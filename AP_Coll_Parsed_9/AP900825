the rotary clubs launched a project friday to 
encourage members to help clean up the earth a sure sign that even 
the sensible middle has gone green a federal official said 
these people are not environmental radicals said richard j 
smith a special negotiator on environmental affairs for the state 
department after addressing about 350 members of the evanston 
illbased rotary international 
these are a very solid center group who are tremendously 
influential and are beginning to think carefully about the 
environment he said 
rotary international claims some 11 million members in 25000 
rotary clubs worldwide 
the civic group traditionally has confined itself to service 
projects such as the eradication of polio in tackling the 
environment rotary turns itself to what some may consider a more 
political arena 
but the groups world president paulo costa said the demand 
for an improved environment is too urgent to ignore 
the rush for development has pushed our ecosystem to the 
breaking point the brazilian told the group we have to change 
our habits 
people at the conference planned workshops to develop specific 
strategies for improving the environment through their clubs costa 
urged members to begin by educating themselves of the problems in 
their own backyards 
education is the true real key said costa who said the 
threat to the rain forest in his nation first prompted him to 
consider the new rotary project 
i see rotary as an umbrella organization a clearing house of 
information he said 
rotary members were encouraged to start environmental resource 
centers address ecology issues in their own communities and use 
environmentally sound practices in their everyday lives 
they were also issued a list of 101 ways you can help 
preserve planet earth among the tips sweep rather than hose 
down sidewalks clean air conditioner filters monthly and fix 
broken things rather than junking them 
you represent the sensible middle and thats what we have to 
engage if the jobs to be done smith told the group

turned a quiet queens neighborhood into a wild kingdom since they 
were stolen from a local business and turned loose three weeks ago 
its like vacationing in a faraway land said constance 
quinn you look out the window and theres a monkey hanging on 
the wash line or swinging in the trees 
the monkey business began when the animals were swiped from 
south america unlimited which imports the primates and sells them 
to research laboratories the thieves apparent plans to peddle the 
monkeys to pet stores fell through and they released them police 
said 
ever since its been monkeys in the middle of everything they 
pop up in back yards dangle from telephone wires lead local kids 
on wild chimp chases one found a new home in mrs quinns garage 
i walked out there and the monkey was just sitting on the 
car mrs quinn said of her monday monkey meeting then it 
started flying all over it was just hysterical 
her encounter with the monkey has made mrs quinn somewhat of a 
celebrity in addition to calls from reporters she made an 
appearance friday morning on a radio station 
what part of queens do you live in the amazon section the 
host asked her 
actually the glendale section which along with neighboring 
ridgewood is where the visitors are hanging out the monkey in mrs 
quinns place escaped despite the best efforts of a policeman and 
an aspca worker since then two of the small brownish beasts have 
been recovered 
one was put to sleep because of the potential health risk the 
other is safe and sound in an undisclosed location said kathi 
travers director of the aspca animal port at kennedy international 
airport 
the cute little critters are as dangerous as they are adorable 
travers warned they will bite if confronted and they can carry 
dozens of dangerous diseases including potentially fatal hepatitis 
b 
but after spending their time in cages since leaving south 
america the beasts are now busy living it up during their summer 
in the urban jungle 
were worried but these monkeys are having a party said 
travers 
foodwise theyve discovered a smorgasbord plenty of greenery 
trees and flowers to munch on along with the occasional spider or 
other insect one homeowner already reported losing his backyard 
grape harvest to the ravenous critters 
but the good times will soon end travers warned the monkeys 
thrive in the heat but a new york winter would mean their demise 
forget it theyd have no shot she said 
they are cute and adorable but they dont belong in the trees 
of new york said travers they belong in the trees of south

the telephone calls from worried relatives 
and friends of us military personnel in the persian gulf start 
streaming into pat enningas kitchen about 530 am 
people are just crying said enninga an organizer of a 
burgeoning support group known as socm support our countrys 
military 
in less than two weeks socms three main organizers have 
comforted thousands of callers from around the country and spawned 
several twin cities chapters and a letterwriting campaign to 
american soldiers 
the activity has been an outlet for people at a loss for 
companionship and information since operation desert shield 
disrupted their lives it also has rekindled some patriotism 
although the group insists it is not political 
all we are trying to project is love said enninga whose 
21yearold son shayne hawkins is with the armys 82nd airborne 
division as long as they are there and they have to be there we 
want to support them and look out for each other 
yvonne minor another socm organizer said the group would 
like to send american flags to the families of active duty soldiers 
who request one 
morale is important to us said minor whose 20yearold 
son shane shipped out aug 6 about two weeks after he was 
married i wanted patriotism back in this country i didnt want 
it like korea or the vietnam war 
minor 45 of savage said she isnt alone many socm 
callers are volunteering to write letters to soldiers whom they 
dont know and a magazine publisher is considering shipping unused 
magazines to the troops minor said she declined to identify the 
publisher 
kids are sending little postcards and pictures of ninja 
turtles she said 
but the groups primary mission has been to console families who 
have been left with very little information about their loved ones 
overseas 
a lot of what were doing is talking enninga said weve 
got people calling from texas new jersey south dakota ohio 
california we just try to get together and cry on each others 
shoulders or hold each other up 
she said the biggest fears surround the possible use of chemical 
weapons by iraq but many callers have unique troubles 
enninga remembered a call from a young woman with 2yearold 
twins who planned to marry an american soldier a week before he was 
summoned to the persian gulf 
all of a sudden hes gone and she doesnt know where he is 
said enninga 40 of brooklyn center she sounded so young shes 
just totally devastated 
socm makes frequent use of the red cross and officers in 
each branch of the military to answer questions many of which have 
to do with mailing enninga said a meeting monday in the twin 
cities also will feature a chaplain and a veteran of the war in 
vietnam she said 
enninga and minor helped start socm after the idea of a 
support group was aired on twin cities television by betty walters 
52 of crystal walters has a son and grandson in active military 
units and most of her family lives in south dakota 
enninga said she has heard of similar support groups at us 
military bases 
attendance at the first two socm meetings totaled about 
100 but the group doesnt yet have membership scrolls and has not 
logged the number of calls it has received minor estimates she 
handles about 100 calls a day but enninga says she has no idea how 
many calls she has received 
the calls begin about 530 am and last until about 10 pm 
she said 
if youre done with a call you dont even bother to hang 
up enninga said you just press the button once on the 
receiver and take the next call

it started out as just another hot lazy 
summer and workers at the quaker oats plant figured the gatorade 
they were making was for weekend warriors on tennis courts and 
softball diamonds 
now that its quenching the thirst of fulltime soldiers in the 
middle east work doesnt seem so dull anymore 
thousands of gallons of the drink produced at the newport plant 
are bound for the persian gulf and more is on the way 
this started about two weeks ago when we received a rush order 
for two truck loads of 12ounce gatorade plant manager bill 
wolford said friday 
through some overtime effort the plant got the order of about 
500000 quart bottles completed in time for delivery to camp 
lejeune nc and an airlift to the middle east 
since then the plant has delivered about 23000 cases of the 
beverage to charleston sc where it was loaded onto container 
ships headed to saudi arabia 
the plant currently is working on another order of 20000 cases 
of liquid gatorade for the military and its anticipating 
potentially larger orders for the drink in powdered form 
in newport a town of 8000 theres a sense of mission at the 
600employee quaker oats plant 
the folks here at the plant are very much aware of where this 
product is going and we are keeping them abreast wolford said 
we have several employees in the plant that have children in 
the armed service and also in the reserves general supervisor 
thom pasinger said 
its a small town so everybody knows where the shipments are 
going the guys in the warehouse are proud weve got a lot of 
veterans said warehouse manager mel wadlinger said 
gatorade was developed for athletes in the 1960s to prevent 
dehydration and heat illnesses it didnt get its first taste of 
military action until recently in panama 
the militarys demand isnt expected to cause any less of the 
product for the domestic market said peter vitulli president of 
quakers grocery specialities division at corporate headquarters 
in chicago

a crack in an old bell is nothing compared 
with new maintenance problems at independence national historical 
park which may start closing buildings as early as october because 
of budget cuts 
in fact the oncetroublesome nowrevered crack in the liberty 
bell is one of the few sights that may remain open to the public if 
the park is forced to get by on the funds they now expect 
we have literally reached the point where we cant maintain 
the park bernie goodman the parks acting superintendent said 
friday 
independence hall is developing a leaky roof original wood is 
rotting and everything from light poles to brick and flagstone 
walkways are in disrepair 
signs at the far end of the threeblock mall north of 
independence mall near downtown philadelphia warn danger uneven 
walking surface enter at your own risk 
sand has been thrown over some of the brick surface rippled by 
roots from trees that shaded what used to be a popular picnic area 
plastic bags cover light poles once topped by globes none of the 
11 fountains works 
park officials said there are two problems insufficient funds 
to make regular repairs and not enough to pay the staff needed to 
keep buildings open 
officials said they need about 85 million in the budget year 
beginning oct 1 to maintain what they did this year for 79 
million which included some temporary building closings but they 
expect to be about 483000 short 
in addition park officials say they need a bigger chunk of 
money from a maintenance fund for parks in the region only 60000 
of the requested 175000 for reroofing independence hall came 
from the fund this year so only a fourth of the job was done 
pieces of metal have been shoved under some of the red cedar 
shingles to keep out water until workers can do more 
money shortages could cause the closing of all but independence 
hall the liberty bell pavilion and the visitor center in october 
goodman said 
potential targets congress hall where george washington was 
inaugurated for a second term old city hall former home of the 
supreme court and franklin court where steel ghost structures 
outline the site of benjamin franklins home and print shop 
goodman said those buildings attract about 13 million people a 
year 
the situation has goodman and visitor services director kathy 
dilonardo showing off the weak points of a park theyd rather boast 
about on friday their guests included rep robert borski dpa 
its a very strange position to be in because we all have a 
great deal of pride and keep a great deal of pride in how well we 
operated the park in the past goodman said 
borski and five other philadelphiaarea congressmen this week 
appealed for help for the park in a letter to the regional director 
of the interior department james w coleman jr whose office is a 
short walk from independence hall 
like other national historic parks across the country the 
philadelphia park is federally funded via the national parks 
service which is part of the interior department 
borski said he expects congress to respond when the problems are 
publicized 
the whole congress was here just a few years ago to celebrate 
the bicentennial of the constitution borski said all 
americans as well as all congressmen will want to see this place 
maintained properly

riyadh saudia arabia ap the biggest us military operation 
since the vietnam war is run out of a cramped room in a downtown 
office building by a gregarious general called in from south 
carolina 
just what you thought for the commanding general right lt 
gen charles a horner said with a laugh as he pointed around 
quarters about 12by20 feet 
the sound of the moslem call to prayer which is piped into the 
modern building reverberates through the room 
horner 53 head of us central command air forces at shaw air 
force base in sumter sc is a downhome fellow whose life has 
been running at fastforward since he was tapped to oversee 
operation desert shield 
horner hasnt ventured into the field yet but hes hoping that 
will change soon when gen norman schwazkopf arrives to assume the 
helm schwazkopf is head of the central command which is 
responsible for us forces from pakistan to kenya and is 
headquartered at macdill air force base in tampa fla 
in desert boots and regulation camouflage work pants and shirt 
horner a beefy davenport iowa native is indistinguishable from 
his troops except for his authoritative tone the three stars 
pinned to his chest and a 3 watch with arabic numerals 
a gift from a mujahedeen explains horner referring to the 
fierce anticommunist rebels in afghanistan 
horner arrived even before president bush announced aug 8 that 
us forces would be deployed in saudi arabia he accompanied 
defense secretary dick cheney to plot the defense of the oilrich 
nation with king fahd four days after iraq invaded neighboring 
kuwait aug 2 
when cheney returned to the united states horner stayed behind 
to start the wheels in motion for the arrival of more than 40000 
troops and 500000 tons of materiel 
secretary cheney looked at me and said good luck chuck 
horner recalled in an interview i swallowed hard 
since then its been adrenelinecharged 15to18 hour days as 
the decorated fighter pilot manages the most important assignment 
of his career 
his command post is in the capital about 200 miles from dhahran 
the gulf city where most of the us troops and materiel are 
arriving 
logistics and dealing with saudi officials are major 
components of the job desert shield is a cooperative venture with 
the saudis the forces operate essentially as a joint command 
us military and diplomatic officials say the movement of 
weapons personnel and equipment has gone off without major 
glitches 
with more than 4500 hours of flying time including 41 combat 
missions over north vietnam horner is itching to get into the 
cockpit of an f15 i love to fly he said 
horner has known and worked with the americantrained top saudi 
air force generals for years he finds the saudis bright 
energetic hardworking and different 
the toughest thing is you have to accommodate to their 
customs he said 
they dont like to say no and would rather postpone a 
decision than risk a confrontation he says 
youre charging and trying to get things done while the 
saudis have a more indirect manner he said 
hes a gruff takecharge kind of guy who is not taken to 
flowery speech said a pentagon spokesman he is not a timid 
politician 
the hours are also a switch saudis take time off during the 
heat of the day and often work until 1 am with vital issues 
raised late in the evening 
despite the challenges horner said even generals get a little 
homesick he misses his family horners daughter is entering 
college and she wrote him several letters telling of her anxiety 
about the choice of which sorority to pledge 
horner concludes an interview when his driver col samir turki 
whom horner calls sammy summons him for a meeting 
tell the people we are in good hands turki says

world leaders gather this weekend to discuss 
ways to counter hate but the conference organizer nobel peace 
laureate elie wiesel wishes he had called the seminar earlier 
i wonder if the conference had been held six months ago if it 
could have done something to avoid the problems we see now 
wiesel said friday referring specifically to the persian gulf 
crisis and unrest in south africa 
the romanianborn author and human rights activist said the 
seminar the anatomy of hate which begins sunday in oslo is 
expected to draw about 70 delegates from 30 countries 
south african antiapartheid activist nelson mandela 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel french president francois 
mitterrand and former president jimmy carter are scheduled to be 
key speakers during the fourday meeting 
wiesel and the norwegian nobel peace prize committee sent out a 
call last fall to statesmen nobel laureates activists and 
thinkers to meet in this small scandinavian city to discuss the 
problem of hate 
at the time wiesel a nazi death camp survivor said he feared 
that new freedoms won by east bloc nations would cause smoldering 
religious ethnic and regional hatred to flare he chose oslo as 
the conference site because it is the home of the peace prize 
which he won in 1986 
now in europe the problem is hatred now in the middle east 
the problem is hatred there is no issue so timely as the issue 
of hate said the 61yearold boston university professor 
keynote speakers including mandela and havel will open 
discussions on racism and regional hatred in europe the middle 
east and africa in a search of ways to resolve conflicts through 
dialogue and democracy 
the moment the iraq crisis exploded i expected people to 
cancel but to our pleasure very few have said wiesel a us 
citizen 
and when i read of the killings in south africa i thought he 
mandela was not coming but he is coming anyway and that is a 
good sign wiesel said 
hundreds of blacks have been killed in fighting between rival 
factions in south african townships recently the violence prompted 
the government friday to impose a state of emergency in black 
townships outside johannesburg giving police widespread powers to 
detain people and take action to stop the violence 
one of those taking part in the hate conference is chai ling a 
leader of last years prodemocracy movement in beijing 
she was greeted with a standing ovation by norwegian students 
she addressed friday ling spoke of the violent june 4 1989 
military crackdown on the chinese students and said tanks can 
crush student movements but cannot crush love or respect between 
people 
we still dont know what the meeting will do wiesel 
admitted a joint declaration may be issued possibly suggesting 
ways to counter hatred 
planners considered bringing together enemies in bitter 
conflicts such as irish catholics and protestants but wiesel said 
the idea was rejected this is not a forum for those who hate

americans traveling in europe this summer find the 
purchasing power of the already weak us dollar sapped even 
further by the crisis in the persian gulf 
from london to athens the dollar buys far less than it did a 
year ago oncecheap destinations bargain basements no longer are 
raising eyebrows and flattening pocketbooks 
we sat in a sidewalk cafe yesterday and were shocked a small 
beer cost 8 said christopher kirk 42 of seattle who was 
visiting paris everybodys been asking us for 5 for a coffee 
and roll for breakfast 
poring over brochures at the champselysees tourist office kirk 
and traveling companion janet stanford ruled out a shopping spree 
for designer wear any fashions they take home will come from 
midpriced department stores 
they number among tens of thousands of americans visiting europe 
whose greenbacks have lost about 20 percent in value to benchmark 
european currencies since this time last year 
the gulf situation has pushed the us currency even lower 
a dollar bought 538 francs aug 1 the day before iraq invaded 
kuwait on friday it fetched 521 francs 
things are tough even in greece a haven for budget 
holidaymakers 
mary mandis of fort lee nj couldnt understand why my 
dollars are buying less drachmas at the bank when i thought greece 
was so cheap 
a parisbased financial analyst said the dollar is weak for many 
reasons slowdown in the us economy lower interest rates more 
people interested in euro currencies 
the gulf situation added to the reasons for the slide higher 
oil prices resulting from iraqs takeover of kuwait renewed the 
threat of a us recession pushing the dollar down the analyst 
said 
the deutschmark grew mighty in the last year as investors saw 
west germany as the economic powerhouse of a bigger europe the 
analyst said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the dollar is at a historic low against the mark dropping from 
about 175 marks to 154 in just two months in britain the pound 
is nearing the benchmark 2 level in italy the dollar has plunged 
to its lowest level against the lire since 1981 
just a few years ago footsore yanks saw rome as crowded and 
smoggy but a bargain for a wellcut suit or big meal 
today only the crowds and smog remain 
we learned the first night said missy prowell of huntington 
beach calif traveling with her husband court 
we had a very nice dinner in a restaurant but we had to pay 
190000 italian lire about 190 mrs prowell said that was 
outrageous now we share dishes and split desserts 
americans are also staying out of the clothing shops 
id love to buy shoes sighed lydia lavin from olean ny 
but i content myself with looking at them 
the potential oil shortage has boosted gasoline prices in europe 
as well as the united states touring english country lanes costs 
58 cents more per liter of gasoline more than it did a month ago 
we rented a car and i thought gas prices were going up at 
home said richard ralston i filled up a small ford for 46 
expatriate workers feel the pinch of the currency exchange rate 
and so do those who depend on their salaries paid in dollars 
like harry spittler who hawks cuckoo clocks and nutcrackers to 
an almost exclusively american clientele of gis and tourists from 
his gift shop in kaiserslauten west germany 
we are very much affected by this our business has gone down 
almost 20 percent in the past month spittler said 
many germans havent realized the benefits they accrue from 
the gis over here but now theyre starting to see 
its hard to tell if fewer americans are visiting europe most 
tourist ministries dont analyze statistics until september 
but hartmut emmich of the reisedienst der wirtschaft travel 
office in frankfurt feels that the low dollar hasnt changed travel 
plans for many americans 
they booked these trips months ago they have a set price when 
they are booked and there havent been many cancellations emmich 
said but it will certainly affect bookings for next year

after threatening the driver and a passenger the men doused the 
truck in gasoline and set it afire killing 219 animals

prices but agriculture minister henri nallet said thursday that

lt gov martha griffiths who served in 
congress 20 years and was a force behind passage of the equal 
rights amendment was dropped friday from the 1990 gubernatorial 
ticket by gov james blanchard 
blanchard praised griffiths as the premier stateswoman and 
a wonderful friend but said he asked her to step aside because 
he no longer considers her ready to assume the governors post at a 
moments notice 
ive always tried to do whats right for the people of 
michigan blanchard told a news conference he did not give a 
reason for his decision and said a search was on for a new running 
mate for the fall campaign against john engler the republican 
senate majority leader 
griffiths was giving a speech in ann arbor at the university of 
michigan and was unavailable for comment her office said 
griffiths 78 ran with blanchard in his successful campaigns of 
1982 and 1986 amid speculation she would not run again griffiths 
surprised her boss on may 10 when she said she was ready for a 
third term 
as recently as aug 7 blanchard told reporters its been a 
great team a successful team id hate to break it up 
griffiths served in the michigan house from 1949 to 1952 two 
years later she entered congress from michigans 17th district and 
she held the seat until her resignation in 1975 
her shining moment came when she got the 218 signatures from 
house members needed to pull the equal rights amendment out of 
committee and onto the floor clearing the way for its eventual 
approval in 1972 
the amendment eventually fell three states short of the 38 
needed to ratify it in order to add it to the us constitution 
a spokesman for englers campaign said the appearance that 
blanchard had dumped her off the ticket was potentially damaging 
democrats would probably have a stronger ticket if martha 
griffiths booted jim blanchard off instead of the other way 
around said the spokesman john truscott 
blanchard declined to speculate on the political fallout of the 
move 
if the decision that i have made were only based on how to win 
the election there would be no question of who i would choose to 
share the ticket lieutenant governor martha griffiths he said 
in a prepared statement 
the governor said he met with griffiths last week to discuss the 
matter and advised her of his decision before he made the 
announcement 
the governor credited griffiths with helping him win his first 
gubernatorial campaign in 1982 and said the decision to remove her 
from the ticket was one of the most personally trying and 
difficult decisions i have ever had to make 
griffiths became michigans first elected lieutenant governor 
when she helped blanchard beat republican richard headlee 
a native of pierce city mo griffiths graduated from the 
university of missouri and the university of michigan law school

the city threatened to prosecute a man because 
his house failed to meet buildingcode regulations after being 
damaged last month by an explosion at a chemical plant 
the july 19 explosion at a basf corp plant rocked george 
heards house across the street said harvey wilbekin the citys 
director of buildings and inspection of 271 buildings that were 
inspected only heards house was condemned wilbekin said 
his department recently sent heard a letter saying that if he 
failed to bring the house up to minimum standards under 
buildingcode regulations he risked prosecution for a firstdegree 
misdemeanor that carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail 
and a 1000 fine 
its the grossest kind of insensitivity it is the worst 
aspect of bureaucratic response heards lawyer david altman 
said friday it is not at all appropriate for a government to 
respond like this to a citizen who suffered from a disaster that 
was not his fault 
they treated mr heard like a guy who let his house go to 
disrepair rather than a guy whose house was destroyed by an 
explosion altman said 
wilbekin apologized after learning about the letter 
the reason it was done was to alert the owner that he had a 
serious condition wilbekin said we do not intend to be 
following up with any prosecution we admit that it was not handled 
as delicately as it should have been 
investigators said the explosion which killed two people 
occurred when a cloud of cleaning vapor solvent ignited at a 
reactor in which chemicals are mixed and heated the plant remains 
closed 
in a lawsuit filed against basf earlier this week in hamilton 
county common pleas court altman demanded that all residents whose 
houses were damaged be reimbursed for all repair and temporary 
relocation expenses 
the company declined immediate comment on the lawsuit 
spokesman charles coe said basf has received about 1500 
reimbursement claims and has settled about half of them but did 
not reveal how much has been paid out

president bush is recommending a 35 
percent pay raise on jan 1 for federal employees 
that is only a small fraction of the 22 percent to 40 percent 
increases that bushs pay advisers recommended to keep pace with 
salaries in the private sector 
but in a letter friday to leaders of congress sent from his 
vacation home bush said pay raises of this magnitude are 
clearly unacceptable 
bushs plan would boost the top salaries among senior government 
executives to 108300 
the lowestpaid job on the civil service pay rung would pay 
10951 a year the highest salary on grade 18 of the civil service 
scale would be 96756 
members of the presidents senior executive service would get 
salaries ranging from 87000 to 108300 
the pay scale for the foreign service would range up to 79675 
the white house also released a separate scale for health 
officials in the department of veterans affairs with a top scale 
of 104085 for the deputy chief medical director

opec is reeling from the sharp blow 
delivered by the persian gulf crisis which has badly crippled the 
cartels ability to exert control over oil pricing and production 
for the moment its an irrelevant organization said bryan 
jacoboski a vice president at paine webber brokerage in new york 
everything occurring in the oil markets is outside of opecs 
influence 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries was thrown 
into one of its worst crises when the unthinkable happened one of 
its members invaded and annexed another in a dispute over oil land 
and money 
years of effort to polish the groups image as a reliable 
business organization appear to have ended in failure 
at this point the organization has very little credibility 
said peter bogin associate director for oil markets at cambridge 
energy research associates in paris the future of the crisis 
will determine the future of opec 
since iraq seized kuwait on aug 2 opec has chosen despite 
pleas from saudi arabia and venezuela not to hold an emergency 
meeting to discuss the turbulent situation in the oil markets 
at least seven of the 13 member nations have agreed to talk 
informally in vienna on sunday but saudi arabias influential oil 
minister hisham nazer may not show up iraq and kuwait also were 
expected to stay away 
without going into a formal session there is little the 
ministers can do to try to calm the jittery markets 
crude prices lifted by fears of military escalation in the gulf 
and cutbacks in oil supplies have spiraled above 30 a barrel a 
level untouched since the mid1980s 
opec is not really a feature in the fundamentals of this 
price move said peter gignoux director of the international 
energy department at shearson lehman hutton in london 
last month the cartel agreed to restrain production at 225 
million barrels a day in the last half of the year in an effort to 
drive prices up to a new target of 21 a barrel the benchmark was 
reached and exceeded almost immediately 
an international embargo on iraqi and kuwaiti oil has meant a 
loss of about 4 million barrels of crude a day to the world markets 
saudi arabia which holds about a quarter of the worlds oil 
reserves has said it intends to increase crude pumping by as much 
as 2 million barrels a day with or without opecs blessing 
but analysts say the kingdom would like the cartels nod to go 
over its newly set supply quota of 54 million barrels a day 
it would be better for saudi arabia and the organization as a 
whole to have it done under the umbrella of opec rather than as a 
unilateral action said bahman karbassioun an oil consultant in 
vienna no one likes unilateral action 
some see the organization divided into two camps those who 
want much higher prices and those who dont theres a terrific 
battle between the opec hawks and doves said gignoux 
iran considered a hawk on prices has said there is enough oil 
in storage in the industrialized world to make up for the loss of 
iraqi and kuwaiti crude 
some of the smaller members with less capacity to produce oil 
also may be delighted by the surge in prices bringing a windfall 
to their governments coffers 
saudi arabia venezuela kuwait and the united arab emirates 
have been considered among the price doves or moderates who worry 
about the effects of sharp price swings on the world economy 
despite the cartels hesitation to act over the iraqi invasion 
analysts say it would be foolish to write its obituary 
calling opec dead is a little bit premature said bogin 
theyve come back from a lot 
the cartel has weathered other crises in just the past decade 
the 1979 revolution in iran a major oilproducing nation was 
marked by a sharp drop in crude production world oil prices 
soared almost hitting the 40 mark and sending the world economy 
into a tailspin 
in the mid1980s a production freeforall sent oil prices 
crashing and the organization was near collapse 
throughout most of the 1980s iran and iraq were at war which 
ended in a ceasefire two years ago 
referring to the present crisis bogin said that if the iraqi 
leadership is replaced by a more moderate one friendly to the west 
opec again can play a role in the oil world 
but if iraqi president saddam husseins military might prevails 
in the highstakes contest he said opec will be spelled 
iraq

the newest report on corporate americas 
performance gives further evidence of an overall weak economy 
analysts say 
the assessment came friday after the commerce department 
reported that corporate profits in the second quarter of this year 
dropped 02 percent from a year ago the quarter began in april and 
ended in june 
the decline is the first since a 59 percent drop in aftertax 
profits in 1989s third quarter julyseptember the commerce 
department reported 
profits rose 17 percent in the final quarter of 1989 followed 
by a 05 percent increase in the first quarter of this year 
the government also reported friday that the gross national 
product for the second quarter expanded at a lackluster rate of 
just 12 percent 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said the profit 
picture is likely to worsen in coming months especially if the 
country enters a recession 
while profits normally drop between 15 percent and 20 percent in 
the typical recession sinai said he was looking for only about a 5 
percent drop in profits next year because he expects that any 
downturn will be a mild one 
even analysts who are not yet forecasting a recession are 
looking for corporate profits to remain soft in coming quarters 
although oil companies are likely to have bigger profits in 
the second half of the year because of higher oil prices that will 
be offset by a weaker showing in other sectors said bruce 
steinberg an economist at merrill lynch 
aftertax profits totaled 1667 billion at an annual rate in 
the second quarter the decline from the first quarter reflected in 
part weak earnings in the transportation and public utilities 
sectors 
among the details of the profits report 
beforetax profits which totaled 2976 billion at an annual 
rate in the second quarter were up a slight 02 percent from the 
first quarter beforetax profits had risen 24 percent in the 
first quarter 
corporate profits after adjusting for depreciation and 
inventories climbed 33 percent in the second quarter to an annual 
level of 3065 billion they had been up 2 percent in the first 
quarter 
corporate cash flows a measurement intended to show the funds 
corporations have for investment rose 23 percent in the second 
quarter to an annual rate of 4023 billion after falling 07 
percent in the first quarter 
dividend payments to stockholders increased 21 percent to an 
annual rate of 133 billion in the second quarter after increasing 
2 percent in the first quarter

lawyers for four performance artists who 
were denied federal grants say they will take the national 
endowment for the arts to court for making what they call a 
political decision that violates the first amendment 
the lawyers from the center for constitutional rights said a 
federal court case is the only option because the nea on friday 
rejected an appeal of its decision in june to turn down the grant 
applications 
as in its initial denial letters the nea gives no substantive 
reasons for the denials the nonprofit center said in a 
statement from its new york headquarters 
the four performers in question are karen finley and holly 
hughes of new york and tim miller and john fleck of los angeles 
their solo stage acts consist of songs and monologues on such 
themes as sexual oppression politics and racism the acts 
sometimes include explicit sexual content 
nea critics had cited the four as examples of the endowments 
willingness to subsidize works that might be considered obscene 
the performers applications for federal grants were approved 
last spring by an nea peer review panel but nea chairman john 
e frohnmayer vetoed them on june 29 with the concurrence of the 
26member national council on the arts the endowments 
presidentially appointed advisory body 
at a fundraising party in washington for local artists 
organizations ms hughes and miller said they were disappointed 
but not surprised by frohnmayers decision to deny the four grants 
which ms hughes said totaled about 23000 
i think its really clear that frohnmayer is going ahead with 
the idea of presenting us as sacrificial lambs to congress so he 
can ask for more money for the nea to perpetuate safe dead 
artists ms hughes said 
now its a matter for the courts and the constitutional 
lawyers miller said fleck could not be reached for comment 
in response to repeated telephone calls an nea spokeswoman said 
she could not confirm the report and had no comment frohnmayer was 
vacationing and could not be reached by telephone 
although frohnmayer gave no reasons for rejecting the artists 
applications or their appeals he warned a meeting of arts 
professionals in seattle in june that political realities made 
it likely he would have to veto some grants recommended by nea 
panels of artists 
two days later he rejected the grant requests by the four 
performance artists each had received nea grants in the past 
frohnmayer apparently was referring to growing criticism from 
religious fundamentalists and conservative members of congress led 
by sen jesse helms rnc they have complained that the arts 
endowment uses taxpayer dollars to subsidize obscene and 
sacrilegious works 
last october at helms urging congress amended the neas 
current 171 million budget to prohibit use of federal funds for 
any works that may be deemed obscene including depictions of 
homoeroticism sadomasochism sexual exploitation of children and 
individuals engaged in sex acts 
although frohnmayer has said repeatedly that he opposes the 
helms statute as unnecessary he is requiring all nea grant 
recipients to sign a pledge that they will not use federal funds to 
produce obscene art 
the pledge has provoked widespread protests in the arts 
community and the advisory council voted overwhelmingly in early 
august to recommend that frohnmayer eliminate the requirement 
the nea chairman said recently he will keep the antiobscenity 
pledge until a federal judge in new york rules possibly within a 
month on a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional

operation push says it will keep urging a 
black boycott of nike after a threehour meeting with executives of 
the sports shoe company produced no promise of a comprehensive 
affirmative action program 
the meeting friday was congenial amiable push founder 
jesse jackson said afterward but he said nike executives showed no 
willingness to yield to the black selfhelp groups demands for 
more minority representation in the company 
nike officials and georgetown university basketball coach john 
thompson who has an endorsement contract with nike said progress 
had been made in the talks but they declined to predict how the 
conflict will be resolved 
obviously were encouraged said nike president richard k 
donahue if this meeting had taken place first there never would 
have been a boycott 
chicagobased push says nike uses black athletes to advertise 
its expensive shoes among black youths yet has no minorities on its 
board of directors and does not advertise in blackowned media 
outlets 
nike released an affirmative action hiring plan last week in 
response to the boycott promising to appoint a black to its board 
within 24 months 
but after fridays meeting jackson suggested he was 
dissatisfied with that offer as well 
john thompson is eminently qualified to be on that board 
immediately jackson said 
the two sides agreed friday to provide each other basic 
information about their organizations and jackson said that nike 
seemed obsessed with learning whether push has any contractual 
agreements with reebok nike has accused push of conspiring with 
reebok a chief nike competitor 
jackson denied any connection between push and nikes rival 
the civil rights leader also complained that nike had failed to 
provide details on the exact job duties of the minorities who make 
up 14 percent of its 3000member work force 
we suspect that the majority of them are on the bottom 
jackson said 
push which has launched successful boycotts against a 
halfdozen other corporations has been urging consumers to stop 
buying nike products or to cover the nike emblem on the goods they 
already own 
tyrone crider president of push said he will travel to 
different cities in the next week in hopes of expanding the boycott 
jackson and the nike officials said they would not set a date 
for future meetings until each side has assessed information 
provided by the other 
i expect it would be a week or 10 days before that 
happens donahue said

b52s will be decisive in any fighting with iraq military 
analysts say 
the americans technological superiority give its pilots a 
critical edge over iraqs warseasoned veterans they say 
the united states backed by britain has built up an awesome 
strike capability in the weeks since the iraqi army invaded kuwait 
on aug 2 
as of friday the americans and their allies had an estimated 
700 combat aircraft in the region the iraqi air force has about 
500 planes 
air power alone cannot win wars but the strength of us and 
british air forces in the gulf and their electronic and 
technological capability is enough to be extremely effective in 
any conflict said don kerr of londons international institute 
for strategic studies 
allied air power can give the iraqis a very hard time in the 
air as well as against strategic targets and iraqs tank 
formations he said in an interview 
but more significantly they can carry out longrange 
penetration inside iraq to hit lines of communication and supply 
beyond kuwait he said 
the iraqis fought iran for eight years and most of their pilots 
known as eagle warriors have combat experience 
but for most of the 198088 war they were up against a 
seriously depleted iranian air force weakened more by shortages of 
spare parts than combat losses 
they became adept at blasting attacking iranian ground forces 
and mounting longrange raids on iranian oil terminals in the 
southern gulf 
dogfights were rare so they have little experience with 
airtoair combat 
they also never had to contend with the kind of operations the 
americans and british can carry out and theyre not very 
experienced in electronic warfare kerr said theyll have a 
lot of difficulties 
strategic bombing offensives against iranian industry were never 
sustained long enough to do lasting damage 
most of iraqs pilots are not considered high quality by western 
analysts but they have a core of top guns flying sovietmade 
mig29s and some frenchmade mirage f1s the best jets in saddams 
arsenal 
superiority in the air is vital because the united states is 
outnumbered and outgunned on the ground 
the iraqis have an estimated 200000 troops and 1000 tanks in 
kuwait they have another 3500 tanks in iraq 
the americans have about 40000 men with light armored vehicles 
in place backed by arab forces these include saudi arabias 450 
battle tanks 
some analysts deem allied air power augmented by the armys 
antitank missiles and tankkilling apache ah64 helicopters 
sufficient to counter an iraqi thrust south from occupied kuwait 
but they believe the united states wont be able to mount a 
major offensive until it has built up its heavy armor 
us units and tanks are en route to saudi arabia but it could 
take weeks before the americans have marshalled enough armor to 
have a lethal punch 
in the gulf region the us aircraft carriers independence and 
saratoga have a combined air strength of more than 100 fighter 
planes 
the uss dwight d eisenhower in the eastern mediterranean has 
more than 50 aircraft capable of hitting iraq from the west 
two more carrier battle groups led by the uss john f kennedy 
and the uss midway are heading for the middle east with 100 more 
fighters 
britains royal air force has 12 tornado f3 fighterbombers in 
saudi arabia and a squadron of jaguar groundattack jets in oman 
backing them is the saudi air forces nearly 200 combat 
aircraft with another 150 from other gulf states 
kuwaiti pilots got most of their 36 fighters to saudi arabia 
before the iraqis overran the emirate 
us f16s deployed in the gulf area are considered more than 
a match for iraqs mirages and mig29s 
most of iraqs air force is composed of older sovietbuilt 
fighter planes 
moscow is reported to have recently supplied baghdad with 
longrange su24 fighterbombers which could pose a threat but 
analysts believe the us and british pilots can handle the planes

defense secretary dick cheney says his 
decision to cut in half the number of planned purchases of a new 
generation helicopter for the army will save close to 8 billion 
over the long run 
the army will buy 1292 of the attack and reconnaissance 
helicopters which are still on the drawing board instead of the 
previously planned 2096 cheney said friday the yearly rate of 
production will be 120 instead of 216 
the change will cut the programs total cost to 342 billion 
from the originally projected 42 billion the army said but it 
will increase the cost of each helicopter produced because the 
research and development costs will be spread among fewer aircraft 
the army said each helicopter is expected to cost 89 million 
up from the previous estimate of 75 million 
cheney said the demonstration phase of the program will be 
extended by two years to allow for full testing of a prototype 
two corporate teams are competing for the production contract 
one is comprised of mcdonnell douglas helicopter co of mesa 
ariz and bell helicopter textron of fort worth texas the other 
is boeing helicopters of philadelphia and sikorsky aircraft co of 
stratford conn 
a mcdonnell douglas spokesman said the company views cheneys 
announcement to build a prototype as a positive step in the 
development of the helicopter 
it is an endorsement that the lh light helicopter concept is 
the best solution for the armys next generation of reconnaissance 
armed helicopters said spokesman ken jensen we have suggested 
that the prototype would be the next logical step 
a single contracting team for fullscale development of the 
helicopter is to be chosen next february 
i am convinced that the light helicopter is essential to our 
longterm strategy of meeting worldwide requirements with a 
smaller lighter army force structure cheney said in a prepared 
statement after a department review of the program 
the new helicopter is designed to perform reconnaissance at 
night in adverse weather conditions at high altitudes and in hot 
climates the pentagon said 
the bush administrations budget request for the 1991 fiscal 
year that begins oct 1 includes 465 million for research 
development testing and evaluation of the newgeneration 
helicopter but congress is expected to approved a smaller total

communist china has turned iraqs invasion of 
kuwait into a badly needed public relations coup by helping 
stranded ethnic chinese from hong kong and taiwan flee the middle 
east 
beijing has done beautifully read an editorial by ming pao 
an independent hong kong daily that often criticizes beijing 
without much effort it saved a group of fellow chinese and won 
the approval of taiwanese and overseas chinese 
so far china has helped 159 ethnic chinese from taiwan and hong 
kong leave kuwait and iraq following baghdads aug 2 invasion of 
its oilrich neighbor 
taiwanese had difficulty returning home because their government 
doesnt have diplomatic relations with kuwait or iraq which both 
recognize china hong kong residents had problems because they 
carry hong kongbritish passports which made them british citizens 
in the eyes of the invading iraqis 
iraq has refused to allow most of the estimated 21000 
westerners leave iraq and kuwait including about 3000 americans 
china apparently easily persuaded iraq to free its 
compatriots as beijings official xinhua news agency refers to 
ethnic chinese at least until the invasion china has been one of 
iraqs top arms suppliers and has maintained close economic and 
military ties with baghdad 
the episode is ironic because beijing has technically been at 
war with nationalist taiwan since 1949 when chinese communist 
troops forced the nationalists from mainland china 
and few people in hong kong have any love for the communist 
government especially since june 4 1989 when china crushed a 
studentled movement for freedom in beijing in which hundreds 
perhaps thousands died 
more than 1000 people emigrate from the british colony each 
week having lost faith in chinas promise to maintain the 
freewheeling economic and social system for 50 years after 1997 
when beijing resumes control of the territory 
in hong kong the episode gave china badly needed good press in 
taiwan prestigious political analyst chiou hungta warned of a 
potential danger of people losing confidence in the nationalist 
government if china continues to successfully employ such tactics 
to win the hearts of taiwanese 
one western diplomat said chinas quick response to requests for 
help in the gulf was aimed at convincing the people of taiwan and 
hong kong they ultimately must recognize beijing as their capital 
chinas two main foreign policy questions in the 1990s will be 
its upcoming takeover of jittery hong kong and its hopes to 
reunite with taiwan beijing has yet to abandon its threat to 
attack taiwan in order to force unification 
the chinese are saying when the chips are down youve got 
to admit that beijing is the boss the diplomat said on 
condition of anonymity 
in beijing a foreign ministry spokesman offered an explanation 
to illustrate chinese thinking on the issue the people on the 
two sides of the taiwan straits are all chinese naturally we 
should offer assistance within our capacity to our taiwanese 
compatriots who have run into difficulties in other countries 
the type of assistance china provided also won it praise the 
chinese embassy issued taiwanese travel permits and not passports 
avoiding the sticky question of forcing the taiwanese to accept 
chinese citizenship 
the episode in the gulf highlights what many chinese 
intellectuals call the crisis of chinese identity 
we all consider ourselves chinese but the crisis comes when we 
have to choose a government to represent us said joseph ys 
cheng a leading educator in hong kong 
for thousands of years chinese have considered themselves 
united as a people not because they shared a capital but because 
they shared a common culture rooted in a common written language 
the events in the gulf rang a bell with almost all chinese 
intellectuals cheng said 
we realize that we cant just be culturally chinese he 
said we must also belong to a political group for many of us 
the time for choosing is now and the choices are few

madison avenue hypesters have seldom been shy 
about waving the flag to boost sales but commercialmakers have so 
far stayed away from ads tied to the us military effort in the 
saudi desert 
advertising experts say they dont expect many will try at 
least as long as there is a chance the persian gulf could explode 
into war 
companies tend to jump on things that they know have no 
enormous downside things like the wall coming down in berlin 
said jack trout a marketing consultant 
the persian gulf has a big downside trout said the region 
could erupt into allout war exposing any effort to draw a 
connection with the troops as crass commercialization 
short of that he said a campaign tied to the gulf could 
antagonize americans who are opposed to us involvement there 
marketers want to deal with 100 percent trout said they 
dont want to be associated with an event that still has a negative 
potential with a piece of their marketplace 
dave hudgens a spokesman for chevrolet said the automaker has 
no plans to run commercials tied to the gulf that is too 
volatile a situation to try and capitalize on it in a commercial 
way he said 
burger king corp and cocacola co each said they had no plans 
for gulfrelated ads 
stephen a greyser professor of consumer marketing at the 
harvard business school recalled that in the aftermath of the 
soviet unions invasion of afghanistan in the late 1970s some 
vodka makers developed marketing campaigns that exploited 
antisoviet sentiment to lure drinkers away from russian vodka 
during world war i he said us vendors of sauerkraut began 
calling their product liberty cabbage to avoid any possible 
connection with the german enemy 
but greyser said there are no products sold here that are so 
clearly associated with iraq to inspire any similar 
countermarketing efforts iraqi troops invaded kuwait on aug 2 
but what about companies that may be providing products american 
troops are using to do their jobs 
quaker oats co for instance supplies the drink gatorade to 
military bases and it announced thursday that it had stepped up 
its efforts to supply the us armed forces for use in the desert 
in saudi arabia 
spokesman ronald bottrell said the company had shipped more than 
20000 cases of the drink for use by troops in saudi arabia and had 
orders for 100000 more cases 
but aside from announcing the order bottrell said the 
chicagobased company had no plans to tout it in advertising our 
feeling this week was not to hype this he said 
so why put out in a news release to the media 
bottrell said he issued it only after receiving about a dozen 
calls from reporters who were writing stories about supplying the 
troops 
we felt we wanted to get on the record he said 
harvards greyser said the public would accept advertising that 
makes a connection between a product and the persian gulf crisis if 
there was a legitimate connection between the products 
performance its use in a desert setting and its use in civilian 
life

magellan engineers tried to recover 
today from an emotional rollercoaster ride after the unruly 
spaceship gave them great pictures of venus and moments of terror 
and of great happiness 
weve got to get the team rested magellan project manager 
tony spear told a news conference friday at nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory 
magellan was launched from the shuttle atlantis on may 4 1989 
it started orbiting venus aug 10 on a 744 million radarmapping 
mission to make the best pictures and maps yet of the cloudcovered 
planet 
the spacecraft returned its first pictures of venus last week 
new pictures released friday including a spectacular 
threedimensional image show a 20milewide meteorite impact 
crater with a floor covered by lava flows 
science and mission planning manager tommy thompson said 
engineers and scientists felt a little strung out after the 
spacecraft malfunctioned and lost contact with earth twice first 
for 14 hours starting aug 16 then for 17 hairraising hours 
beginning tuesday night 
its kind of like having a date for the prom stubbing your 
toe the night before getting up the next morning and stubbing a 
toe on the other foot thompson said 
while magellan mission control is staffed around the clock many 
other team members were resting this weekend he said 
until engineers identify and fix the problem that cut the radio 
link i think its likely to happen again spear said earlier 
friday 
if contact is lost again engineers are ready with new computer 
commands to kick start magellans automatic safety systems and 
make the spacecraft reestablish contact with earth immediately 
spear said 
my heart cant stand this 17hour loss of signal again he 
said there are moments of terror and of great happiness after we 
recovered the signal 
the emotional wearandtear showed a bit friday as national 
aeronautics and space administration officials contradicted each 
other on one possible explanation for the communication problems 
during the news conference spacecraft system engineer john 
slonski said the braking rocket magellan used to slow down and go 
into orbit around venus might have failed to separate fully or 
might have burned some cables as it was jettisoned 
its a possibility were investigating that the solid rocket 
motor really hasnt gone away that its still hanging on and 
bumping into magellan slonski said 
spear called that possibility remote and contrary to available 
evidence but also said it was conceivable the rocket yanked out 
some cables on magellan as it separated from the spacecraft 
two hours later the laboratorys public relations office issued 
a statement saying there was currently no doubt the separation 
was complete spokesmen refused to elaborate when asked to 
explain the contradiction between that statement and those made by 
slonski 
even if the rocket had not completely separated it wouldnt 
prevent magellan from conducting its mission spear said the 
official mapping effort is likely to start no earlier than 
midseptember two weeks later than planned he said 
engineers also were considering the possibility the 
communications failures were caused by problems with magellans 
computer hardware or programs or the unlikely chance magellan is 
being affected by previously unknown electrical fields around venus 
one of the biggest joys was that magellans first pictures of 
venus made during an aug 16 radar test lived up to nasas 
promise of being 10 times more detailed than the best obtained from 
radar on earth or from the soviet venera 15 and 16 spacecraft in 
the mid1980s 
the meteorite impact crater shown in pictures released friday 
has a very smooth floor and a central peak the smooth floor 
indicates the crater was flooded by volcanic lava either during or 
sometime after the impact said steve saunders magellans chief 
scientist 
he said the crater is relatively young geologically 100 million 
to 150 million years old it is named after soviet sculptor anna 
golubkina who lived from 1864 to 1927 
other pictures from magellan showed intense venusquake 
faulting lava flows and a network of intersecting ridges and 
valleys

police face a shortage of both 
manpower and credibility as they confront black factional fighting 
in the townships ringing johannesburg that has claimed more than 
500 lives 
in many instances only a handful of police have been present to 
prevent battles between hundreds of angry zulus and xhosas warring 
since aug 12 
also many township residents view the police as an enemy rather 
than a protector they accuse police of bias and even active 
participation in the bloodletting 
we have evidence that there are elements in the police force 
that seem to be interested in the violence spreading said pallo 
jordan a spokesman for the african national congress the 
countrys leading black opposition movement 
police emphatically deny the charges and many neutral observers 
believe the police have been far more restrained than in recent 
years a fouryear national state of emergency lifted in june had 
given police extensive powers and officers routinely used force to 
break up even peaceful demonstrations 
the suggestion that police either disarm or tear gas certain 
sectors of the community in order to facilitate inkatha attacks 
is unfounded said law and order minister adriaan vlok 
the government acknowledges it needs more police and is adding 
10000 policeman to the 70000strong national force responsible 
for a vast country with a population of 30 million people 
some accusations of police bias appear based on anger that 
police wont let the two sides fight it out other blacks point 
fingers because officers wont side with them against their 
opponents 
policemen are often the most visible symbol of white authority 
in black townships and there is inevitably suspicion of their 
actions 
many township residents say police favor zulus tied to the 
conservative inkatha political movement in their township battles 
against mostly xhosas who back the anc 
in kagiso a hardhit township west of johannesburg residents 
said police simply stood watch at night as zulus attacked homes 
with stones gasoline bombs and guns then took money televisions 
and radios from the unarmed residents 
the police do nothing to stop the zulus said one kagiso 
resident who gave his name only as joe we call the police but 
they do not respond 
associated press reporters saw several uniformed black municipal 
police officers fighting alongside the zulus in kagiso other zulus 
said the officers were zulus living in hostels and were defending 
themselves 
municipal police work for particular townships and are distinct 
from the national police who have borne the brunt of the fighting 
but regular police in kagiso reacted swiftly on several 
occasions thursday to intervene between zulus living in a migrant 
workers hostel and township residents who said they wanted to 
destroy the hostel 
police fired tear gas at both sides to prevent clashes between 
heavily armed gangs when residents could not reach the hostel 
they threw gasoline bombs and stones at police police responded 
with more tear gas several residents were hurt and others were 
arrested

iraqi soldiers sealed off the us and at 
least eight other embassies in kuwait on friday and baghdad 
threatened to forcibly remove any diplomats whose governments 
defied orders to close their missions 
us ambassador nathaniel howell and a skeleton staff of about 
10 remained at the palmfringed us compound near the persian gulf 
coast 
richard boucher a state department spokesman said howell and 
his staff would stay keeping in touch with the 2500 americans 
trapped in kuwait as much as circumstances allow they were 
keeping telephone conversations short because iraqis were listening 
in boucher said in washington 
in amman jordan a spanish diplomat said baghdad had threatened 
to use force to remove diplomats remaining at their posts in kuwait 
city on saturday 
electricity and water were cut to the british and greek 
embassies officials in those countries said west germanys 
foreign ministry said the iraqis had warned embassies they would 
take such action if they do not close 
in london a foreign office spokesman said later that iraqi 
tanks had moved into position to back up troops outside the british 
embassy in kuwait where ambassador michaely weston and three staff 
members remained 
the ambassador and his staff are in good heart and the last 
time we heard from them they were drinking champagne by 
candlelight said the spokesman who cannot be identified under 
briefing rules 
the spokesman said the embassy staff had stocked up food 
supplies in case the iraqis tried to starve them out 
britains foreign secretary douglas hurd said his embassys 
staff would decide for themselves how to oppose any iraqi move on 
the mission 
i dont expect no one expects unarmed diplomats to give 
physical resistance to physical force he said 
about a dozen iraqi soldiers surrounded the canadian embassy in 
kuwait preventing individuals from entering or leaving the mission 
in gaspe quebec prime minister brian mulroney said iraq is 
well on the way to becoming a pariah nation 
more than 100 us embassy personnel and dependents including 
the marine guards left the us embassy in kuwait on thursday and 
were staying in the us embassy in baghdad said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater said the iraqis had promised earlier to allow the 
group to leave iraq then reneged he said iraqi forces of one 
kind or another were surrounding the us embassy in kuwait but 
have not made any moves against the embassy or intruded in any 
fashion 
it would appear that people are not being allowed to enter or 
leave the embassy fitzwater said in kennebunkport maine 
iraqi troops were also surrounding or patrolling near the 
french japanese norwegian swedish romanian and hungarian 
embassies 
the official iraqi news agency said iraq would only detain the 
male embassy employees including diplomats of those countries 
that refused to close their embassies in kuwait but there was no 
indication that dependents including the us women and children 
who had traveled to baghdad were being allowed to leave 
ina quoted an unidentified official spokesman in baghdad as 
saying iraq is determined to implement its decision to shut 
down the embassies in kuwait 
president saddam hussein of iraq who seized kuwait in a 
lightning assault on aug 2 and later annexed it had given foreign 
governments until 9 pm friday to vacate their embassies in kuwait 
spains ambassador to jordan ramon armengod told a news 
conference in jordan on friday that iraqi authorities later told 
the embassies in kuwait that they had until 830 am saturday to 
close 
he quoted iraqi authorities as saying that once the saturday 
deadline passed troops would proceed with the forced 
evacuation of diplomats 
the deadline passed with no immediate report of action by iraqi 
troops 
baghdad has said that keeping the embassies open would amount to 
an act of aggression and that diplomats remaining in kuwait 
would no longer be considered protected by diplomatic immunity 
the united states canada japan bangladesh switzerland 
austria poland czechoslovakia yugoslavia egypt and the 12 
european community nations were among those countries who declared 
they would defy the order 
they have evacuated most of their staff and dependents leaving 
behind only skeleton staffs 
egypt has refused to close its embassy or reduce its staff of 
20 and its foreign ministry announced friday that it would hold 
iraq responsible for any harm to its mission in cairo four 
truckloads of riot police remained outside the iraqi embassy where 
they have been stationed since the invasion of kuwait 
the united states and other countries said their embassies have 
a right to remain in kuwait because they do not recognize iraqs 
annexation of the oilrich emirate and need to provide assistance 
to citizens trapped there 
about 3000 americans and 4500 britons are among the roughly 
21000 westerners trapped in iraq and kuwait 
among the countries complying with the iraqi order to close 
their embassies were lebanon jordan and the philippines 
the soviet union malaysia and india evacuated all of their 
embassy personnel from kuwait but said they did not consider their 
missions closed 
saudi arabia refused to close its embassy but its legation in 
kuwait has been locked since the invasion and the saudi ambassador 
is back in his country 
about 60 countries have embassies in kuwait

superantidotes that could neutralize chemical weapons drug 
overdoses and most poisons 
the metal ions act as catalysts that can convert poisons to 
harmless substances inside the human body said stephen j

it could be used as a detoxifying agent for people who have 
taken a drug overdose and can be used against environmental 
pollutants benkovic said in an interview when the us military 
learned of the early laboratory success it asked for a briefing 
about applications in chemical warfare he said 
the metalloantibodies can be made by altering the amino acid 
sequence of protein to make it easier to bind with a metal said 
sheila a iverson working on the project at the research institute 
of scripps clinic at la jolla calif 
antibodies occur naturally in the body and are integral 
components of the human immune system they attack invading 
bacteria and viruses using metal ions could broaden their range to 
combat strong toxins the human body cannot fight 
through different modifications antidotes could one day be 
developed for any poison making metalloantibodies a logical 
defense against chemical warfare said david lenz an army 
pharmacologist at the aberdeen proving ground in maryland 
it can be used not so much to demoralize the enemy but to 
reduce the threat of him using chemical weapons at all lenz 
said they wont use them if theyre not going to work 
development of antibodies for humans is years away but recent 
laboratory successes are promising he said 
by having a metal ion embedded in the protein it can now 
catalyze many diverse chemical reactions said benkovic whose 
work with richard lerner of the research institute was published in 
the aug 10 issue of science magazine 
a metalloantibody could be developed to treat cocaine overdoses 
benkovic said 
the antibody can convert poisons by acting as a catalyst he 
said it changes the first toxin it sees then keeps on going 
until theres no toxin left the antibody can be engineered to bind 
toxins or chemically change them 
with zinc or copper attached the new antibody could be injected 
into a person even before exposure chemical poisons rendered 
harmless would be excreted 
in research conducted between april and june benkovic and 
lerner experimented on genetic material exposed to fluorescein 
which emits a known amount of energy 
after altering the genetic materials antibodies with a copper 
ion they exposed the new product to fluorescein energy changes in 
the original foreign substance took place 
when metal binds to fluorescein it should change the energy 
level ms iverson said so researchers knew the metal ion had 
been successfully added to the antibody 
to make the process work on animals or humans scientists must 
explore the structure of other antibodies and determine what what 
chemical alterations are needed to make the metal attach to them 
if successful antidotes could one day be massproduced 
benkovic said 
we have shown that you can bind a metal ion to an antibody 
benkovic said its a start

a sizzling abortion debate in both 
east and west germany threatens to hold up a treaty that would 
merge the laws of the two states 
the newly adopted oct 3 unity date is not endangered but 
failure of the treaty would leave a number of legal issues to be 
settled by an allgerman parliament allgerman elections are not 
set until dec 2 
the opposition social democrats have threatened to torpedo the 
treaty following a government decision that west german women who 
after unity try to take advantage of east germanys permissive 
abortion law can be prosecuted 
the social democrats have insisted west german law should only 
apply to west german turf 
party chief hansjochen vogel said chancellor helmut kohls 
government cannot force a special regulation that discriminates 
against women 
kohl needs a twothirds majority for the treaty to pass 
parliament and thus needs the backing of the social democrats west 
germanys secondbiggest party 
the treaty covers a grab bag of issues including distribution 
of sales tax revenues among the german states how to settle claims 
by west germans on property they once owned in east germany and 
abortion rights 
for weeks womens rights groups politicians and government 
officials in both germanys have feuded over the best abortion law 
for a united germany 
in west germany abortions are allowed only if there is 
lifethreatening risk to the mother if the pregnancy resulted from 
rape or incest or if the birth would create extraordinary social 
and economic hardship for her 
east german women on the other hand have a fundamental legal 
right to an abortion as long as it occurs within the first 12 
weeks of pregnancy 
east germany with a population of about 16 million last year 
recorded 73000 abortions the figure was 75297 in west germany 
which has a population abour four times greater than its eastern 
neighbor 
the two germanys have agreed to keep their respective abortion 
laws until a single set of statutes can be worked out which could 
take years 
there is strong pressure from east german women to not scrap 
their nations abortion law 
many conservative west germans insist their law is the correct 
one 
the roman catholic church and the lutheran church added their 
powerful voices to the debate friday 
in a joint statement the two churches criticized east germanys 
abortion statute saying it fails to stress that every death of a 
human being stands in contradiction to the foundations for a humane 
system of laws 
the statement was authored by bishop martin kruse head of the 
german lutheran church and his roman catholic counterpart bishop 
karl lehmann 
kohl however is feeling pressure from within his coalition to 
be more liberal on the abortion issue 
leaders of the free democrats kohls junior coalition partners 
reluctantly agreed that west german women who go to east germany 
for abortions after unity should face prosecution 
but many party members now say that decision was a mistake and 
they wont support it in a parliamentary vote 
a weekend meeting is planned to try to resolve the dispute

the peace corps usually conjures up images of 
idealistic american youth aiding the poor in distant lands in a 
new twist a former peace corps volunteer has started a program for 
foreigners to work at soup kitchens and homeless shelters in 
americas inner cities 
the first two peace corpsinreverse volunteers arrived in 
boston this summer from ghana and czechoslovakia ghana was the 
first country to receive american volunteers and the latter one of 
the latest 
the two already have worked in soup kitchens and an innercity 
day camp planted gardens at a homeless shelter and aided the 
elderly both said the poverty they encountered surprised them 
i knew there possibly would be some problems but not to this 
extent said charles hutchinson 29 a biology teacher taught by 
peace corps volunteers as a teenager in southern ghana 
more than 130000 volunteers and staff have served in the peace 
corps in 95 countries since john f kennedy founded the overseas 
development agency in march 1961 in his first major initiative as 
president 
hutchinson and ester boszormenyiova 24 of czechoslovakia 
spoke outside the john f kennedy library about the twomonth pilot 
program funded by 6000 in private donations 
i think everybody who comes to the united states they think 
this is a very rich country a kind of hollywood life 
boszormenyiova said 
boszormenyiova said she has few illusions about the darker side 
of capitalism she was particularly disturbed by the problems of 
american youth 
hutchinson said learning about urban poverty here will serve him 
well when he returns home many of our countries in africa are 
going through very fast development in terms of urbanization he 
said 
tracy mathieu a former peace corps volunteer started up the 
pilot program and hopes to extend it next year so that 100 
volunteers two for every state can come to the united states 
for the summer 
were getting a lot of interest in it said mathieu who 
once supervised a water sanitation project in west africa its 
really taking off 
supporters include sen john kerry dmass economist john 
kenneth galbraith and citizens energy corp president michael 
kennedy a nephew of the late president 
a reverse peace corps project was first proposed in 1961 by 
former ghanaian prime minister kwame nkrumah 
for two years between 1966 and 1968 overseas peace corps 
volunteers came to the united states and worked in vista the 
volunteers in service to america progam for improving the living 
conditions of impoverished americans 
but the program was never approved by congress mathieu said 
both of this years volunteers who plan to attend school in the 
united states when the program ends said they are inspired by 
kennedys call to american youth ask not what your country can 
do for you ask what you can do for your country 
boszormenyiova said kennedys words hold significance for 
czechoslovak youth who want to foster democracy in the midst of 
eastern europes political upheavals 
it was something i really started thinking about she said 
i feel that i must give something to my country im proud of 
czechoslovakia as john kennedy was proud of america people in 
czechoslovakia are waking up

the united nations sanctioned the use of force to back up a un 
economic embargo of iraq early saturday while sadam hussein made 
diplomats his latest target ringing foreign missions in kuwait 
with iraqi troops 
on friday the soviet union announced it was ending its 
objections to the us initiative clearing the way for passage of 
the resolution 
that move came after soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
warned saddam hussein the persian gulf situation was extremely 
dangerous and suggested in an urgent message his country might 
now support a military blockade of iraq 
in baghdad saddam detained a group of us embassy dependents 
and staff who had been promised safe passage from his capital he 
said they would not be released until kuwaits us embassy was 
vacated 
britain said tanks surrounded its embassy and the water and 
power were cut it later reported on saturday that the tanks were 
withdrawn and electricity restored 
the middle east conflict on friday came home to hundreds of us 
military reservists called up in the first such summons since 
vietnam 
iraqs parliament speaker sadi mehdi saleh warned the same day 
the presence of us forces in the gulf might ignite a war that 
would set the region and its oil reserves afire and kill thousands 
of americans 
at the united nations the 15member security council voted for 
a us initiative that puts teeth into un sanctions against iraq 
the resolution by the 15member council passed with 13 votes in 
favor and 2 abstentions it calls on nations with naval forces in 
the persian gulf region to use such measures commensurate to the 
specific circumstances as may be necessary under the authority of 
the security council to halt all inward and outward maritime 
yemen and cuba abstained from the vote 
at least nine embassies in kuwait including the us and 
british missions were guarded by troops friday as diplomats 
defied an iraqi order to close their doors with its aug 2

iraq now considers kuwait to be iraqi territory 
a european envoy said baghdad threatened to use force to remove 
diplomats remaining at their posts on saturday the iraqis also 
threatened to cut water and power to the missions and the foreign 
office in london said they did just that on friday at the british 
embassy 
like other embassies staying open the us mission had a 
skeleton staff of about 10 more than 100 us embassy staff and 
dependents including about 30 children left kuwait only to find 
new trouble in baghdad where they were detained 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday the iraqis 
had promised earlier to allow the group of americans to leave but 
then reneged they are safe he said but stuck 
the official iraqi news agency said later that iraq would only 
detain the male embassy employees including diplomats of those 
countries that refused to close their embassies in occupied kuwait 
but there was no indication the dependents were being allowed to 
leave 
the foreign ministry in rome said three italian diplomats who 
left kuwait thursday were kept from leaving baghdad on friday and 
that the reason cited was that italys embassy in kuwait had defied 
orders to close 
besides the diplomats about 21000 westerners including 3000 
americans were caught in iraq and iraqioccupied kuwait by the 
invasion and president bush said they must be considered hostages 
getting out of iraq was becoming harder even for people from 
countries not considered hostile toward baghdad 
jordan however still let refugees cross over from iraq despite 
wednesdays announcement that the border would be closed to them 
jordan said coping with thousands of refugees had become too much 
of a burden the european community and others moved to help with 
money and supplies 
turkey another escape route for refugees said it might close 
its border with iraq unless countries whose nationals are coming 
through take steps to ensure quick transport elsewhere 
in his message gorbachev had urged iraq to comply immediately 
with un security council resolutions 
the soviet ambassador to the un valentin v lozinskiy later 
announced in new york that moscow was ending its resistance to 
backing the unordered embargo with military muscle he also 
indicated the soviets would be willing to join an international 
force to police the embargo 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said that 
the soviets had pulled all staff from their kuwait embassy but 
insisted they had not formally closed it the soviets long an 
ally of iraq immediately cut off weapons supplies to baghdad

iraqi authorities warned the western diplomats that troops would 
forcibly remove them from their missions starting saturday 
also the japanese foreign ministry said iraqi soldiers told the 
two japanese diplomats remaining in kuwait friday that their 
diplomatic immunity had been revoked but made no attempt to remove

video stores have been besieged with requests 
for cassettes of three men and a baby amid speculation that the 
ghost of a child lurks in a scene in the disney film 
everybody whos walked into the store today wants this 
movie said operations manager ryan bicknell of music plus in the 
los angeles suburb of marina del rey all the stores copies of the 
1987 comedy about three bachelors who rear a baby were rented out 
friday morning he said

viewers have been transfixed by an eerie figure in a scene in 
which actor ted danson and celeste holm costarring as dansons 
mother walk by a window in a home shared by danson and his 
buddies played by tom selleck and steve guttenberg 
partially obscured in the window is the figure of what looks to 
many to be a young boy seemingly hiding behind a curtain 
i was never a firm believer in ghosts or anything but ill 
tell you the truth it made the hair stand up on my arms jon 
roup of network video in pittsburgh said friday 
callers from milwaukee pittsburgh los angeles utah and 
vancouver canada have inquired at disneys video division about 
the scene for weeks said buena vista home video spokesman steve 
feldstein popular los angeles radio station klos reported on the 
controversy friday setting off a rush for the video in this city 
feldstein said some viewers believe the figure is the ghost of a 
child who either died or committed suicide in a house where the 
film was shot 
but he said the mysterious figure is actually a cardboard cutout 
or standee of a man in top hat and tails it was part of the set 
dressing in the film that was made on a sound stage in toronto he 
said not in anybodys house 
its a prop he said of the standee a promotional device 
for a role played by danson 
some bought disneys explanation 
it doesnt look like a ghost said sales rep aaron chu of 
movies and more in west los angeles theres no third dimension 
to the figure he said adding that it appeared to be the 
likeness of a young man 
yet many people believe something supernatural is going on 
after all three men was directed by leonard nimoy the former 
host of in search of a television show tracking strange 
phenomena 
i put standups up all the time in here and it isnt big 
enough said tony hostler of best video rentals in pittsburgh 
you cant make out the kids face and on a real standup they 
make sure you can but you can make out the body real clear 
i believe its just some kind of freak of nature or 
something he said 
roup said he and other employees at network video examined the 
footage carefully on a video machine with crystalclear freeze 
frame 
if you look at it its way too small to be ted danson and it 
doesnt have any feet or anything he said

a federal grand jury issued indictments 
against five state legislators accused of accepting bribes in 
exchange for their support for a bill legalizing betting on horses 
and greyhounds 
a 16month fbi sting operation led to the indictments issued on 
friday prosecutors said they expect a federal grand jury to issue 
more anticorruption charges against other state lawmakers over the 
next few months 
this investigation is continuing us attorney bart daniel 
said at a news conference 
state reps robert kohn luther taylor robert brown danny 
winstead and state sen rick lee were indicted under the hobbs act 
a federal law banning acceptance of money or gifts in return for 
votes or favors winstead also was indicted on a second charge of 
obstruction of justice 
the indictments simply put allege that each of these public 
officials sold their votes for cash daniel said 
conviction under the hobbs act carries a maximum penalty of 20 
years in prison and a 250000 fine taylor indicted on six 
counts faces a maximum sentence of 120 years in prison and a 15 
million fine if convicted 
winstead faces a total of 30 years in prison and a 500000 fine

a judges rejection of provisions in 
pennsylvanias restrictive abortion law provides a chance for the 
supreme court to review its 1973 decision in roe vs wade that 
legalized abortion both sides in the case said 
senior us district judge daniel h huyett struck down 
provisions in the 1982 state law saying much of it was just a 
repeat of provisions previously ruled unconstitutional the state 
said it would appeal to the 3rd us circuit court of appeals and 
if necessary to the supreme court 
if the supreme court is looking to overturn roe v wade 
this case provides an opportunity to do that said linda wharton 
of the womens law project an attorney for the plaintiffs in the 
case 
everything is happening the way we thought it would happen 
said republican rep stephen freind the leading antiabortion 
voice in the legislature no doubt we are going to win in the 
supreme court 
in 1986 the supreme court declared unconstitutional much of 
pennsylvanias abortion control act the legislature amended the 
act in 1988 and 1989 but huyett called the new law nothing more 
than a reenactment of the old one 
in his 191page ruling huyett said womens rights are being 
subjected to the vicissitudes of the legislative process 
the us territory of guam had banned all abortions except where 
the mothers life is threatened a federal judge on thursday ruled 
that law unconstitutional 
the guam ruling is the only other potential challenge to roe vs 
wade in the pipeline wharton said 
planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania and five 
abortion providers challenged the amendments the judges ruling 
stops the state from enforcing them 
safe legal abortion continues to be accessible to women in 
pennsyvlania because of the courts decision today said 
elizabeth hrendaroberts executive director of planned parenthood 
pennsylvania affiliates 
pennsylvanians would be wellserved if the commonwealth 
accepts this decision and stops squandering taxpayers money to 
promote government interference in personal matters and threaten 
womens lives she said 
an appeal could be heard sometime next year and could reach the 
supreme court in 1992 wharton said 
robert gentzel spokesman for attorney general ernie preate jr 
said fridays ruling was disappointing but not unexpected 
huyett ruled against pennsylvanias requirements that a woman 
notify her husband before getting an abortion wait 24 hours before 
getting an abortion and that minors obtain the consent of at least 
one parent or a court order before an abortion 
the judge upheld a provision allowing the state to collect data 
from doctors and clinics on abortions performed as long as it was 
kept confidential he also upheld a section requiring a test to 
determine the age of the fetus

officials denied that the army which landed wednesday on nearby 
kayts island had bogged down in its latest offensive against the 
tigers but they acknowledged their attempts to break the tiger 
siege had slowed 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity claimed at 
least 170 tigers have died since the offensive began wednesday to 
crush the rebels in their jaffna peninsula stronghold troops also 
hoped to rescue a government garrison under siege for more than two 
months in jaffna fort 
the causeway leads from kayts island to mandativu island and on 
to the 17th century starshaped fort 4 miles away 
most of the rebels were killed by helicopter gunships strafing 
boats and jungle roads they said 
they claimed only four soldiers have been killed and 16 wounded 
in the 4dayold offensive 
government troops landed wednesday on kayts island the 
following day deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne chief 
architect of the war effort predicted they would reach the fort in 
two or three days 
the tigers in statements issued in london and geneva claim to 
have killed a large number of government troops they denied 
the government had inflicted heavy losses charging instead that 
300 civilians died in government aerial bombing and strafing and 
troops gunfire 
no independent reports of the situation in jaffna peninsula 
home to 850000 people have emerged communications with the 
peninsula 185 miles northeast of colombo were severed after june 
11 
on that date the tigers broke a 13month ceasefire and 
attacked government police stations and army camps the combatants 
use radios to communicate with colleagues outside the peninsula 
the government claims 5000 people have died in the past 10 
weeks in northern and eastern sri lanka bringing to 14000 the 
death toll since the tamil insurrection began in 1983 
the tamil tigers are fighting for a separatist homeland for 
their ethnic minority which has long accused the sinhalese 
majority of discrimination in jobs and education 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
they predominate in the north while the east is about equally 
divided among sinhalese tamils and moslems 
fighting has tapered off in the east where the government is 
concentrated in the towns and the tigers have retreated to the 
jungles 
sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the population have 
controlled the government and military since the indian ocean 
island became independent from britain in 1949

irishman brian keenan who 
spent most of his life in strifetorn belfast dismissed the 
dangers of beirut when he went there to teach english in 1986 
theres a war there theres a war here at home and life has 
to go on his sisters remember him saying 
for four months keenan taught at the american university in 
beirut writing home about the beauty of lebanon and the fine 
cuisine and nightlife in beirut 
on april 11 1986 he rushed out of his apartment late for an 8 
am lecture and was abducted by gunmen 
no group had claimed responsibility for kidnapping keenan but a 
previously unknown group called the organization of the islamic 
dawn announced he would be freed friday 
american educator frank reed who was freed on april 30 said he 
spent almost three years with keenan and british journalist john 
mccarthy either in the same room or the same house and had seen 
them two days before his release for at least part of the time 
they were blindfolded and chained to radiators 
keenan and mccarthy who became like blood brothers 
exercising daily and reading voraciously reed said 
they kept each others spirits high and keenan had used his 
irish gift for storytelling to relate anecdotes lasting more than 
an hour reed said 
the organization of the islamic dawn is believed part of 
hezbollah or party of god a shiite fundamentalist umbrella 
organization whose factions hold most of the 13 western captives in 
lebanon 
keenans sisters brenda gillham and elaine spence said their 
brothers mistake was to forget his irish passport when he left his 
apartment they believe his kidnappers thought he was american or 
british rather than a citizen of a small neutral country 
although born in northern ireland which is part of britain 
keenan decided about 15 years ago to adopt irish citizenship his 
sisters said 
any northern irelander is entitled to dual irish and british 
citizenship but keenans choice was unusual since he is 
protestant and most protestants identify with britain rather than 
the overwhelmingly roman catholic irish republic 
even though keenan only has an irish passport he has never 
renounced british citizenship so both britain and ireland had 
worked for his release 
keenan was dubbed britains forgotten hostage because his 
plight did not receive the same publicity as that of anglican 
church envoy terry waite and mccarthy 
after two years of campaigning for his release mrs gillham 
said the trouble is nobody seems to want to know we have not 
had much help we wrote to some mps members of parliament but 
only one replied 
keenan never joined a political party but his sisters said he 
believes fervently in the nonviolent unification of ireland 
with great affection mrs gillham and mrs spence describe 
their bachelor brother as somewhat eccentric a scruffy 
impulsive artistic man who gets around belfast on an old bicycle 
loves poetry irish culture conversation and his dog which is 
with his mother minnie in east belfast the dogs name is saiorse 
the irish word for freedom 
when keenan was born on sept 20 1950 northern ireland was 
still relatively conflictfree but by the time he graduated from 
orangefield boys secondary school near his home in mainly 
protestant east belfast in 1970 the province was in the throes of 
sectarian rioting the british army had arrived and the irish 
republican army was being resurrected 
keenan graduated from the new university of ulster at coleraine 
near londonderry in 1974 with a bachelors degree in english and 
spent the following year in san sebastian spain working as an 
english tutor 
in 1975 he returned to his old school orangefield and spent 
two years teaching english and coaching rugby from 1977 to 1984 
as sectarian and political strife continued belfast city council 
employed him as a community worker dealing with protestants and 
catholics young and old 
he tried to build communication on both sides mrs gillham 
said he loved his country 
he also pursued his graduate studies receiving a postgraduate 
certificate in community studies from aberdeen university in 1978 
a masters degree from the new university at coleraine in 
angloirish literature in 1984 and a doctorate in english 
literature from the new universitys magee college in 1985 
later that year he left for beirut

the lead vocalist of the british rock band 
judas priest says the heavy metal group is ready to get back to 
work after being cleared by a judge from liability in the death of 
two young fans 
our immediate reaction is obviously one of great relief rob 
halford said friday its a great day for judas priest 
in a telephone interview from from puerto vallarta mexico 
halford said he and his fellow band members simply just want to 
get on with what we do playing rock n roll and heavy metal 
music 
earlier friday washoe district judge jerry carr whitehead ruled 
that subliminal messages exist on the bands 1978 stained class 
album but they were not intentional and did not cause the two 
youths to form a suicide pact as their families charged in a 
lawsuit 
he said the words do it on the song better by you better 
than me were a chance combination of sounds 
raymond belknap 18 died from a single blast from a shotgun 
held in his mouth two days before christmas 1985 james vance then 
20 blew away the lower portion of his face the same day but lived 
until november 1988 
the families of the two victims sued the band and cbs records 
claiming messages hidden in judas priests song touted satanism and 
promoted suicide they had sought 62 million in damages 
ken mckenna a lawyer for belknaps family predicted the 
judges finding of subliminal content will open the way for similar 
lawsuits 
this finding although not a victory certainly gives hope to 
attorneys pursing similar cases in the future he said 
defense lawyer suellen fulstone agreed saying she was pleased 
with the result but adding the judge is certainly more open to 
the possibility of subliminal communication than i think the 
scientific evidence warrants i dont think this will be the end of 
cases alleging such effects 
the defense maintained during the fourweek trial that what 
sounded like do it was actually halford exhaling combined with 
the sound of guitars 
the judge agreed reluctantly saying that a listener probably 
would not have perceived such phrases in the record without the 
power of suggestion 
in a small victory for the plaintiffs whitehead ordered 
codefendant cbs records to pay 40000 to their he said the 
company refused to find the original multitrack recordings of other 
songs on the stained class album 
he said the defaults were not caused by the courtroom lawyers 
but by inhouse counsel of cbs 
the judge added that even if the master tapes had been found 
the court does not believe that the ultimate outcome of the trial 
would have been any different

the security council today overwhelmingly 
authorized military action to enforce its trade embargo against 
iraq in an unprecedented step meant to force saddam husseins 
troops to pull out of kuwait 
approval came after the soviet union on friday dropped its 
opposition to the usbacked resolution as one of the five 
permanent members of the security council the soviets have veto 
power 
it was the first time in its 45year history that the council 
had authorized such military action to enforce its own sanctions 
a sweeping economic embargo against iraq 
iraqs envoy condemned the council action as illegal and warned 
that acting on it could lead to allout war 
this use of force by the united states or any of its allies or 
puppets will lead inevitably to a number of explosions which will 
burn all in their path said iraqi ambassador abdul amir 
alanbari 
us ambassador thomas r pickering hailed the decision 
iraq has evaded resolutions of the security council and 
thumbed its nose at all humanity he said this has prompted 
the council to take one of the most important decisions in its 
history 
the vote early today was 130 with two abstentions from cuba 
and yemen after informal meetings through the night 
yemens ambassador abdallah saleh alashtal warned that any 
military action backing the sanctions might lead to war while 
cuban ambassador ricardo alarcon said the councils move was in 
defiance of the un charter 
the vote gave security council blessing to a loose military 
arrangement without a un flag or command whereby navies in the 
region could take unspecified steps to enforce the un embargo 
todays resolution calls on countries deploying warships in the 
persian gulf region to use such measures commensurate to the 
specific circumstances as may be necessary under the authority of 
the security council to halt all inward and outward maritime 
shipping in order to implement the embargo 
language calling for minimum force was dropped friday at the 
insistence of the soviet union and other nations but diplomats 
emphasized that the vague language adopted clearly did not exclude 
the use of military might 
it is sufficiently broad as to allow the use of force 
pickering said of the measure 
this is not an act of war he added but an enforcement of 
sanctions which have been flagrantly violated 
the sanctions against iraq were ordered by the united nations on 
aug 6 to punish iraq for invading kuwait on aug 2 and later 
annexing it 
most countries have cut off trade with iraq whose main export 
is oil but but some iraqi ships have gotten around the embargo 
pickering said 
jordan has allowed trucks to transport supplies into neighboring 
iraq from ships that unload at the jordanian port of aqaba it was 
not immediately clear what effect the resolution would have on 
those shipments as they have been difficult to differentiate from 
jordanian imports 
the resolution covers only maritime shipping and not airlifts to 
iraq 
it was the fifth in a series of strong council resolutions since 
iraq invaded kuwait other resolutions have condemned the invasion 
and demanded immediate and unconditional withdrawal imposed 
sweeping economic sanctions against iraq declared the annexation 
of kuwait to be null and void and demanded the immediate release 
of all foreigners held against their will 
there is no precise precedent for such un authorization of 
military action in 1950 in the korean conflict it approved an 
international force under a un flag and a us command 
british ambassador crispin tickell said the latest move was 
the result of mounting evidence of breaches of sanctions on a 
large scale there is a string of tankers carrying iraqi oil from 
iraqi ports going outward 
he said the resolution shows a new spirit and creative 
approach of the international community to deal with an 
unprecedented crisis 
the confirmation of soviet support by ambassador valentin v 
lozinskiy on friday removed the final major hurdle to security 
council approval of the us initiative for about 10 days the 
soviets had balked 
but lozinskiy emphasized that use of any force should be the 
last resort he said political and diplomatic efforts should 
come first in defusing the crisis precipitated by iraqs invasion 
of kuwait 
chinese ambassador li daoyu said his government is also opposed 
in principle to military involvement by big powers and is not in 
favor of using force in the name of the united nations he said 
china had argued to delete the reference to use of force from 
the amended resolution 
on friday soviet president mikhail s gorbachev sent an urgent 
message to saddam that urged him to obey un resolutions or face 
corresponding additional measures 
president bush had said he wanted the security councils 
endorsement of the use of force to halt iraqs shipping but he 
also said the united states already had the right to enforce the 
un trade sanctions against iraq 
the five permanent council members are the united states 
britain china france and the soviet union

a multinational african force sent 
to liberia to end its civil war landed safely in the port city of 
monrovia and met no resistance from government or rebel soldiers a 
news agency reported 
the landing occurred friday night the news agency of nigeria 
said 
the report monitored in abidjan said nigerias naval 
headquarters was in touch with the 3000 troops sent to liberia 
aboard six ships 
earlier friday gunfire in monrovia had kept troops from the 
five west african states from landing delaying their attempt to 
end liberias 8monthold civil war which has killed more than 
5000 people mostly civilians 
charles taylor a leader of one of two liberian rebel groups 
has threatened to fight the multinational task force saying their 
announced intention to stop the fighting is a ploy to keep 
president samuel doe in power 
taylors national patriotic front has about 10000 fighters and 
is stronger than either does forces or those of prince johnson a 
leader of a rebel faction that has grown hostile to the taylors 
group 
the port of monrovia is controlled by johnsons forces who also 
hold most of the capital city 
johnsons forces and troops loyal to doe declared a truce 
monday and said they would welcome the west african intervention 
they also said they were ready to join forces to resist any attacks 
by taylor 
taylor said through his chief spokesman tom woewiyu that the 
soldiers of the task force will be regarded as the enemy and we 
will shoot at them taylors forces control most of the country 
outside the capital 
fighting has raged in monrovia since late june taylor led his 
forces into liberia from ivory coast on dec 24 saying does 
government was corrupt and that he wanted to oust it johnson later 
split with taylor 
west african leaders decided to intervene on aug 6 they said 
the war was no longer an internal conflict because thousands of 
their citizens were trapped in liberia and 400000 liberian 
refugees were burdening neighboring countries 
the task forces chief of staff brig cyril igwueze of nigeria 
said on nigerian state television thursday that the west african 
troops have no desire to shoot their way into monrovia but he also 
warned we are able and willing to defend ourselves if attacked 
troops from ghana nigeria sierra leone gambia and guinea are 
in the force togo said it would send troops but did not 
us forces stationed on a warship off liberias coast have 
evacuated us citizens and residents of other countries trapped by 
the fighting the us marines have also landed in liberia to 
defend the us embassy compound

president kurt waldheim of austria met 
today with iraqi leader saddam hussein on the fate of thousands of 
foreigners held in iraq an austrian diplomat said 
waldheim the first western leader to meet with saddam since 
iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 arrived aboard an iraqi presidential 
plane accompanied by his foreign minister alois mock and other 
austrian officials according to diplomats who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
saddam and other senior iraqi officials greeted waldheim at the 
baghdad airport they said 
an austrian diplomat said waldheim was expected to use his 
friendship with saddam to raise the issue of the 21000 westerners 
including more than 70 austrians and 3000 americans stranded in 
iraq and kuwait 
waldheim became acquainted with arab leaders during his 10 years 
as united nations secretarygeneral he has been shunned by western 
leaders in recent years since it was disclosed that during world 
war ii waldheim served with a german army unit in the balkans 
implicated in atrocities and later misrepresented his war record 
in vienna austrian radio said saddam held an impromptu news 
conference for austrian reporters accompanying waldheim before the 
talks started saddam had not talked with western reporters since 
the crisis began 
the radio quoted saddam as saying that iraqi troops dont plan 
to withdraw from kuwait and confirming that foreigners have been 
brought to strategic points including missile bases and oil 
refineries 
this is not done to protect iraq against the us but to 
protect the foreigners the radio quoted saddam as saying 
the radio quoted saddam as saying the united states had occupied 
saudi arabia and other holy places of islam and the arab world 
condemns this 
he termed the western military action a naked aggression 
the phrase westerners applied to his invasion of kuwait 
the leadership of saudi arabia is corrupt saddam reportedly 
said but he said iraq respects the sovereignty of every arab 
country and would not attack saudi arabia 
the radio quoted saddam as saying iraq also respected the 
sovereignty of kuwait but the corrupt regime there made a 
conspiracy against its motherland 
he said he was happy about the visit of waldheim whom he 
described as an especially fair politician who could mediate 
the austrian president arrived from amman jordan austrias 
ambassador to amman franz pernegger told the associated press 
that waldheim was not accompanied by jordans king hussein 
earlier it was believed that the king also might attend the 
meeting with saddam 
waldheim told reporters friday in amman that he would discuss 
humanitarian issues with saddam

borders which had never really closed and it asked the united 
nations for emergency assistance

several european governments today joined the 
united states in welcoming the united nations security council 
resolution authorizing military enforcement of the economic embargo 
against iraq 
the resolution adopted 130 with cuba and yemen abstaining 
called on all countries deploying maritime forces in the persian 
gulf region to use such measures commensurate with the specific 
circumstances as may be necessary to end commerce with iraq 
the french foreign ministry called the measure a very 
important act which is testimony to the international communitys 
firmness and solidarity and said french forces would apply the 
resolution with the necessary resolve 
though france was coordinating with other countries on the 
placement of forces each force remains under national control 
and master of its mission the foreign ministry said in a 
statement 
britain refused to say immediately what force british vessels 
would use to back up the embargo we will use obviously the 
minimum force necessary william waldegrave the secondranking 
official in britains foreign office told a news conference 
he hailed the passage of the resolution 
it is important that contrary to what some people might have 
expected i think what saddam hussein expected the unity of the 
international community is not fraying it is actually getting more 
close as time goes on waldegrave said 
the white house said today the resolution further strengthens 
the world resolve to force iraq out of kuwait 
greek government spokesman vyron polydoras called the security 
council decision an act of historic significance and a landmark 
in the further course of international relations 
it demonstrates the will of the international community to 
serve justice and ethics he said in a statment 
greece has said that it will send a frigate to join the 
multinational armada but has not said when it will sail or what its 
mission will be 
danish foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen said the security 
council move is so fine that i almost dont know how to express 
it he said his country is now prepared to contribute a corvette 
and a supply ship to the forces in the gulf subject to 
parliamentary approval 
with the historic un resolution we now have a clear basis to 
participate actively in the multinational blockade of iraq 
ellemannjensen said in an interview with danish public radio 
juan lena spokesman for the spanish foreign ministry said in a 
statement that the security council vote coincides with the 
spanish posture since the start of the persian gulf crisis in

for much of the summer two dozen cardboard shacks 
draped in plastic have sheltered a small squatter community a 
stones throw from the magnificent goldtipped domes of red square 
not long ago police would have smashed the shacks and dragged 
the occupants away today policemen protect the squatters from the 
occasional angry worker who wants to evict them from their grassy 
lot outside the hotel rossiya 
so the squatters wait as everyone here must for one thing or 
another they sit with their handscrawled paper signs about 
grievances against the government former employers the communist 
party 
as summer slid into autumn bringing a cold rain the ink of 
their printed plaints ran and smeared 
we are here today one sign says you will be here 
tomorrow we are all deprived of our rights in the ussr down 
with communist slavery 
like everyone else they wait to see what the government will do 
next 
it has been a long summer of waiting for consumer goods for 
the government to prepare a new plan for a market economy for yet 
another explosion of protest 
the list of things people must wait for seems to grow as rapidly 
as the line that forms in the rain for a rare opportunity to buy 
german shoes 
drivers carry empty cans in their cars to fill when they find 
gasoline frustrated smokers block traffic in moscow and other 
cities to protest a cigarette shortage ice cream kiosks close 
because there is none to sell 
even bread traditionally abundant and just a few cents a loaf 
is so scarce that rationing was introduced in tarusa south of 
moscow a riot broke out in chelyabinsk siberia after an angry 
crowd had demanded vodka and meat 
some things are plentiful 
old women sell freshly cut red white and pink carnations 
outside nearly every subway station 
just in time for fall while parents hunt for scarce school 
notebooks inflatable beach toys fill the shelves of detsky mir 
the huge childrens department store 
at tables inside subway stations vendors sell posters featuring 
everything from pictures of the last czar to a topless woman 
putting a saddle on a horse theres a bumper grain crop this year 
but the fuel shortage hampers the harvest and tons of wheat may rot 
in the fields 
crime is increasing some tourists report their hotel rooms 
looted black marketeers hawk car parts cigarettes and other goods 
on moscows ring road on saturday nights 
newspapers are filled with reports of violent crimes including 
rumors of a jack the ripper on the loose in moscow 
two things are in great supply anxiety and pessimism 
many people agree the soviet union must adopt a market economy 
but worry about replacing a bad system with one that may be worse 
sergei borinov a 19yearold college student says he is not 
convinced the goverment can cure the shortages and the ailing 
economy 
lawmakers have visited shops several times to check the 
situation in the stores and nothing ever changes said borinov 
one of those who blocked traffic last week to protest cigarette 
shortages i am indignant about such an attitude and about just 
what is going on in our country 
two commissions one appointed jointly by president mikhail s 
gorbachev and his chief rival boris n yeltsin and the other run 
by prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov are considering how to make 
the switch to a market system 
yeltsin president of the russian federation says it should be 
done in 500 days 
gorbachev wants to go slower lessening the shock of price 
increases 
yeltsin has accused ryzhkovs government of sabotaging the 
reform effort by not divulging basic economic data and has said 
the russian federation will ogo its own way if the ryzhkov plan is 
presented to the national parliament scheduled to convene sept 3 
russia largest of the 15 soviet republics is one of a dozen 
republics seeking to set their own courses either through 
independence or a lesser form of autonomy 
the separatist movements are related to the process of 
disintegration illustrated by the cardboard village near the 
kremlin walls where dozens of protesters clamor for the attention 
of the soviet leadership they have elected an unofficial mayor to 
coordinate their demands 
authorities have made no move to evict them 
a policeman who spends eight hours a day keeping track of them 
was asked how long they would be allowed to stay 
it depends on how fast their problems are solved lt sergei 
petrykin said 
the country has a lot of problems and these are priorities 
when the country resolves its own problems it will be easier to 
deal with the individual problems of these people 
in the meantime he said these people are just torturing 
themselves

president turgut ozal of turkey tells of 
glancing at the television screen just in time to see and hear 
president bush saying he was about to call him up 
the turkish president walked into his office and picked up the 
ringing telephone it was bush 
thats the way it often is in the persian gulf confrontation 
cable news networks constant live broadcasts from scenes of 
crisis and diplomacy lets leaders a world apart look over one 
anothers shoulders as events unfold 
in another era information on crisis situations moved to 
diplomats and warriors over secret coded back channels the world 
knew only what these movers and shakers wanted known 
the gulf crisis is broadcast around the world in color often 
live 24 hours a day on cnn among the most avid watchers are the 
world leaders who make the news including britains margaret 
thatcher frances francois mitterrand libyas moammar gadhafi and 
king fahd of saudi arabia 
cnn staffers in washington are reminded of this by a photograph 
tacked to their bulletin board it shows president bush and his top 
advisers watching an iraqi newscast the cnn logo prominent in one 
corner 
abcs ted koppel broadcasting from baghdad paid a rival the 
ultimate compliment by saying that the iraqi foreign ministry was 
following events by watching cnn 
and turkeys ozal a key player says he has kept his television 
tuned to cnn since iraq troops crossed into kuwait aug 2 an 
associated press reporter arriving for an interview recently found 
the president chuckling over a brawl between the new york mets and 
philadelphia phillies 
each morning iraqi television sends cnns atlanta headquarters 
two or three messages advising what stories it plans to carry such 
a message might advise that at 1130 am eastern time iraqi tv 
will be carrying a message from president saddam hussein to 
president bush 
television has become a weapon in this war of nerves just as it 
was when the ayatollah khomeini allowed us camera crews to film 
frenzied mobs of iranians denouncing the great satan america 
during the 19791980 hostage crisis 
and its getting on president bushs nerves bush complained to 
reporters this week that they were asking harder questions of him 
than of saddam hussein in baghdad 
ed turner cnns executive vice president for news gathering 
said the network tapes most iraqi tv offerings and screens them 
before they are put on the network 
but on thursday when hussein appeared on television for 50 
minutes with a roomful of englishspeaking hostages cnn stayed 
with iraqi tv the entire time the other american networks showed 
excerpts of the bizarre profoundly disturbing scene 
turner no relation to cnn founder ted turner shrugs off any 
suggestion that the network is being used for propaganda by the 
iraqis 
the technology that permits all this is not going to be 
disinvented he said when we worry about being used or 
manipulated or becoming a part of this story as opposed to being 
chroniclers it seems to me that since the technology exists its 
a question of using it responsibly 
robert macneil coanchor of the macneillehrer hour on the 
public broadcasting service said television is doing what wire 
services and newspapers have been doing for more than a century 
its just that television has speeded it up macneil said 
its a kind of television version of the hot line that kennedy 
and khrushchev set up after the cuban missile crisis 
the international audience for cnns broadcast is awesome the 
networks broadcasts are seen in 95 countries including 25 in 
europe 3 in the middle east and 10 in africa 
were virtually the primary source of news for many people 
including many principals involved in the current crisis said 
peter vesey director of cnn international its gratifying but 
it emphasizes once again our responsibility as journalists not only 
to get it fast but to get it right 
ted turner began with 17 million domestic subscribers and now 
has over 55 million at any given time the evening newscasts of the 
other three commercial networks out draw cnn 10to1 but that is 
not a valid comparison since the cable networks audience is spread 
over a 24hour day 
vesey estimates that cnn has nine million subscribers worldwide 
but its audience is far larger since the service is available 
unscrambled to people who have the right kind of equipment but 
dont pay 
the network observed its 10th anniversary last month and 
newsweek describing a celebration headlined its piece cnn is 
the network of the new world it helped create national public 
radios daniel schorr who was with cnn at the start called it 
the worlds intercom 
cnn took out a threeage advertisement this month in the 
industry publication electronic media to brag about how far its 
come 
they laughed when we decided to create an allnews network 
said the first page 
nobodys laughing now says the second

the united nations security council voted today to put military 
might behind economic sanctions on iraq while diplomats inside 
embassies in kuwait played a tense waiting game with iraqi troops 
surrounding some of their compounds 
us officials said electricity to the us embassy in kuwait 
was cut off today but iraqi troops around the american compound 
have not attempted to close it 
the security council vote came after the united states which 
has dozens of warships in the persian gulf sought un authority 
to use force in stopping trade with iraq the embargo is aimed at 
pressuring iraqi president saddam hussein to end his 3weekold 
occupation of kuwait 
iraq denounced the security council move as illegal and warned 
it could lead to allout war 
this use of force by the united states or any of its allies or 
puppets will lead inevitably to a number of explosions which will 
burn all in their path said iraqs un ambassador abdul amir 
alanbari 
meanwhile japans foreign ministry said today that tokyos 
ambassador to iraq had protested the moving of about 20 japanese 
from a baghdad hotel to an unknown destination a foreign ministry 
official said the japanese nationals were put on a bus today with 
about 20 other foreigners mostly caucasians 
saddam has repeatedly threatened to use trapped foreigners as 
human shields to protect iraqi installations against attack 
in the embassy standoff a european envoy had said iraq 
threatened to forcefully remove diplomats remaining at their posts 
in kuwait today 
but diplomatic sources said it was unlikely that baghdad would 
make such a move while austrian president kurt waldheim was in the 
iraqi capital for talks with saddam 
waldheim arrived today and saddam himself was on hand to greet 
him at the airport according to diplomats who spoke on condition 
of anonymity the austrian president was the first western leader 
to meet with saddam since the invasion of kuwait aug 2 which set 
off the persian gulf crisis 
according to article 45 of the vienna convention on diplomatic 
relations foreign missions are to remain inviolable even in times 
of armed conflict 
iraq had said it would cut water and power to embassy compounds 
where diplomats defied an iraqi order to close their doors 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the power 
was cut at the us compound but water and other supplies remained 
adequate 
japan and italy said power had been cut at their embassies but 
the british foreign office said electricity to its compound cut 
friday was back on today and that iraqi tanks previously 
surrounding the british compound had left 
the british and us embassies were among 10 missions ringed by 
soldiers 
todays un security council vote was the first time in its 
45year history the council has authorized such military action to 
enforce its own sanctions the sanctions against iraq were imposed 
four days after the invasion 
the resolution calls on nations with naval forces in the persian 
gulf region to use such measures commensurate to the specific 
circumstances as may be necessary under the authority of the 
security council to halt all inward and outward maritime 
the us ambassador to the united nations thomas r pickering 
called the resolution a historic decision and said it is 
sufficiently broad as to allow the use of force 
the main sticking point prior to the vote was objections by 
moscow but the soviet union agreed to back the resolution and said 
it would consider joining the naval force as a permanent council 
member the soviets had veto power over the measure 
the soviet reversal after 10 days of balking came shortly after 
president mikhail s gorbachev sent an urgent message to iraq 
suggesting moscow might support a military blockade he called the 
persian gulf situation extremely dangerous 
the 15member council adopted the resolution with 13 votes in 
favor and two abstentions from cuba and yemen 
yemen said today it was fully committed to honoring the un 
embargo and denied reports it serves as a base for iraqi warplanes 
but diplomatic sources in the gulf region contended that iraq 
had flown 12 captured kuwaiti jet fighters to yemen and that prior 
to the invasion it had based 36 sovietmade iraqi jet fighters at 
taez 120 miles south of yemens capital sana 
in occupied kuwait troops were reported surrounding or 
patrolling near the us british canadian french japanese 
italian norwegian swedish romanian and hungarian embassies iraq 
now considers its oilrich neighbor iraqi territory 
several nations complied with the iraqi order to close 
embassies including venezuela the philippines india and lebanon 
moscow evacuated its embassy but said the mission remained 
technically open 
the japanese foreign ministry said today that there were still 
soldiers posted outside the japanese mission and that water 
electricity and telephone lines were cut 
japan also said one of 213 japanese refugees from kuwait now 
under virtual house arrest in a baghdad hotel had made telephone 
contact with the baghdad embassy and reported all the japanese 
confined in the hotel were well 
in rome italys foreign ministry said today that electricity at 
its kuwait mission was cut off 
many embassies remaining open maintained skeleton staffs some 
including poland and spain had just one diplomat present 
greeces foreign ministry said today its embassys 
telecommunications had been cut poland too said it has had no 
contact with its embassy today 
spains ambassador to amman ramon armengod said in madrid that 
iraqi authorities warned western diplomats that troops would 
forcibly remove them from their missions starting today 
but there were no immediate reports of iraqi action 
the us mission like most embassies staying open was cut to a 
staff of about 10 including ambassador nathaniel howell on 
friday 100 dependents and staff traveled to baghdad from where 
they were scheduled to leave for home 
but once they arrived saddam reversed an earlier promise and 
refused to let them leave the country said white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
later friday the official iraqi news agency said iraq would 
detain only male embassy employees of those countries that refused 
to close embassies in kuwait but there was no indication the 
dependents were being allowed to leave 
italys foreign ministry said three italian diplomats who left 
kuwait were also kept from leaving baghdad on friday 
iraq had said it would revoke the diplomatic status of embassy 
staff who refused to leave by a friday deadline after that date 
diplomats were to be treated as any other foreigner 
about 21000 westerners including 3000 americans have been 
held in iraq and kuwait since the invasion and president bush has 
said they must be considered hostages 
turkey and jordan which share borders with iraq said they were 
encountering difficulties sheltering and providing transport for 
the thousands of mostly arab refugees streaming across their 
borders 
jordan said earlier this week that it would close its border 
but the european community and others moved to help with money and 
supplies and the border remained open turkey requested similar 
assistance 
in the saudi arabian desert more than 100000 iraqi troops face 
tens of thousands of us troops deployed to deter further 
aggression by saddam 
the american forces will be bolstered by reservists from half a 
dozen states called up friday

the persian gulf crisis has presented western 
europe with a tough practical test of its dream of uniting into a 
superpower 
the european community began the summer with ambitious plans for 
deepening the economic and political union of its 12 member states 
then came the iraqi invasion of kuwait and suddenly the europeans 
must think militarily as well 
their initial response was hesitant the french appeared 
determined to go their own way west germany cited constitutional 
restrictions on deploying forces outside europe 
britain as ever washingtons most loyal ally quickly sent 
ships and planes but it was an american show from the start that 
has helped squelch any notion in europe that with the end of the 
cold war america was fading away as a superpower 
the united states has gained tremendous respect and people can 
no longer say that it is a failing superpower unable to keep up 
with the ec or anybody else said vernon bogdanor an oxford 
university expert on europe 
the european population is larger than that of the united 
states and they rely on arab oil even more than the americans do 
but they are simply not able to organize their own defense 
it took nearly three weeks for the europeans to come up with a 
joint response 
on tuesday the ninenation western european union the european 
arm of nato said it had agreed on a coordinated military response 
to back the un embargo against iraq 
european community foreign ministers also meeting in paris 
announced the same day that member countries would defy iraqi 
orders to close their embassies in kuwait 
belgium the netherlands italy spain and greece will join 
britain and france in sending naval vessels to the gulf 
west germany said it would change its constitution to allow 
participation portugal the ninth member of the western european 
union expressed reservations and did not commit itself to sending 
ships 
foreign minister roland dumas of france described the tuesday 
meetings as a response to a situation which is exceptional in its 
gravity and its implications 
frances president francois mitterrand acknowledged the 
disadvantage of not having a joint defense structure he said 
europe must become more conscious of itself which will become 
more possible once it has a political existence 
bogdanor said europe was slow to act partly because there is 
no real european government to make decisions and partly because of 
the lack of a defense capacity 
he said the western european union could act only through member 
governments and required unanimity and the ec was preoccupied with 
internal problems 
germany is concentrating on reunification and the rest of 
europe is looking at monetary and political union so the gulf 
crisis has really highlighted the weaknesses of the community 
bogdanor said 
josef janning of the european research group at mainz university 
in west germany said the delay showed the europeans had no concept 
of how to react quickly and were forced to scramble in a crisis 
west germany hid behind its own laws to avoid military action in 
the gulf he said but it is noteworthy that changing the 
constitution is no longer being completely rejected 
as the ecs economic powerhouse germany cannot escape the 
point that at some time military operations must be undertaken 
even if they expose themselves to others who say ah there come 
the germans who started world war ii janning said 
the ec has been firmer on diplomatic issues arising from the 
crisis 
foreign secretary douglas hurd of britain pointed to the united 
stand on iraqs threat to the embassies in kuwait 
its been very heartening that against some predictions 
weve all stuck together on this and none have yielded to the 
temptation to pull out the diplomatic staffs while the going was 
good he said friday as iraqi troops began surrounding the 
legations 
even those countries who have very small communities in kuwait 
have stuck and that is a good thing hurd said 
trevor taylor a defense expert soon to join the royal institute 
for international affairs in london said of the decision to sent 
naval forces the notion that there would be such a coordinated 
european military action outside the nato area was unthinkable a 
few years ago 
christopher hill lecturer in international relations at the 
london school of economics noted that the western european union 
meeting was the first to coincide with a conference of ec foreign 
ministers 
combine this with the german decision and you have an 
extremely significant development he said 
hill added however that the concerted action runs the risk 
of breaking the traditional euroarab dialogue asunder

kuwait was cut off today but iraqi troops around the diplomatic 
mission have not attempted to close it us officials said 
theyre operating under generator power said white house 
spokesman roman popadiuk adding that the bush administration had 
made known our views about the current situation to iraqi 
officials in baghdad kuwait and washington 
but he said water and other supplies remain adequate for 
ambassador nathaniel howell and his staff of about 10 diplomats 
who are defying iraqi president saddam husseins order to shift the 
us embassy operations to baghdad 
power was cut to our embassy some time during last night 
popadiuk said there are reports that power as well as other 
services such as water have been cut to other embassies 
he said however that electricity may have been restored to 
some of the other diplomatic compounds 
the embassy continues to function it is carrying out its 
consular functions popadiuk said 
he said a small contingent of iraqi soldiers remained outside 
the embassy as they have since before fridays deadline from the 
iraqis for western nations to close their embassies in kuwait 
meanwhile the state department sought to assure 2500 or so 
americans trapped in kuwait that the embassy was determined to 
continue working for your release from kuwait and your safe return 
to your families 
in a broadcast carried on the voice of america and the british 
broadcasting corp the state department also cautioned americans 
not to go to the embassy compound where iraqi troops were posted 
the united states government wants american citizens to be 
assured that your welfare is foremost in our thoughts the 
broadcast said 
in baghdad about 100 us diplomats and dependents who were 
evacuated from the embassy in kuwait still were unable to leave 
iraq 
their situation has not changed a us official told the 
associated press in washington 
the group had been guaranteed safe passage but en route to 
baghdad from kuwait city the iraqis imposed new regulations 
barring the departure of diplomats whose embassies remained open 
despite saddams order that they be closed friday 
subsequently the iraqi news agency reported the dependents 
could leave the state department planned to evacuate them to 
turkey today but they remained in the iraqi capital while us 
diplomats took up the situation with the iraqi foreign ministry 
the officials in washington said 
in other developments today the white house applauded the 
united nations vote to allow military enforcement of trade 
sanctions against baghdad saying the move further strengthens 
the world resolve to force iraq out of kuwait 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater also hailed soviet 
president mikhail gorbachevs strong support of the sanctions 
calling it a very important development 
at the pentagon officials announced that elements of the 48th 
tactical fighter wing were being deployed to saudi arabia from 
their base at raf lakenheath in great britain 
the wing will deploy f111 aircraft which are longrange 
bombers associated personnel and equipment to support the us 
central command forces in operation desert shield f111s from 
britain were used in the raids against libya 
fitzwater in a written statement released at this rainy resort 
where president bush is in the third week of a crisisclouded 
vacation said 
president gorbachevs statement friday supporting the united 
nations sanctions was a very important development we welcome his 
voice to the world condemnation of the aggression by saddam 
hussein 
fitzwater added that the un security council resolution 
adopted early today further strengthens the world resolve to 
force iraq out of kuwait we are encouraged by the progress of 
events at the united nations and by president gorbachevs strong 
support 
gorbachev sent an urgent message friday to saddam urging him to 
comply with the un orders to get out of kuwait and warning that 
the situation in the gulf was extremely dangerous 
bush stayed out of the public eye today fishing from his 
speedboat fidelity despite a morning downpour 
the resolution by the 15member security council passed with 13 
votes in favor and yemen and cuba abstaining it calls on nations 
with naval forces in the persian gulf region to use such measures 
commensurate to the specific circumstances as may be necessary 
under the authority of the security council to halt all inward and 
outward maritime 
fitzwater said 
the unanimous vote further underlines the deep concern of the 
world community regarding the blatant aggression by iraq against 
kuwait the resolve of the international community is strong 
iraq overran kuwait aug 2 and annexed the emirate six days 
later 
the soviets had said they would back a us resolution calling 
for minimum force to stop all shipping to and from iraq 
as us ambassador thomas pickering was marshaling support for 
that resolution at the un on friday the white house charged that 
iraq was circumventing the sanctions in a variety of ways 
including aviation shipments into baghdad 
fitzwater said called iraqs refusal to let all the diplomats 
out a further step in the harassment that saddam has 
undertaken 
at least 20 countries kept their kuwait embassies open in 
defiance of saddams edict the british and greek embassies 
previously reported they had no electricity or water and troops 
surrounded a number of western embassies and the japanese embassy 
thousands of american troops and an armada of warships are 
within range of iraq and kuwait but bush has given no hint how he 
might respond if saddam attempts to overrun the embassy 
the navy announced on saturday that it had called up 127 reserve 
units 
the marine guards at the us embassy in kuwait left in the 
convoy signalling that us officials had no intention of 
resisting any iraqi effort to storm the building

freed irish hostage brian keenan said 
today he had seen american hostages terry anderson and thomas 
sutherland and other westerners during his fouryear captivity in 
lebanon 
keenan 39 looking pale but otherwise physically fit was 
turned over to irish foreign minister gerry collins today almost 
24 hours after he was freed by his captors 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was abducted march 16 1985 he is the longest held of the 
13 westerners still believed held by moslem zealots in lebanon 
i saw terry anderson some time ago keenan said without 
specifying when hes in good form he received messages from his 
fiance and he appreciates the letters that he received from his 
family 
he said he also saw sutherland who was kidnapped june 9 1985 
and british hostage john mccarthy grabbed april 17 1986 
he did not specify when he last saw sutherland 56 of fort 
collins colo but said he was with mccarthy 33 only two 
nights ago 
about sutherland he said hes well he has told us an entire 
repertoire of jokes also several times and dr sutherland is in 
good health and regularly exercising 
he said mccarthy a reporter for the londonbased worldwide 
television news was also well 
his great sense of humor succeeded very early in driving me 
slightly insane johns good humor mimickly was very much 
appreciated and brought in all of us who came in contact with him a 
real sense of the outside world keenan added 
of anderson he said he has a picture of his daughter 
sulome which is some great companionship for him 
anderson has never seen sulome 5 who was born almost three 
months after he was kidnapped he is among six americans two west 
germans and an italian also remaining in captivity in lebanon 
andersons sister peggy say told of keenans comments said 
im anxious to talk to brian and to get more details about 
terrys mental emotional and physical health 
of course im very pleased for the keenan sisters and their 
family but unfortunately our experience has been in the past that 
when a single hostage is released that doesnt nercessarily mean 
that we are going to see another one for some time six months and 
sometimes years she said by telephone from her home in kentucky 
keenan who held a news conference at the home of the dutch 
ambassador gerben meihuizen read a handwritten statement to 
reporters but took no questions 
keenan was turned over to the irish foreign minister at the 
syrian foreign ministry keenans sisters eliane spence and brenda 
gillham also were waiting in the compound 
kenaan his hair cut short and his beard neatly trimmed 
struggled to hold back tears as he sat between his sisters on a 
sofa in the syrian foreign ministers office 
i am delighted to be with my sisters he said his voice 
choking 
collins mrs spence and mrs gillham had flown in from dublin 
an hour earlier they were accompanied by a doctor and a nurse 
they drove first to the home of the dutch ambassador then to the 
ministry 
keenan was the fifth western hostage released in as many months 
a littleknown group calling itself the organization of the 
islamic dawn had said the teacher was being freed friday and 
ireland later confirmed keenan had been handed over to syrian army 
officers in beirut the lebanese capital 
keenan was kidnapped april 11 1986 in west beirut while walking 
to the american university where he taught english he was born in 
belfast and was traveling on an irish passport but he has dual 
irishbritish citizenship 
a statement by the irish government said everyone in ireland 
is overjoyed at the news of keenans release 
britains foreign office also expressed delight and said britain 
welcomed the helpful role played by syria and iran in keenans 
release and looked to their undoubted influence to ensure the 
release of other hostages 
these include church of england envoy terry waite who 
disappeared in beirut in 1987 while trying to negotiate the release 
of other hostages and mccarthy alec collett and jack mann 
collins had told a news conference friday he hoped keenans 
release would signal the start of the release of all other 
hostages and the irish government intended to work toward that aim 
until the kidnappers statement friday no group had claimed 
responsibility for keenan from the time he was abducted until he 
was freed 
the only other statement on hostages to come from the 
organization of islamic dawn was when it announced april 30 it was 
releasing frank reed an education administrator born in malden 
mass 
hostage robert polhill of new york was freed april 22 and two 
swiss red cross workers elio erriquez and emmanuel christen were 
freed this month 
in london sky news television said on friday that reed held 
with keenan for almost three years was to fly from washington to 
greet keenan on his arrival at dublin 
reed 57 promised after his release following 44 months of 
captivity that he would be with keenan when the irishman was freed

iraq not only has become a major poison gas 
producer but also has revived efforts to make atomic weapons 
which were thwarted by israels 1981 bombing of a nuclear reactor 
a report says 
president saddam husseins government each year turns out more 
than 1000 tons of chemical warfare agents including 
blistercausing mustard gas and nerve gas according to sword of 
the arabs a survey of iraqi weaponry to be issued shortly by the 
washington institute for near east policy a private research 
organization 
sustained production at that level would give iraq the worlds 
largest chemical weapons stockpile if the united states and soviet 
union carry out obligations of a treaty they signed last june to 
reduce their stocks to 5000 tons by the year 2002 current us 
stockpiles are estimated at 30000 tons while the soviets have an 
estimated 50000 
iraq also has an active program to make germ weapons even though 
it has signed but not ratified a 1972 treaty prohibiting 
development or possession of biological weapons said the report 
obtained by the associated press 
after israel bombed iraqs osiraq reactor in 1981 the iraqi 
nuclear weapons project remained dormant until 1987 when baghdad 
turned to the gas centrifuge method of enriching uranium fuel the 
study said 
this could provide the ability to produce nuclear weapons in 
five to 10 years depending the amount of equipment and technology 
iraq continues to draw from abroad it added 
long before that however iraq could make one or two small 
lowyield atomic bombs using 125 kilograms 275 pounds of 
frenchsupplied uranium in its possession said report author 
michael eisenstadt 
that uranium however is subject to international inspection 
and its diversion to weapons would be a formal breach of the 
nonproliferation treaty signed by iraq provoking international 
censure and making it harder for baghdad to acquire equipment and 
technology for the other process 
eisenstadt said iraq was unlikely at this time to opt for the 
crude smaller bombs 
the gas centrifuge method used by pakistan and brazil is easy 
to disperse and conceal and might enable iraq to clandestinely 
develop a nuclear weapons production capability while formally 
preserving its credentials as a signatory of the npt treaty he 
said 
predicting that iraq will stockpile chemical and possibly 
biological weapons for the foreseeable future eisenstadt said 
iraq in the near future is expected to produce chemical missile 
warheads vastly increasing the lethality of its strategic 
forces 
such capabilities enable iraq to coerce its smaller neighbors 
and increasingly to deal with israel from a position of 
strength he said noting inputs of soviet chinese west german 
austrian italian argentine egyptian and swiss technology in 
iraqi missile development 
development of strike systems capable of reaching israel has 
led to the emergence of an uneasy deterrent relationship between 
iraq and israel he said israel now has to consider that a 
preventive strike against iraq could prompt retaliation and produce 
unacceptable losses iraqs strategic deterrent thus produces a 
protective umbrella for its nuclear weapons program 
eisenstadt a research fellow in politicalmilitary affairs at 
the washington institute also works as a civilian analyst for us 
army intelligence and is a reserve army intelligence officer the 
institute has a declared policy of promoting wideranging informed 
debate about the middle east while regarded as supportive of 
strong usiraeli relations the institute office said it receives 
no israeli funds 
its advisory board includes former secretaries of state george 
shultz and alexander haig former vice president walter mondale

after struggling for weeks to fix 
fuel leaks nasa intends to try once again this week to send 
columbia up to study some of the hottest objects in the universe 
the shuttle sporting new hydrogen lines is scheduled to lift 
off at 117 am edt saturday with seven astronauts and the 150 
million astro observatory the countdown is due to begin early 
wednesday 
as columbia orbits 218 miles above earth astro will probe 
highenergy ultraviolet light and xrays emitted from stars 
galaxies quasars even a comet and supernova such radiation is 
invisible from the ground 
the mission scheduled to last nine to 10 days will be the 
first in five years devoted entirely to scientific research 
it also will be the first shuttle flight since discovery carried 
the flawed hubble space telescope into orbit in april thats the 
longest gap between missions since flights resumed following the 
1986 challenger disaster 
were certainly aware we will be getting a lot more public 
attention will that affect what were doing not at all said 
jeffrey hoffman one of four astronomers on board to operate astro 
we were always going at it 105 percent 
columbia originally was scheduled to lift off with astro in 
march 1986 one of the targets was to have been halleys comet 
that mission and all others were put on hold after challenger 
exploded in january 1986 
this year after a revamping of astros observation plans 
launch was set for may 30 but hydrogen escaped from columbia 
during fueling and the flight was called off 
atlantis took columbias place at the pad but also was found to 
have a hydrogen leak and its classified military mission was 
delayed from july to november 
atlantis was rolled back to the hangar 2 weeks ago and a newly 
repaired columbia reclaimed the pad 
yeah its frustrating hoffman said noting all the delays 
one of the things that you absolutely need in this business is 
patience and also the ability not to take all of these things 
personally 
besides coping with leaky shuttles the space agency has spent 
the past several months investigating the cause of hubbles 
blemished mirror 
more recently national aeronautics and space administration 
engineers have been struggling with the periodic loss of radio 
contact with the venusorbiting magellan spacecraft 
consequently nasa expresses eagerness for success 
everyone is very anxious for our mission to go very well 
said gene urban deputy mission scientist for astro were really 
a little nervous id say about having everything work right 
im worried that it normally comes in threes so maybe i have 
two more to go following hubble said charles pellerin jr 
nasas director of astrophysics 
scientists main concern with astro is the instrument pointing 
system for the three ultraviolet telescopes the pointing system 
has been used only once before for solar observations in 1985 and 
numerous problems were encountered 
about half of the 150 or so objects astro will observe some of 
them millions of degrees will be new this time around said 
mission scientist ted gull many of the may targets had to be 
replaced because they got too close to the sun for the instruments 
to see 
columbias flight will be the first of five spacelab missions 
dedicated to a single subject astrophysics 
among the questions astronomers hope astro will answer on its 
first outing are how much helium existed shortly after the universe 
was created and what powers quasars the most distant objects in 
the universe 
columbias crew is taking advantage of the missions scientific 
focus to conduct space classroom the first of what nasa hopes 
will become a regular series for youngsters more than 40 middle 
school students at two nasa centers will question the astronauts 
through a twoway audio link 
the crew hopes to contact the two cosmonauts aboard space 
station mir by ham radio marking the first time direct radio 
communications is made between a us and soviet spacecraft 
payload specialist ron parise a licensed ham radio operator 
also plans to contact amateur radio stations around the world 
commanding the mission is vance brand who at age 59 will become 
the oldest astronaut to fly in space

marchers protesting political 
violence and alleged police bias paraded through several cities 
saturday to demand government action to restore peace 
some 250 women of all races of the african national congress 
womens league marched to parliament to present demands including 
an immediate halt to black factional fighting 
the womens league organized similar marches around the country 
and drew even larger crowds in port elizabeth on the southern 
coast and pietermaritzburg in natal province 
more than 5000 blacks have been killed in natal province since 
1985 in clashes between the zululed conservative inkatha movement 
and ancaffiliated groups 
the clashes spread to black townships around johannesburg on 
aug 12 leaving more than 500 people dead on friday the 
government declared the johannesburg area townships unrest 
areas which gave police widespread powers to suppress the 
violence 
the marchers claimed thousands of lives would have been saved if 
the government had taken effective steps earlier 
had the conflict been in white residential areas or if the 
victims had been predominantly white immediate steps would have 
been taken to end the conflict said nomatyala hangana of the 
womens league 
the marchers also contended that police failed to protect black 
communities and had shown extreme partiality toward inkatha 
members police and government officials have denied such charges 
the marchers demanded a judicial commission of inquiry into the 
violence that security forces play an effective and impartial 
role as peacekeepers and creation of a crisis fund to help 
families repair damaged and looted homes 
in a separate protest several hundred people marched to the 
headquarters of the governmentoperated south african broadcasting 
corp in johannesburg to protest what organizers called secret and 
partial decisionmaking on restructuring 
the protesters demanded a governmentappointed task force on the 
restructuring be disbanded they also demanded impartial 
broadcasting union organizing at the corporation racially

since 1946 the officers of the un 
military staff committee have gathered doggedly every two weeks to 
formally confirm that there is no work for their moribund group to 
do 
suddenly their role may change 
the un resolution passed saturday authorizing the use of 
force to carry out an embargo against iraq asks member states to 
coordinate their actions as appropriate through the military 
staff committee 
the resolution didnt say precisely what the committee should 
do it could conceivably be a center for exchanging intelligence 
or just receive reports of individual nations activities 
but the resolution is likely to give some visibility and a new 
lease on life to what had been one of the united nations most 
obscure institutions 
the committee consists of senior military officers from united 
states soviet union china britain and france the five permanent 
members of the security council since the committees founding it 
has met twice a month for about 20 minutes often in a basement 
conference room to officially take note that the security council 
hasnt ordered it to do anything 
meanwhile on the 38th floor of un headquarters civil 
servants have coordinated the un forces the world is already used 
to the 15000 peacekeepers assigned to trouble spots worldwide 
the civilian secretariat members run the peacekeeping troops in 
a hierarchy completely separate from the military staff committee 
under the un charter the military staff committee was to 
command any combined military force that the security council would 
establish 
but the committee quickly became moribund because of the cold 
war during the korean conflict the united nations assigned 
military command of un forces to the united states instead of 
attempting to activate the military staff committee 
diplomats have favored continued meetings of the staff committee 
on the grounds that abandoning them would symbolize an end to the 
hope that the united nations would ever be able to organize joint 
military action 
the un missions of the five powers pay the salaries of the 
officers assigned to it

reports filtering out of baghdad tell of 
panic buying rationing and housetohouse sweeps by militiamen 
hunting food hoarders as iraq begins to feel the bite of the un 
trade embargo 
on saturday the un security council approved military action 
to enforce the embargo imposed aug 6 to punish saddam hussein for 
invading and annexing kuwait 
it could be weeks before iraqis really have to tighten their 
belts 
but even before the sanctions were given sharper teeth reports 
out of iraq said essentials such as cooking oil flour and fruit 
have virtually disappeared in the capital city of baghdad and other 
areas 
armed units of the ruling bath partys militia the peoples 
guard were conducting random checks of stores and homes looking 
in freezers and cupboards for surplus stocks the dissident kurdish 
democratic party said in a statement released in nicosia 
the reports were confirmed by sources in baghdad where about a 
quarter of iraqs 17 million people live 
since aug 12 when saddam told the nation to prepare for 
austerity hoarding food and profiteering have been punishable by 
death 
for the last three days government agents have been conducting 
a census in baghdad to prepare for national rationing based on the 
number of people in each family according to sources who spoke on 
condition they not be identified 
militiamen and soldiers patrolled baghdads streets to disperse 
crowds of more than five people the sources said 
government ministers and the official media have been asking 
people to reduce their consumption of some foods while assuring 
them that iraq has sufficient stockpiles to last months the 
sources said 
exiled iraqis and experts have varied opinions about how much 
food iraq has on hand and how long it will last the only certainty 
is that the country requires food imported with oil revenue 
last year iraq spent 29 billion importing 75 percent of what 
its people ate 
with oil exports saddams main source of revenue now largely 
cut off iraq faces a harsh winter if it does not withdraw from 
kuwait 
the most important thing is the oil embargo said selim 
fakhri a former colonel in the iraqi army and a leading figure in 
the resistance alliance in exile 
food is still coming in through jordan perhaps yemen and 
lebanon but if iraq cant sell its oil then there will come a 
time when the country will not be able to pay for anything even if 
it can bring it in 
without oil the country grinds to a halt i give it no more 
than a couple of months he said in a telephone interview from 
london 
throughout the 198088 war with iran and after iraq bought most 
of its food from the united states canada and australia all now 
committed to the embargo 
in the 12 months ending june 30 iraq bought 25 million tons of 
wheat barley rice and corn from the united states said jonathan 
crusoe an analyst with the middle east economic digest us corn 
accounted for 650000 tons of total iraqi imports of 750000 tons 
last year however the us agriculture department reduced 
credit to iraq which then started seeking other suppliers of 
cotton tobacco wool cattle hides and tallow 
around 100000 tons of wheat had been ordered from the european 
community for shipment in august and october crusoe said 
turkey which supplied its southeastern neighbor with citrus 
fruits tomato paste lentils chickpeas and cotton could have 
helped fill iraqs import gap but joined the embargo on aug 8 
some us agencies estimate that iraq has enough wheat to last 
two months rice for three months and corn for less than two weeks 
all these stocks could be extended substantially by rationing 
the eightyear war with iran left its scars on iraqs 
agricultural sector but the real damage was done by 20 years of 
tight socialist control of the economy 
farmland between the tigris and euphrates rivers was ravaged a 
campaign against rebellious kurds in the fertile north resulted in 
the forcible relocation of tens of thousands of peasants 
even with the international military action to halt shipping to 
iraq some food still may get through un resolution 661 allows 
food on humanitarian grounds 
but president bushs goal is total economic deprivation to 
be successful he said this embargo is going to be 
allencompassing and it will include food

pennsylvanias antiabortion advocates 
promised to restore restrictions overturned by a federal judge and 
predicted ultimate victory in the courts 
the big enchilada is the us supreme court and were going to 
win said rep gerard kosinsky one of the legislatures most 
vocal antiabortion supporters 
in a 191page ruling issued friday us district judge daniel 
h huyett iii struck down provisions of pennsylvanias abortion law 
that would have required a woman to notify her husband and to wait 
24 hours before getting an abortion and would have forced minors 
to obtain a parents consent or a court order 
womens rights groups proclaimed victory after the ruling but 
expressed concern the pennsylvania law could become the case that 
would lead to the overturning the us supreme courts 1973 roe vs 
wade decision legalizing abortion 
kathryn kolbert the american civil liberties union lawyer who 
argued the case said it could reach the nations highest court by 
fall 1991 she said the case continues to pose an ominous threat 
to reproductive freedom nationwide 
pennsylvanias law was considered the nations most restrictive 
state statute the nations most stringent law enacted in the 
us territory of guam banned all abortions except when a womans 
life was in danger and also made it illegal to recommend a woman 
have an abortion a federal judge threw it out it thursday 
a stringent antiabortion bill was passed this year by the 
louisiana legislature but the governor vetoed it after the 
legislative session ended and legislators rejected a move for a 
special session 
a spokesman for pennsylvani state attorney general ernie preate 
jr said an appeal seeking to uphold the law here would be filed 
with the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
abortionrights activists said huyetts decision proved the law 
was unconstitutional and that the pennsylvania legislature was out 
of sync with voters 
we feel it was the best decision we could have gotten said 
jenny daughtry executive director of the national abortion rights 
action league it was a very sensible and courageous decision 
judge huyett saw through the antichoice rhetoric and spoke to the 
lives of real women harmed by the restrictions 
ms daughtry said her group is working to defeat antiabortion 
legislative candidates in the upcoming november election 
particularly rep stephen freind the legislatures chief abortion 
opponent 
contacted by the delaware county times at the new jersey shore 
freind said no doubt we are going to win in the supreme court 
im not the slightest bit discouraged everything is happening the 
way we thought it would happen 
rep karen ritter the states most vocal abortionrights 
legislator said she was pleased by the ruling but concerned that 
womens reproductive freedom could be threatened nationwide 
we are concerned that we may have problems keeping abortion 
safe and legal in the united states not just in pennsylvania 
she said 
howard fetterhoff executive director of the pennsylvania 
catholic conference said the decision could not be viewed as a 
significant setback because he predicted it would ultimately be 
reviewed by the us supreme court 
for those people who think abortion is a legitimate medical 
procedure the law does pose burdens but for those of us who 
believe unborn children are deserving of legal protection the 
law does as much as it can under present circumstances to protect 
the unborn child fetterhoff said

it was a night for sushi and tears as arts 
supporters rallied to denounce government censorship and plot a 
lawsuit against the national endowment for the arts for rejecting 
grants to a quartet of avantgarde theater performers 
two of the stage artists holly hughes of new york and tim 
miller of los angeles enlivened the fundraising party friday 
night with ribald monologues that heaped scorn on nea chairman john 
e frohnmayer and sen jesse helms rnc 
the mood of the party was dampened by word that frohnmayer had 
just denied the appeals of the four performers ms hughes 
miller karen finley of new york and john fleck of los angeles 
whose grants he had vetoed in late june 
ms hughes said frohnmayer was using the four rejected grantees 
as sacrificial lambs to appease helms and other conservative 
members of congress who oppose federal support for works they 
regard as obscene and sacrilegious 
ms finley whose performances sometimes include smearing her 
body with chocolate and filling her bra with gelatin didnt make 
the party but she issued a statement in new york charging that 
frohnmayers decision amounted to government censorship of the arts 
this only underscores that we are being punished for the 
controversial content of our work she said the government 
wants art to be propaganda for the state and were not willing to 
do that 
the nonprofit center for constitutional rights of new york said 
the nea had disclosed frohnmayers decision in letters received 
friday as in its initial denial letters the nea gives no 
substantive reasons for the denials the center said 
the center said it would represent the four performers in a 
lawsuit in federal court charging that frohnmayers decision was 
based on political rather than aesthetic grounds and violates their 
first amendment freespeech rights 
last october after criticism of nea support for exhibitions of 
controversial images by photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist 
andres serrano congress voted to prohibit the arts endowment from 
using federal funds to support works that may be deemed obscene 
frohnmayer warned a meeting of arts professionals in seattle in 
late june that political realities might force him to veto some 
grants recommended by nea review panels 
two days later on june 29 he rejected panelapproved grants 
for ms finley ms hughes miller and fleck 
at fridays party about 200 people used chopsticks to munch on 
sushi and spring rolls as charlotte murphy executive director of 
the nonprofit national association of artists organizations 
tearfully told the gathering that her group would press the fight 
against censorship especially censorship based on politics racism 
and homophobia 
public performances by such solo performance artists as the 
four rejected nea grantees frequently include monologues or songs 
with explicit sexual content that deal with politics racial

six years ago andrew dice clay was 
banished from the las vegas strip after one performance because his 
act was too raunchy 
but the diceman returneth clay had three sellout shows at 
ballys resort last week and if dice fans were fearful of him 
cleaning up his act they need not have worried 
one woman in the front row became a target for the evening of 
sexually explicit shots by the comedian as he graphically described 
his sexual appetite and questioned hers 
clay said he considers himself greatest comic that ever 
lived 
ive created something so unique so special people are just 
going crazy for it clay said im going to be around for a 
long time 
he wasnt so confident six years ago when he was bounced from 
the lineup at the comedy store at the dunes hotel across the strip 
from ballys because of his foul language 
he vowed he would be back and would someday see his name on the 
marquee of one of the strips glitzy resorts he realized that goal 
when he returned thursday 
i figured the town just wasnt ready yet he said of his 
first experience with las vegas 
when it comes to dallas however clay apparently feels that 
city isnt ready for him he canceled his dallas concert because 
hes afraid of violating texas strict antiobscenity law his 
publicist said friday 
michael levine said clay canceled the show scheduled for 
sunday because we feared the possibility that dice might be 
subject to arrest embarrassment and subsequently jailed

a conservation swat team has returned from 
an unexplored bolivian forest with plants unknown to science tales 
of spectacular animals and a case of bubonic plague 
the teams trip to northern la paz province bolivia was the 
first test of a method for surveying wilderness areas to determine 
whether they are deserving of protection or further study said 
russell mittermeier president of conservation international in 
washington dc which devised the method 
the monthlong trip by four american field biologists and three 
of their counterparts in bolivia revealed an area with one of the 
richest collections of plants and animals on earth 
its really confirming that the region may be as diverse as 
the manu national park in peru which is known to be the richest 
protected area on earth in terms of biological diversity 
mittermeier said 
the swat team known more properly as a rap team for rapid 
assessment program found 403 species of birds and 45 species of 
mammals including three not previously known to exist in bolivia 
they were the spiny tree rat the bigeared bat and the shorteared 
dog 
for me the most exciting thing was the sighting of this 
shorteared dog said mittermeier it was spotted by louise h 
emmons of the smithsonians national museum of natural history 
its an extremely poorly known animal she actually got a look 
at one with a frog in its mouth that was the first observation 
ever of the animal feeding in the wild mittermeier said 
emmons also found something she wasnt looking for fleas 
carrying bubonic plague the black death of the middle ages 
she came back and got sick and they said youve got the 
plague mittermeier said they cured it but she was out of it 
for a few weeks 
the team also came back with hundreds of plant specimens which 
they are now studying some of them are likely to be new to 
science the team said in its report 
the rap team was led by theodore a parker iii of conservation 
international and louisiana state university who is able to 
identify tropical birds from their songs 
he concluded that the forest in la paz may contain as many as 
1000 species of birds or 11 percent of all the species on earth 
as a result of the rap teams findings the idea is to 
recommend some sort of protection for the area said mittermeier 
the development of the rap teams is part of conservation 
internationals effort to rapidly assess and protect what it calls 
the worlds most important conservation hot spots 
science can proceed at a glacial pace but forest destruction 
is spreading like wildfire mittermeier said the rap teams he 
said are cuttingedge biology that can put us one step ahead 
of deforestation

soviet authorities on saturday sought to reassure 
smokers that there will be enough tobacco soon following 
increasing public outrage over the worst cigarette shortage in 
decades 
staterun newspapers reported that a moscow factory had produced 
45 million cigarettes in the previous 24 hours the newspapers said 
a special command post was ensuring that the packs made it to 
tobacco kiosks instead of black marketeers and that authorities 
were cracking down on such speculators 
prime minister nikolai ryzhkov tried to calm the nations 
smokers estimated at 70 million out of a population of 285 milion 
on national television friday night by similarly pledging that 
more cigarettes both domestic and imported were on the way 
ryzhkov also dodged responsibility for the crisis saying that 
the shortage was not the fault of the central government but the 
leadership of the individual soviet republics he also blamed 
panicbuying by the public 
beneath a banner headline pleading government give us a 
smoke saturdays komsomolskaya pravda newspaper devoted its 
entire front page to the crisis chronicling the various tobacco 
rebellions around the soviet union since july and reporting that 
an american pack of marlboros would bring up to 32 on the black 
market in moscow 
the actions underscored how seriously national and local 
authorities are taking the summerlong cigarette shortage 
especially after an upsurge in street demonstrations by angry 
smokers in moscow and leningrad 
on wednesday scores of people blocked a street next to the 
kremlin the seat of soviet power until a nearby tobacco kiosk was 
restocked 
the newspaper moskovskaya pravda reported that muscovites will 
be getting ration coupons for tobacco products as a temporary 
twoto threemonth measure to combat hoarding and black market 
speculation 
the newspaper also said one black marketeer killed a buyer over 
a pack of cigarettes in moscow but it provided no details 
komsomolskaya pravda said that in the central siberian city of 
barnaul one brand of soviet cigarettes was being sold for 7 rubles 
1120 on the black market soviet cigarettes usually sell for 
about 45 kopecks about 80 cents per pack 
the java cigarette factory the main one in moscow turned out 
45 million cigarettes since friday and a freight car full of 
cigarettes from bulgaria arrived saturday the communist party 
newspaper pravda reported 
we are trying for the most rational distribution pravda 
quoted moscow city council member a bobkov as saying were 
sending the bulk of the supply directly to workplaces and 
residential areas 
in addition he said the city council has a special duty car 
to deliver a load of cigarettes to any hot spot pravda 
reported 
police arrested one cigarette delivery truck driver who made an 
unscheduled stop and was selling five cases of cigarettes at higher 
prices the newspaper said he was turned in to police by the 
distributor who was to have been the legitimate recipient of the 
cigarettes 
pravda said a criminal case was opened against a store owner who 
had stashed about 16000 packs of cigarettes under the counter for 
resale at higher prices 
in an interview with pravda l sinelnikov director of the java 
factory disputed the central governments disclaimer of 
responsibility for cigarette production 
he said half of his plants equipment is obsolete and more than 
20 years old when he informed communist central planners he said 
he was told the problem was not serious and that the soviet people 
should cut down on their heavy smoking anyway because it is a 
health hazard 
in one corner of its front page komsomolskaya pravda provided a 
4by4inch blank spot to be cut out and used by its readers to 
roll their own cigarettes out of the loose coarse tobacco that is 
being sold at some cigarette shops in the absense of proper paper 
and filters 
printed beneath the blank spot was a sardonic proviso 
typographic ink is hazardous to your health smoke only in the 
appointed place

correction officers at rikers island call the 
3to11 shift at the nations most populous jail the war tour 
and they say the prisoners hold every advantage in numbers 
weapons and rules 
two weeks ago about 600 guards tried to change the rules for 
two days they blockaded the lone bridge to the island turning back 
food medical supplies and even the corrections commissioner they 
relented only after city officials agreed to ease restrictions on 
use of force against inmates 
every day rikers is a slowly brewing riot said robert 
gangi director of the correctional association a private research 
group that studies the jail usually its the inmates who blow 
up but here it was the cos who blew by erecting the blockade 
ive never heard of anything like it 
the night the blockade ended inmates in one unit rioted and 
guards who quelled the rebellion allegedly lined up prisoners and 
systematically beat them with nightsticks 
we control the jails not you guards were said to have 
shouted 
when it was over the injured included 142 inmates and 20 guards 
also hurt during that tense two days were eight emergency 
medical technicians the victims of attacks by guards at the 
blockade 
a second major incident occurred this past week after an inmate 
was stabbed by an unknown assailant tuesday night a group of 
inmates refused to return to their cells and began setting fires 
by the time order was restored 25 guards and four inmates had 
suffered minor injuries mostly smoke inhalation 
although the blockade seemed to bring the jail to the edge of 
chaos a union spokesman said it was a symptom not a cause of 
rikers malaise 
the officers had come to the conclusion they were in danger 
said jim grossman they simply didnt feel safe anymore 
many never felt safe at a jail where the population doubled to 
14000 in 10 years where prisoners routinely carry knives and 
homemade weapons where theres an average of a stabbing a day 
each month for the past year and a half the citys jail system 
has set a new record for violent incidents 
officers who directly supervise prisoners meanwhile carry no 
weapons 
we dont scare anyone anymore says phil seelig president 
of the officers union 
the penal complex occupies 440 acres on a chunk of land in the 
east river it houses all sorts of inmates men and women 
juveniles and adults the convicted and the accused the celebrated 
and the unknown 
always a violent crowded place rikers in recent years has been 
flooded by an influx of drug outlaws many of whom form gangs 
within the jail increasingly the balance between order and 
anarchy has been determined by the prisoners themselves 
confronted with an exploding jail population the city opted for 
relatively inexpensive and easily constructed open dormitories 
rather than conventional concrete and steel cell blocks each dorm 
accommodates about 50 inmates 
in an interview published in saturdays editions of the new york 
times allyn r sielaff who took over the citys jail system in 
march criticized previous administrations for what he sees as 
spending too much energy expanding the jails and not enough on 
programs to make it safer 
the dormitories were the quickest structures to put up and 
the cheapest he said but theyre the toughest structures to 
supervise 
he also said he intends to reverse conditions at rikers island 
in which guards are swiftly punished for the most minor infractions 
while inmates get put on a waiting list 
when an inmate stabs or slashes somebody when he attacks an 
officer one should expect he would be taken out of the general 
population sielaff said we had 500 stabbers and slashers 
mingling with the rest of the population 
but he also said that hiring standards for corrections officers 
have been too lax in recent years 
meanwhile a federal judge is considering a new set of rules on 
the use of force by jail guards 
the revised guidelines agreed to by the correction department 
and legal aid attorneys were submitted for approval friday to us 
district judge morris e lasker of manhattan lasker scheduled 
another hearing next week 
the legal aid society began the court proceeding after the city 
decided to replace a 27page directive on the use of force with a 
streamlined ninepage version as part of a settlement to a job 
action by guards at rikers island 
legal aid had complained that the ninepage guidelines went too 
far in relaxing restraints on guards 
the subsequent compromise list of rules said legal aid attorney 
john boston restores all the important restrictions while 
removing excess verbiage it is appropriate and serves everyones 
purpose 
but ernesto marrero a lawyer for the officers union objected 
to specific language in the new directive as unduly restrictive

a man who held a former business adviser hostage 
with a hunting rifle for three hours saying the mans advice had 
not paid off thought he would get to keep the 2000 he received 
as ransom police said 
after charles edward jordan accepted the cash from authorities 
he tossed it inside his house locked the door and surrendered 
ill be ready to go in a minute jordan reportedly told 
tactical officers who had their weapons leveled at him as he 
secured his house friday in the south oak cliff section of dallas 
his hostage bruce henry humphrey of suburban carrollton was 
released unharmed 
jordan knew he was going to jail but he thought he got to 
keep the 2000 said cpl joey fox police later retrieved the 
money 
jordan was charged with aggravated kidnapping and was jailed on 
25000 bail saturday 
the hostages wife fay humphrey said that jordan using 
another name had called her husband repeatedly last week asking 
him to come to the house mrs humphrey said she and her husband 
work for a company that helps people prepare business plans to 
present to banks for financing 
in 1988 humphrey prepared a business plan for jordan charging 
him 2000 jordan used the plan but failed to find financing 
the fee for producing the plan was nonrefundable police said 
jordan felt he had been wronged in a loan approval several 
years ago and since then several other things had gone wrong in his 
life like a divorce and some other failed business deals fox 
said i guess he thought that at minimum he could get his 2000 
back 
police didnt know what kind of business jordan had planned to 
open 
jordan told mrs humphrey that he wanted 2000 in return for 
her husbands release she went to a nearby bank branch to call 
police the bank later provided the money that led to jordans 
release 
he said i wouldnt live to see anything but the inside of his 
house if he didnt get 2000 humphrey said afterward i tried

the allwhite selma country club has reversed 
itself and extended membership to a japanese businessman barred 
last month amid lingering ill feelings about world war ii 
hiroshi isogai manager of the honda alllock manufacturing co 
plant in selma was accepted into the club friday following a vote 
by its board of directors earlier in the week 
the board action overturned an earlier vote by the general 
membership which rejected isogais application to join the golf 
club some members blamed the first vote on resentment dating back 
to japans 1941 attack on pearl harbor 
city council president carl morgan a member of the club 
saluted directors for their decision 
i guess there still are people out there who are fighting 
world war ii said morgan who served in the army in europe 
during the war as for me i wouldnt blackball a german 
telephone calls to isogais home and office went unanswered 
saturday 
isogai 55 was 10 years old when world war ii ended in an 
interview after his initial rejection isogai said he just wanted 
to play golf at the club 
i dont want to say much about this he said 
shortly after the initial vote a club member who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said isogai drew between 15 and 20 
blackballs against him being admitted to the club five no votes 
are enough to bar membership 
one of the clubs director charles pollack declined to discuss 
the boards action 
we made a pact not to say anything because we felt the whole 
thing had been blown out of proportion said pollack 
president donnie russell said the club has no exclusionary 
policies toward any minorities either written or verbal he 
refused to say whether any blacks had ever applied for membership 
morgan said although the club has no black members i imagine 
that issue will be coming next 
the issue of isogais membership surfaced about the time the pga 
championship became embroiled in controversy over the allwhite 
membership at birminghams shoal creek country club following 
protests and threats of pickets during the tournament the club 
accepted a black insurance executive as an honorary member

investigators of a private plane crash that 
killed three men have ruled out tainted fuel weather and 
structural failure and believe it will be months before the 
accidents cause is determined 
weve taken fuel samples and they are fine warren v 
wandell chief air safety investigator for the national 
transportation safety board said friday structural and weather 
problems had been ruled out earlier 
three men in the cockpit of the gulfstream g159 that crashed 
thursday including the pilot and copilot were killed 12 
passengers were injured 
the crash was the second worst at the houston intercontinental 
airport five people were killed on feb 14 1980 when a 
mitsubishi mu2 twinengine crashed 
on saturday crews continued documenting the wreckage and 
prepared to move it to a hangar for a detailed analysis 
the plane owned by a subsidiary of houstonbased rowan drilling 
co was ferrying to new orleans a group of offshore oil workers 
who had completed a regular twoweek tour in the north sea 
obviously we wont know what caused this accident for 
months wandell said based on initial witness statements from

there was a loss of control shortly after liftoff 
it appeared the plane got 30 to 50 feet off the ground then 
veered suddenly to the left wandell said its left wing tip 
touched the ground crumpling the entire wing 
then the propellers came off and the rest of the aircraft 
slammed to the earth scattering wreckage for about 150 yards he

actor nicholas kadi who played an arab 
terrorist in the film navy seals knows the tumultuous middle 
east first hand 
his father nizar elkadi served 22 years as an iraqi 
ambassador and in other diplomatic posts in india turkey lebanon 
belgium and the united nations 
my first christmas tree was a palm tree my mother cut off the 
top of a tree in baghdad said kadi who was born nameer elkadi 
in istanbul turkey 
not all his memories of baghdad are fond ones at night the 
family slept on the roof to escape the 120degree heat 
when i was about 5 years old there was a communist printing 
press discovered across the roof from us about five oclock in the 
morning i looked over and they were shooting this family right in 
front of us 
kadi 37 has little sympathy for the current iraqi leader 
saddam hussein 
the man is regarded as a robin hood in iraq for myself i 
just put the emphasis on hood he said i think president 
bush is doing the right thing 
kadi now is an american citizen and lives in the los angeles 
area with his scottishborn wife and 3monthold daughter 
his navy seals role of ben shaheed was based on an actual 
member of the hezbollah terrorist group 
i was very pleased to finally play a smart terrorist he 
said in a telephone interview he had them really running around 
those seals 
however kadi faults hollywood for failing to flesh out such 
characters and explain what led them to terrorism 
to show the very stereotypical madman arab is a little 
unfair i sometimes speak to producers about that he said 
for navy seals kadi spent two months filming in spain 
we had to shoot in the armpits of spain because it was 
supposed to be burntout beirut he said there were a lot of 
drug addicts there theyd have to clear the set of hypodermic 
needles before we went out to shoot 
fluent in arabic and french he has played a variety of other 
roles including a caveman in the film quest for fire and a 
crossdressing gay viennese soldier in the play a patriot for

afghan president najibullah returned 
to kabul on saturday hours after rockets slammed into the capital 
city killing nine people and wounding 15 
no one claimed responsibility for the attack but a kabul radio 
broadcast blamed rebel fighters headquartered in pakistan the 
radio was monitored in islamabad 
najibullahs sudden departure for moscow on july 29 generated 
speculation that the united states and the soviet union were 
hammering out a settlement to the 12yearold civil war however 
spokesmen for the superpowers have reported only that the two 
nations were closing the gap with no deal agreed 
more than 15 million people have been killed in the war between 
usbacked rebels and najibullahs communiststyle government 
until february 1989 afghan guerrillas were battling more than 
115000 soviet troops who intervened militarily nine years earlier 
to help fight an islamic insurgency and install a government 
friendly to moscow 
the kremlin withdrew its soldiers in line with a unnegotiated 
agreement but sends about 300 million worth of military and 
humanitarian aid to kabul monthly the united states delivers an 
estimated 300 million worth of military supplies to its rebel 
allies annually 
najibullah left for moscow reportedly for medical treatment 
only three days before soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
and us secretary of state james a baker iii met in the siberian 
city of irkutsk 
no details of najibullahs medical treatment have ever been 
given shevardnadze told reporters in irkutsk that najibullah was 
on vacation with his family in the soviet union only adding to the 
speculation 
the two sides ended their meetings in siberia saying they were 
close to a deal on afghanistan but nothing was settled

yemen said saturday it was fully 
committed to honoring un economic sanctions on iraq and denied 
reports that iraqi warplanes are based in that red sea country 
yemens information minister mohammed ahmed garhoum also 
denied reports that yemen let iraq fly food and medical supplies 
out of the country or broke any provision of the un embargo 
against iraq 
authorities in yemen also said they ordered a british diplomat 
expelled after they caught him friday taking pictures of military 
activities and port facilities in aden where britain argued yemen 
had violated un sanctions against iraq 
the british foreign office confirmed that consul general doug 
gordon had been given 48 hours to leave yemen 
diplomatic sources in the persian gulf region speaking on 
condition of anonymity said iraq flew 12 captured kuwaiti jet 
fighters to sana the yemeni capital and that before invading 
kuwait on aug 2 it based 36 sovietmade iraqi jet fighters at 
taez 120 miles south of sana 
they said saturday all the planes are still there 
garhoum said in a telephone interview that there is no basis 
whatsoever to reports that yemen is a base for iraqi warplanes 
there are absolutely no iraqi warplanes and no iraqi forces on 
any part of yemeni soil he said 
iraqs official news agency also denied that iraqi warplanes had 
been sent to either yemen or sudan as some other news reports 
indicated 
garhoum added yemens stand is very clear we are committed 
to all aspects of the embargo he said however that yemen 
will not impede international navigation by challenging ships 
the statement was yemens most forceful declaration yet it would 
abide by the un sanctions on iraq 
yemen and cuba abstained from a 130 security council vote 
saturday authorizing use of military force to enforce the embargo 
the minister denied reports circulating among diplomats in sana 
that yemen allowed iraq to fly shipments of food and medicine out 
of the country 
he said iraq has not requested any shipments of food or 
medicine but left open the possibility of such shipments in the 
future he said terms of the un embargo provide for exempting 
food and medicines when necessary 
in response to a charge by british foreign secretary douglas 
hurd garhoum confirmed that the 35388ton iraqi tanker ain zalah 
unloaded part of its cargo of crude oil at the refinery in aden 
this week but he said that was before yemen announced its decision

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki led a 
tribute to solidaritys 10th anniversary saturday filled with 
nostalgia for the days when the movement united workers and 
intellectuals 
ten years ago the alliance between workers and intellectuals 
was so strong these values cannot be wasted said 
mazowiecki marking the start of his second year as the east blocs 
first noncommunist prime minister 
the solidarity movement that led the democratic upheaval in 
eastern europe begins its second decade deeply divided the split 
is between workers backing the trade union and leader lech walesa 
on the one hand and intellectuals surrounding mazowiecki and the 
warsaw government on the other 
the two camps have been observing the anniversary separately 
the events began aug 15 in gdansk where walesa led a 
commemoration of the shipyard strike that spawned the movement 
walesa did not attend saturdays forum at warsaw university but 
sent a warmly received letter that began thank you for those 10 
years 
we won because we were united but today there is no 
need to hide that we dont agree on everything he wrote 
mazowiecki is expected to go to gdansk on aug 30 to meet with 
shipyard workers and join walesa in celebrating the accords 
solidarity signed with communist authorities to create the first 
free trade union in the soviet bloc 
it was during those negotiations that mazowiecki then a 
catholic journalist brought a letter to walesa expressing the 
support of intellectuals in warsaw and krakow for the workers 
movement being born on the baltic coast 
the united front formed by the two forces joined by farmers is 
given significant credit for solidaritys ability to survive 
martial law and eight years underground before toppling the 
communists last year 
historian bronislaw geremek chief of the solidaritybased 
parliament caucus joined mazowiecki in early support for 
solidarity 
on saturday he recalled walesa receiving the intellectuals 
letter and then asking but can you help us 
the fact that striking workers accepted this alliance 
began from the simplest things apples brought by farmers the 
presence of intellectuals on both sides of the shipyard fence 
geremek said 
although the dissolution of solidaritys united front has been a 
painful development participants suggest it is the start of a 
multiparty political system that must emerge after four decades of 
communist party rule 
calling solidarity a strong partner mazowiecki said 
today we are divided it is what democracy is about 
with all our differences we will be all responsible for this 
historic moment

iraqi authorities stepped up pressure on 
foreign diplomatic missions in occupied kuwait on saturday cutting 
off water power and telephone service and deploying heavily armed 
troops nearby 
but there was apparently no effort to remove diplomats by force 
according to reports reaching foreign ministries of the countries 
involved in washington iraqs ambasador said we are not going 
to use force against the us embassy in kuwait 
we havent touched any embassy there the iraqi diplomat 
said at an impromptu news conference at the state department 
however baghdad warned its own citizens that hiding foreigners 
would be considered an act of espionage punishable by death 
iraqi officials had already issued harsh warnings against harboring 
foreigners 
the iraqi ambassador to washington sadiq almashat also said 
saturday that american diplomats who earlier left kuwait for 
baghdad would be treated just like anybody else in other 
words that they no longer had diplomtic immunity but he said 
their dependents would be allowed to leave iraq 
about 100 us diplomats and dependents had fled kuwait for iraq 
late thursday arriving in a 33car caravan after more than 19 
hours on the road 
according to the bush administration their safe passage out of 
the area was assured by iraq but while they were en route iraq 
imposed what it said were new regulations prohibiting the departure 
of diplomats whose embassies had not shut down as ordered by 
saddam this left the diplomats and their families stranded at the 
us embassy in the iraqi capital 
brent scowcroft bushs national security adviser said 
negotiations were under way in baghdad to permit the departure of 
the diplomats and dependents 
meanwhile the official iraqi news agency reported that hundreds 
of iraqi children marched to the us embassy in baghdad on 
saturday carrying signs complaining that the international trade 
embargo against iraq is depriving them of milk the protest likely 
had official sanction 
the iraqi government has threatened to deprive western children 
stranded in iraq and kuwait of food and medicine if supplies are 
cut for iraqi children 
the united states canada japan bangladesh switzerland 
austria poland czechoslovakia yugoslavia and the 12 european 
community nations were among those who announced they would remain 
in kuwait defying an iraqi order to shut down 
in london the no 2 man at the foreign office william 
waldegrave said more than 30 embassies were still functioning in 
kuwait he said electric power at the british embassy had been cut 
off again after being restored earlier in the day 
similar reports were received in paris rome vienna oslo and 
tokyo although the numbers of soldiers outside the compounds 
varied the troops patrolling outside some of the embassies were 
armed with machine guns and mortars the reports said 
the us ambassador in kuwait nathaniel howell and about 10 
other americans stayed at the american compound 
iraqi troops appeared outside the us embassy in kuwait city on 
thursday night and according to us officials have blocked entry 
and exit since 
electricity and water were cut off saturday but iraqi troops 
around the diplomatic mission have not attempted to close it us 
officials said they said the embassy was operating on generator 
power 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said the administration had 
expressed its objections through diplomatic channels in baghdad 
kuwait and washington 
the embassy continues to function it is carrying out its 
consular functions said popadiuk in maine with the vacationing 
bush 
the voice of america radio advised the 2500 americans trapped 
in kuwait not to go near the embassy while the soldiers remained 
a state department broadcast on voa said the embassy was 
determined to continue working for your release from kuwait and 
your safe return to your families 
in rome foreign ministry officials said soldiers began 
patrolling around the italian mission in the morning electricity 
went off in the early afternoon but the embassy was able to keep 
its lights on with a generator 
an italian foreign ministry official said the iraqis had damaged 
the wall around the french compound as they were working to cut off 
the water in paris the foreign ministry said it was trying to 
verify the report a halfdozen french embassy personnel remained 
in the mission 
the norwegian foreign ministry said power and water had been cut 
at its embassy 
iraq annexed kuwait after invading it on aug 2 officials in 
baghdad decreed that all embassies there must close on friday and 
said diplomats remaining in kuwait would lose their diplomatic 
immunity 
according to article 45 of the vienna convention on diplomatic 
relations foreign missions are to remain inviolable even in times 
of armed conflict 
many governments believed closing their missions could be 
interpreted as the first step toward recognition of iraqs claim of 
sovereignty over kuwait other governments including the soviet 
union said that they would remove their diplomats for reasons of 
security but that this was not implicit recognition of the claim 
in tokyo a foreign ministry official said water electricity 
and telephone lines to the japanese embassy were cut off saturday 
without notification 
there were no reports that soldiers had made any move to take 
control of the complex where two diplomats remained the diplomats 
were told on friday that their diplomatic immunity had been 
revoked however 
the greek mission and many others maintained skeleton staffs 
some including poland and spain had just one diplomat present

white house chief of staff john 
sununus managerial philosophy which will be on display this week 
in an unusual visit to moscow is what he calls the acorn theory 
of management 
he says he would rather deal with a couple of dozen problems 
when theyre acorns rather than one big problem when its become an 
oak tree 
in practice it means keeping his door open and giving aides 
ample opportunity daily to contact him on even the most trivial 
matters 
sununu isnt trying to graft his own style onto the kremlin and 
in fact is hoping to learn as much as he imparts on his fiveday 
visit with soviet president mikhail gorbachev and company 
im a great believer that whenever you talk shop with 
somebody you can learn he said in an interview last week with 
the associated press were going over to the soviet union as 
much to take a look at what they have and learn as much as we can 
sununu and a phalanx of top white house staff were departing for 
moscow sunday night from andrews air force base in maryland they 
will return to pease air force base in new hampshire on friday 
sununus trip actually is a return visit with the soviet 
efficiency experts who got a backstage view of how the white house 
works following the bushgorbachev summit in june 
the soviet team led by gorbachev aide mikhail shkabardnya like 
sununu an engineer by training knew just what they wanted to talk 
about such as how president bushs scheduling works how the white 
house interacts with congress how the administration separates 
responsibilities between domestic policy and national security 
policy 
they were smart enough to understand that the needs of their 
new presidency were very distinct from the more autocratic 
ruling structure that they had before sununu said 
sununu a staunch conservative confided that if hed been told 
five or six months ago hed be consulting for the kremlin i 
wouldnt have believed it 
its a tribute to the president to mr gorbachev and what 
theyve done with the ussoviet relationship sununu said 
it trip also marks the latest chapter in sununus own success 
story which came as a surprise to washington insiders who 
predicted the strongwilled engineer would be outmatched by the 
demands of running the white house 
brookings institution scholar stephen hess calls sununu the 
big surprise of the bush administration 
he has kept the white house staff efficient and importantly 
anonymous his relations with congress are a little rocky 
from time to time but its an opposition congress said hess 
how has sununu done it 
in part by working marathon hours maintaining an opendoor 
policy and despite a reputation for ideological rigidity 
displaying an ability to cut deals even with liberals such as sen 
edward kennedy dmass 
sununu a massachusetts institute of technology graduate and 
former governor of new hampshire brought formidable intellectual 
skills to the job bush in a toast at a state dinner may 15 for 
the president of tunisia noted that his guest kept track of his 
cabinet on a home computer 
your home computer is called an apple mine is called john 
sununu bush quipped

cranes used for unloading cargo hang 
motionless against the blue sky and the constant roar of trailer 
trucks to and from the port has stopped 
jordans only port and by extension iraqs red sea gateway 
has been brought to a near standstill by the un sanctions imposed 
on iraq after its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
jordanian economists say the embargo could eventually have a 
devastating effect on the countrys fragile economy by boosting 
unemployment shrinking the economy and drastically cutting foreign 
exchange 
on saturday the un security council endorsed the use of force 
to back up the sanctions 
it is a major blow to the jordanian economy fahad fanek a 
leading economist and publisher of the jordanian economic monitor 
said of the un embargo 
king hussein has said he intends to comply with the sanctions 
but jordans economic dependence on its powerful neighbor to the 
east coupled with the countrys grassroots support for iraqi 
president saddam hussein make it difficult for the beleaguered 
king to comply 
fanek estimates that longterm compliance with the sanctions 
could cut the kingdoms gross domestic product which he estimated 
at 4 to 5 billion a year in half 
jordan will suffer more than iraq if jordan is forced to 
comply he said 
the most significant loss would be in exports he said since 
they account for 50 percent of the gross domestic product more 
than half of jordans labor force works in that sector 
before the invasion iraq was the destination for 23 percent of 
those exports while another 5 percent went to kuwait 
that means we will sacrifice about 14 percent of the economy 
through export losses he said 
related losses would come in the transportation sector until 
recently driven by a steady stream of trailer truck traffic plying 
the 1120 miles between aqaba and baghdad along a narrow desert 
highway 
losses in the export and transit sectors would translate into a 
doubling of the current 20 percent unemployment rate fanek said 
the hundreds of longhaul trucks parked idle along the highway 
leading into aqaba bore witness to the pinch already being felt 
drivers lay on the pavement under their trucks to escape the sun 
which reaches 113 degrees in august 
the economist said jordan was likely to lose annual development 
grants totaling 185 million which it received from iraq and kuwait 
also lost was the ability to buy iraqi oil for 16 a barrel 
instead of at world prices now over 31 a barrel to compensate 
jordan for its exports iraq supplies 90 percent of jordans oil 
having to buy oil on the world market could cost jordan up to 
400 million a year in scarce foreign exchange fanek said 
wages sent home from the approximately 100000 jordanian workers 
in kuwait which amounted to 300 million a year were another 
major source of foreign exchange for the country 
fanek predicted potential losses of 15 billion to 2 billion a 
year for jordan which already has an 84 billion foreign debt 
major development costs and no ready source of revenue like its 
oilrich neighbors

veterans from the unit that dropped the 
atom bombs met saturday to dedicate a peace memorial but the 
gatherings tone was marred when a japanese journalist was 
scratched off the speaker list for saying the bombings werent 
necessary 
a planned rendition of the japanese national anthem also was 
removed from saturdays program 
the memorial was dedicated to the 2000 members of the 509th 
composite group and the nearly 200000 people who died in the 
atomic blasts at hiroshima and nagasaki 
the dedication was held in conjunction with the 509ths 45th 
reunion and about 400 people gathered at the monument adjacent to 
the wendover visitors center 
veterans said they believe peace was bought with the lives 
claimed by the bombings a chaplain gave thanks for the bomb 
we thank thee god for the atom bomb through which peace came 
to our world said the rev william b downey in dedicating the 
16foot granite obelisk topped with a brass model of the enola 
gay the b29 that dropped the bomb on hiroshima 
lord keep that peace downey said 
the 509th trained at the nowabandoned wendover air base in 
nearby utah in 194445 a few hundred yards from where the memorial 
was dedicated 
group organizers had invited hideaki kase a conservative 
japanese author and advisor to two prime ministers to speak of the 
significance of the event 
kase is a controversial figure in japan because he has advocated 
bolstering the military and rewriting the japanese constitution 
drawn up under us auspices after world war ii to allow japan to 
send its troops overseas 
friday night kase said japan was ready to capitulate before the 
bombs were dropped making the destruction of the two cities 
unnecessary during kases presentation dozens of veterans and 
their wives walked out and sang god bless america in the 
hallway 
christopher turoff 69 a bombardier in the group was one who 
stayed 
i couldnt believe it he said later he seemed to blame 
the whole war on us 
kase who traveled to wendover from tokyo said he was unclear 
what portion of his speech offended his guests 
what i talked about was that japan was ready to give up the 
war in early august kase said that in retrospect the two 
atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki were not necessary 
james corliss 69 who was flight engineer on one of the chase 
planes on the aug 6 1945 hiroshima raid said he was 
disgusted with kases rendition of history 
he said we shouldnt have bombed at all corliss said he 
said we started the war 
fearing a walkout at the dedication ceremony if kase were 
allowed to talk reunion organizer george marquardt told the 
conductor of the army band not to play the japanese national anthem 
and passed over kase on the program 
i feel awful about it said marquardt a 70yearold retired 
major who now lives in murray utah but this is the 509ths 
reunion i couldnt have them walking out 
there would have been a riot said corliss 
kase said he was not offended by the lastminute decision to cut 
him out of the program 
i am a guest here he said you will have to ask them what 
i said that was offensive 
in an interview from tokyo in the weeks before the event kase 
said the bombings had been necessary because their demonstration of 
power had prevented a major war since 
retired gen paul w tibbets jr commander of the 509th and 
pilot of the enola gay which dropped the bomb on hiroshima 
unveiled the memorial along with marquardt and retired gen charles 
sweeney who piloted the bomber on the nagasaki raid 
under tibbetts command the 509th practiced highaltitude 
precision bombing flying long trips to californias salton sea 
bombing range and the caribbean sea to simulate long overwater 
navigation 
only tibbetts knew the groups true mission and he demanded 
unquestioning loyalty from those who didnt all he told them was 
that their efforts might save thousands of american lives and bring 
the war to an early end

what elvis presley would have weighed in 
outer space may be a useful theme with which to approach potential 
mates in bars but the keepers of graceland dont find it funny 
its really kind of tasteless said todd morgan a spokesman 
for graceland the singers former home we have a lot more 
important things to worry about than how much elvis would weigh on 
other planets 
the elvis on other planets weight chart was printed in 
several publications recently marking the 13th anniversary of the 
singers death 
chris mojo 30 of mojos guitar shop in new york city said he 
used to have the chart printed on the back of his business cards 
he said he borrowed the idea from the business cards of billy 
gibbons lead singer of the rock group zz top 
for some reason people all over the country got copies of 
them mojo said everybody told me that it was the best opening 
line for picking up girls ever like do you know how much elvis 
would weigh on pluto 
presley weighed 255 pounds when he died aug 16 1977 
according to the chart that equals about 7140 pounds on the 
sun 97 pounds on mercury and mars 232 pounds on venus 43 on the 
moon 648 on jupiter 275 on saturn 232 on uranus 303 on neptune 
and 13 pounds on pluto 
the weights vary in relation to the planets surface gravity 
relative to earths 
james emerson zz tops general crew master said the cards are 
very popular although a few fans were offended 
he quoted one memphis woman as saying i see youve very 
conveniently left off what hes weighing in heaven

near the saudiiraqi border ap the thousands of arab 
soldiers camped in the desert are training with tanks 
antiaircraft weapons and gas masks for possible battle with iraq 
saudi military officials said saturday 
for the first time since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 the 
saudi government escorted reporters to the border area to see 
saudi egyptian and moroccan troops in the field 
military officials said syrians and troops from other persian 
gulf countries are also deployed in the joint arab command but 
reporters were not taken to their outposts 
they are on alert to either move forward stay or pull back 
here to prepare to defend the border said a major general who 
commands a joint saudigulf cooperation council force of more than 
10000 men 
the cooperation council defense ministers have agreed to 
reinforce their rapid deployment force in saudi arabia up to 
10000 troops from six cooperation council states have been based 
at the northeastern saudi base of hafr al batin for the past two 
years 
the joint arab force is significant because it is the first time 
soldiers have united against another arab country iraq 
i am defending the saudi arabian territory regardless of who 
the offender is because it is a holy land said an egyptian 
colonel saudi arabia is home to islams holiest shrines at mecca 
and medina 
the egyptian said he was taking orders from the saudis 
saudi troops make up the front line of defense while forces 
from other nations are further back americans are not in the same 
area military officials said 
saudi officials escorted journalists to within 18 miles of the 
border on condition they not reveal exact locations or the 
commanders full names 
the major general said arab troops were about 36 miles from the 
closest iraqi troops but they hadnt spotted any movements 
the iraqis are in a defensive posture the general in charge 
of the arab force said 
the headquarters are a clump of tents and vehicles in the desert 
shimmering with heat other units each of which is responsible for 
protecting a section of the border dot the area their clusters 
difficult to distinguish from mirages 
several tanks primarily frenchmade mx30s were visible 
although their silouettes were concealed by sands 
saudi military officials said they had thousands of tanks and 
were pleased with their performance the iraqis are believed to 
have between 800 and 1000 tanks in kuwait 
were iraqi tanks to roll across the border a massive tank force 
would be needed to stop them said a saudi lieutenant colonel who 
is a battalion commander 
air power can destroy tanks but they cant stop them he 
said his battalion of 368 people has an air defense platoon 
attached to it 
we consider our tank one of the best tanks he said good 
firepower good for our environment and it can carry people 
our morale is high the lieutenant colonel said if 
attacked we will keep fighting until victory or martyrdom 
the troops also have antiaircraft equipment including tow 
missiles 
the saudis and cooperation council countries have infantry 
artillery air and tank divisions the egyptians 2000 men 
wearing a different style of camouflage uniform and driving smaller 
jeeps are an elite commando unit known as saiqa the arabic for 
lightning 
the moroccan infantry unit seemed less wellequipped the men 
were unarmed and some wore teeshirts fatigues and sandles 
instead of uniforms 
compared to american units the saudis camp seemed more 
homelike the main tent at each camp was covered with a nylon 
persian rug 
instead of packaged meals the men ate a rice and lamb stew and 
grapes for lunch 
many of the men are stationed permanently in the area so they 
can call their families or go home for a fourhour day leave 
the men also have less trouble adjusting to the heat than do the 
americans because they are accustomed to the temperatures 
i told you logistics were not a problem here said one 
saudi pepsi here kleenex here cigarettes here

looking a little like a 
highrise construction project three tall trees stand surrounded 
by scaffolding in sequoia national park in an experiment to gauge 
ozone damage to the giants 
smog from the san joaquin valley in central california is 
increasingly wafting into the air around the sequoias of the 
southern sierra nevada 
earlier research has shown that ozone damages seedlings 1 and 
2yearsold the current project is aimed at finding ozones 
effects on mature trees damaging ozone results when nitrogen 
oxides and hydrocarbons components of smog react in sunlight 
the problem we have here in the park is mainly ozone ranger 
diane m ewell an air quality specialist said friday we dont 
have the air problems cities do such as carbon monoxide you need 
great concentrations of carbon monoxide to exceed health 
standards 
the current research began in june about a mile north of giant 
forest village and 150 miles northeast of los angeles when 
researchers rigged 106foothigh scaffolding beside three 
200yearold 165foot tall trees 
four clear cellophane cylinders about 2 feet in diameter and 
four feet long were placed over separate boughs on each tree a 
length of 10inch foilwrapped ducting brings in air mixed with 
specific levels of ozone 
one set of chambers contains half the level of ozone considered 
normal or ambient the second has normal levels the third double 
that amount and the fourth triple 
ewell said the scaffolding would be removed in late september 
because it would be unable to handle the weight of the winters 
snow 
expected federal budget cuts make the projects future uncertain 
currently it is funded by about 82000 from the national park 
service and about half that amount from the us forest service 
said head researcher nancy e grulke from the forest service 
forest fire laboratory in riverside 
this summers statistics will be analyzed by the end of the 
year she said

a newsweek poll released saturday found 80 
percent of americans oppose quick military action against iraq 
preferring instead to wait to see if economic and diplomatic 
sanctions are effective 
the poll conducted on thursday and friday also found growing 
support for a covert assassination of iraqi president saddam 
hussein as a way of quickly ending the crisis 
in the new poll 43 percent said they would support an 
assassination 49 percent opposed it and 9 percent didnt know in 
a newsweek poll two weeks ago 34 percent supported a covert 
assassination 
federal law prohibits american involvement in the assassination 
of foreign leaders 
more than two thirds 68 percent of respondents said 
president bush should pay more attention to a diplomatic solution 
to the crisis which began aug 2 when iraq invaded kuwait 
but if fighting begins more than half 57 percent said bush 
should order attacks on iraqi positions even if saddam makes good 
on his threat to station us hostages as human shields only 26 
percent said bush should not attack under those conditions and 17 
percent didnt know 
bushs approval rating has not changed much from the newsweek 
poll two weeks ago 74 percent now compared with 75 percent in a 
poll done aug 9 and 10 
most americans 55 percent said bush was not spending too 
much time on vacation during the crisis compared with 38 percent 
who said he was and 7 percent who didnt know 
newsweek interviewed 767 people for the new poll which has a 
margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent

austrian president kurt waldheim left iraq 
after a brief visit with president saddam hussein on saturday 
taking with him more than 90 austrians stranded here since iraq 
invaded kuwait 
waldheim was the first western leader to meet facetoface with 
saddam since iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 the austrian 
leader was accompanied by his foreign minister alois mock and 
other austrian officials 
the special iraqi airways flight carrying waldheim and the 
austrian evacueess landed in amman jordan on saturday evening 
the austrian evacuees immediately boarded a plane for vienna and 
waldheim stayed behind in amman 
at ammans airport waldheim told reporters he still held out 
hope for a diplomatic settlement of the persian gulf crisis 
of course i cannot tell you what the outcome will be but the 
president saddam assured me that he continues to be interested in 
a peaceful negotiated settlement 
waldheim said later that he had raised with saddam the issue of 
us citizens and other westerners who have not been allowed to 
leave iraq and kuwait but he received no commitments from the 
iraqi leader 
the president saddam was very serious in discussing this 
matter with me and it is my hope that it will take a positive 
development waldheim told the associated press in an interview 
at an amman hotel 
he said he told saddam i hope that it will be possible to do 
something for the other citizens too and the president said he 
will keep it in mind he didnt give me any immediate answer 
an austrian embassy official in amman said 96 austrians 
including about 30 women and 15 children arrived on the flight 
from iraq earlier an austrian diplomat in baghdad had said about 
80 people mainly workers technicians and their families were 
leaving with waldheim 
waldheim said four austrians stayed behind in baghdad to take 
care of personal and business affairs and would be traveling 
overland to jordan in the next few days 
franz pernegger the austrian ambassador to jordan said iraqi 
authorities arranged for helicopters to fly austrians stranded 
elsewhere in iraq to baghdad so they could leave with waldheim 
waldheim interviewed by the cable news network in amman said 
austria did not make any concessions and we were not asked to 
in order to obtain permission for its citizens to leave iraq 
in baghdad the official iraqi news agency said waldheim and the 
iraqi president were joined in their meeting by foreign minister 
tariq aziz izzat ibrahim vice chairman of the iraqi revolutionary 
council and other council members 
about 21000 westerners including 3000 americans and 4500 
britons are stranded in iraq and kuwait saddam has barred them 
from leaving and he confirmed saturday that some were taken to 
strategic points including missile bases and oil refineries 
this measure is not meant to protect us against attacks it is 
meant to prevent attacks from happening saddam said at a news 
conference with austrian reporters 
we hope that our hosting of the rest of the foreigners here 
will not last long but he added that this depended on the 
removal of the specter of war which the usa seeks to ignite in 
the area 
waldheim arrived aboard an iraqi presidential plane and was 
greeted at the airport by saddam diplomats said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
waldheim got to know arab leaders during his 10 years as un 
secretarygeneral most western leaders have shunned him and 
america barred him after disclosures that he served during world 
war ii with a german army unit implicated in atrocities and later 
misrepresented his war record 
saddam held the impromptu news conference for austrian reporters 
accompanying waldheim before the talks began it was carried by 
austrian radio and broadcast later on iraqi tv picked up by cable 
news network it was his first talk with western reporters since 
the crisis began 
saddam dressed in a gray suit told reporters iraqi troops 
dont plan to withdraw from kuwait 
he said the united states had occupied saudi arabia and other 
holy places of islam and the arab world condemns this 
a multinational military force composed largely of us troops 
sent by president bush has been building up in neighboring saudi 
arabia following the invasion of kuwait 
saddam termed western military action a naked aggression 
he characterized as corrupt the government of kuwait that was 
driven into exile sitting around gambling tables wasting 
millions this is the type of arab character bush wants to bring 
back to kuwait 
in news conference remarks broadcast by cnn saddam said he was 
ready to negotiate over the crisis but that western powers hadnt 
offered to open talks 
i shall say that whatever collides with iraq will find colmns 
of dead bodies which may have a beginning but may not have an end 
we want the americans to live we do not want them to die in the 
same way we want the iraqis to live and not die saddam said 
so it is the duty of americans now to bear in mind that they 
must resort to a political solution and not to force and to end 
this tendency they have that they can have anything they want 
he also said that with the annexation of kuwait iraq seeks no 
other arab territory

the federal aviation administration could lose 
air traffic controllers and other key staff to severe budget 
cutbacks and the national callup of military reservists a 
spokesman for the agency said 
nearly 15 percent of the faas 2200 key jobs in the northwest 
mainly air traffic controllers are held by reservists faa 
spokesman mitch barker said friday just over 5 percent or about 
865 of the faas 17250 air traffic controllers are in the 
reserves 
the agency has asked all its facilities to report daily on how 
many reservist they lose to active duty said faa spokesman fred 
farrar in washington dc 
were concerned and were working right now to develop some 
way to get through this barker said 
faa administrator james busey said friday the reserve callup 
had not yet caused any problems 
as of friday seven controllers at some of the nations 686 
control towers had been called to active duty the faa has said 
remaining controllers would work overtime if a staff shortage 
develops 
the agency has not asked for any of its controllers to be 
exempted from the callup 
farrar said it would be difficult to move controllers to 
understaffed airports because it would take several months for them 
to adjust 
but he said the agencys main concern is with potential budget 
cuts when the next phase of the grammrudman deficitreduction law 
takes effect on oct 1 the faa could lose nearly onethird of its 
budget 
some senior employees have begun seeking early retirement 
fearing that generous elements of the federal retirement program 
could be cut by congress farrar said that could further compound 
a staffing problem 
the agency has asked the bush administration for 475 more 
controllers and 250 more safety inspectors in fiscal 1991 busey 
told reporters friday at seattletacoma international airport 
he said an existing shortage of inspectors means the faa will 
not alter its policy of allowing large airlines to oversee their 
own safety and maintenance records 
busey said the system works despite a 60count federal 
indictment last month against eastern airlines and several of its 
top managers for allegedly falsifying safety and maintenance 
records 
there will always be discrepancies he said im very 
comfortable that the system is working

it was 90 degrees on the plains but 
sherry barsotti and jim reaka went to the top of 14264foot mount 
evans for a windy chilly and breathtaking wedding ceremony 
after saying their i dos friday the arvada colo couple 
and an impromptu wedding party climbed onto 18speed mountain bikes 
and bicycled 28 miles a drop of 6724 feet down the winding 
twisting narrow asphalt road to idaho springs 
along the way the newlyweds stopped at echo lake lodge at 
10600 feet for a wedding lunch highlighted by the traditional 
cutting of the nuptial cake 
we originally thought of getting married in kansas city which 
was our original hometown but we both love the outdoors and knew 
about this bicycle tour sherry said it sounded like an 
exciting way to get married 
sherrys friend joni lund runs bicycle tours off mount evans 
and arranged the combination wedding and tour 
at first we really didnt think she was serious lund said 
but soon we realized she was so we contacted two couples from 
massachusetts who were already booked on the mount evans tour and 
asked if they would mind 
one of the visitors susan gaitley of duxbury mass stood next 
to the bride during the ceremony and said she got so carried away 
with the sentiment that i thought i was going to cry 
with temperatures in the 30s ice on pools of water and a brisk 
wind blowing at the summit the cyclists donned red twopiece 
windbreaker suits for the trip down 
the lunds tied a bouquet to the handlebars of the married 
womans bicycle and threaded color crepe paper streamers through 
the front wheel spokes of the newlyweds bicycles 
looking on with varying degrees of curiosity were a forest 
ranger several tourists and a few mountain goats on a nearby 
slope

nations around the world hailed the united 
nations approval of force to back its embargo of iraq praising 
the decision as an act of international solidarity against baghdad 
however libyan leader moammar gadhafi called the resolution a 
very dangerous endorsement of a fait accompli which is imposed by 
force he was referring to the military buildup in the region by 
the united states britain france and other countries opposed to 
iraq 
the libyan leader sent a message to un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar complaining that this is very dangerous 
for it is a patchedup resolution taken under american pressure 
libyas official jana news agency said 
the un resolution adopted 130 with cuba and yemen 
abstaining authorized the various nations navies assembled in the 
gulf region to use force if necessary to stop iraqi trade 
the white house hailed the un resolution as strengthening 
world resolve to force iraq out of kuwait 
president bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft 
said the united nations has given the bush administration a free 
hand to enforce the economic embargo on iraq but he sidestepped a 
question of how much force america was willing to use 
scowcroft said on cable news network that the un action 
means no commerce should go in and out of iraq by sea and that 
means that vessels will be stopped and inspected effective 
immediately 
in moscow soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze warned 
iraq to heed saturdays un vote the results of the voting 
show the unanimity of the council with regard to measures to be 
taken in the existing situation we hope that the iraqi leadership 
will draw proper conclusions from this fact will take steps to 
deescalate the conflict 
france said the resolution was a very important act which is 
testimony to the international communitys firmness and 
solidarity it said french forces would apply the resolution 
with the necessary resolve 
france has said its forces remain under french command though 
they are coordinating with other countries 
the un security council decision was an act of historic 
significance and a landmark in the further course of international 
relations greek government spokesman vyron polydoras said it 
demonstrates the will of the international community to serve 
justice and ethics he said in a statement 
britain said that the un decision displayed vital 
international unity 
it is important that contrary to what some people might have 
expected i think what saddam hussein expected the unity of the 
international community is not fraying it is actually getting more 
close as time goes on said william waldegrave secondranking 
official in britains foreign office during a news conference 
in his comments waldegrave would not say what force british 
vessels in the gulf region would use we will use obviously the 
minimum force necessary he said 
saddam iraqs leader ignited the international uproar with his 
aug 2 invasion of neighboring kuwait iraq later annexed the 
oilrich state 
in a statement carried by iraqi news agency iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz said the un resolution did not come as a 
surprise to us considering the frenzied efforts that have turned 
the security council into a tool for americas aggressive and 
unjust policy 
in venice italian foreign minister gianni de michelis said the 
agreement of china and the soviet union was especially significant 
he said italian military authorities would give orders to the 
three italian navy ships headed to the gulf on the basis of the 
un resolution he said rules of engagement would be discussed 
monday among navy officials of the countries of the ninenation 
western european union 
spain denmark and canada were among the other nations that

waldheim the first western leader to meet saddam since the 
invasion has been shunned by western leaders because he concealed 
his links to a german army unit in world war ii that has been 
implicated in atrocities 
saddam did not hesitate to use the visit by waldheim a former 
un secretarygeneral to again reject demands by the united 
nations that he restore kuwaits sovereignty and free the hostages 
saddam at a news conference with austrian reporters said iraqi 
troops will not withdraw from kuwait and repeated that foreigners 
have been moved to strategic points including missile bases and 
oil refineries 
i shall say that whatever collides with iraq will find columns 
of dead bodies which may have a beginning but may not have an end 
we want the americans to live we do not want them to die in the 
same way we want the iraqis to live and not die saddam told the 
austrian reporters 
so it is the duty of americans now to bear in mind that they 
must resort to a political solution and not to force and to end 
this tendency they have that they can have anything they want he 
said 
after leaving iraq for jordan on saturday waldheim gave a 
lengthy interview to cable news network in which he said of saddam 
i have the impression that he still wants a negotiated 
settlement i personally insisted that one should try to find 
such a settlement waldheim said 
he realizes of course that the situation is very dangerous 
he expressed his concern about the possibility of a military 
confrontation saying that he would be prepared for that but that 
he wants a negotiated solution and that he is still trying to get 
this 
saddam has repeatedly threatened to use trapped foreigners as 
human shields to protect iraqi installations against an attack by 
tens of thousands of us forces deployed in saudi arabia to 
contain iraqi aggression 
in another indication that iraq is carrying out that plan 
japans foreign ministry said 20 of its nationals and 20 other 
foreigners mostly caucasians were moved by bus saturday from a 
baghdad hotel to an undisclosed location 
the security council vote saturday was a major victory for the 
united states which had sought un authority to use force in 
stopping trade with iraq and thus force saddam to end his 
3weekold occupation of kuwait 
the resolution allows navies in the gulf region to use such 
measures commensurate to the specific circumstances as may be 
necessary under the authority of the security council to halt all 
inward and outward maritime 
moscow had held up the resolution but later changed its position 
and said it may even join the naval force because it is one of 
five permanent security council members the soviet union could 
have vetoed the measure 
the united states says iraq is still receiving goods and even 
military equipment iraqi oil tankers have recently anchored in 
yemens harbor and iraqi goods are still passing through jordans 
red sea port of aqaba 
it was not immediately clear what effect the un resolution 
would have in aqaba where iraqi and jordanian imports are 
difficult to differentiate 
the resolution covers only maritime shipping and not airlifts to 
iraq 
yemen and cuba were the only countries that abstained from the 
security council vote yemens ambassador abdallah saleh 
alashtal warned that any military action backing the sanctions 
might lead to war 
yemen said saturday that it was fully committed to honoring the 
un embargo and denied reports it serves as a base for iraqi 
warplanes 
but diplomatic sources in the gulf region say iraq has flown 12 
captured kuwaiti jet fighters to yemen and that prior to the 
invasion it had based 36 sovietmade iraqi jet fighters at taez 
south of yemens capital sana

national parks are being warned that they may 
have to fire some employees put others on unpaid temporary leave 
or even shut down completely because of the federal budget crisis 
weve sent a memo to every park superintendent telling them to 
dust off their contingency plans to reduce operations said 
harold danz of denver the national park services associate 
regional director for administration that could come to even 
include closing of parks 
yellowstone national park managers said friday they had received 
the memo 
grand teton national park in wyoming and bighorn canyon national 
recreation area and glacier national park both in montana 
received similar memos and letters for employees the billings 
mont gazette reported saturday 
the federal budget already bogged down by a huge deficit is 
being further stretched by the mounting costs of the massive us 
military buildup in the middle east 
unless congress and the white house compromise on a budget by 
the end of next month 100 billion in automatic cuts would take 
effect 
federal agencies have therefore taken the unusual step of 
warning employees that they might have to take unpaid furloughs of 
up to 22 days to keep costs down national park service employees 
should receive the warning letters monday yellowstone spokeswoman 
marsha karle said 
us forest service bureau of land management and other 
agencies will distribute similar letters next week 
all federal workers are expected to receive similar letters by 
the end of the month the last time a furlough was threatened was 
in 1982 when several thousand employees were kept from work for a 
few days 
cutbacks could hit yellowstone especially hard the summer staff 
is far smaller than in previous years snd rangers are struggling to 
keep up with a record number of visitors 
we have fewer people doing more with less karle said 
this is all going to be hard for folks to take with morale 
already down 
congress is far behind this year in passing an appropriations 
bill for the department of the interior 
if there are no funds there is no legal way to spend money 
danz said but we have to look at an orderly closure 
during world war ii he said similar cutbacks were required 
because of military expenditures national parks kept skeleton 
staffs in parks but shut down most of their public services 
karle said if reductions come only top yellowstone park 
administrators and law enforcement rangers would probably continue 
working 
were going to keep the park open as long as we can karle 
said but if we do run out of money we may have to take hard 
steps to cut down

freed hostage brian keenan who flew home 
to ireland saturday said he saw american hostages terry anderson 
and thomas sutherland during his fouryear captivity in lebanon and 
that both had been well 
its an understatement to say im delighted to be home he 
said his voice breaking as he read a statement in dublin its 
where the heart is you know 
keenan 39 looking pale but otherwise physically fit earlier 
had an emotional reunion with his two sisters in the syrian 
capital damascus almost 24 hours after he was freed by his 
captors in beirut 
in his comments in damascus he did not say when he had seen the 
two americans he described anderson as being comforted by a 
picture of his daughter sulome and said sutherland entertained 
his fellow hostages with jokes and stories 
he said he had seen british hostage john mccarthy only two days 
ago but did not mention any other hostages 
his hair cut short and his beard neatly trimmed keenan 
struggled to hold back tears as he sat between his sisters elaine 
spence and brenda gillham he read the statement to reporters in 
dublin but took no questions 
keenan said he had spent a long 4 years in captivity and it 
sometimes seemed like 4 lifetimes 
on my way here i thought of what i was going to do he told 
reporters and finally i said to myself i would eat all the food 
in the world drink all the drink in the world and make love to all 
the women in the world and then maybe ill get a good night 
sleep 
keenan said he was overwhelmed by his homecoming but another 
part of me goes back to those men who are left behind 
theyre somewhere out there somewhere in here he said 
pointing toward his heart 
after keenan left his sisters spoke briefly with reporters 
as you see he still has his wit and his humor his character 
is still very strong he is the same brian that left us 4 years 
ago said mrs spence 
asked why her brothers voice was so weak mrs spence said he 
spoke in a whisper because he communicated that way with the other 
hostages and hasnt gotten used to raising his voice yet 
keenans sisters arrived in syria with irish foreign minister 
gerry collins and a doctor and a nurse they all flew back to 
ireland three hours after keenan was formally turned over to 
collins at the syrian foreign ministry 
a welcoming cheer went up as keenan stepped off a government jet 
at dublin airport onto a red carpet he was warmly embraced by 
prime minister charles haughey 
keenan opened his arms to the crowd and then clasped his hands 
over his head in delight 
keenan wearing a sweater his mother had knit for him clasped 
his two sisters to him and blew kisses to the crowd of about 500 
before going into the vip lounge for a private reunion with more 
than 20 relatives 
in damascus he told reporters i saw terry anderson some time 
ago 
hes in good form and he appreciates the letters that he 
received from his family 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longest held of the 13 westerners believed held 
captive by moslem extremists in lebanon he was abducted march 16 
1985 
anderson and sutherland are among six americans remaining in 
captivity along with two west germans an italian and four britons 
of sutherland 56 of fort collins colo keenan said hes 
well 
he has told us an entire repertoire of jokes and dr 
sutherland is in good health and regularly exercising keenan 
said sutherland was kidnapped june 9 1985 
anderson has never seen his 5yearold daughter who was born 
almost three months after he was kidnapped but keenan said he 
has a picture of his daughter sulome which is some great 
companionship for him 
keenan also said he had seen mccarthy a reporter for the 
londonbased worldwide television news two nights ago he said 
mccarthy was well 
johns good humor was very much appreciated and brought in 
all of us who came in contact with him a real sense of the outside 
world keenan said 
mccarthy 33 was captured april 17 1986 the other britons are 
terry waite the envoy of the archbishop of canterbury and alec 
collett and jack mann 
waite disappeared in beirut on jan 20 1987 while seeking the 
release of other hostages 
andersons sister peggy say told of keenans comments said 
im anxious to talk to brian and to get more details about 
terrys mental emotional and physical health 
of course im very pleased for the keenan sisters and their 
family but unfortunately our experience has been in the past that 
when a single hostage is released that doesnt necessarily mean 
that we are going to see another one for some time she said by 
telephone from her home in kentucky 
keenan was handed over friday to syrian army officers in beirut 
the lebanese capital after a littleknown group calling itself the 
organization of the islamic dawn said he would be released 
until the kidnappers statement friday no group had claimed 
responsibility for keenan from the time he was abducted until he 
was freed

kidnapped april 11 1986 in west beirut while walking to the 
american university where he taught english 
he was born in belfast and was traveling on an irish passport 
but he has dual irishbritish citizenship

malden mass 
hostage robert polhill of new york was freed april 22 and two 
swiss red cross workers elio erriquez and emmanuel christen were

the map of iraq is elaborately marked and 
circled pinpointing potential targets if shots are fired in the 
persian gulf standoff 
until recent days us military planners focused on iraqi 
president saddam husseins troop positions including a 
concentration of forces along the kuwaitsaudi border a 
crescentshaped formation further north near kuwait city and supply 
routes back to iraq 
now convinced there is enough us firepower on the ground to 
thwart any iraqi attack strategists at the american command post 
here are mulling ways to use their might against iraq should 
hostilities erupt 
right after the invasion of kuwait we had to hurry so it was 
a comeasyouare war a pentagon source said that was more 
than two weeks ago now for us its a doasyouplease war 
there are numerous political economic and military factors that 
would influence any decision to make an allout assault on iraq an 
attack that american officials stress is highly unlikely unless 
iraq fires first complicating all planning is iraqs grasp on some 
10000 western hostages including 3000 americans 
but it is clear from interviews and reviews of us intelligence 
and planning over the past week that such a plan is in place and 
being refined virtually daily as spy satellites awacs tracking 
planes and other intelligence sources provide information on iraqi 
military activities 
after spending their first week here reluctant to discuss 
contingency plans many officers in the past week at several 
command levels have discussed such plans privately if for no 
other reason than to send a signal to saddam 
we know when they are loading gas into their trucks an army 
colonel said friday well be ready if they come and ready to go 
after them too 
vietnamera generals leading the deployment in saudi arabia 
favor an overwhelming attack on iraq if fighting erupts that would 
include destruction of key government facilities in baghdad iraqi 
oil fields and military installations and infrastructure used to 
resupply iraqi forces in kuwait and near iraqs border with saudi 
arabia according to a number of military sources here 
the command post for the persian gulf deployment dubbed 
operation desert shield has been at the central command 
headquarters in florida but a makeshift war room will be opened in 
saudi arabia within days 
i came out of one briefing the other day hearing b52s humming 
in my head one senior officer said this past week a field 
commander privy to some of the contingency plans put it this way 
these guys have decided if we go we go all out none of this 
halfway bull shit 
the options according to the officials include bombing runs 
use of naval firepower from a battleship and other ships in the 
persian gulf and even ground forces if necessary to knock out key 
iraqi installations and block supply and communications routes 
american aircraft have been flying 24 hours a day on practice 
missions and to counter iraqi air patrols elements of the 82nd and 
101st airborne divisions have been briefed on possible iraqi 
targets the 82nd consists of paratroopers the 101st has attack 
helicopters and can deploy infantry from helicopters as well 
members of the 82nd have been told their division might be 
dropped into iraq or just over its border with kuwait to cut off 
supply routes according to the sources 
massive amounts of us military force continue to pour into 
saudi arabia and the waters that surround the arabian peninsula 
for example the first shipments of huge m1 tanks are just 
offshore and once unloaded will immediately move to forward 
positions in the saudi desert the m1s from the armys 24th 
infantry division mechanized will join marine m60a1 tanks 
already on the ground 
backing up the tanks are formidable deployments of tankfighting 
helicopters a10 planes and other heavy weapons stationed in the 
saudi desert some at airstrips not even on most maps these 
strips are well within striking distance of iraqi targets in both 
kuwait and iraq 
a ground war against entrenched iraqi positions in kuwait would 
be bloody planners say and the air attacks necessary to support 
the ground troops likely would level much of kuwait kuwaiti 
government officials now living in exile in saudi arabia have 
implored us officials not to wage such a fight 
less bloody and potentially devastating to saddams power 
would be a direct assault on selected iraqi targets which if 
successful would create chaos in the government and choke off 
supplies and reinforcements to the iraqi forces in kuwait 
air force jets stationed in saudi arabia and on navy carriers in 
the persian gulf and red sea are within range of iraqi targets as 
are f111 bombers in turkey and longrange b52s from diego garcia 
the pentagon said saturday that more f111s which the united 
states has used previously against libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
were being moved from britain to saudi arabia 
us officials believe there is enough firepower here to defend 
saudi arabia from any forward attack from kuwaiti territory during 
such an assault on iraq 
there are concerns that iraq would launch chemicalcarrying scud 
missiles into saudi arabia if the united states moved against iraqi 
targets 
but american and saudi military officials say the missiles 
travel slowly and jets and groundtoair missile systems should be 
able to destroy them in flight saudi officials this week confirmed 
reports that scud launchers had been moved into kuwait however an 
american military intelligence source disputed that while 
acknowledging that scuds stationed in southern iraq still could 
reach saudi targets

the bush administration has vastly overestimated 
the viewership of tv marti whose broadcast since march has been 
marked by cuban government jamming according to a report saturday 
the us information agency estimated that 1 million to 7 
million cubans watched the new station which broadcast american 
entertainment and news shows to the communistruled island from 
florida 
but the general accounting office in an unpublished report 
obtained by the miami herald cited notes by us diplomats who 
estimated an audience of only 50000 to 70000 
the gao the investigative arm of congress faulted the usias 
methods in two viewership surveys which polled cuban refugees and 
emigres arriving at miami international airport between march 28 
and may 12 
the survey subjects would be more interested in and aware of 
tv marti than the general population because they were leaving 
cuba the gao report said 
the first report prepared by usias radio marti research and 
policy staff in miami concluded the station was received in 
practically all of the cuban territory with acceptable quality 
for potential viewing by 73 million cubans 
a second report prepared by a research firm under contract to 
usia estimated 1 million to 13 million cubans tuned in during the 
stations first six weeks on the air 
the station began transmitting on march 27 its signal 
frequently is beamed to havana from 345 am to 559 am when 
staterun stations are not transmitting officials have said tv 
martis directors do not want to overlap with cuban stations both 
for technical reasons and to avoid further aggravating the cuban 
government 
tv martis signal often is partially blocked by cuban jamming 
gao investigators said 21 percent of the 112 airport arrivals 
who responded to the usia survey said they watched tv marti on four 
days when there were no broadcasts 
the gao report was requested by us rep john dingell dmich 
chairman of the house subcommittee on oversight and investigations 
tv marti is an extension of the radio marti coverage launched by 
the reagan administration in its campaign against cuban president

elite army troops joined 
police patrols in black townships saturday as part of a government 
crackdown on factional fighting that has killed more than 500 
people 
soldiers wearing full combat gear went doortodoor at migrant 
worker hostels in the vosloorus township southeast of johannesburg 
confiscating the crude weapons used in street fighting between 
zulus and township residents 
armored police vehicles stood guard as the soldiers rounded up 
spears knives machetes clubs and other weapons 
no serious fighting was reported for a second straight day in 
the townships near johannesburg after almost two weeks of clashes 
between zulu backers of the conservative inkatha political movement 
and xhosas mostly loyal to the african national congress 
however a grenade exploded late saturday at a train station 
east of johannesburg killing one person and injuring two police 
told the independent south african press association 
several recent blasts in the johannesburg area have been blamed 
on extreme rightwing whites opposed to government moves toward 
sharing power with the disenfranchised black majority 
police said two more bodies from the factional fighting were 
found saturday increasing the death toll to 514 since fighting 
erupted aug 12 government officials said 18000 people had been 
left homeless by the conflict 
on friday the government declared the townships around 
johannesburg unrest areas giving police widespread powers to 
suppress violence it also ordered in more soldiers and police to 
control the chaos 
demonstrations against the violence and alleged police bias 
toward inkatha were held in several cities saturday in cape town 
about 250 members of the anc womens league marched to criticize 
the government for waiting so long to curb the fighting 
the soweto civic association called a work stayaway in the 
township for monday to protest the violence police behavior and 
to mourn our dead more than 120 people have died in soweto since 
the fighting began 
police have denied accusations that they sided with inkatha 
fighters in the clashes president fw de klerk said friday that 
while a few individuals may have acted improperly the force as a 
whole followed orders to be impartial 
army commanders said three elite paratroop and infantry 
battalions were being sent to the townships to aid police along 
with a battalion of exiled black angolans who fought that countrys 
communist government in the mid1970s 
the anc has charged that some members of the angolan battalion 
terrorized south african blacks in natal province earlier this year 
army officials declined to say how many troops were involved 
but most south african battalions have at least 500 soldiers 
about 1000 police and troops raided kagiso township late friday 
and seized a large number of weapons officials said police capt 
eugene opperman said such raids might be conducted regularly 
the government lifted a nationwide state of emergency in june in 
all provinces except natal where fighting between inkatha and anc 
forces has claimed about 5000 lives in the past five years 
the anc had demanded lifting of the state of emergency as a 
condition of formal talks with the whiteled government on a new 
constitution 
anc leader nelson mandela said friday the new emergency measures 
were unnecessary but would not derail negotiations with the 
government on ending apartheid and sharing power with the black 
majority 
on saturday defense minister gen magnus malan said the anc 
continued to advocate violence despite telling the government it 
had suspended its armed struggle 
malan also said black leaders should quit blaming each other for 
the violence and work together toward peace 
zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi on saturday accused the anc of 
starting the johannesburg area violence it was the latest in a 
series of charges and counterclaims by the rival black opposition 
movements 
buthelezi says the anc is terrorizing inkatha members to try to 
wipe out any competition for power among black groups 
the anc claims inkatha spread the political violence from natal 
to the johannesburg area to try to broaden its constituency

the quintuplets and their parents spent the day tossing water 
balloons picnicking and talking about the trials and joys of 
family life times five 
raising quintuplets is much like raising any other large family 
parents said many said they dont dress young quintuplets alike 
out of spite its an easy way to keep track of them in a crowded 
mall 
i know immediately what to look for said amy chikaraishi of 
glenview a suburb north of chicago i just do a quick head count 
and if im one short its easier to find them 
making sure each of his fiveyearolds receives an equal amount 
of attention and affection is one of the biggest chores for gregory 
miller a truck driver and supervisor in bennett colo 
because theyre all the same age you cant spend time with 
oneonone activity then time with another one doing something 
different miller said at the same time you cant just treat 
them as a group 
we noticed that they were individuals with different 
personalities right away so we started treating them like that 
he said 
in the past five years miller said hes learned to be more 
patient 
forget taking family pictures its ridiculous miller 
said as event organizers frantically tried to round up all 45 
children and keep them in one place long enough for photographers 
to snap a picture 
not all quintuplets look alike but those who do say outsiders 
have trouble keeping them straight 
our teachers give up on our names davis said they wind 
up just pointing or saying you there 
its not the only time davis minds someone pointing at her 
we hate it when people talk about it too much davis said 
people still point and stare 
but she and her four identical sisters christa casey charla 
and chelsa do have some advantages 
we get to share clothes she said and we spend a lot of 
time together as a family weve always done that

stories of a ghost lurking in a scene in the 
movie three men and a baby are scaring up business for video 
stores nationwide 
i was never a firm believer in ghosts or anything but ill 
tell you the truth it made the hair stand up on my arms said 
jon roup who works at network video in pittsburgh which was 
besieged by requests for the movie 
staff and customers of music plus in marina del rey calif 
looked for the eerie figure friday before all copies of the comedy 
were rented 
everybody whos walked into the store today wants this 
movie said operations manager ryan bicknell 
viewers are transfixed by a scene in which ted danson and 
celeste holm costarring as dansons mother walk by a window in a 
home shared by characters portrayed by danson tom selleck and 
steve guttenberg 
partially obscured in the window is what appears to many viewers 
to be a young boy hiding behind a curtain 
some callers claim the figure is the ghost of a child who died 
in a home where the film was shot 
but disney spokesman steve feldstein said viewers actually are 
looking at a cardboard cutout or standee of a man in top hat and 
tails the 1987 movie was filmed on a toronto sound stage not a 
private home he said 
feldstein said the cutout was part of the set a promotional 
device for dansons character in the movie

as jurors in new york city weighed the 
fate of three teenagers charged in the cental park jogger case a 
jury 300 miles away heard the gruesome details of an attack on 
another jogger raped and left to die 
two days after the three teenage defendants in new york were 
convicted for the central park attack jurors in syracuse on monday 
found 23yearold erwin williams guilty of the 1986 rape and 
attempted murder of a suburban woman 
both victims were women running alone attacked by strangers 
they were later unable to identify both trials involved black or 
hispanic defendants charged with attacking a white victim 
but the williams trial aroused little of the outcry that grew up 
around the central park case the new york trial was marked by 
national media attention demonstrations outside the courthouse and 
accusations of racism by some black new yorkers 
in syracuse the racial thing has not come up at all said 
county legislator william sanford the first person to see the 
jogger after the attack 
it was bigger than that it wasnt black or white it was just 
two animals out there nothing but animals 
the 40yearold woman was raped stabbed 11 times with a 
penknife and left tied to a stake in the ground on sept 20 1986 
as her attackers left one said die bitch die she testified 
in court 
with the knife still protruding from her neck and one lung 
partially collapsed the woman freed herself and walked more than a 
mile along the trail to sanfords boathouse home 
a second defendant 32yearold ronald jock pleaded guilty in 
july to attempted murder and testified against williams 
even the plea bargain agreement with jock who is white drew no 
protest except from williams relatives said defense attorney 
william rose williams is black 
assistant district attorney mary felasco said the plea bargain 
was offered to jock because the victim did not want to testify at 
two trials jock said his only involvement was tying the womans 
hands together and the victims statements corroborated that 
felasco said 
it wasnt a racial issue she said throughout our 
investigation ronald jock appeared to be the less culpable of the 
two 
the situation in new york was one of a series of highly 
publicized racially charged incidents that have plagued that city 
said van robinson president of the syracuse branch of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
while syracuse is not immune to racial conflict he said you 
dont have the heightened racial tensions here that you have in new 
york some 15000 people live in syracuse and of them roughly 16 
percent are black 
the passage of time between the attack and the arrests also 
helped calm emotions robinson said 
arrests in the central park case came within days of the april 
1989 incident in syracuse it was more than 3 years after the 
september 1986 attack before jock and williams were arrested 
police received anonymous tips fingering the pair shortly after 
the attack but it was not until march 1990 that williams 
estranged wife came forward with evidence that would end the 
investigation 
outrage over the crime has not diminished but has been tempered 
by time sanford agreed you go back four years there was 
community response he said the outpouring was tremendous 
williams was 19 when he and jock attacked the woman as she 
neared the end of a 9mile jog along the running trail at onondaga 
lake park in geddes a suburb of syracuse 
there in the leafy woods beside the trail the jogger was raped 
and stabbed the woman testified that the man who tried to strangle 
her said she just wont die she wont die 
shes an amazing woman said sanford i dont think i ever 
saw her in a situation where she wasnt in control i think she was 
an unbelievable example of the extent that a person can control her 
destiny whether she was going to live or die 
sanford said the arrests and convictions give him a feeling of 
relief that he hopes the victim shares

the united nations has given the 
bush administration a free hand to enforce the economic embargo 
against iraq president bushs national security adviser said 
saturday 
but brent scowcroft sidestepped a question of how much force the 
united states was willing to use to choke off commerce to and from 
iraq 
asked during a cable news network interview whether the united 
states planned to board seize or even sink ships moving goods 
between iraq and other nations scowcroft said only that american 
vessels will use the minimum amount of interference with traffic 
in order to make the sanctions effective 
the un security council early saturday adopted a resolution 
calling for military enforcement of the embargo against iraq the 
resolution was approved 130 with cuba and yemen abstaining 
scowcroft said the un action means no commerce should go in 
and out of iraq by sea and that means that vessels will be 
stopped and inspected effective immediately 
asked whether the united states now had a free hand in the 
persian gulf to do as it wants in enforcing the blockade he said 
i believe thats the case 
meanwhile the new york times reported in sundays editions that 
the administration is studying the possibility of offering 
political asylum to the crews of iraqi vessels to persuade them to 
cooperate with the embargo 
the idea is to persuade the crews to give up without resorting 
to violence the paper reported quoting administration and 
pentagon officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
american intelligence officials say the tanker crews are under 
orders from baghdad to ignore warnings to halt even if fired upon 
and face execution if they allow us forces to board the paper 
said 
at the pentagon a senior official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said he did not foresee any immediate conflict involving 
ships and that the two iraqi ships the navy fired upon last 
weekend were continuing to be monitored 
i dont sense that theres anything out there about to 
happen because of the un action the official said 
scowcrofts comments came as administration officials protested 
the interruption of electricity to the us embassy in 
iraqioccupied kuwait and as iraqs ambassador to the united states 
said the wives and children of american diplomats who fled kuwait 
to baghdad were free to go 
us officials said iraqi soldiers maintained their blockade of 
the us embassy in kuwait city and the embassy was operating on 
generator power water also had been cut off 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said the administration had 
expressed its objections through diplomatic channels in baghdad 
kuwait and washington 
the embassy continues to function it is carrying out its 
consular functions said popadiuk in maine with the vacationing 
bush 
he added a small contingent of iraqi soldiers continues 
to maintain its presence outside the embassy 
bush received an intelligence briefing and monitored the 
situation while continuing his threeweek vacation 
the voice of america radio advised the 2500 americans trapped 
in kuwait not to go near the embassy while the soldiers remained 
even though there appeared to be no attempt to take over the 
compound 
the state department broadcast on voa said the embassy was 
determined to continue working for your release from kuwait and 
your safe return to your families 
scowcroft said the power had apparently been returned to the 
british embassy but that it was a very fluid situation at all 
the western diplomatic missions 
us officials said telephone service to kuwait was sporadic 
but they were maintaining phone contact with ambassador nathaniel 
howell and his staff of about 10 diplomats who stayed behind to 
keep the embassy open in defiance of iraqs order to close it on 
friday 
scowcroft said negotiations were under way in baghdad to permit 
the departure of some 100 us diplomats and dependents who were 
being detained after they evacuated the embassy in kuwait on an 
iraqi promise they could leave from the iraqi capital 
mohamed sadiq almashat iraqs ambassador to the united states 
said saturday in washington the wives and children of american 
diplomats who fled kuwait to baghdad were free to go but that the 
diplomats would be treated just like anybody else 
he did not register any direct threat to the diplomats or any of 
the more than 3000 us citizens trapped in iraq and kuwait 
iraqi president saddam hussein in a television news conference 
saturday warned the united states to pursue a diplomatic solution 
to the volatile situation or risk great bloodshed 
the white house welcomed the un vote in a statement from 
press secretary marlin fitzwater the administration singled out 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev for praise moscow voted for the 
resolution after balking for several days 
gorbachev sent an urgent message friday to saddam urging him to 
comply with the un orders to get out of kuwait 
gorbachevs statement was a very important development 
fitzwater said 
meanwhile the navy announced saturday that it had called up 127 
reserve units from 34 states and the district of columbia 
in addition the army released a list of 173 national guard and 
reserve units from 37 states puerto rico and the district of 
columbia it said might be called to duty before oct 1 
in omaha neb the air forces strategic air command confirmed 
that it sent b52 heavy bombers from two us air bases overseas 
two weeks ago sac did not however indicate how many had been 
dispatched or where they had been sent 
the us response to the persian gulf crisis sparked a 
demonstration saturday in front of the white house the national 
park service said there were about 140 participants

the federal election commission sued the 
national republican senatorial committee friday accusing it of 
illegally funneling nearly 27 million raised through solicitation 
letters from george bush to a dozen gop campaigns in 1986 
the suit filed in us district court accuses the senate 
campaign arm of the national republican committee of violating a 
contribution ceiling of 17500 that party organizations can make 
to a single candidate 
all 12 of the gop senate candidates subsequently lost to 
democrats in the november general election 
the commission filed the suit in us district judge gerhard a 
gesells court in response to his ruling last january reversing the 
fecs decision to dismiss a portion of a complaint by common cause 
against the senate gop committee 
common cause a citizens lobbying group filed the complaint 
with the fec a week before the 1986 general election it alleged 
that the republican committees bundling of contributions 
raised from bushs letter and dispersing them to the 12 candidates 
circumvented the party spending limits 
in september 1986 the committee mailed out in mass some 24 
different versions of bushs solicitation letter each mentioning 
four states in which senate campaigns were occurring but not the 
names of the gop candidates bush was vice president at the time 
the returning checks from donors were made out to the national 
republican senatorial committee or an organization under its 
control such as the inner circle or the republican 
presidential task force rather than the individual candidates 
campaigns 
the committee however reported the contributions as going 
directly from original donor to candidate 
in some cases individual donors had never even heard of the 
candidates to whom they supposedly had earmarked contributions 
the fec said in its lawsuit friday 
the fecs general counsel said the committees fundraising 
tactics on behalf of the senate gop candidates violated the federal 
election campaign act 
however the commission reflecting its composition of three 
republicans and three democrats deadlocked on most of his 
recommendations effectively rejecting them in july 1988 
however the panel did find that the 534000 the gop committee 
spent on the mass mailings without listing the money as a 
contribution to the candidates violated the law 
five months later the republican committee agreed to pay a fine 
of 20000 however common cause opposed the settlement and filed 
suit in gesells court to reverse it 
our position is that this matter was closed in 1988 bill 
canfield the republican committees legal counsel said friday 
we paid a civil penalty and we have a letter from the general 
counsel of the fec saying the matter is closed 
canfield described the fec as being caught between a rock and 
a hard place because of gesells ruling last january he said any 
adverse ruling by gesell who happens to be no friend of 
republicans in the suit filed friday will be appealed by the 
committee

parents were advised friday by a national 
organization of social workers to stop spanking their children 
because mild physical punishment could quickly escalate into abuse 
an antispanking policy was adopted on a voice vote by the 
primary governing body of the 130000member national association 
of social workers the policy is an expansion of one opposing 
physical punishment in school adopted six years ago 
we are not simply trying to circumvent child abuse said 
isadora hare the groups education commission staff director we 
also want to reverse the acceptance of using physical means to 
resolve conflicts there are more effective ways to discipline 
children without using physical punishment 
hare said that physical punishment is deeply ingrained in the 
united states a recent study showed that 81 percent of us 
parents use physical punishment on their children during 1982 more 
than 60 percent spanked at least once a week 
an estimated 3 million children have been kicked bitten or 
punched and about 2 million have been beaten up by parents some 
time in their lives the association said research has demonstrated 
that most physical child abuse is an escalation of what a parent 
intends only as discipline 
several european countries have laws banning parental use of 
physical punishment sweden prohibited physical punishment of 
children in 1979 denmark finland norway and austria have since 
passed legislation england has launched a parentfocused campaign 
called end physical punishment of children 
the idea to expand the 1984 ban of physical punishment in school 
came last february when the association participated in a meeting 
involving researchers and other national agencies that issued a 
position statement opposing parental use of physical punishment 
hare said the latest action is a tremendously important 
statement of principle in terms of impact it will be a slow 
process of changing the way people feel about raising children 
the association is the worlds largest organization of 
professional social workers with members in the united states 
puerto rico and europe social workers provide more than half of 
the mental health counseling in this country

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan imposed a hiring freeze friday as officials laid plans for 
dramatic cuts that would be necessary if no federal budget 
agreement is reached by oct 1 
in a memorandum to the departments 118000 employees sullivan 
said the reductions under the grammrudmanhollings law would 
seriously affect this departments many programs the people we 
serve and our employees 
no budget compromise between the bush administration and 
congressional leaders is in sight 
even if the freeze on hiring from outside hhs and other 
moneysaving steps are taken furloughs may still be necessary 
sullivan said in the memo 
kevin moley hhs assistant secretary for management and budget 
said most federal departments and programs would see their budgets 
reduced by 319 percent if no agreement is reached 
however government officials believe that the required 
acrosstheboard spending cuts of more than 100 billion would be 
so severe that they would not remain in effect for long 
in past years lawmakers and the white house have agreed to roll 
back grammrudman cuts after leaving them in place only briefly 
in addition to furloughs at hhs payments for such programs as 
medicare and social security would be delayed and medicare 
payments would be cut by 2 percent moley said 
social security commissioner gwendolyn king told moley in an 
internal memo that a 13 billion cut in personnel and 
administrative costs would leave the agency too shorthanded to keep 
up with changes in the benefit rolls an agency spokesman confirmed 
social security benefit payments would not be affected by the 
grammrudman cuts

the food and drug administration said friday 
it is too early to blame the deaths of 27 americans who took 
ltryptophan directly on gene splicing 
we are still not sure what caused the problem said fda 
spokesman jeff nesbit 
the fda will review a petition filed by biotechnology watchdog 
jeremy rifkin asking the agency to put on hold further approvals of 
genetically engineered products nesbit said 
rifkin president of the foundation on economic trends filed 
his petition friday saying the ltryptophanlinked deaths are the 
first cases on record connecting a genetically engineered product 
with human deaths and injuries 
the 27 who died were among more than 1500 americans who 
developed a rare blood disorder called eosinophiliamyalgia 
syndrome or ems after taking ltryptophan 
until the fda ordered all ltryptophan off the market in march 
because of its link to ems the dietary supplement was sold in 
health food stores as a remedy for insomnia appetite control and 
depression 
an aug 9 article in the new england journal of medicine 
concluded that the japanese chemical company whose product had been 
linked with most of the ems cases had made two changes in its 
manufacturing process that could have caused the problem 
the company showa denko kk introduced a new strain of 
genetically altered bacteria at about the same time it changed its 
purification process for ltryptophan the changes occurred in 1988 
the data from the new england journal of medicine article 
suggest but dont prove a relationship of illness with ingestion of 
tryptophan made with the aid of a bacillus that is bioengineered 
the fda said in a paper put out friday 
the agency also noted that a great number of products 
medicines and foods continue to be made by fermentation 
processes many involving bioengineered organisms with no apparent 
deleterious effects on the health of people that use them 
but the fda also said problems with their use must be thoroughly 
investigated

efforts to help americans trapped in kuwait 
and iraq and provide information to family members in the united 
states have largely boiled down to trying to improve morale the 
state department said friday 
the information offered to families is generally limited because 
of the nature of the situation the department said adding there 
is no information on the whereabouts of americans rounded up by the 
iraqis and detained 
i think the american community in iraq and kuwait is very 
tense concerned said nicholas ricciuti director of the 
citizens emergency center of the departments consular section 
i think morale is probably the most practical purpose of the 
state department communication effort he said 
however ricciuti said the department had provided repatriation 
money and emergency loans 
we assist the americans any way that we can he said 
at a briefing ricciuti said more than 25000 phone calls had 
been received by the kuwait task force since the aug 2 iraqi 
invasion inquiring about the well being of americans in the two 
nations 
the task force staffed by more than 100 people in three shifts 
24 hours a day has made more than 10000 calls to families and 
friends to relay information ricciuti said 
the state department says there are about 2500 americans in 
kuwait of whom 1984 have been identified by the us embassy 
there are some 500 americans in iraq 
gathering information has become difficult because of restraints 
placed on us diplomats in the two countries and because of the 
belief that iraq is monitoring telephone calls to learn the 
locations of americans ricciuti said 
he said calls are kept short 
we never say where they have moved for obvious reasons he 
said we have been able to pass messages to families in the 
united states and vice versa

of antigovernment demonstrators who for a third straight night 
occupied central university square and blocked traffic

several hundred took over the square in the early evening 
shouting slogans demanding the resignation of president ion 
iliescu they blocked traffic and attacked a delivery truck that 
tried to drive through 
on wednesday and thursday evenings demonstrators had 
voluntarily dispersed when police arrived on friday however 
hundreds of riot police were called in to form a rectangle around 
the squares perimeter when protesters stood fast 
fellow demonstrators blocked off another section of the 
boulevard about a halfmile north burning piles of garbage on the 
road police marched in formation up the boulevard and cleared that 
area

police helicopters flew over at low altitude drawing a chorus 
of boos

square since june 13 when clubswinging police broke up 53day 
occupation the police action led to violence in which six people 
were officially reported killed 
unlike the previous demonstrations organized by students and 
others who accuse iliescu and his associates of being thinly veiled 
communists this weeks rallies appeared mainly motivated by the 
deteriorating economic situation and attracted mostly lowerincome 
workers

sen paul simon a frequent critic of the 
governments handling of the savings and loan crisis said friday 
he did nothing wrong when he helped a developer who owed millions 
of dollars to a troubled thrift 
but it quickly became a campaign issue as simons republican 
election opponent rep lynn martin sought an ethics investigation 
simon last month asked a california bank president to seek a 
settlement of a lawsuit against a chicago developer who raised 
thousands of dollars for the senators past three campaigns 
martin said she will file a formal complaint asking the us 
senate ethics committee to determine whether simon violated senate 
rules 
simon said friday he was unaware the lawsuit against the 
developer involved a troubled savings and loan and did nothing he 
hasnt done for thousands of constituents 
first nationwide financial corp the bank that sued simon 
supporter stephen ballis was trying to reach a settlement long 
before simon contacted them a bank spokesman said 
but martin said the senator improperly used his influence on 
behalf of ballis who raised as much as 10000 for the senator 
how often does paul volunteer to call a bank president to 
forestall foreclosure and negotiate deals for people who are not 
raising money for his campaign martin said this is not normal 
procedure for members of congress you dont call bank presidents 
to talk about loans 
ballis president of dayton resources ltd defaulted on a 5 
million loan to chicagobased pathway financial fa san 
franciscobased first nationwide received a 255 million pledge 
from federal thrift regulators in december 1988 for agreeing to 
take over pathway 
in may first nationwide officials sued to foreclose on the 
loan after meeting with ballis in chicago simon called first 
nationwide president john devine and asked if the bank could seek a 
settlement 
i said if you two can get together and work it out and avoid 
litigation it seems to me that its in everyones best 
interest simon said the taxpayers arent out a penny 
the settlements details were complete but the agreement has 
not yet been approved said dan brigham first nationwide spokesman 
ballis wife elizabeth contributed 1800 to simons reelection 
and 1988 presidential campaigns records indicate ballis total 
fundraising efforts for simon totalled less than 10000 said 
campaign spokeswoman ellen golin 
simon who held hearings on the savings and loan crisis in 
chicago last week says he would make the same phone call today 
public relationswise you might reconsider it but it was 
clearly a proper thing to do simon said 
martin said simons intervention will become an issue in her 
campaign to unseat him 
i believe he is beatable on the issues i believe he is 
beatable on philosophy she said but it would be just as wrong 
not to talk about this as it would be not to talk about the other 
things

an american islamic leader on friday urged 
religious officials to repudiate the united states military 
buildup in the middle east 
mohammad t mehdi secretarygeneral of the national council on 
islamic affairs called the military buildup a threat to 
international peace and said it would create greater hostility 
against america throughout the moslem world 
in messages to various catholic protestant and jewish leaders 
mehdi said peace in the middle east and the world depends on the 
religious community and our opposition to the war hysteria created 
by president bush 
so far christian and jewish leaders have shown support in 
principle for the usled actions against iraqs takeover of 
neighboring kuwait 
the american military establishment has been idle since the 
vietnam war and was itching for action to justify its 
existence said medhi 
american and other military forces were sent to saudi arabia at 
that islamic countrys request to prevent further agression by 
iraq the united nations approved economic sanctions against iraq 
the national council of churches which includes most major 
protestant and orthodox denominations has denounced iraqs 
invasion and supported international resistance against it 
however it expressed hope for diplomatic solutions 
similar stands have been taken in recent days by roman catholic 
and jewish leaders the associated press attempts to those 
religious leaders for comment on mehdis appeal late friday were 
unsuccessful 
mehdi termed absurd president bushs claim that operation desert 
shield was needed to protect the american way of life and said in 
apparent reference to the monarchies of saudi arabia and kuwait 
the protection of a few medieval kingdoms and princedoms can 
never be vital for the protection of the american way of life 
the free flow of oil in world markets is assured regardless 
of who controls the arab oil resources mehdi said whoever rules 
will either have to sell the oil or drink it 
mehdi urged religious leaders in the name of the one god we 
worship to do your utmost to pressure the president to withdraw 
american forces

president carlos salinas de gortari says 
mexico is willing to send troops to the persian gulf if the united 
nations asks its help in a multilateral force 
we would be ready to participate in any manner that the united 
nations security council would decide salinas said in an 
interview with syndicated journalist and cartoonist ranan r lurie 
if they consider that the presence of mexico in a multilateral 
force would be needed it would be ready 
we participated in world war ii with a force with the allies 
and we would certainly respond to any request from the un 
salinas remarks in the interview this week were made available 
to the associated press on friday 
the president was restating general government policy but it 
appeared to be his most direct comment on mexicos approach to the 
persian gulf crisis since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
the un security council has ordered an embargo on all trade 
with iraq but has not called for a multilateral un force to join 
western and arab forces already arrayed against iraqi troops 
salinas did not respond directly when asked if he would send 
troops if asked by the united states or saudi arabia but indicated 
he would need broad global backing for such a move 
we are part of the world community and we will act along with 
the world community he said 
i wouldnt hesitate to participate with the rest of the world 
in what the world considers a just act 
the turmoil in the persian gulf has affected world oil supply 
mexico is one of the largest crude oil producers outside the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
salinas said his country immediately opened the capacity of 
oil production to its limits increasing it by 100000 
barrels per day in order to make a contribution to a stable world 
market 
asked what he expected of iraqi president saddam hussein 
salinas replied he will not pull out of kuwait

a man convicted of plotting to kill a 
catholic priest who sexually abused him when he was a teenage 
altar boy was placed on three years probation friday 
gregory j riedle 26 of st paul minn was arrested in may 
after police got a tip he had come to this town in northern 
wisconsin with the intention of killing the priest thomas adamson 
police found a butcher knife and a 4foot long wooden club in 
riedles car in his hotel room they found a letter addressed to 
riedles girlfriend saying adamson had to die 
district attorney raymond pelrine said he recommended to eau 
claire county judge william obrien that riedle be given probation 
because no violence actually occurred police arrested riedle 
before he could find adamson 
riedle had been charged with attempted firstdegree intentional 
homicide but the charge later was reduced to attempted felony 
battery 
in an interview last week with the eau claire leadertelegram 
riedle said he did not plan to kill adamson only to confront the 
priest who sexually abused him when he was a 14yearold altar boy 
he said adamson first approached him in a st paul ymca 
whirlpool and they had a sexual relationship for two years until 
his family moved 
as god as my witness i would not have done anything riedle 
said i aint got it in me to hurt people physically i was 
mad at him i wont deny that ive always been mad at him 
riedle told police he brought the knife to commit suicide and 
the club to protect himself from adamson 
adamson moved to the eau claire area several years ago when he 
was deactivated by the church after revelations of sexual liaisons 
with riedle and another altar boy 
riedle won a settlement from the twin cities archdiocese in 1988

a former beauty queen convicted of 
strangling her exboyfriends fiancee begged for mercy friday 
before being sentenced to life in prison with no parole for at 
least 13 years 
lori esker 21 pleaded for a chance to start paying back all 
the people i hurt so bad with the sept 20 murder of lisa cihaski 
if i could trade places with lisa i would in a minute ms 
esker choking back tears told marathon county circuit judge 
michael hoover 
hoover sentenced ms esker to the required term of life in 
prison and granted her request that she be eligible for parole in 
13 years four months the minimum the judge said her otherwise 
clean record prevented him from setting a harsher minimum 
a circuit court jury ruled in june that ms esker killed ms 
cihaski 21 because she was jealous of the victims relationship 
with her former boyfriend 26yearold bill buss a dairy farmer 
the sept 20 strangulation is something i will be punishing 
myself for as long as i live said ms esker the marathon county 
dairy princess last year there isnt a day that goes by that i 
dont think about what happened 
after sentencing she was taken to the taycheedah womens prison 
near fond du lac her conviction was to be appealed 
ms esker of the tiny farming community of hatley a few miles 
from here was convicted of firstdegree intentional homicide 
which carries a mandatory life sentence 
but hoover was allowed to set the parole limit 
its as much a tragedy that has befallen the defendants 
family as the cihaski family hoover said no one expects the 
cihaski family to fully understand that at least not today 
the cihaskis declined to comment 
buss who dated ms esker for more than a year before becoming 
engaged to ms cihaski also refused to comment 
ms esker a junior at university of wisconsinriver falls 
strangled ms cihaski with a belt after the two women met in a car 
outside a wausau motel where the victim worked according to 
testimony 
she confessed to the murder but her lawyers claimed that she 
killed ms cihaski in self defense after the two women argued

the white house on friday condemned 
iraqi president saddam husseins tv appearance with britons he 
wont allow to leave iraq as sick beyond expression 
meanwhile president bush prepared to interrupt his vacation and 
personally brief members of congress on the persian gulf crisis 
in kuwait iraqi troops blocked off the us embassy that saddam 
has ordered closed while in baghdad more than 100 americans who 
had left compound on thursday were kept from continuing their trip 
and leaving iraq 
though the embassy standoff was tense there were indications 
the president did not want military action there 
our purpose is not to create a confrontation or to create a 
threat bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater said when asked 
why it was decided to pull out the embassys marine guards in 
kuwait city while defying the friday deadline to close the embassy 
fitzwater said bush had watched a tv broadcast thursday in which 
saddam told a group of british citizens that their presence helped 
to prevent a us military attack 
the spokesman said saddams broadcast shows the cynical and 
inhumane view that he holds for human life to hold men women and 
children up for viewing as targets for destruction is sick beyond 
expression 
the washington post reported in saturday editions that us 
officials believe the situation along the kuwaitsaudi arabia 
border has stabilized and that the likelihood of a prolonged 
military and diplomatic standoff between the united states and iraq 
is at least as great as war 
the newspaper in a story from kennebunkport that cited no 
sources said the possibility of a lengthy standoff has raised 
concerns about how long economic and military pressure can can be 
maintained against iraq 
bush will fly to washington on tuesday afternoon to meet with 
congressional leaders and members of key foreign policy committees 
although congress is still in recess several congress members 
indicated they would like to come back to washington for a 
facetoface briefing fitzwater said 
as for the embassy standoff fitzwater was asked what would be 
the appropriate response by ambassador nathaniel howell and his 
staff if the iraqis forced their way in 
i cant get into specific instructions but he is staying 
there to help out as he can fitzwater said 
force has not been applied should he be subject to that he 
will have to act accordingly but those are judgments that he is 
authorized to make in many cases and beyond that i couldnt go 
into specific discussions we have had with him 
tensions also were high in persian gulf waters where us 
vessels trailed a number of iraqi and other ships 
the united states so far has declined to forcibly interdict any 
ships for violation of the united nationsendorsed trade embargo 
against iraq but fitzwater said we are monitoring all of them 
navigating in the region 
bush has said he was willing to give the united nations a little 
time to work out agreement on a resolution backing military 
enforcement of the sanctions but he also was prepared to go ahead 
with military interdiction without that approval officials have 
indicated 
fitzwater expressed confidence the un concurrence would come 
he said iraq continues to try to circumvent the un sanctions 
among its efforts he said are aviation shipments into baghdad 
of one kind or another materiel that appears to be coming in 
through some routes and also the procurement of chemical warfare 
products which we have great concern about 
the spokesman declined to give further details because we are 
still working to resolve the matter and put an end to this 
however in answer to a question he indicated the source of the 
materiel was not the soviet union long a major supplier of 
armaments to iraq 
the vacationing president spent most of friday morning with his 
national security adviser brent scowcroft taking him out on 
bushs speedboat to continue discussions of the persian gulf 
developments fitzwater said 
turning to domestic issues bush also met friday with treasury 
secretary nicholas brady and budget director richard darman they 
were discussing new administration proposals on reducing the 
national deficit

scientists who successfully bonded 
metal ions to an antibody say its the first step toward creating 
superantidotes that could neutralize chemical weapons drug 
overdoses and most poisons 
the metal ions act as catalysts that can convert poisons to 
harmless substances inside the human body said stephen j 
benkovic a chemistry professor at penn state 
it could be used as a detoxifying agent for people who have 
taken a drug overdose and can be used against environmental 
pollutants benkovic said in an interview when the us military 
learned of the early laboratory success it asked for a briefing 
about applications in chemical warfare he said

a judges rejection of provisions in 
pennsylvanias restrictive abortion law provides a chance for the 
supreme court to review its 1973 decision in roe vs wade that 
legalized abortion both sides in the case said 
senior us district judge daniel h huyett on friday struck 
down provisions in the 1982 state law saying much of it was just a 
repeat of provisions previously ruled unconstitutional the state 
said it would appeal to the 3rd us circuit court of appeals and 
if necessary to the supreme court 
if the supreme court is looking to overturn roe v wade 
this case provides an opportunity to do that said linda wharton 
of the womens law project an attorney for the plaintiffs in the 
case 
everything is happening the way we thought it would happen 
said republican rep stephen freind the leading antiabortion 
voice in the legislature no doubt we are going to win in the

lawyers for four performance artists who 
were denied federal grants say they will take the national 
endowment for the arts to court for making what they call a 
political decision that violates the first amendment 
the lawyers from the center for constitutional rights said a 
federal court case is the only option because the nea on friday 
rejected an appeal of its decision in june to turn down the grant 
applications 
as in its initial denial letters the nea gives no substantive 
reasons for the denials the nonprofit center said in a 
statement from its new york headquarters 
the four performers in question are karen finley and holly 
hughes of new york and tim miller and john fleck of los angeles 
their solo stage acts consist of songs and monologues on such 
themes as sexual oppression politics and racism the acts 
sometimes include explicit sexual content

for donald trump it was another humbling week he found the 
fate of his complex debt restructuring being decided by casino 
regulators for the state of new jersey who put their stamp of 
approval on a new loan from his banks 
trump himself was relegated to spectator status at several days 
worth of state hearings where he was reduced to conducting 
business by pay telephone during breaks in the proceedings 
adding insult to injury fortune magazine on tuesday dumped the 
exbillionaire from its annual list of the worlds richest people 
trump worth 17 billion by fortunes estimates last year now 
could have a negative net worth according to the documents released 
by new jersey gambling regulators 
although mildly humiliating the agreement reached with the 
casino control commission at least helped trump avert disaster the 
bank deal gave him 65 million in new credit and put a moratorium 
on some other pressing loan payments trump in turn promised to 
make payments on bonds financing his casinos and live within a 
strict budget with fresh capital in hand he took the trump 
shuttle off the market for the time being 
also during the week he peddled a new book titled surviving

author dorothy gilman gets letters from readers 
who love her books about mrs pollifax who travels through exotic 
places on missions for the cia looking more like a grandmother on 
holiday than a secret agent 
she also gets letters from people whove discovered her five 
nonpollifax novels saying how much they enjoy those few letter 
writers like both 
gilman made her first authors tour this summer promoting 
mrs pollifax and the whirling dervish published by doubleday 
she doesnt speak against her creation of 26 years ago even 
then an intrepid widow in her mid60s she supported me and my 
two boys and put them through college 
but she admits mrs pollifax does get a bit confining to 
write now that im in my later years im insisting on doing 
more books i really want to do but i always feel when i do a 
nonpollifax someone is looking over my shoulder saying this is 
nice but when are you going to do the next mrs pollifax 
the clairvoyant countess is about a clairvoyant who helps 
the police a nun in the closet is her only funny book about 
two cloistered nuns who get embroiled in the outside world 
incident at badamya was published last year its heroine 
is 16 there are people up through their 60s she said its 
not a mystery its an adventure story a lot of strangers are 
captured together in burma telling their stories it has some 
mysticism in it ive been told theres a little mysticism in all 
my books 
gilmans books are set in exotic locales which she visits 
finding that more fun than pounding her manual typewriter before 
mrs pollifax met the sufi dervish in her ninth cia assignment 
gilman toured in morocco with a dozen people two of whom spoke 
english 
for the first book i was too poor to travel gilman says 
i had her in albania i couldnt go to turkey for the second but 
for the third i went to bulgaria ive been to the country of all 
the mrs pollifaxes since switzerland thailand china 
she usually isnt in danger i went to kenya and tanzania and 
nothing happened in zambia bombs were going off there were 
freedom fighters from what is now zimbabwe while i was there 
somebody was blown up that trip was for mrs pollifax on safari 
 
gilman says the books have to have something political 
america is supporting the moroccan king in his fight to take over 
the western sahara from the polisario in 1975 the un promised 
the polisario a plebiscite 
it appalled me there was my plot i do have a bit of trouble 
with plots so i lean on the political the political part of the 
book is still up to date no vote has been taken 
there were more beggars in morocco than gilman has seen anywhere 
else it made me even angrier at the king and at our government 
for supporting him he is spending 1 million a day on this war 
i didnt know about the war until i looked into morocco i 
love the research on these books 
she finished mrs pollifax and the whirling dervish last 
summer now is working on a nonpollifax for six years ive been 
collecting material on the sahara desert and tribes i haunt 
secondhand bookstores when i find something its a big event 
now im finally putting it to work 
many writers start with a protagonist similar to themselves but 
only now is gilman catching up to mrs pollifax in age i think i 
was hiding behind her the new brunswick nj native says i 
was a ministers daughter the church had so many eccentric 
wonderful elderly ladies it just seemed natural that mrs pollifax 
would be a little quirky like them she gave me a good cover 
i had a need for escape in that horrible year 1964 when i 
had to leave my husband i had a lot of trouble doing that 
actually 
i was caught in a very confined marriage getting very 
depressed you werent supposed to leave husbands this was my 
escape she traveled which i had always wanted to do i think 
growing up i wanted to be a spy or a deep sea diver and write about 
those things 
gilman had gone to art school in philadelphia and was married 
to a seventh grade teacher the unexpected mrs pollifax was 
published in 1966 
then i wrote uncertain voyage it was psychological 
suspense about a woman recovering from a nervous breakdown and 
testing herself by a trip to europe she has to find herself there 
was some intrigue somebody said it was prewomens lib she said 
i never thought mrs pollifax would be a series then they 
wanted another one it isnt surprising since the day the 
unexpected mrs pollifax was published gilman received a phone 
call that rosalind russell wanted to star in a movie of it she 
departed from the book and wore designer clothes in the 1970 mrs 
pollifax spy it wasnt a hit 
gilman had previously written a dozen young adult books my 
income from those had risen to 5000 here i was with three of us 
to support she calls the movie sale kind of a neat rescue 
the author whose sons and infant grandchild live in new york

whatever the outcome of the showdown in the 
persian gulf wall streeters believe the stock market now is 
reconciling itself to the prospect of a long dry spell for 
corporate profits 
as the summer began hopes had been spreading among us 
investors that earnings would soon start pulling out of a slump 
that set in at mid1989 
even in a relatively weak economic environment the reasoning 
went bottom lines at many businesses stood to benefit from moves 
by the federal reserve toward a more stimulative credit policy 
such visions faded fast however with the aug 2 strike on 
kuwait by iraq under president saddaam hussein and the resulting 
upsurge in oil prices and interest rates 
the economy looks bad said suresh bhirud chief portfolio 
strategist at the investment firm of oppenheimer amp co 
what saddam has done summarized barton biggs at morgan 
stanley amp co is boost oil prices diminish economic growth 
raise inflation and increase budget deficits particularly in the 
us at a time when economic engines were beginning to sputter 
anyway

they add this reduced estimate may still prove to be too 
optimistic if the us economy does indeed enter a recession 
over the next few quarters stock prices will get little 
support from the overall corporate profit performance 
some favorable resolution of the middle east crisis it is 
widely presumed would logically cause oil prices to drop back 
significantly from the recent peaks they have reached of 30plus 
per barrel 
but even then energy costs are expected to settle at a point 
higher than they would have been otherwise increasing many 
companies operating costs and hurting businesses that depend on 
car travel and on consumers disposable income 
the increase in interest rates looms as another negative in the 
cost of doing business not so incidentally it enhances the 
comparative allure of interestbearing investments that compete 
with stocks for investors favor 
as the stock market struggled to cope with such unsettling 
thoughts it took a steep drop in the past week to its lowest 
levels in more than a year 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed friday at 
253292 down 11188 from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 1004 to 
17105 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
dropped 2616 to 36733 and the american stock exchange market 
value index was down 1732 at 31629 
volume on the big board averaged 18986 million shares a day 
against 14795 million the week before 
late in the week a flurry of stories crossed financial news 
wires carrying word of companies budgeting money to buy back shares 
of their stocks 
that was reminiscent of the aftermath of the 1987 market crash 
when buyback plans sprang up by the hundreds 
in one of the most notable early instances this time federal 
national mortgage association announced that it had earmarked as 
much as 500 million for purchases of its common shares and 
warrants 
buybacks by themselves are far from any assurance that the 
worst of a market decline is over but they provided one sign that 
stock prices had at last fallen far enough from their july peaks to 
attract a few venturesome buyers operating from a longterm point 
of view

while the middle east crisis holds profound implications for the 
economy grain and soybean prices seem to have been little moved by 
the iraqs invasion of kuwait 
its not that whats going on in the persian gulf and other 
financial markets is unimportant to farm commodities rather the 
crisis is sending a mixed message 
theyre getting inflation and recession signals at the same 
time said walter spilka an analyst with smith barney harris 
upham amp co 
the higher oil and precious metals prices are inflationary and 
should be pulling grain prices higher 
but if we do have a recession people will be going out to 
dinner less and switching more to chicken spilka said the 
things that use up corn the most are steaks and hamburgers 
the worldwide supply of corn and other grains contains other 
puzzling elements in the united states corn supplies are tight 
in lots of areas there just isnt any said analyst william 
biedermann research director of allendale inc a futures 
brokerage in crystal lake ill in other areas there is some 
corn but farmers just arent selling 
for the last three years weve been consuming more than were 
producing he said 
the result biedermann said is that for the first time in the 
nations history corn stocks have dropped four years in a row 
the supply of corn on hand at the end of this marketing year is 
expected to be 133 billion bushels by september 1991 corn 
supplies are expected to be down to 12 billion 
yet the price of corn 257 on the chicago board of trade 
friday is low id say it costs more than 240 to grow it 
now spilka said 
the tight corn supplies happen to coincide with a little more 
wheat in the nations storage bins than a year ago and with better 
than average crops being reported in much of the northern 
hemisphere this season 
with the price of wheat not much above that of corn livestock 
growers will be feeding a lot more wheat than normal which 
depresses the price of corn overseas sales arent likely to help 
much either 
we have to export this stuff spilka said but there are 
better crops this year in the soviet union and a big wheat crop in 
china 
the fact that grain prices remain depressed seems to be an 
indication that the trade believes there is going to be plenty for 
what demand develops 
the ending stocks were seeing now is not the final number 
spilka said the market probably is saying that the stocks are 
not going to be this tight 
if the country was booming the stock market going up gas 
prices ok then there would be an explosive potential on the up 
side he said 
but under present conditions he said theres no anticipation 
of renewed demand

a financial adviser afraid to face his 
clients admitted in a videotape message that he lost about 100 
million of investors money by making risky trades in stock options 
more than 1000 investors may be affected according to lawyers 
included are several large retirement funds 
words arent adequate to express my regret and sorrow said 
jim donahue head of the hedged securities associates limited 
partnership based in the denver suburb of englewood i feel 
terrible remorse for the things ive done to you 
h alan dill attorney for the partnership said the 
organization has about 525 million in assets remaining and will 
seek bankruptcy protection to sort out investor claims 
he said the biggest loser was the retirement fund of 
weyerhaeuser co of tacoma wash which lost about 30 million 
in a statement weyerhaeuser said only a small percentage of 
our total pension funds was invested there and our pension funding 
continues to be very sound 
the company said aggregate assets of its pension funds exceeded 
850 million at the end of 1989 
the facts in this situation are still unclear and since a 
legal evaluation is under way we cannot comment further the 
wood products company said 
donahue sent a videotape to an investor meeting thursday instead 
of appearing personally because he feared for his safety according 
to aides 
while the 18minute message was played to an overflow crowd 
security guards walked through the audience 
donahue 62 was known as an aggressive trader in stock options 
contracts to buy or sell a stock for a specified price in the 
future 
during the past 11 years he claimed annual returns of 20 
percent or better by hedging his bets in the options market 
donahue ran into trouble when he bet on an upturn in the shares 
of united airlines parent company ual corp 
the stock turned down after an employee group failed to line up 
financing to buy the company and on iraqs invasion of kuwait 
the loss is extensive and involves most of the total assets 
of the fund he said my words cannot possibly alleviate the 
emotional or financial impact on each person involved

usair inc said friday it will eliminate 
2100 more positions during the next four months bringing to 3600 
the total number of layoffs announced this week 
the layoffs were ordered to cut operating costs before 1991 
when the rate of business growth is expected to decline usair 
spokesman mike clark said 
we expect softening passenger demand poor economic conditions 
generally escalating fuel costs clark said 
usair currently has about 54000 employees workers to be laid 
off include 500 managers 211 pilots 650 flight attendants and 
2100 reservation clerks and other fleet service employees 
the carrier previously forecast 6 percent growth for next year 
but recently completed reviews have reduced that number to 2 
percent 
so what we have is people who were hired pretty much in 
anticipation of a continuing growth rate that has been scaled back 
and we just simply do not need that many people clark said 
company officials do not know whether any more layoffs will be 
ordered before the end of the year he said
