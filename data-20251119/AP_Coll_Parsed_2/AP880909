tentative agreement was reached thursday on sept 25 as the date 
for the first of two presidential campaign debates between democrat 
michael dukakis and republican george bush while top aides were 
working out details the rival candidates were emphasizing defense 
policy during appearances in texas and kentucky 
dukakis told the american legion that a mountain of debt 
built up during the reagan administration was endangering national 
defense while bush observing the fiery destruction of us 
missiles to comply with a new treaty hailed the day we began to 
reverse the arms race 
the tentative debate agreement was announced by dukakis campaign 
chairman paul brountas who said the two candidates would meet on 
sept 25 at wake forest university in winstonsalem nc brountas 
said the second presidential debate would be oct 13 or 14 
depending on the baseball playoff schedule 
the debates will be general in topic rather than having one on 
domestic and one on foreign and defense policy said mark goodin a 
bush campaign spokesman he said the second presidential debate 
would be held somewhere on the west coast 
vice presidential nominees lloyd bentsen and dan quayle will 
debate during the first week in october 
we are still discussing format staging and the length of the 
debates and we will continue to carry on those discussions 
brountas said after meeting with bushs campaign chairman james a 
baker iii 
nbc news president michael gartner announced the network would 
not televise the first debate live because of its commitment to 
olympic games coverage he said nbc would air a delayed tape of the 
debate after its olympic broadcast 
bush was at longhorn army ammunition plant in karnack texas to 
join other us and soviet officials in witnessing the demolition 
of two pershing missile engines 
he called the occasion one of those unique moments in the 
career of man a moment when the tides of history turned that a 
new future dawned 
the engines were among about 850 weapons to be destroyed by the 
united states under the ussoviet treaty that eliminated 
mediumrange missiles from europe the soviets have destroyed 
several of their missiles 
the missile stages we destroy today are just a beginning 
said bush it is a moment we will be able to tell our children 
and grandchildren about this was the day we began to reverse the 
arms race this was the day we began destroying the weapons of 
destruction 
sheila tate bushs campaign spokesman said the vice president 
now favors an increase in the minimum wage which has been 335 an 
hour for the past eight years in line with reagan administration 
policy bush has opposed an increase in the past 
tate did not say how much of an increase bush would favor 
dukakis has made a call for a higher minimum wage a central theme 
of his campaign 
the nations largest teachers union announced its endorsement 
of dukakis for president and called for an end to eight years of 
teacher bashing under the reagan administration 
mary hatwood futrell president of the 19 million member 
national education association said the union would mobilize at 
least 500000 volunteers for the dukakis campaign 
a new poll done by louis harris amp associates for business week 
magazine said bush had a 50 percent to 44 percent lead over 
dukakis among likely voters the survey of 1299 people was taken 
sept 1 through sept 6 and had a margin of error of 3 percentage 
points meaning the possibility exists that the two candidates 
could be in a dead heat 
however david krane of the polling firm noted that the results 
were a reversal of a survey taken a month earlier and said we 
feel hes bush ahead at this point 
dukakis addressed the 70th annual convention of the american 
legion in louisville ky and he said the budget deficits of the 
reagan years were hindering efforts to build up the nations 
military forces 
bush and reagan addressed the legion convention earlier in the 
week and used their appearances to denounce dukakis views on 
defense 
after eight years and 2 trillion we still dont have an 
antitank weapon that can stop modern soviet tanks dukakis said 
we cannot build a strong national defense on a mountain of debt 
the massachusetts governor also backed continued research on 
star wars the spacebased missile defense system and said he 
would support deployment if it were proven the system would be 
effective and was in the national interest 
however when questioned by reporters he also said deployment 
would violate the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty and that he 
wanted to keep that agreement 
i think it is in our best interest to observe that treaty 
dukakis said for our own sake we have to continue with 
research 
republican vice presidential nominee dan quayle touted star wars 
known officially as the strategic defense initiative in a 
speech to the city club of chicago 
the next president should make every effort to determine 
whether he or his successor could develop and deploy a second red 
button not just the button of retaliation but the button of 
protection said the indiana senator 
he also said the united states must strengthen its strategic and 
conventional forces even while trying to conclude agreement with 
the soviets to reduce in both areas 
we must probe the soviet position on start working to 
conclude an agreement while modernizing our forces he said 
we must probe the soviet position on conventional forces while 
continuing initiatives to strengthen our conventional force 
posture and we must probe soviet willingness to restrain their 
clients and to determine whether soviet new thinking will in fact 
lead to behavior that can lower the possibilities for regional 
conflicts said quayle 
his democratic counterpart texas sen lloyd bentsen followed 
dukakis lead in attacking the reagan budget deficits 
during this election youre going to hear a lot about a 
fiveyear economic boom he told a business audience on long 
island ny referring to the current expansion but he said 
accomplishing that was no trick when the government was writing 
hot checks with deficits of more than 150 billion a year 
if you listen to this administration you would think they are 
fiscal conservatives he said but they have not submitted one 
balanced budget 
were all going to pay the price for this borrowandspend 
philosophy 
on another front the cleveland plain dealer reported in its 
friday editions that quayle entered law school in 1970 through an 
experimental program that was a precursor to affirmative action 
efforts at the indiana university law school 
the plain dealer said the law school admissions program was 
intended to offer equal opportunity to minorities the 
economically disadvantaged and other students of different 
viewpoints and backgrounds 
quayle spokesman jeff nesbit said the program was for kids who 
didnt make the first cut but showed promise had something in 
their application that showed they had what it would take in dans 
case graduation from one of the finest colleges in the midwest 
depauw the harvard of the midwest the top of the top

following a successful practice 
countdown with discoverys five astronauts nasa officials said 
they hope this month to launch the first space shuttle since the 
challenger disaster nearly three years ago 
you have a feeling this train is about to leave the station 
and were about to get on board astronaut mike lounge said after 
thursdays exercise the last major milestone before discoverys 
launch 
we clearly demonstrated that were ready to pick up the count 
for real i hope that we will be able to do that by the end of the 
month kennedy space center director forrest s mccartney told 
the launch team 
the test concluded three days of training here for the 
astronauts they flew back to houstons johnson space center where 
they planned to concentrate on flight simulator work between now 
and launch time 
lounge and discovery commander rick hauck will return here for 
launch and flight readiness reviews tuesday and wednesday with key 
shuttle managers nasa is expected to announce a launch date after 
wednesdays meeting 
officials have been discussing a date from sept 26 to sept 29 
hauck lounge and the other crew members dick covey george 
nelson and dave hilmers climbed aboard discovery for the final two 
hours of the practice count pulling switches testing 
communications and monitoring systems just as they will on launch 
day 
the only problem was with a ground communications link between 
the launch control center and the spacecraft it was corrected but 
delayed completion of the countdown 34 minutes 
during their fourday missions the astronauts are scheduled to 
deploy a communications satellite test new spaceship systems and 
conduct science and technology experiments 
the shuttle fleet has been grounded since the jan 28 1986 
challenger explosion that killed all seven crew members 73 seconds 
after liftoff

a woman who admitted trying to kill two 
previous husbands for insurance money got married again in a 
ceremony performed by the judge who sentenced her to 20 years in 
prison a day earlier 
linda sue jones 37 exchanged wedding vows with william dobbs 
during a brief courthouse ceremony conducted thursday by superior 
court judge george g grover 
i really dont want to discuss it grover said afterward 
her getting married isnt an issue in the case at all people get 
married every day 
but deputy district attorney diane harrison thought it was 
unusual 
i think that is very ironic its like henry viii but shes 
up to number three the prosecutor said 
dobbs has known ms jones for about 20 years and was considered 
a family friend for a long time said her attorney david gunn 
she wore jail clothes during the brief ceremony said gunn 
the choice of judges didnt result from any special affinity 
between jurist and defendant gunn said but from convenience 
if her case had been assigned to some other judge she probably 
would have made the same request gunn said 
ms jones who stood to collect 600000 in insurance benefits 
had the murders been successful pleaded guilty wednesday to three 
counts of attempted murder two of solicitation to murder and one 
of gun theft 
gunn said she pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors to avoid 
the possibility of two consecutive life terms if convicted 
the bride who most recently lived in torrance calif was 
sentenced to prison for several 1987 incidents 
in may her estranged husband douglas hilliker was chased 
through the couples lake elsinore home and managed to dodge three 
bullets fired by 18yearold jeffrey burke who was hired by ms 
jones the prosecutor said 
hilliker who has since divorced ms jones survived because 
burke ran out of bullets in the 45caliber weapon she said 
in another attempt three days earlier the prosecutor said 
burke tried to kill hilliker by trying to flag down his car on the 
freeway the 50yearold hilliker who named his wife as 
beneficiary on a 500000 life insurance policy refused to stop 
his car 
burke has pleaded guilty to attempted murder and faces up to 11 
years in prison when sentenced next month 
the other attempted murder occurred two months earlier 
the prosecution said ms jones hired a man to kill exhusband 
eric jones of visalia in march 1987 with the exhusband out of the 
way she stood to collect 100000 in benefits from the death of 
their teenaged son who was killed in a 1986 motorcycle accident 
the hired killer eventually backed out of the the deal the 
prosecutor said

no newts is bad news park officials say 
in an outpouring of compassion for a burdened creature that 
lives under rocks and eats bugs and worms the east bay regional 
park district is for the sake of love about to lend a hand or 
at least a right of way 
the 4inchlong tailed amphibians die by the hundreds under the 
wheels of vehicles when the newts cross the main road in tilden 
park during the fall to mate district spokesman ned mackay said 
this week 
with their weak legs salamanders are not equipped to scoot 
across roads dodging cars he said the only answer is to 
occasionally reserve the road as a freeway for newts he said 
the agency is officially devoted to the little lizards 
conducting seasonal newt walks to allow citizens to ogle the 
critters when they emerge from their summer havens and head for the 
marshes to make more newts 
to better protect them the district announced that tilden park 
will periodically close the roads after heavy rains probably 
during evening hours when hordes of the newts make their 
lovedriven treks 
signs are to be posted on a onemile stretch of the main drive 
that warn motorists of closures said mackay 
less drastic measures to save the newts from slaughter have been 
tried to no avail in 1975 four signs were posted that said 
caution newts xing together with a largerthanlife portrait

the average homicide victim in the united states 
is 32 and each years killings together mean more than 600000 
years that go unlived according to federal government scientists 
the us centers for disease control reported thursday that in 
1985 its latest year for such analysis the 18351 homicides in 
the united states resulted in 612556 years of potential life 
lost by the victims 
since 1968 the toll of homicides in terms of potential life has 
risen 44 percent the atlantabased cdc reported during that same 
time the total of lifeyears lost to early deaths from all causes 
went down 25 percent 
years of potential life lost before age 65 are measured by the 
cdc in studies of the most common causes of premature death 
sixtyfive is a statistical benchmark the actual us life 
expectancy is higher on the average a homicide victim in the 
united states is 32 years old at the time of death the cdc noted 
the cdc in its weekly report called for increased cooperation 
among the criminal justice social services health care mental 
health and public health sectors to prompt development of 
effective programs for prevention of homicides 
black males continue to have by far the highest homicide rate 
the cdc said in 1985 6284 black men died from homicide a rate 
of 49 out of every 100000 white men died in 7467 homicides for 
a rate of 8 per 100000 
black female homicides numbered 1550 for a rate of 11 per 
100000 2630 white females died in homicides at a rate of 3 per 
100000 
there was an encouraging note in thursdays report the cdc 
cited studies published earlier this year showing that the homicide 
rate for young black men is dropping 
the homicide rate for black males 1524 the highestrisk group 
for homicide fell 13 percent from 1978 to 1984 the last year 
that such figures were available the number dropped from 1934 
homicides and a rate of 70 per 100000 in 1978 to 1710 homicides 
and a rate of 62 per 100000 in 1984 
government health officials have set a goal of reducing the 
homicide rate among black males 1524 to less than 60 per 100000 
by the next decade the cdc said statistics suggest the 1990 
objective for this target group can be attained

soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
will visit washington this month for talks with secretary of state 
george p shultz on prospects for superpower relations and arms 
control agreements during president reagans final months in 
office administration sources say 
the sept 2223 visit is to be announced next week but three 
us officials disclosed the plan thursday and said reagan may 
participate in at least part of the discussions 
over his nearly eight years in office the president gradually 
has shifted from harsh antisoviet rhetoric and inaction on arms 
control to a cooperative stance illustrated by four summit meetings 
with soviet general secretary mikhail s gorbachev and a treaty 
last year to ban all us and soviet intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said there 
were no plans for a fifth summit meeting however reports persist 
that reagan and gorbachev will have a final session in vienna 
budapest or new york before the end of the year 
negotiators in geneva are meeting on proposals to reduce 
longrange nuclear weapons and to limit weapons tests they also 
are trying to set up eastwest talks on cutbacks in conventional 
forces in europe 
after their session us and soviet experts will meet in 
washington in a joint effort to slow the proliferation of ballistic 
missiles in the middle east and other areas of the world 
the us officials said shultz and shevardnadze would take up 
several regional problems including afghanistan 
the administration has expressed satisfaction with the pace of a 
soviet troop withdrawal from the wartorn country but is concerned 
about the continuing conflict between the afghan government and 
usbacked rebels and its spillover into neighboring pakistan 
surveying other regional problems shultz intends to question 
shevardnadze about prospects for the withdrawal of vietnamese 
forces from cambodia and to review usled diplomatic efforts to 
work out a settlement in angola and to promote independence for 
namibia the sources said 
shultz and shevardnadze last met in may in geneva to iron out 
implementation of the ussoviet treaty banning intermediaterange 
nuclear weapons and then assisted reagan and gorbachev at the 
moscow summit at the end of the month 
their sessions over the years on arms control paved the way for 
the historic weaponsban treaty and an overall improvement in 
ussoviet relations 
still the officials said there was no indication reagan would 
hold a fifth and final summit with gorbachev before leaving office 
next january also differences over monitoring several types of 
strategic nuclear weapons apparently still stand in the way of a 
new treaty 
shultz and shevardnadze may continue their talks in new york the 
week of sept 26 when both plan to attend the special session of 
the un general assembly

two american satellites designed to 
improve telephone and television service in the united states were 
in orbit today after a flawless launch into space by an ariane 
rocket 
the ariane 3 rocket lifted off at 8 pm thursday 7 pm edt 
from the european space agencys launch site on the edge of the 
guianian jungle on the northeastern coast of south america 
about 17 minutes later the rocket attained orbit altitude and 
both of the satellites separated successfully from the vehicle 
officials at the space center called the launch a complete 
success 
frederic dallest president of arianespace the company created 
to handle commercial shots called the 25th launch of an ariane 
rocket a special launch a symbolic shot 
after the challenger catastrophe of 1986 we were the only 
ones capable of assuring with the heavy responsibility that that 
implies the replacement of the free worlds satellites that were 
coming to the end of their lives he said 
the satellites aboard the ariane 3 belong to gtespacenet and to 
satellite transponder leasing corporation a division of ibm 
both are designed to expand and improve television signal 
distribution numeric telephone communications and data 
transmission in the continental united states alaska and hawaii 
the gstar iii weighing 2799 pounds will complete gtes 
network of three spacenet satellites all the satellites built by 
general electrics astro space division were launched aboard 
european rockets 
the sbs5 constructed by hughes aircraft corp weighs 2735 
pounds and is expected to function for about a decade a similar 
satellite was launched in 1984 and a third in the sbs series is 
under construction 
three more ariane launches are scheduled before the end of the 
year including the november launch of an ariane4 the new 
generation of european rocket if the launches are successful 
arianespace will have fired eight rockets into space this year 
ariane holds 50 percent of the commercial launch market and 
holds contracts for 41 launches worth 22 billion dallest said 
arianespace had 30 rockets under construction and was in the 
process of ordering 50 more 
we have found clients throughout the world including the 
united states we think having 20 to 25 percent of the american 
market is feasible he said

westinghouse electric corp next year will 
begin operating the federal governments aging atomic reactor 
complex in south carolina that produces nuclear weapons material 
joseph salgado acting deputy secretary of energy announced 
thursday that the department of energy had selected 
pittsburghbased westinghouse for the 5year operating contract 
worth an estimated 67 billion 
westinghouse was competing with martin marietta corp for the 
right to replace the du pont co as operator of the savannah river 
plant du pont which built the plant and operated it for more than 
30 years announced last fall it would not renew its contract when 
it expires next april 
the selection process resulted in the choice of the single 
proposer which i believe will operate srp in the best interest of 
this nation salgado said 
all three operating reactors at the plant currently are shut 
down because of safety concerns or maintenance operations 
westinghouse operates six other doe nuclear facilities the 
company will begin operations at the savannah river plant on nov 
1 working with du pont during a fivemonth transition period 
doe spokeswoman chris sankey said du pont employees working at 
the plant will be guaranteed continued employment with westinghouse 
john c marous chairman and chief executive officer of 
westinghouse said in a statement that his company will be 
committed to total quality of all phases of operation 
energy secretary john herrington last month recommended the 
savannah river plant as the site for a newly designed reactor to 
produce all the tritium needed for the nations nuclear weapons 
program he also recommended construction of a smaller nuclear 
reactor to produce weapons materials in idaho 
the new reactors eventually would replace the three aging 
reactors at srp and one at the hanford nuclear reservation in 
washington state

us and soviet specialists are mapping out an 
ambitious series of cooperative programs including an exchange of 
nuclear power plant inspectors in the wake of the first visit to 
the soviet union by a chairman of the nuclear regulatory commission 
we laid the groundwork for a very hopeful very positive 
exchange in the future nrc chairman lando w zech jr said 
thursday 
the aug 1931 soviet trip by a delegation headed by zech 
included an inspection tour of the chernobyl reactor that exploded 
and burned in april 1986 killing 31 people and forcing evacuation 
of a large surrounding area in the ukraine 
the american group also visited nuclear plants at novovoronezh 
and rovno as well as a reactor fabrication facility near leningrad 
talks held in moscow by the delegation involved the first 
meeting of a new ussoviet joint coordinating committee for 
civilian nuclear reactor safety 
our discussions were very candid very open and i would say 
very productive zech told reporters 
while the americans and soviets discussed differences in the 
design construction and operation of nuclear plants he said it 
was clear to me that we have much more in common than we do 
differences 
zech said both sides agreed that if there is to be any future 
for nuclear power we certainly must keep the current plants 
operating safely 
james m taylor the nrcs deputy executive director for 
operations said the joint coordinating committee had agreed on a 
yearlong series of meetings seminars and exchanges in both 
countries including an exchange of nuclear power plant safety 
inspectors 
we hope that the exchange of inspectors will take place during 
the summer months next year taylor said 
he said the program also would involve sharing of technical data 
with the soviets in several areas of key interest to the united 
states among them 
radiationcaused embrittlement of reactor components and 
fullscale annealing of reactor vessels 
studies of health and environmental effects in the wake of the 
chernobyl disaster its very important information to predict 
and to understand the effects of radiation on health and the 
environment taylor said 
erosion and corrosion of nuclear plant piping 
zech said that while it was clear from the us groups onsite 
visits that the soviets have undertaken numerous safety 
modifications since chernobyl we did not make any overall safety 
assessment of their plants 
at chernobyl the delegation was able to go inside one layer of 
the concrete tomb built around the crippled reactor to see the 
control room and view the firewracked core through a periscope 
zech said they were the first nonsoviets to go inside the tomb 
at all three nuclear plant sites visited zech said it seemed 
to me that the senior managers we met were businesslike and 
were safetyminded 
robert newlin an agency spokesman said the trip marked the 
first visit to the soviet union by a chairman of the nrc which was 
established in 1974 as successor to the atomic energy commission

imports of grapes apples and other items are 
growing rapidly to help satisfy a growing american appetite for 
fresh fruit agriculture department analysts say 
last year for example total fresh fruit imports jumped 20 
percent to 12 million metric tons from 996000 in 1986 says a 
report by the departments economic research service 
this years drought also is expected to help boost us demand 
for some items thus adding to the growth in fruit imports a shift 
in exchange rates and demographic factors also has had an effect 
grapes made up 21 percent of the fresh fruit imports last year 
with most coming from chile apples accounted for 12 percent of the 
total mostly divided among canada chile and new zealand 
the report said the us dollar has been declining against 
european currency the japanese yen and the canadian dollar since 
1985 but it has risen against the currencies of many major us 
agricultural trading partners 
as a result products from these countries are very 
competitive in the us market the report said relative 
production costs abroad particularly in south america and mexico 
where many fruits are grown make these countries relatively more 
competitive in the us market 
demographic changes also have favored the rise in fruit imports 
the report said a growth in the number of women in the nations 
work force for example has led to greater demand for convenience 
food 
growth in major ethnic groups is impacting food demand in the 
united states the report said generally the diets of these 
groups have a higher proportion and wider variety of fruits than 
the typical american diet 
the report added also within the united states knowledge of 
and concern for health and nutrition have increased in the past 10 
years leading to increased consumption of fresh fruits 
chile has passed south africa australia and argentina to become 
the leading supplier of fresh fruit to north america and europe 
during the winter months 
because chiles grapes come into season during the us winter 
months grapes are now available year round to the us market 
the report said 
apples are also a major chilean export and these compete with 
the us domestic crop in 1983 imports of chilean apples totaled 
14780 metric tons last year those totaled 43020 tons another 
growing import are chilean pears up from 4216 tons in 1983 to 
14797 tons last year 
exports of fresh fruit by the united states have run ahead of 
imports but the gap is narrowing 
in 1986 exports totaled 136 million tons compared with 
imports of 996000 last year exports at 15 million tons compared 
with 12 million tons of imports

democrats say they will try to move a minimum 
wage increase through congress this year but the issue is being 
complicated by presidential politics 
members of the house and senate who handle labor legislation met 
thursday and agreed to try for final passage of the legislation 
before congress adjourns for the year next month 
but it was also clear that differences between democrats and 
republicans could doom the bill the reagan administration has 
steadfastly opposed boosting the wage base which has stood at 
335 an hour since 1981 
george bush the republican presidential nominee told 
knightridder newspapers wednesday that he would soon propose 
some adjustment in the minimum wage bushs new position 
represents an attempt to gain support from bluecollar voters and 
came shortly after a campaign appearance at which he was booed 
repeatedly by shipyard workers in oregon 
sen edward kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor 
committee noted the political implications on wednesday 
weve been battling on these issues for the last seven years 
and its fair to say where was george when we carried those 
measures in the full committee or the subcommittee theres been 
absolute silence he said 
the democraticcontrolled congress has been poised for weeks to 
consider legislation that would raise the minimum wage to 455 an 
hour by 1991 in a senate bill and to 505 hourly by 1992 under a 
house measure 
in an effort to pass the proposal by the time congress adjourns 
next month house democratic leaders have agreed to accept the 
lower senate figure on thursday kennedy house labor committee 
chairman augustus f hawkins and others met and agreed to try to 
move the bill quickly 
the measure however faces the threat of a veto by president 
reagan 
in addition republicans are ready to introduce amendments that 
many democrats oppose 
chief among them is a proposal for a training wage lower 
than the minimum wage that businesses would be allowed to pay new 
workers in the knightridder interview bush indicated support for 
a training wage 
republicans say the training wage which could be paid to each 
worker for only a few months would create extra jobs but 
democratic opponents say the provision would be a loophole that 
would allow companies to pay less money to millions of workers 
while not guaranteeing that any of them actually receive training 
democratic aides say such a proposal might pass but would doom 
the overall bill because liberals bitterly oppose the training wage 
and would vote against a final package that contains it 
hawkins dcalif said he considered the training wage proposal 
to be a killer amendment and said he would pull the bill from 
the house floor if the amendment was passed 
id disown it myself he said 
removing the bill from consideration however would allow bush 
to contrast his newfound support for a minimum wage boost with a 
democratic decision to postpone consideration of such an increase 
until at least next year 
rep thomas e petri of wisconsin ranking republican on the 
labor standards subcommittee which oversees the minimum wage said 
he did not know what minimum wage changes bush favors 
i hope when the vice president spells out the changes he has 
in mind well have a chance to vote on them on the floor he 
said 
petri and sen rudy boschwitz rminn have introduced bills 
that would expand the earned income tax credit to which poor 
working families are entitled they say that such a change would 
help lowincome workers more efficiently than a minimum wage 
increase which they say would have more of an impact on workers in 
the middle class 
currently lowincome workers are allowed tax credits of up to 
874 a break that petri and boschwitz would expand by for the 
first time increasing it according to the size of workers families 
republican vice presidential nominee sen dan quayle rind 
has been an ardent opponent of democratic attempts to raise the 
minimum wage 
but he along with petri and many other republican lawmakers 
support a different formula that would raise the minimum wage to 4 
hourly institute a training wage and increase the earned income 
tax credit it is unclear if this is the idea bush favors

a bill of rights for taxpayers involved in 
disputes with the internal revenue service is a step closer to 
becoming law as part of a catchall package of tax changes written 
by the senate finance committee 
the bill of rights is designed to change what sen david pryor 
dark chairman of the finance subcommittee on the irs has called 
a bully mentality in the agency that aims to strike fear in 
the hearts of all taxpayers to force compliance 
meeting behind closed doors the finance committee agreed 
thursday to attach the bill of rights to a huge bill whose chief 
purpose is to correct errors and clear up ambiguities in the 1986 
tax overhaul 
that technical corrections bill approved earlier by the 
committee already contains a provision repealing a new law that 
has required farmers and other offroad users of diesel to pay the 
tax of 151 cents a gallon on the fuel and apply later for a refund 
the committee added a sheaf of new provisions on thursday 
including short extensions of some expiring tax credits and the tax 
increases to pay for them overall aides said the bill would not 
worsen the budget deficit it would cut some taxes by 23 billion 
over three years while raising others by 23 billion 
a much larger package already has been approved by the house it 
would raise 71 billion in taxes to finance 71 billion in 
targeted tax cuts if the senate passes the finance committee bill 
negotiators would attempt to work out a compromise between the two 
versions 
in general the senate bill would extend expiring provisions for 
shorter periods than the house plan but there are other 
differences for example the house bill includes but the senate 
bill does not permanent relief for about 20 million mutual fund 
shareholders who otherwise would be unable to deduct some or all of 
certain operating expenses of the fund 
on the other hand the house measure does not include the 
taxpayer bill of rights 
pryor and other lawmakers have been pressing for such 
legislation since hearings last year uncovered evidence that some 
irs field managers often ignore policy directives from washington 
and that some agents have shown little regard for the rights of 
taxpayers 
under the bill the irs would have to give a written explanation 
of rights to any taxpayer being audited or subjected to collections 
actions and would be prohibited from promoting employees on the 
basis of how much money they collect the agency would have to give 
30day notice compared with 10 days now before seizing a bank 
account the measure also would exempt more of a persons wages and 
property from seizure 
in addition the legislation would give a taxpayer the right to 
taperecord meetings with the irs require the irs to forgive any 
penalty that was imposed because of erroneous advice furnished by 
the agency permit the irs ombudsman to halt any agency action that 
would impose a significant hardship on a taxpayer and require that 
any taxdue notice include a full explanation 
the irs opposes most of the changes as unneeded insisting for 
example that it already prohibits promotions on the basis of 
collections 
other parts of the package approved thursday would 
retroactively repeal a 1986 provision that prohibited freelance 
writers photographers and artists from deducting expenses of a 
project until it produced income the same relief would be granted 
some livestock producers who otherwise would have to pay what has 
come to be known as a heifer tax 
disallow any business deduction for the basic monthly charge 
for a home telephone 
extend through june 1989 a tax exemption for certain bonds used 
to help lowerincome families buy their first home 
renew for 1988 only a tax exclusion for educational assistance 
provided by an employer most graduatelevel study would not 
qualify similarly an exclusion for employerpaid legal services 
would be extended through this year 
extend through march 31 a credit for increased spending for 
research and experimentation 
renew a tax break for healthy savings and loan associations 
that take over failing associations and extend the benefit to 
banks 
permit use of taxexempt bonds to finance certain highspeed 
rail facilities 
allow farmers who are forced by drought to sell draft 
sporting dairy or breeding livestock to delay tax on such income 
for a year 
make it more difficult to avoid taxes on investment in 
singlepremium life insurance policies whose cash value builds at a 
faster rate than those whose premiums are paid in seven equal 
installments 
require certain corporations that have underpaid estimated 
taxes to pay the shortages fully in the next quarter 
allow an 80 percent deduction for contributions to college 
athletic scholarship funds even when such gifts are a way to 
ensure good seats at athletic events 
permit rural letter carriers to deduct 3375 cents for each 
mile they use a personal car on their route that is 150 percent 
the usual rate

in the middle of this sunbaked 
anatolian plateau in western turkey us archaeologists are 
working to preserve the tomb of king midas around whom grew the 
myth of the golden touch 
archaeologists believe the 2600yearold tomb is the oldest 
standing wooden structure in the world 
about 90 pyramidshaped mounds of earth rise on the land where 
the phrygians had their ancient capital of gordion 
the largest and highest of the burial mounds is believed to be 
the tomb of king midas believed to have lived from 725 bc to 675 
bc 
the tomb chamber within a mound about 150 feet high and 900 
feet in diameter has started to show signs of deterioration 
mostly because of lack of air circulation and the high rate of 
humidity inside the grave 
there are cracks in the north wall and the wall is slightly 
bulging out explained professor kenneth sams of the university 
of north carolina who has undertaken the preservation work in the 
name of the university of pennsylvania museum 
there is no imminent danger of collapse but we want to keep 
this unique monument as it is for the coming generations he said 
the tomb was excavated in 1957 under the direction of the late 
rodney s young of the university of pennsylvania 
according to historians it was the phrygians who first 
introduced the tumulus or mound burial style in anatolia this 
small central anatolian village is 60 miles southwest of the 
turkish capital city of ankara 
thirty grave chambers have been excavated 25 by the us 
excavators over the past few decades and the rest by the germans in 
1900 
the midas chamber was made of squared logs and an outer casing 
of round logs of juniper and pine to take the pressure of the 
rubble from a wall covering the tomb phyrgians built a roof and a 
waterproof stone covering on top of the tomb and then covered it 
with tons of earth 
the body and funeral gifts were placed inside the rectangular 
chamber which measures about 320 square feet 
large white fungi today cover the upper sections of the wooden 
chamber 
they are slowly eating the wood says sams we have to 
bring mycologists fungi specialists here to determine how many 
kinds of fungi exist here and why they find this place so 
comfortable 
sams said the archaeologists are in the preliminary stage of the 
conservation work first they are trying to find the reason for 
the fluctuations in the humidity which ranges from a low of 35 
percent to a high of 85 percent while temperatures remain steady 
throughout the year at about 60 degrees 
the phrygians moved into anatolia from thrace and the balkan 
peninsula in 10th century bc and became the major power in asia 
minor in the 9th century bc inheriting the remains of the 
hittite civilization they served as a cultural bridge from the 
hittites to the anatolian civilizations of the lydians and the 
greeks 
they bequeathed to greek mythology and roman religion their 
mothergoddess cybele 
professor ekrem akurgal one of turkeys most prominent 
archaeologists said many phyrgian kings were named midas but the 
one whose tomb is being preserved is the great monarch who 
established phrygian hegemony in asia minor and is mentioned in 
assyrian tablets of the period 
akurgal said this midas is the one on whom the legend of the 
golden touch is based 
according to the legend midas son of king gordius was a 
spendthrift who begged the gods for the power to turn anything he 
touched to gold his wish was granted but midas nearly starved 
because even the food he tried to eat turned to gold 
the curse was lifted when he cleansed himself by bathing in the 
river pactolus known today as sart cayi famous for its golden 
sands 
the burial mounds are on a site on which according to greek 
legend gordius tied his cart to a pole with an intricate knot 
the gordian knot oracles said that whoever untied the knot would 
rule asia alexander the great cut the knot with a stroke of his 
sword according to the story 
archaeologists today are particularly interested in the woodwork 
of the phrygians 
in the midas burial chamber excavators found remains of tables 
inlaid wooden screens bronze and leather belts bronze cauldrons 
and other items lying beside the skeleton of the king 
a team of us art conservators and archaeologists led by 
elizabeth simpson of the metropolitan museum of art in new york are 
restoring these artifacts 
this extraordinary furniture from gordion occupies a special 
place in the history of woodworking and of ancient art in 
general she said the inlay work is ingenious the geometric 
decoration bold and elegant 
the phrygians used wood of contrasting colors and displayed a 
unique sense of design in symmetry and patterns she said the 
findings from the tombs are also important because very little 
ancient wooden furniture has survived 
the team members have so far restored two inlaid screens and a 
wooden table that are on display in ankaras anatolian 
civilizations museum 
their restoration work sponsored by the us kress foundation 
of new york city continues at the laboratory of the ankara museum

senate republicans say domestic political 
considerations are the driving force behind a move to pass 
legislation this year removing us business investment from south 
africa and imposing a neartotal trade embargo 
but democrats pushing the economic sanctions bill as a means of 
increasing the cost of racial apartheid to pretorias 
whitedominated government say the issue is moral not political 
the reagan administration which has long opposed sanctions 
against south africa says imposing them now could undermine 
delicate talks in brazzaville the congo over the withdrawal of 
cuban troops from angola and independence for the territory of 
south west africa or namibia now under south african control 
the negotiations are in progress as we speak they are in a 
very delicate stage said charles freeman assistant secretary of 
state for legislative affairs 
freeman told the senate foreign relations committee on thursday 
that action on the sanctions bill now would cause both sides 
particulary south africa and cuba to harden their positions 
at the state department spokesman charles e redman said we 
are strongly opposed to the wideranging and punitive sanctions 
against south africa contained in the legislation we believe its 
far more likely to encourage resistance to change in south africa 
than promote a rapid end to apartheid 
the foreign relations panel set a vote on the sanctions bill for 
next wednesday leaving time for action on numerous amendments 
which are expected to be offered by opponents of the measure 
as the committee opened its consideration of the bill gop 
opponents accused democrats of trying to build a political issue 
that can be used against republican presidential candidate george 
bush in the fall campaign 
domestic political implications are driving this sen dan 
evans rwash said of the proposal to end virtually all us 
trade with and investment in south africa domestic election 
politics can do harm to foreign policy efforts 
sen rudy boschwitz rminn complained of democrats making 
moral statements as the elections approach 
it is an emotional issue coming shortly before the election 
he said it is the political season not deliberation that is 
moving this bill forward 
the 1988 democratic platform brands south africa as a 
terrorist state and democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis has called for sterner sanctions 
bush opposes sweeping sanctions saying the united states must 
remain engaged in south africa to retain influence over events 
there and to prevent communists from taking control 
sen paul simon dill a principal sponsor of the bill which 
is similar to the version passed by the house last month by a vote 
of 244132 said his advocacy of it is not politically motivated 
theres a time bomb ticking away and its not going to stop 
ticking because theres an american election said simon who just 
returned from five days in south africa 
chances of the new sanctions bill becoming law are considered 
slight in the month remaining before congress is scheduled to 
adjourn for the year 
if the senate were to pass the measure the lack of strong 
republican backing for it likely would deny supporters the votes 
needed to override an almost certain veto by president reagan 
backers of the sanctions bill said committee action would send a 
strong signal to south africa that it must end apartheid and would 
not threaten the brazzaville talks sen alan cranston dcalif 
noted that the talks have made significant progress since the house 
passed its version of the sanctions bill

what would a japanese rumba sound like how 
about blues written by johann sebastian bach 
tap the right keys on yaakov kirschens jfy music generator and 
a computer will compose an original ditty in any of a variety of 
musical styles ranging from druse arab folk dance to bebop 
kirschen a leading israeli cartoonist who created the jerusalem 
posts dry bones cartoon compares the process to breaking down 
music into basic genes that can be mixed and matched 
we take pieces of musical dna from different styles and tell 
the machine to recombine the pieces what we get is an original 
piece of music said kirschen 
as he spoke his fingers flashed across the keyboard to give a 
bongo beat to traditonal japanese music the result was well 
regrettable mixtures of classical and blues worked better 
with his machine kirschen says he can mimic almost any style 
and produce for example the songs the beatles might have written 
but never got around to 
the combinations are almost limitless and about 27 million 
variations in the styles can be generated almost instantly 
the machine can also vary the instrumentation changing from a 
clarinet to a trombone with a touch of the keys and it can print 
out an instant score of music 
such features are found in some commercial computers and music 
synthesizers 
but kirschen a 50yearold immigrant from brooklyn ny 
stresses that each computer tune from his music box is unique 
because it produces original songs even though the tunes bear some 
similarities to their parents 
he stressed that his machine did not store pieces of music only 
a computer analysis of the style the way notes and tempo were used 
there is no song stored in here only the relationships that 
the machine has found in the music said kirschen who works in 
creative confusion around a bank of screens sound boxes and 
halfeaten baigeleh the middle east version of bagels 
kirschen whose shock of untamed white hair gives him the 
appearance of a music conductor developed the music generator in 
part because of frustration at being unable to make music 
i can play 60 different instruments all of them badly he 
said stumbling through oh susannah on the harmonica 
using tunes he wrote on the jfy music generator kirschen 
registered as a member of the local musicians union as a composer 
sally ariel general mananager of kirschens lkp ltd in 
jerusalem said the firm is seeking a pioneer patent on the device 
jfy inc a long beach calif subsidiary is marketing the 
invention which costs about 25000 to studios that make films 
commercials and cartoons 
users say it is a useful took for making soundtracks because it 
can instantly invent a tune to match a mood and do it in any 
specified time period it is also not temperamental 
the machines wife or husband didnt get up in the morning and 
create problems so a composer cant work with a composer i have to 
make sure hes in the right mood to create the machine always 
meets the deadline said dan setton a filmmaker of set 
productions co in jerusalem 
denis de vallance who runs a film production studio in los 
angeles said he was using the machine to write background music 
for 26 films that need new sound tracks for marketing abroad and 
for animated films 
a big part of pictures is the ambience a lot of money and 
time goes into the background music but in the end hardly anyone 
notices it he said in a telephone interview this is a big 
time saver 
but he said there were many unanswered questions about copyright 
and that artificial music is likely to be as controversial as 
testtube babies 
it may put a lot of sidemen studio musicians out of work 
and thats a problem he said suggesting the issue should be 
explored with unions in advance 
also what happens if you produce a soundalike miami vice 
soundtrack is that a copyright violation i dont think anybody 
knows said de vallance 
de vallance said he is using the jfy music generator to write 
the base line and then have a composer score an original melody 
line for his films the copyright is shared by computer and 
composer he added

young men who go out at night with romance in 
their hearts and condoms in their wallets should find another 
storage place medical researchers say 
ozone a major component of smog and a product of lightning 
storms damages the latex in condoms and any practice threatening 
to tear condoms packaging and expose them to air should be 
avoided the researchers said 
its not something you should subject to putting in your back 
pocket or sitting on or in any way damaging said russell p 
sherwin a researcher at the university of southern california 
school of medicine in los angeles 
ozone is a lung irritant produced when industrial pollutants and 
nitrogen oxide react in the presence of sunlight it reaches high 
levels in us cities inhabited by a total of 75 million people 
the federal environmental protection agency estimated earlier this 
year 
us sales of condoms fueled in part by us surgeon general 
c everett koops endorsement as protection against aids totaled 
290 million last year and should jump 20 percent more this year 
market analysts have said 
sherwin and fellow researchers tested 20 unrolled unpackaged 
latex condoms exposing them to air containing 03 parts per 
million of ozone for 72 hours a level comparable to a stage 1 
smog alert in southern california 
afterward all but two condoms had obvious holes in them and 11 
burst at pressures far below those that condoms unexposed to 
ozonecontaining air were able to withstand the researchers said 
examination of the ozoneexposed condoms with an electron 
microscope also revealed deterioration the researchers reported in 
a letter in fridays journal of the american medical association 
the effect on latex of 03 parts per million of ozone for 72 
hours is serious and deserves consideration for all phases of 
condom storage including the storage and dispersion of 
nonpackaged condoms by sexually transmitted disease prevention and 
family planning clinics the researchers wrote 
sherwin said in a telephone interview wednesday the package 
seemed to provide protection as long at it was intact as long as 
it wasnt perforated or crinkled 
he said the researchers are continuing studies and plan to issue 
formal findings including whether another common pollutant 
nitrogen dioxide can penetrate typical condom packaging as it 
does other kinds of packaging and cause condoms to become faulty 
even when unopened 
the general advice that we offer on condoms holds said dr 
robert staab vice president of scientific affairs for schmid 
laboratories inc the nations no 2 condommaker behind carter 
wallace inc of new york 
that is that they are going to remain safe and effective for a 
normal life of a product which is in years as long as you keep 
them away from heat light and ozone staab said thursday from 
the companys little falls nj headquarters 
the companys packaging is designed partly with ozone in mind by 
choosing only raw materials that will seal properly to keep out 
heat light and ozone staab said 
schmid makes ramses sheik and koromex latex brands and fourex 
natural skins brands but the researchers declined to identify any 
of the brands of condoms involved 
natural skins condoms also are susceptible to damage from 
exposure to the environment staab added 
recent recalls of several condom lots have increased concern 
about their dependability the california researchers said 
our general advice is if upon opening a condom and it doesnt 
look right dont use it staab said

criminals have more rights than innocent 
people facing guardianship proceedings the houses foremost senior 
citizens advocate said in advancing a plan to end abuses in a 
system meant to help the elderly and infirm 
rep claude pepper dfla introduced the national guardianship 
rights act on thursday his 88th birthday with the declaration 
that the current system is a national disgrace 
his chief cosponsor rep don bonker dwash said the bill 
was designed to restore guardianship to a system which does 
indeed serve to protect our nations most vulnerable citizens 
people become wards of guardians if they are deemed incompetent 
to handle their own affairs the guardian assumes their legal 
rights possessions and decisionmaking authority the ward 
typically is not permitted to vote own property marry or make 
medical decisions more than half a million americans are wards of 
guardians 
because the imposition of guardianship is so onerous there 
must be strong national safeguards against unnecessary and unduly 
restrictive guardianships pepper said in a statement 
he labeled many state and local guardianship systems sleeping 
watchdogs of personal liberty and added even a convicted felon 
is guaranteed more rights in many areas than innocent elderly and 
disabled americans who are subjects of guardianship proceedings 
the elderly and infirm would have more rights and recourse under 
peppers bill and a similar measure that sen john heinz rpa 
plans to introduce next week in the senate guardians would have to 
meet new training and reporting requirements 
the attorney general could withhold federal money from states 
not in compliance with the pepperbonker bill the heinz bill pegs 
compliance to federal medicaid funds only 
the house select committee on agings health subcommittee 
chaired by pepper issued an explanatory document citing an 
extensive associated press series exposing problems in guardianship 
systems across the country and case studies presented at a 
subcommittee hearing on the issue 
the panel learned of numerous instances of fraud abuse and 
incompetence the examples included 
an 81yearold kansas woman who suffered a stroke and returned 
home to learn that a guardian had been appointed to handle her 
affairs after she finished mowing her lawn one day she was 
forcibly taken to a nursing home and remained there for five weeks 
before she got the guardianship removed 
a 23yearold michigan man a barroom janitor with no 
experience or training in handling money social work or law who 
was given a public guardian job within a year he was responsible 
for the lives of 80 people and 350000 in their income and assets 
he later was convicted of embezzling 130000 from his wards 
a los angeles woman appointed guardian of her mother who lost 
nearly all of her mothers 250000 in savings when she placed the 
money with a stockbroker who used it to trade options a new 
guardian was named 
peppers bill is designed to prevent these and similar 
situations anyone facing imposition of a guardianship would have 
to receive adequate notice of impending proceedings be represented 
by trained attorneys be afforded an examination by an independent 
professional team have the right to a jury trial and have the 
right to prompt appeal of the decision or the choice of guardian 
in addition guardians would have to be of competent character 
receive thorough training provide at least annual reports on the 
financial and physical wellbeing of the incapacitated person and 
be subject to annual review and automatic removal by the courts 
the ap studied more than 2000 guardianship cases peppers 
subcommittee cited several ap findings among them that 97 percent 
of guardianship petitions were approved and that 44 states require 
guardians to file regular accountings of a wards money but they 
were missing or incomplete in 48 percent of the files examined

the top federal savings and loan regulator is 
defending his agency against congressional charges that it is 
overstepping its authority in issuing billions of dollars in notes 
to rescue insolvent institutions 
in just the last three weeks the federal home loan bank board 
which regulates the nations 3000 sampls has pledged more than 12 
billion to prevent the failures of 48 savings institutions most of 
them in the oildependent southwest 
half of that assistance was in interestpaying promissory notes 
bringing the total of notes issued by the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp to 107 billion 
members of the house banking committee have expressed fear that 
regulators will pile up so much debt that a taxpayer bailout of the 
fslic which gets its money through an assessment on the industry 
will be inevitable 
it was never the intent of congress to give an open checkbook 
to any governmental agency said rep toby roth rwis who 
vowed never to vote for tax money to bail out the industry 
rep stan parris rva complained that other types of 
assistance offered by the bank board including various guarantees 
against loss are too openended 
its like giving my kids my credit card he said 
however bank board chairman m danny wall told the committee 
thursday that the notes are the most costeffective way of 
assisting insolvent institutions they are taxfree and thus the 
bank board has to pay less interest than on its other borrowings 
he said 
these are costs that will have to be paid by someone 
somehow he said a couple of months ago we were being 
criticized for not being fast enough 
wall was backed by rep richard h lehman dcalif who said 
i think you find yourself here today somewhat in a damned if you 
do damned if you dont type of situation 
other members of the committee accused the regulators of trying 
to postpone the resolution of the savings and loan crisis until 
after reagan administration officials have left office 
the plan seems to be nothing more than a massive shell game 
said rep charles e schumer dny many of these institutions 
will ultimately have to be bailed out again at even greater cost to 
the taxpayer 
schumer said the strategy would only postpone the day on which 
the bill for this crisis becomes due until long after the members 
of the current administration have left washington and are sitting 
on a beach somewhere 
rep fernand st germain dri chairman of the committee and 
rep henry gonzalez dtexas criticized treasury undersecretary 
george d gould in particular for maintaining that the fslic 
needs no new money at least through next year 
gould bristled at the criticism and noted that when the 
administration in early 1986 proposed a plan to bring 25 billion 
into fslic from the industry congress delayed action and finally 
allowed less than had been requested 
wall has estimated the cost of cleaning up the savings industry 
at 31 billion well within fslic revenue projections of 42 
billion over 10 years 
however wall said thursday that the bank board in the next 30 
days to 45 days would be increasing its estimate of cleaning up 
problems in texas where most of the industrys problems are 
concentrated as of the end of last year it estimated the cost at 
7 billion but since has increased that to 152 billion 
wall is asking congress to put the full faith and credit of the 
us government behind the fslic notes he maintains that his 
agency has the legal right to issue as many notes as it wants but 
he said it would not issue more than 16 billion 
he also indicated that before the end of the month the bank 
board will issue more notes in september he said the bank board 
intends to resolve the cases of another 65 insolvent institutions 
bringing the agencys case resolutions to about 100 between aug 15 
and sept 30 
congress since 1982 has extended full government backing to 
savings and loan deposits wall wants congress to extend that 
backing to fslic notes

the senate is moving closer to approval of new 
curbs on textile apparel and shoe imports defying the threat of a 
veto that could put the bills republican opponents on the 
electionyear defensive 
yes im a protectionist sen ernest f hollings dsc 
the bills sponsor told lawmakers thursday foreign importers 
are trading our shirts off of us were going broke we need 
protection 
the measure would freeze textile and apparel imports next year 
at 1987 levels and limit growth in each subsequent year to 1 
percent it would halt increases in imports of nonrubber footwear 
supporters on thursday managed to shunt aside three weakening 
amendments and a vote on the bill was scheduled for today 
there was no doubt that sponsors had enough support for passage 
and earlier senate votes on the issue indicated they might have a 
vetoproof twothirds margin the house however fell short of a 
twothirds margin when it approved its version 263156 
the textile apparel and shoe industries were rocked by a wave 
of imports in the early 1980s mainly from asia since then they 
have pushed for trade barriers they say are needed to protect us 
jobs and maintain their capacity to produce uniforms and boots for 
the armed forces 
the reagan administration and freetrade forces mainly 
lawmakers from exportminded states say heightened competition has 
made the us textile industry highly efficient and that its trade 
troubles are a thing of the past they note that the companies 
already benefit from high tariffs as well as quotas and claim the 
companies are crying wolf 
this bill is an illconceived attempt to protect some at the 
expense of many and deserves to be defeated said sen john c 
danforth rmo the textile and apparel industry has long enjoyed 
an extensive web of trade protection 
the industry concedes that textile mills have modernized since 
the early 1980s and automation has caused some of the drop in 
employment but it says apparel plants have not benefited from the 
same technological gains and remain vulnerable to products from 
lowwage countries 
small apparel plants are really the backbone of small cities 
in rural america said sen howell heflin dala 
the administration says the bill would raise prices narrow 
consumer choices and invite retaliation by us trading partners 
some of the major textile and apparelproducing countries are 
among the top buyers of american agricultural goods 
us trade representative clayton k yeutter and six other 
cabinet members said in an aug 5 letter to lawmakers that if the 
bill reached reagans desk they would recommend a veto 
but textile industry officials are hoping that electionyear 
pressures will make reagan think twice about following through on 
the threat a veto would bring the politically thankless task of 
trying to gather support to avert an override 
the effort would be certain to claim the spotlight as election 
day drew near handing democrats material to paint the 
administration as insensitive to the very bluecollar workers that 
vice president george bush is now courting 
i think the realization is there that this is a strongly 
political issue said dan frierson president of the american 
textile manufacturers institute and of dixie yarns inc 
senate margins in early skirmishing on the bill have not been 
reassuring to the administration the senate voted 6829 on 
wednesday to invoke cloture limit debate to 30 hours twothirds 
of the 100 senators on hand for the vote are needed to override a 
presidential veto

a soviet cosmonaut said he made a mistake when he 
restarted the braking rocket of his stranded space capsule after a 
computer had shut it down but he said he was impatient to bring 
the craft back to earth 
errors were made by the commander i want to say there is 
fault vladimir lyakhov told soviet and afghan journalists 
thursday at the baikonur space center 
the cosmonaut who has made three trips into space commanded 
the mission that ended wednesday a day behind schedule his 
remarks were broadcast on the evening television news 
lyakhov and crewmate abdul ahad mohmand the first afghan in 
space managed to land their soyuz tm5 capsule safely in soviet 
central asia after 26 tense hours stranded in orbit while their 
oxygen and food ran low 
problems began tuesday when the cosmonauts began trying to 
reenter the atmosphere and a computer malfunctioned 
lyakhov said an infrared sensor in the soyuz guidance system 
malfunctioned during the first attempt to fire an engine that 
brakes the capsule so that it can safely reenter the atmosphere 
the computer was unable to judge whether the spacecraft was 
correctly oriented and the engine was shut off the cosmonaut 
said 
a second attempt was made the braking engine fired under 
automatic control but then shut off 
when the engine switched off for the second time lyakhov 
said i very much wanted to start the landing and i turned it on 
for a second time of course in the back of my mind i realized 
that turning on the engine would cause complications i am not 
excusing myself there was fault there 
deputy flight chief viktor blagov told the government newspaper 
izvestia that backup landing sites could have been used so there 
was no rush to fire the reentry engine 
then appearing to defend lyakhov blagov said it could be 
understood in a purely human way why the commander was anxious to 
land at that time and place 
lyakhov said he and mohmand had wanted to make a third attempt 
at reentry tuesday but that the craft might have landed outside 
soviet territory 
he said the crew preferred to wait until landing could be 
assured in its designated spot in the soviet republic of 
kazakhstan 
the government newspaper izvestia suggested lyakhov should have 
immediately assumed manual control over the computer that was 
malfunctioning and said that might have prevented the delay in 
landing 
the public questioning of a cosmonauts performance and 
lyakhovs admission of mistakes on the widely watched television 
news program were highly unusual it reflected soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs new policy of glasnost or openness 
lyakhov a 47yearold military pilot flew in space for 175 
days in 1979 and 150 days in 1983 
at the news conference the cosmonauts also described what it 
was like to be stranded in space for 26 hours with diminishing air 
food and water supplies they said they had to remain in their 
seats in the cramped capsule in the same position as for a launch 
immobility was the biggest problem the official tass news 
agency reported 
the cosmonauts had an emergency supply of food and water but 
decided not to use it until absolutely necessary tass said 
other reports have said the capsule had no toilet virtually no 
room to move around and only enough air for two days

the reagan administration is moving swiftly to 
ban the use of tissue from intentionally aborted fetuses in 
research before a special national institutes of health advisory 
committee meets on the matter 
gary l bauer president reagans assistant for policy 
development told health and human services secretary otis r bowen 
he wanted the secretarys comments on the proposed executive order 
by today 
the nih panel formed at the direction of a top official in 
bowens department begins a twoday meeting sept 14 to consider 
the issue 
a copy of bauers memo dated sept 2 along with a copy of the 
draft executive order that reagan would sign was obtained thursday 
by the associated press 
campbell gardett an hhs spokesman confirmed that the documents 
had been received by bowen 
theres no comment at this time on the draft order which is 
under review said gardett 
the issue arose last april when nih scientists sought approval 
to conduct experiments in which brain tissue from freshly aborted 
fetuses would be transplanted to patients suffering from 
parkinsons disease 
surgeons in mexico city reported last january that they had 
injected such tissue from a miscarried fetus into the brains of two 
parkinsons sufferers with promising results 
there have been reports of researchers in other countries 
employing the emerging fetal tissue transplant techniques which 
also could have applications in many other diseases 
although miscarried fetuses have long been used in more 
conventional research areas the new techniques which require 
fresh tissue to be effective open up a new rash of ethical 
questions 
parkinsons disease causes gradual loss of muscle control and is 
potentially fatal the fetal tissue is believed to work by 
stimulating production of dopamine a brain chemical that people 
suffering from parkinsons lack 
much of the opposition to the new research has come from people 
who oppose abortion under all circumstances the draft order 
circulated by bauer says final regulations shall be issued by 
nov 1 1988 one week before election day 
the white house instructed bowen last month to enforce stringent 
new rules against federally financed family planning clinics that 
counsel abortion in any cases not covered by two court orders which 
ban enforcement over much of the country 
however federal officials acknowledged that the instructions 
would have little immediate impact since they would apply only to 
grant applications received after oct 1 and that only a handful 
will be up for renewal even then 
private family planning leaders maintained the white house edict 
was a political statement to energize antiabortion forces prior to 
the republican national convention 
bauers memo said the fetal research order is intended to 
protect unborn and newborn children from experimentation research 
and organ transplantation except in cases where the unborn or 
newborn child would itself directly benefit by any such 
procedures 
dr robert e windom the assistant hhs secretary for health 
rejected a proposed nih project last april in which scientists 
would implant fetal tissue into patients with parkinsons disease 
windom instructed nih director james b wyngaarden to appoint an 
outside advisory committee to examine the ethical medical and 
legal implications of using tissue from intentionally aborted 
fetuses 
that prohibition issued in april which is still in force did 
not ban continuing research on tissue from fetuses from 
miscarriages or stillbirths nor would the proposed executive order 
it shall be the policy of the federal government to the 
extent permitted by law that an unborn or newborn child who has 
died as a result of an induced abortion shall not be used for 
purposes of research or transplantation says the draft order 
although the impact was not immediately clear the draft 
apparently would attempt to inhibit such activities by private 
researchers who benefit from federal funds 
activities and procedures not in conformance with the policies 
above may not receive federal funds nor may such activities be 
conducted by federal agencies or departments or in facilities 
governed by federal law to the extend permitted by law said one 
section 
a few conferences have been held by ethicists and researchers on 
the new technology but no clear consensus has emerged in the 
scientific community about how to proceed 
a letter published in science magazine last year by participants 
in a seminar at case western university is one of the clearest 
statements on the potential questions 
that letter signed by neurosurgeons ethicists and lawyers 
concluded that there are similarities to using tissue from fetal 
remains and using tissue from adult cadavers but it went on to say 
there are dissimilarities that merit careful consideration 
the letter recommended for example that there should be a 
clear separation between decisions related to the acquisition of 
tissue and decisions regarding the transplanting of tissue into a 
recipient

scheduled to be returned to the great lakes on saturday exactly 
175 years after perrys fleet defeated the british in the battle of 
lake erie 
perry would recognize his old ship this is as exact a 
restoration as there can be said melbourne smith an annapolis 
md marine architect who dismantled the niagara and rebuilt it to 
historical specifications 
the 182foot 278ton ship restored for the third time with 
38 million in state and private money in dry dock at this port 
city will be outfitted by next spring with 118foot and 113foot 
masts square rigging about 22000 square feet of polyester sail 
and 20 aluminum cannons 
then it is to tour the great lakes and east coast ports as 
pennsylvanias official flagship 
the first uss niagara was one of six small ships built at erie 
during the war of 1812 and put under perrys command to break a 
british blockade of american great lakes ports and to defend the 
northwest territory 
on sept 10 1813 perrys nineship squadron met six british 
vessels under commodore robert heriot barclay in a short but fierce 
battle near putinbay ohio that left 135 british and 123 
american casualties 
perrys flagship the uss lawrence was disabled by british fire 
and perry transferred to the niagara where he hoisted his famous 
blueandwhite battle flag and attacked again the niagara helped 
break the british battle line and forced barclay to surrender 
we have met the enemy and they are ours two ships two brigs 
one schooner and one sloop perry reported to his superiors 
the niagara served as a station ship in erie until 1820 when 
she was scuttled in nearby misery bay the ship was raised by erie 
citizens in 1913 and restored for a great lakes tour to celebrate 
the 100th anniversary of perrys victory she was restored again in 
the 1930s and 1940s 
the latest niagara incorporates 42 pieces of the original ship 
some within view for visitors smith said the original wood is aged 
and not strong enough for structural use 
it will be obvious he said 
in 1813 a gang of about 300 shipwrights blacksmiths and other 
craftsmen and laborers directed by new york shipbuilders adam and 
noah brown hired on at erie and built perrys fleet in three 
months there were no sawmills in erie which then had only 500 
inhabitants and craftsmen cut hewed and squared the unseasoned 
wood by hand 
it was all green wood from around here it wouldnt last two 
years smith said but it didnt matter this was a throwaway 
boat for war 
smiths modern crew of about 60 working over 99 days included 
shipwrights and carpenters experienced in restoring old ships they 
were assisted by laborers from the pennsylvania conservation corps 
a job training program for disadvantaged youth 
they worked in a dockyard where perrys smaller gunboats were 
built in 1813 the niagara and lawrence were built nearby 
according to project spokeswoman maura mclaughlin 
the niagaras new 18pound carronades which are stubby cannons 
for shortrange use and two 12pound long guns will be cast at an 
erie foundry of aluminum to save 10 tons of weight on deck the 
navy removed the original cannons before sinking the niagara 
ships like this werent very safe to sail they were top 
heavy smith said but it was wartime and it didnt matter in 
wartime you do dangerous things 
smith estimated a crew of about 35 will be needed to sail the 
restored ship as it tours the great lakes beginning next summer 
the state does not plan to give rides or to rent the ship

napoleon duarte inaugurated a rural development project in this 
northern rebel stronghold in his first public ceremony in more than 
three months 
duarte 62 is suffering from terminal cancer he has lost 35 
pounds and most of his hair because of chemotherapy treatment 
but his voice and step were firm thursday as he opened the 5 
million project in the provincial capital 45 miles north of san 
salvador chalatenango is a stronghold of leftist guerrillas who 
have waged a nearly 9yearold war against the usbacked 
government 
after the ceremony duarte who wore a blue cap from notre dame 
his alma mater was asked by the associated press how he felt 
good he said i am getting stronger every day 
but a measure to declare duarte incapable of carrying out his 
duties due to incurable liver cancer was referred to committee in 
the legislature thursday 
ramon rosales leader of the tiny conservative party merecen 
presented the proposal his party has no legislators but private 
citizens may speak in congress and present proposals if backed by a 
legislator rosales motion was supported by a member of the 
rightist republican nationalist alliance 
the measure is not considered likely to succeed under the 
constitution further action requires the unanimous opinion of five 
physicians designated by congress and the approval of 40 of the 
legislatures 60 members 
duarte said after the ceremony in chalatenango that his next 
treatment set for late this month should not weaken him as much

the government issued exit visas this year to 
15715 ethnic germans a sharp increase over previous levels a 
spokesman announced 
spokesman vadim perfiliev told reporters thursday that the 
figure covers the first seven months of 1988 and includes 844 
children he said 7000 applications are now being processed 
this years figure is 150 percent higher than last years 
perfiliev said 
he said 142 requests for visas were denied in the first seven 
months of 1988 on the grounds that the applications included 
falsified information either about relatives in west germany or 
about applicants themselves 
the soviet union has about 16 million citizens of german 
extraction most of them in western parts of the country during 
various periods in russian history germans were invited to serve 
as technicians in various areas many established wealthy 
agricultural colonies and maintained their ethnic identities 
before world war ii ethnic germans living in the middle volga 
area had their own autonomous region but during the war their 
republic was abrogated and they were moved eastward into siberia 
and middle asia

george bush and michael dukakis naturally 
enough are being called upon to give american voters an idea of 
how they will cope with us foreign policy problems 
never mind that what a candidate says on the stump in a debate 
or on the tube may have little bearing on what he does once he is 
president circumstances change crises erupt opportunities arise 
also he can act more in accord in the oval office with what he 
feels ought to be done abroad rather than what will endear him to 
the voters 
but both in the midst of the campaign and afterward what is 
often overlooked is how little influence america even with its 
nuclear might and democratic aspirations can exert in most of the 
world 
its one thing to try to work out an arms control accord with 
the soviet union or to try to nudge arabs and israelis toward the 
negotiating table its quite another to try to dissuade iraq from 
crushing its kurdish minority reportedly with devastating dosages 
of chemical weapons 
washington and moscow clearly can control their rockets but 
their halting efforts to prevent the nuclear club from taking in 
new members is an example of how limited us influence really is 
in the world 
a president can try to slow proliferation by constraining 
shipments of technology he can also try his powers of persuasion 
on friendly or semifriendly states but their leaders make their 
decisions largely on the basis of national interests not deference 
to the united states 
us influence tends to be greater with kindred democracies but 
they are already more inclined to yield to pressure from washington 
than nonaligned or antagonistic governments 
and in the event of revolutions and natural calamities often 
the most that the united states can offer is statements of good 
will as illustrated by what has been going on this week on the 
international scene 
in burma perhaps 1 million soldiers police uniformed state 
factory workers buddhist monks catholic nuns students teachers 
and housewives marched through rangoon the capital seeking an end 
to 25 years of repressive oneparty rule 
the asian countrys future may be in their hands but evidently 
there is virtually nothing the united states can do to promote 
democracy americans like other outsiders are concentrating their 
efforts right now on evacuating diplomats dependents in the event 
of anarchy while keeping the us embassy open to demonstrate the 
us presence 
in hapless and teeming bangladesh where the worst floods in 70 
years have left as many as 28 million people homeless or stranded 
the united states is providing nearly 36 million in additional 
food transportation and other emergency aid 
this is an expression of american generosity but it is a 
bandaid applied to an epidemic of population explosion and limited 
resources that for instance led the bengalis to chop down trees 
that would have slowed the waters in order to build the houses now 
immersed an estimated 110 million people are crowded into an area 
the size of wisconsin 
in iraq tens of thousands of kurds a nonarabic people seeking 
autonomy have fled to neighboring turkey they are the fortunate 
ones according to reports tens of thousands of other kurds were 
massacred with cyanide and other chemical weapons in what refugees 
called a war of extermination 
the state department voiced concern about iraqs treatment of 
civilians it also condemned the use of poison gas as abhorrent 
unjustifiable and unacceptable 
throughout the iraniraq war the state department has expressed 
grave abhorrence to chemical weapons but that evidently did not 
deter baghdad just as us entreaties did not stop china from 
providing iran with antiship missiles 
even friendly governments can be stubborn 
four trips to the region by secretary of state george p shultz 
this year failed to persuade israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
and king hussein of jordan to engage in middle east peace talks 
on the other hand dedicated us diplomacy may finally be 
paying off in southern africa under american tutelage cuba and 
south africa may be on the verge of a settlement that will remove 
cuban troops from angola and provide independence for namibia 
so the united states and whoever is in the oval office keeps 
trying

a nuclear regulatory commission vote next week 
is likely to remove a major hurdle in the long quest by operators 
of the seabrook nh nuclear power plant to obtain a lowpower 
operating license 
none of the commissioners objected to the proposed rules change 
at a staff briefing thursday and nrc chairman lando w zech jr 
said afterwards that he likely would take the staffs 
recommendation and support it a vote is scheduled for next friday 
the proposal would allow seabrook to receive a license to 
conduct tests at 5 percent power capacity without having a system 
in place to notify residents within 10 miles of the reactor of an 
accident 
it is highly unlikely that members of the general public would 
be exposed to dangerous levels of radiation following an accident 
at low power the staff said in a 23page report to the 
commissioners 
the rule if adopted would allow the commission to reverse a 
february ruling by the atomic safety and licensing appeal board 
that blocked a lowpower license after sirens were removed from the 
massachusetts municipalities within the plants 10mile zone 
new hampshire yankee the plants operator was forced to remove 
the sirens after a federal appeals court sided with state and local 
officials massachusetts gov michael dukakis and other plant 
opponents wanted the sirens removed because they believe no 
evacuation system can adequately protect nearby residents 
under the new rule new hampshire yankee still would need a 
notification system for a fullpower license the company has 
suggested truckmounted sirens and sirenequipped helicopters as 
replacements 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon said in a telephone 
interview thursday that the state probably would not try to block 
the rule change in court but instead challenge the actual license 
if it is eventually issued 
after the siren issue the only other lowpower question pending 
before the commission is an appeal by seabrook critics that the 
reactors bleak financial condition should block issuance of the 
permit 
it is unclear when that issue will be decided and whether it 
will hold up the oftdelayed license said martin g malsch deputy 
general counsel for licensing and regulation at the commission 
zech declined to comment on the potential impact of the 
financial qualification question 
were taking one step at a time with seabrook he said

about four of every five flights by major us 
airlines arrived on time in july although poor weather held down 
the ontime performance in the heavily traveled air corridors of 
the northeast according to transportation department figures 
two carriers serving the sun belt america west and southwest 
airlines reported better than 91 percent of their flights on time 
during july airports in salt lake city phoenix and las vegas had 
the best arrival rates 
the monthly statistics were released by the department thursday 
pan american world airways had the worst arrival record among 
the 13 airlines monitored with only 688 percent of its july 
flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule the governments 
ontime standard the department provided more recent figures for 
consumer complaints showing that pan am also had the highest rate 
in that category in august 
overall 815 percent of the more than 441000 flights during 
july arrived within 15 minutes of schedule slightly fewer than the 
843 percent during june 
the figures do not include delays caused by mechanical problems 
but do include those that are due to poor weather airlines that 
have a concentration of flights in the southwest have consistently 
performed well as did airports in that part of the country 
on the other hand airports in the northeast where weather as 
well as heavy air traffic contributed to delays were generally at 
the bottom of the ontime list as were some of the air carriers 
that serve that region 
the three new york city area airports laguardia john f 
kennedy and newark international as well as philadelphia had the 
worst arrival rate with about onethird of their flights delayed 
boston and pittsburgh where a runway repair project also added to 
delays also fared badly 
the transportation department began monitoring airline arrival 
rates last september amid growing complaints about flight delays 
and poor service 
delta air lines which earlier this year struggled well down the 
list in ontime performance among the 13 carriers posted the third 
best arrival rate in july with 861 percent of its flights on time 
in addition to pan am the airlines with the worst record were 
piedmont airlines and usair both of which reported arrival rates 
of slightly better than 74 percent 
david shipley a usair spokesman blamed the poor showing on the 
runway problem at pittsburgh where usair has its major hub as 
well as weather problems he said 10 percent of usairs total 
arrival delays were linked to the runway being closed 
salt lake city had the best arrival rate of the 27 airports 
monitored with 923 percent of its flights arriving on time the 
other two airports with arrival rates of better than 90 percent 
were phoenix and las vegas nev 
meanwhile complaints from air travelers to the transportation 
departments office of consumer affairs continued to decline 
compared with 1987 as they have steadily during the year 
during august the department received 2363 complaints from air 
travelers twothirds fewer than the 7337 received during the same 
month a year ago 
pan am had the worst record with 1714 complaints for every 
100000 passengers flown followed by hawaiian airlines with 1318 
and twa with 1075 
continental airlines and northwest airlines which during most 
of the past year have led the airlines in number of complaints 
showed a sharp improvement with their july figures continental had 
its best month in a year with 994 complaints per 100000 
passengers and northwest had 62 rate of complaints 
the august complaint statistics were released along with the 
july ontime statistics 
the number of mishandled bags increased slightly during july to 
715 per 1000 boardings from 676 in june twa had the highest 
number of such complaints 1165 for every 1000 boardings

pacs to the max 
after more than a decade of explosive growth by political action 
committees the rate of pac receipt and spending increases has 
fallen dramatically during the 198788 election cycle 
the dollar amounts continue to set record highs according to 
figures released thursday by the federal election commission but 
several political scientists say the farlower growth rates from 
previous cycles indicate that the pac movement may be leveling off 
and reaching its saturation point 
the fec said that for the 18 months ending june 30 pacs 
representing business labor ideological and other interest groups 
spent 2154 million a 48 percent increase over the same period 
in the 198586 election cycle 
this increase was well below the 38 percent rise in pac spending 
that occurred in the corresponding 18 months of the 198586 cycle 
when compared with the 198384 cycle which itself was up 44 
percent over 198182 
receipts by pacs showed a similar slowing in growth the 2666 
million collected during the first 18 months of the current cycle 
was 47 percent above 198586 which saw 18month receipts running 
30 percent above 198384 which was 42 percent over 198182 
as of june 30 pacs had given 949 million to candidates for 
federal office 3 million to presidential races 327 million to 
senate candidates and 592 million to house candidates 
this represented a 21 percent increase over the same 18 months 
in 198586 this rate however was below the 38 percent rise from 
198384 to 198586 and the 49 percent growth from 198182 to 
198384 
incumbent senators and representatives got got nearly 90 percent 
of the money contributed by pacs to congressional races in the 
first 18 months of this election cycle democrats led republicans 
609 million to 339 million 
norman ornstein a congressional analyst with the american 
enterprise institute a washington think tank said the 
doubledigit percentage increases in pac receipts and spending 
couldnt continue indefinitely 
we may have reached a saturation point he said thats 
good news for all of us except campaign vendors 
ornstein said its hard to say whether weve got a longterm 
trend 
he said the reduced rates of increase could be partly 
attributable to so few competitive races in the house 
there isnt the demand from incumbents to put the screws to 
pacs he said 
janet grenzke a political science professor at holy cross 
college in worcester mass said the figures could indicate the 
saturation point is nearing for pacs 
those people who were going to form pacs and who were going to 
participate in the political process through them have pretty much 
done so grenzke said 
she said some political money that previously might have been 
channeled through pacs now could be ending up as soft money 
the lesscontrolled and littlereported cash flow increasingly 
finding its way to places like political party committees 
herb alexander a political science professor at the university 
of southern california said the number of pacs has leveled off as 
has the number of pacs that are really active 
a couple of hundred pacs do half the business he said 
theres an ingrown limitation on how much they can raise 
while its not at a standstill the growth rate isnt as 
explosive 
randy huwa of common cause the selfdescribed citizens lobby 
that has been urging congress to outlaw pacs said he was not 
heartened by the latest fec figures 
the first thing i look at is contributions to candidates and 
thats continuing to grow he said

the date of the japanese attack on pearl 
harbor once proclaimed a day that will live in infamy 
apparently hasnt stuck in the memories of george bush and his 
eldest son 
george bush jr confused the date thursday during an interview 
on the michael jackson syndicated radio talk show his father the 
republican presidential candidate got the date mixed up wednesday 
during a discussion about the campaign with host jackson the 
candidates oldest son lamented that the problem is that so much 
of what we see in presidential politics is the 15second sound bite 
on tv 
last night for example the 15second sound bite on my dad on 
the national networks was the fact that he slipped for 45 seconds 
on whether pearl harbor was on september 9th or december 9th 
and they made a big deal of that on tv i didnt quite get the 
point because he you know corrected himself 
jackson did not note that the younger bush had misquoted his 
father who had said during a speech wednesday sept 7 to the 
american legion in louisville ky i wonder how many americans 
remember today is pearl harbor day fortyseven years ago to this 
very day we were hit and hit hard at pearl harbor we were not 
ready 
within a minute or so bush corrected himself 
both bushes misstated the date of the attack dec 7 1941 
which marked americas entry into world war ii and was proclaimed 
a date which will live in infamy by president franklin d 
roosevelt

carmen rodriguez cries when she remembers the 
night her daughter died in the cross fire of rival street gangs 
but her tears cannot keep the young people in their gang colors 
out of her neighborhood one of the areas of the city suffering 
from an increase of nearly 70 percent in gangrelated killings so 
far this year 
police say the use of heavier caliber guns and the closure of 10 
city hospitals in four years have contributed to the surge in 
gangrelated deaths the reluctance of witnesses to testify against 
gang members adds to the frustration of victims families 
people saw mrs rodriguez says of her daughters shooting 
her eyes swollen from weeping as she stands in front of her 
familys small candy store in a predominanty hispanic neighborhood 
southwest of downtown 
i bend down on my knees i say please tell me they dont 
say anything 
mrs rodriguez says she has too much invested to leave this 
workingclass neighborhood where she moved 32 years ago from 
puerto rico and raised 10 children 
one of those children was delma who was 28 when she died on 
july 1 1987 the victim of a bullet fired from the darkness as she 
sat with her mother on the hood of a car near the family home and 
the store 
i only pray some day they catch the guy mrs rodriguez says 
the killing was one of four in a foursquareblock area in the 
last two years says frances sandoval another neighborhood 
resident and victim of gang violence 
mrs sandoval founded mothers against gangs after her oldest 
son arthur was fatally stabbed by a gang member in 1985 she says 
arthur an honor student and 15yearold high school sophomore had 
come to the aid of a friends sister 
gangrelated killings increased to 37 through july from 22 in 
the same period last year a jump of 68 percent authorities said 
however cmdr sollie vincent head of the police departments 
gang crimes unit said gang warfare has not escalated as much as 
the death count suggests the number of gangrelated aggravated 
battery cases such as shootings and stabbings rose to 730 in the 
first seven months of this year from 700 in the same period last 
year he said 
we suspect that they are using better weaponry probably 
heavier caliber guns vincent said 
hospital closings that have stretched emergency room resources 
thin also may be aggravating the death toll he added 
gang killings have worsened in other major cities as well los 
angeles county expects more than 420 gangrelated killings this 
year up from 387 in 1987 and driveby slayings now average more 
than one a day los angeles gangs are expanding their 
cocainetrafficking networks as far away as seattle kansas city 
mo and philadelphia 
in chicago there are an estimated 125 gangs involving 12000 to 
15000 youths with an average age of about 18 vincent said some 
members are as young as 10 or 11 
the gangs account for about 1 percent of all city crime but 5 
percent to 6 percent of homicides vincent said 
most gang members are black or hispanic the products of 
poverty poor schools or broken families he said 
the black gangs tend to be heavily involved in drug trafficking 
vincent said the hispanic gangs seem more interested in protecting 
territory and showing gang colors resulting in more irrational 
shootings he said 
theres an elementary school across the street from mrs 
rodriguezs store and a catholic church across a small plaza where 
children play football by day 
but after sundown the neighborhood streets often are claimed by 
clusters of young people displaying their gang colors 
were talking about a small minority that has been allowed to 
defame our community mrs sandoval said 
some of the recent ganglinked shootings have been drivebys 
mrs sandoval says police often are slow to respond to gang 
violence allow young people to congregate past curfew and reassign 
detectives and gang specialists to civic festivals 
vincent denies that enforcement has been lax 
in a driveby shooting if you had a million police how could 
you stop that he said

officials in a city near tokyo discovered last year 
that industrial waste contaminated wells used for the drinking 
water of up to 25000 people but they waited until thursday to 
announce it 
though we had found the levels to be in excess we were still 
unsure just how widespread it was said masaru yano of the 
kimitsu city offices environment conservation department 
yano said the city waited to announce the contamination because 
investigations still were under way but he said a small number of 
residents directly affected by it were told earlier 
he said the substance found in the wells trichloroethylene may 
cause cancer in humans acceptable levels in drinking water were 
established by health and welfare ministry guidelines in 1984 
in march 1987 officials found two of seven local wells in 
kimitsu 27 miles southeast of tokyo contaminated with the 
substance the city then expanded its investigation to cover 43 
wells 
between may 1987 and june 1988 10 wells were found to have been 
polluted with one registering 237 times the acceptable level of 
003 milligrams per liter according to yano 
four of the 10 contaminated wells were not in use but water 
from one is believed to have mixed with a larger system used by 
25000 residents said an official with the kimitsu waterworks 
department the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
all contaminated wells have been shut down 
the 25000 residents whose water would have been diluted by 
uncontaminated supplies were not informed until thursday 
soon after the original findings eight households using water 
directly from the wells were told to boil their water before 
drinking it yano said 
he said the pollution is believed to have originated from an 
industrial plant owned by the toshiba components co but an 
investigation has not been completed 
a plant official said that after being informed of the 
contaminated wells the plant offered to donate water 
purification equipment worth an estimated 225000 some equipment 
now is being tested 
our decision to donate the equipment does not mean that we are 
accepting responsibility said katsuo inami head of the toshiba 
components plants general affairs division by donating 
equipment we hope to speed up efforts to determine the source of 
the pollution 
but inami said as far as he knew the plant was the only one in 
the area using trichloroethylene and may have been a pollutant in 
the past the company has operated since 1967 and used the 
chemical since 1972 he said 
hisashi yano an official with the water quality bureau of the 
environment agency said although trichloroethylene has been 
found by some to be a possible carcinogen we cannot say for 
certain whether it actually causes long or shortterm harm 
trichloroethylene is used mainly as an industrial cleanser but 
is also used by dry cleaners

school who sued for a chance to dance say a judges order means 
theyll soon be getting footloose 
we just want to have a casual fun first dance said purdy 
high school student council president nancy fox one of 21 students 
who along with their parents sued the school board im excited 
you can anticipate that a request will be made in the very 
near future said the students attorney william fleischaker 
us district judge russell clark on thursday answered a request 
by the board in purdy that he clarify their responsibilities under 
his aug 1 decision declaring their centuryold dance ban 
unconstitutional 
the school board should treat student social dances in the 
same manner as it treats other student activity on school 
premises clark said 
the judge said the school board can regulate the number of 
dances and take steps to see that dances are chaperoned but any 
rules or regulations promulgated must not have the effect of 
barring student social dances on school premise 
the court will not tolerate any attempt to circumvent the 
meaning and spirit of the court order he said 
repeated attempts to contact attorney ransom ellis iii who 
represented the board by telephone were unsuccessful 
the purdy school system centered in a town of about 900 people 
50 miles southwest of springfield has about 520 students in all 
grades about 240 are in the sixyear junior and senior high school 
residents say the dance ban has been part of the school board 
policy book for 100 years senior classes at purdy high school have 
made an annual ritual of asking for a dance and being refused 
proms and other dances have been held in neighboring towns or at 
the purdy community center 
but the class of 1986 persisted in its quest for a school dance 
with the lawsuit petitions and a rally to which they invited stars 
of footloose a movie about a fictional texas town where high 
school students fought a similar prohibition actors kevin bacon 
and lori singer did not attend

texas sen lloyd bentsen the democratic vice 
presidential nominee is sharpening up his rhetoric as he and 
michael dukakis fight back against republican attacks that have 
helped send their campaign sinking in the polls 
bentsen who was heading to iowa today for a speech in which he 
planned to blast the gop record on agriculture told a gala 
democratic party dinner in new york on thursday night that he and 
dukakis would erase the moral deficit of the last eight years 
with the help of record fundraising including 5 million raised 
at the manhattan dinner alone democrats would be better able than 
ever to deliver their message of hope he said 
the message is going to be no to the hatemongering 
disciples of the hard right he said 
the message is going to be no to the massive budget deficits 
and trade deficits that have endangered americas economic 
leaderhsip in the world 
and the message is going to be no to the candidates who 
impugn the loyalty and patriotism of others while hiding behind the 
american flag he said a direct slap at bushs criticism of 
dukakis who based on a court opinion that it was 
unconstitutional vetoed a massachusetts law requiring the pledge 
of allegiance in schools 
bentsen speaking before new york gov mario cuomo and dukakis 
was introduced by texas state treasurer ann richards who was the 
democrats keynote speaker at their convention in july 
she got a roar from the crowd when she poked bush for fumbling 
the date of the attack on pearl harbor in a speech this week 
well i told you hed put a silver foot in his mouth she 
said you see that one yesterday i mean i didnt even get shot 
down and i know when pearl harbor was 
after a warm reception bentsen continued the line alas poor 
george he said ann richards was born with a silver tongue in 
his mouth 
or as another texan said bentsen added george was born 
on third base and thinks he hit a triple 
the dinner with 2800 people paying at least 1000 a seat was 
decidedly upbeat but nationwide the ticket is trailing the 
republicans by 51 percent to 42 percent according to a new 
washington postabc news poll 
and despite the prominence of bentsen and richards the 
democrats find themselves behind in the polls in texas which bush 
also calls home 
bentsen who campaigned in texas on labor day was traveling to 
california after iowa this week but dukakis was visiting the state 
today friday and bentsen planned to return next week to fight for 
the states prize of 29 electoral votes

vice president george bushs presidential 
campaign asked three agencies to investigate a political action 
committee that has spent 15 million so far to promote bush and 
blast his opponent 
the latest expenditure by americans for bush an arm of the 
national security political action committee is a 500000 
television ad campaign painting democrat nominee michael dukakis as 
soft on crime and criminals 
officials of the group said they would continue spending 
lavishly on the vice president unless bush campaign chairman james 
baker iii asks them to stop 
bush spokesman mark goodin said the campaign has filed 
complaints against the group with the postal service the internal 
revenue service and the federal election commission 
we are concerned about the name of the organization it 
connotes a connection with this campaign and the vice president 
there is no connection goodin said we are also concerned 
about their fundraising techniques and methods there are a range 
of complaints 
some people have reported receiving as many as three mail 
solicitations in the same day from americans for bush some 
contributors confused by the groups title and letterhead have 
said they believed they were giving money to the bush campaign 
nspac was formed in 1986 by chairman elizabeth fediay retired 
military officials and others fediay said the pac has collected 
38 million since last year including contributions to americans 
for bush she said anyone who wants a refund of their contribution 
can get one 
fediay maintained that only middlelevel bush campaign staffers 
have expressed concerns about nspacs activities although goodin 
said bush himself has asked that americans for bush change its name 
fediay said she was sending a letter to baker seeking his view 
of the groups independent activities on behalf of bush if he 
asks me to stop advocating the election of george bush i will 
she told reporters at a news conference called to unveil the 
groups two latest ads 
the new 30second ads started airing wednesday on national cable 
networks and are to continue until oct 5 with appearances in 
virtually every media market in the country 
dukakis not only opposes the death penalty he allowed 
firstdegree murderers to have weekend passes from prison a 
narrator says in both ads 
one spot goes on ten murderers on weekend passes have 
escaped one kidnapped and stabbed a maryland man and raped his 
fiancee as president george bush will be as tough on criminals as 
they are on us 
leslie dach a dukakis spokesman said one way the governor 
would respond to such attacks is by citing his record in 
massachusetts where the crime rate has fallen during his tenure 
goodin said he was not familiar with the activities ads or 
media strategy planned by the group the bush campaign began its 
own tv drive this week with sentimental spots showing bush with his 
family and at the republican convention

a sharp slowdown in the growth of consumer 
credit in july indicates americans are showing caution despite wage 
gains that month an economist says 
consumers dont seem to be buying bigticket items as they had 
in the past and that probably reflects the increases in interest 
rates mike evans head of a washington economic consulting firm 
said 
the government reported thursday that consumer credit grew at a 
48 percent annual rate in july a sharp decline from the 102 
percent rate for the first six months of the year 
americans took out 26 billion more in consumer credit than 
they paid off in july well down from the 81 billion they took 
out in june according to the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve has been tightening credit since late march 
in an effort to dampen demand as a way of cooling inflationary 
pressures

support among ethnicamericans was asked to resign thursday after 
it was learned he had defended a cleveland autoworker convicted in 
israel as a nazi war criminal a bush campaign aide said 
we told him that his advocacy on this issue puts him at a 
fundamental disagreement with the campaign and with the vice 
president said mark goodin 
goodin said brentar belonged to a group that defended john 
demjanjuk who is appealing a death sentence imposed after a court 
in jerusalem found him guilty of mutilating and killing inmates in 
nazi death camps during world war ii 
rep charles e schumer dny and five other jewish members 
of the house held a news conference to charge that an ugly 
assortment of antisemites and racists had been named to the bush 
campaign committee

no place in any organization he is associated with for religious 
bigotry or for anyone who would tolerate those views he said the

republican legislators say the state budget signed 
by gov michael dukakis in july is out of balance by as much as 
12 billion because the governor is overestimating tax collections 
and spending too much 
the results are very sobering and very disquieting about the 
future of this state house minority leader steven pierce said 
thursday 
senate minority leader david locke joined pierce in calling once 
again on dukakis to demand that the legislature return to session 
immediately to address the fiscal situation auto insurance and 
other concerns 
dukakis has touted the massachusetts economy during his campaign 
for the presidency 
but locke said based on our analysis there is going to be a 
shortfall that may exceed a billion dollars and suggested 
dukakis and democratic legislative leaders may be disguising 
planned tax increases 
although the legislature voted for the current 116 billion 
budget in july and dukakis does not have the power to 
singlehandedly summon the legislature back to work the 
republicans laid both problems at dukakis feet

saying he made a mistake and was just 
plain stupid sen gordon humphrey apologized to congressional 
candidate betty tamposi for saying her place was at home with her 
two small children 
in plain english i made a mistake i am sorry and i 
apologize humphrey said in a statement released by his concord 
office on thursday 
humphrey unleashed a firestorm of protests both by tamposi 
supporters and foes on tuesday when he said it was selfevident 
that you cannot work 12 to 14 hours a day in congress and have time 
left over for a child 
its difficult enough being a father of a young child and a 
member of congress as i am said humphrey who has a 3yearold 
son for the mother who in our society is the primary care 
giver working 1012 hours a day makes it impossible to give the 
nurturing the child would need 
humphrey suggested tamposi was negligent to run for the house 
with two daughters ages 22 months and 4 tamposi a millionaire 
officer in her fathers real estate company pays a nanny to care 
for her children 
on thursday humphrey took it back even though he had insisted 
for two days he would stand by his remarks 
humphrey apparently changed his mind after he got a call from 
chuck douglas tamposis strongest opponent in the 2nd districts

a couple who filed a 100 million lawsuit 
claiming that a hospital switched their healthy baby for one with a 
fatal heart defect nine years ago say they hope medical records 
will uncover their real daughter 
ernest and regina i twigg allege that florida hospital workers 
changed identifying bracelets and altered records to give the 
twiggs healthy baby to an adoptive family then gave the twiggs an 
infant born the same day with a congenital heart defect 
were totally devastated mrs twigg told the baltimore 
sun our lives have turned into a nightmare weve not only lost 
our arlena but also where is our own daughter 
the couple raised arlena twigg as their own until she died in 
august following surgery to correct the heart defect shortly 
before her death the lawsuit said a blood test performed at johns 
hopkins university here revealed that the child was not related to 
either parent 
the test showed arlena had a blood type of bpositive the 
twiggs said their baby had been born with a blood type of 
opositive and they also both have type o blood 
additional tests on arlenas tissues also concluded it would be 
all but impossible for arlena to be their child said the couples 
attorney marvin ellin of baltimore 
mrs twigg later recalled that on the day her baby was born a 
nurse told her another woman on the maternity ward had also 
delivered a daughter which she intended to give up for adoption 
the suit said those were the only two girl babies in the ward at 
the time ellin said 
mrs twigg said she told a nurse shortly before leaving the 
hospital that the child she was nursing did not look like the same 
baby she had nursed earlier in her stay but the nurse dismissed 
the notion 
the lawsuit filed wednesday in us district court in tampa 
fla asks for hospital records that ellin said could help the 
twiggs find out who adopted the girl the attorney said he has also 
contacted the fbi 
the suit names hardee memorial hospital in wauchula fla three 
physicians and a nurse charging them with fraud or negligence or 
both 
a woman who answered the telephone thursday at the twiggs home 
in langhorne pa referred calls to ellin 
the suit said that after the baby was born the twiggs were 
originally told that she was healthy but three days later were told 
she had congenital heart disease that could eventually prove fatal 
one of the defendants ernest palmer a family doctor told the 
sun i certainly wouldnt switch babies on anyone but i guess 
you can be sued by anyone harold connelly hospital 
administrator said he had no knowledge of the suit and was 
surprised by the allegations 
attempts by telephone to reach the other defendants dr 
william d black an obstetrician dr adley z sedaros a 
pediatrician and dena e spieth a nurse were unsuccessful 
the suit said the unknown adoptive parents wanted a healthy baby 
but it gave no reason why the medical personnel might have gotten 
involved in switching two babies ellin said some defendants may 
have been only negligent but that at least one of them must have 
deliberately switched the two babies bracelets 
the suit seeks records of payments to the defendants that might 
give insight into motives as well as indicate where the other child 
is living ellin said

pressure mounted on defiant city councilmen 
to drop their opposition to a courtordered housing desegregation 
plan as fines approached a 1 millionaday limit today and mass 
layoffs of city workers loomed 
yonkers was fined 819200 thursday for continuing to defy the 
desegregation plan the penalties imposed by us district judge 
leonard sand began at 100 a day and double daily reaching a 
total of 1638300 thursday 
mayor nicholas wasicsko scheduled a council meeting for noon 
today for a new vote on the housing plan the fines were expected 
to rise to 1 million a day the cap imposed by an appeals court 
if the council refused to accept the plan 
with the fines rapidly eating up the citys 337 million budget 
the city plans to lay off 447 library planning and parks employees 
saturday roughly one quarter of the city payroll during the next 
few weeks virtually all city services will be terminated and all 
city workers laid off 
sand is putting part of the citys fines in a trust to keep the 
school system solvent however school started thursday without 
crossing guards on the streets 
wasicsko who favors compliance with the housing desegregation 
ruling said the tide of public opinion is turning and the 
scenario only gets more draconian from here 
its a painfully slow process of the publics coming to that 
awareness but maybe thats the democratic way he said maybe 
the councilmen will come around once they face a publicrelations 
nightmare 
the peoples union a 2000member citizens group that has 
supported the councils resistance reversed itself and began 
lobbying at city hall for the council to give up 
we woke up and smelled the coffee lucille rizzettalantz 
president of the group said at a raucous council meeting thursday 
this cant continue you cant have people losing their jobs we 
want one of the councilmen to change his vote to prevent the city 
from disaster 
telephone calls urging the city to comply with the order clogged 
the lines at city hall 
some residents were upset that their garbage was not collected 
because suppliers worried about the citys finances refused to 
deliver diesel fuel this week 
they cant go on like this said william brickwedell 79 
right now theres no garbage collection on my street its time 
for integration 
at thursdays meeting the council voted 51 to transfer 73000 
to its judgments and claims account so the city could pay 
wednesdays fine of 409600 fines are paid the day after they are 
incurred 
councilman edward fagan voted no and henry spallone abstained 
the two have been in the majority in the councils several 43 
votes against the housing desegregation plan 
this business of blaming us is not right said spallone i 
blame the judge and i say to him if you want the money come and 
get it 
his comment brought cheers from the spectators 
sand ruled in 1985 that the city had willfully segregated 
housing and education for 40 years the first time a court had 
linked segregation in the two areas 
the schools were desegregated under a plan approved by sand the 
judges housing order calls for the development of 1000 units of 
low and moderateincome housing 
the us supreme court has refused to hear the citys appeal of 
sands contempt of court ruling against the councilmen for defying 
the order but it has stayed fines and threatened jail sentences 
pending a hearing on the councilmens appeal

whitney ray petersen hasnt been born yet 
but doctors are preparing to give him a new heart in an operation 
performed only once before officials say 
the fetus carried by cynthia petersen who is 33 weeks pregnant 
suffers from a lethal heart defect called hypoplastic left 
ventricle in which the left chamber of the heart does not develop 
mrs petersen and her husband daymon who have selected whitney 
ray as the name for their boy when he is born said thursday they 
would fly to loma linda university medical center to await a 
suitable donor heart 
if an appropriate donor heart becomes available the baby will 
be delivered by caesarean section and the heart will be 
transplanted immediately 
baby paul from canada is the only other baby with 
hypoplastic left ventricle to have had a transplant right after 
birth the baby was operated on at loma linda 11 months ago and is 
growing normally officials said 
mrs petersens obstetrician found the abnormal fetal heart beat 
during a prenatal examination and referred her to dr greggory de 
vore director of the intermountain fetal diagnostic and treatment 
center at lds hospital here 
most babies with the fetuss condition die within the first 
three to four weeks of life de vore said 
twenty infants have undergone human heart transplants at loma 
linda and 16 are having healthy normal childhoods said hospital 
spokeswoman anita rockwell 
but de vore said those were the ones lucky enough to find a 
donor and that half the babies die before a donor can be located 
the petersens hope to improve the odds by starting the search 
before birth 
we know there is only a 50 percent chance they will even 
locate a donor but we are optimistic petersen said 
because a newborns immune system isnt developed it is not 
yet keyed in to reject a donor organ and the transplant is more 
likely to take de vore said although rejection still is possible 
the petersens have a 5yearold girl and a 2yearold boy 
petersen is a maintenance worker for the utah national guard and 
mrs petersen is a nurse 
the couple said their insurance company will not cover the 
100000plus price tag of the surgery and they dont know how they 
are going to pay it

walter hudson who walked out of his 
house for the first time in 18 years after losing an estimated 680 
pounds in a year says he dreams of helping other fat people slim 
down 
i got a lot to live for the 520pound long island man said 
after he lumbered into the sunshine thursday i want to help a 
lot of people people who are overweight or on drugs 
hudson 43 weighed about 1200 pounds a year ago 
wearing a light blue toga with pants and sunglasses to protect 
his eyes hudson walked through a widened doorway and onto a 
specially constructed elevated concrete patio he sat on a 
concrete block with a vinyl cushion 
it feels good he said i shouldnt have waited this 
long 
hudsons fear that his legs would not support his weight kept 
him confined mostly to his bed since he was 15 years old he made 
headlines last fall when he became wedged in a doorway and had to 
be rescued by firefighters with saws 
hudson said thursday that frightening episode was a blessing 
because it made him realize something had to be done 
i would have kept eating more and more he said that fall 
saved my life it was a gift from god 
he lost several hundred pounds under a diet regimen directed by 
comedianturnednutritionist dick gregory but when gregory wanted 
to bring him to his clinic in the bahamas hudson balked he didnt 
want to leave the house 
hudson pressed ahead with his own diet he drank his own liquid 
diet formula which he plans to market some day every other day 
he consumes nothing but water every three days he eats garlic 
onions and apple cider 
in an average week he loses three pounds he hopes to reach 190 
pounds 
hudson has been aided by a medical team led by barbara rosen a 
psychologist specializing in eating disorders 
i am very proud of what walter has accomplished in such a 
short period of time said rosen he knows now that anything he 
sets his mind to do he can do 
hudsons goal is to visit his mothers grave in a cemetery a few 
blocks from the small house he shares with his relatives 
mama knows im coming to see her he said it wont be 
long now

iran raised the possibility that the stalled peace 
talks with iraq could be suspended and shifted to new york the 
first public indication by either side that a break is near in the 
2weekold negotiations 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran charged at a news 
conference thursday that iraq tried to derail the discussions 
by introducing extraneous elements on the first day of talks 
aug 25 
he said the tehran government agreed in principle with small 
reservations to a compromise formula proposed by un mediator 
jan eliasson in an effort to move the talks ahead but that iraq 
refused to accept it velayati refused to elaborate on the proposal 
there was no response from iraqi officials iraq and iran have 
engaged in indirect peace talks all but one day since aug 25 
in an interview with irans official islamic republic news 
agency velayati also accused the iraqis of repeating past matters 
without showing the slightest cooperation and flexibility with 
un mediators 
asked at the news conference if he foresaw an early adjournment 
of negotiations and a shift of venue to new york he said 
yes i think it will start in maybe two or three weeks from 
now but the ending of this round of talks depends on the decision 
of the un secretarygeneral 
the talks are aimed at a lasting peace settlement after the 
unsponsored ceasefire in the 8yearold persian gulf war took 
effect aug 20 
the timing of the next round probably would coincide with 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellars presence in new york 
for the un general assembly opening sept 20 
perez de cuellar personally mediated the first week of iraniraq 
talks then named eliasson a swedish diplomat as his special 
representative 
the un chief said wednesday the talks were blocked and that no 
quick solution was in sight 
velayati said iran was ready to pursue peace efforts and to 
resume facetoface meetings which were held only on the first two 
days of talks 
the londonbased newsletter mideast mirror quoted velayati in an 
interview as urging third parties including neighboring gulf arab 
states to persuade the baghdad government to confine the peace 
talks to the agenda 
in geneva velayati said iraq deviated from the basis for the 
talks laid out mainly in a un ceasefire resolution by 
demanding discussion of free navigation and the clearing of the 
disputed shattalarab waterway which forms the countries 
southern border 
iran has consistently said these points should be dealt with 
later 
velayati said clearing shattalarab could not be discussed 
before the forces of both sides withdraw to internationally 
recognized borders 
the problem is that iran still considers valid a 1975 treaty 
setting the iraniraq border down the middle of shattalarab 
iraqs major sea outlet iraq has renounced the pact and claimed 
the entire waterway 
shattalarab has been blocked by sunken ships almost since the 
war began in september 1980 and has also become silted

coretta scott king can sue boston university for 
thousands of documents martin luther king jr gave the school but 
will have to explain why she waited 23 years to seek her late 
husbands papers a judge ruled 
in a ruling made public thursday suffolk superior court judge 
john l murphy jr said a 1964 letter by king bequeathing the 
papers to bu is not a formal will giving mrs king the right to 
pursue her claim 
a lawyer for mrs king james obrien said he was pleased with 
the decision and would soon file a motion requesting a trial 
attorney melvin miller a member of the bu board of trustees 
said murphys decision never touched on who should own the papers 
the ruling dated aug 31 is the latest development in a legal 
battle launched by mrs king in december she wants the 83000 
documents held by bu transfered to the martin luther king jr 
center for nonviolent social change in atlanta which holds 
100000 other king documents 
the bu collection represents about onethird of kings surviving 
documents and correspondence 
a key issue in a trial murphy said would be whether the 
23year delay in instituting this action was unreasonable and 
resulted in some injury or prejudice to bu 
obrien said he was confident the question of any harm to bu in 
the delayed filing of the claim can be easily handled boston 
university has not been harmed in any way its actually benefited 
by having the papers all this time he said 
the judge also rejected a counterclaim by bu to ownership of the 
king papers stored in atlanta 
miller labeled the decision very spurious and said 
university attorneys havent decided whether to appeal 
obrien said he was pleased the counterclaim was rejected 
thats 90 percent of the case behind us in our favor he said 
mrs king is on vacation and was not available for comment 
in the onepage typewritten letter dated july 16 1964 king 
who received his doctorate in theology from bu in 1955 wrote in 
the event of my death all such materials deposited with the 
university shall become from that date the absolute property of 
boston university

a storm that triggered floods across central 
florida causing at least six deaths and the evacuation of 1000 
people threatened homes and lives as it headed north today 
officials said 
tampa should be breaking out of the rain but north of 
tampa they could still get some pretty substantial rain national 
weather service meteorologist randy lascody said in miami 
the storm has swamped the gulf coast with up to 15 inches of 
rain since sunday causing more than 1 million in damage in 
hardhit manatee county where a state of emergency was in effect 
the weather service issued a flashflood watch for gulf and 
franklin counties in the florida panhandle 
a wave of showers moving north from the gulf of mexico was 
expected to settle over northern florida and southern georgia by 
tonight lascody said adding that the real heavy stuff should 
be heading up the southern atlantic coast 
gov bob martinez was to tour the stricken bradenton area of 
manatee county by florida air national guard helicopter today to 
decide whether the area should be declared eligible for state 
disaster relief money 
the rising waters left two dead on the west coast a 44yearold 
tampa man was presumed drowned after his car plunged into a ditch 
and he was sucked into a pipe near downtown tampa in new port 
richey a 2yearold boy drowned in a rainswollen canal 
the storm also contributed to a small plane crash wednesday that 
killed all four aboard near williston about 110 miles north of 
tampa national transportation safety board investigator ron bird

the rainfall far surpassed the 5 inches dumped by hurricane 
elena on labor day 1985 when wind and high tides did 9 million 
damage and sent 13000 people to shelters 
in st petersburg hundreds of mostly elderly residents 
mistakenly thought the latest flooding was a hurricane 
this is insane pinellas county emergency management

no reason at all

michael dukakis heads south today having 
fattened the democratic partys coffers by 5 million while 
acknowledging he faces formidable odds in his quest for the 
white house 
i wont kid you this is not going to be an easy 60 days 
dukakis said at a blacktie fund raiser thursday 
dukakis whose campaign has been sinking in the polls since the 
republican national convention last month in new orleans heads for 
that city today after first making a couple of stops in texas 
the democratic presidential nominee was planning to stop first 
at east texas state college in greenville alma mater of the late 
house speaker sam rayburn then address a convention of baptist 
ministers in dallas 
thursdays fundraiser where supporters paid a minimum of 
1000 each to attend raised more than 5 million for the 
democratic party said robert farmer in charge of raising money 
for the dukakis campaign 
the dukakis campaign so far has raised 30 million of its 50 
million goal for the national party farmer said 
the party can spend that money on activities related to the 
election such as drives to get out the vote 
dukakis also met briefly thursday with jesse jackson who was 
among four of the unsuccessful democratic presidential hopefuls 
attending the dinner at a manhattan hotel 
the two men chatted for a few minutes as jackson walked by 
dukakis table in the hotel ballroom the substance of the 
discussion was not disclosed 
the other former candidates at the event were tennessee sen 
albert gore jr missouri rep richard gephardt and former arizona 
gov bruce babbitt 
before the meeting jackson told reporters his support for the 
ticket has not wavered since the democratic convention in july but 
he said that the nominees message was not getting through 
i do know that we have a good message that needs to be an even 
sharper message jackson said if you write with the same 
pencil for a long time sometimes the message gets blurred 
dukakis who said earlier in the day he was not worried about an 
abcwashington post poll showing him trailing republican nominee 
george bush 51 percent to 43 percent told his supporters the weeks 
ahead will have good polls and not so good polls 
we are facing determined adversaries and formidable odds 
dukakis said 
dukakis was joined on the stage by his running mate sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas 
the tuxedos in manhattan contrasted sharply with the tshirts 
and coveralls dukakis encountered earlier thursday at a general 
motors corp engine assembly plant at tonawanda ny 
dukakis strolled along the assembly line shaking hands with the 
workers pausing briefly to cock his elbow atop a cart of fuel 
injectors and talk 
later with american flags and racks of completed v6 engines 
serving as a backdrop dukakis addressed a small but friendly crowd 
of plant employees 
he reminded them of a remark bush made during a visit to the 
soviet union when he said workers there could come to the united 
states to give americans a lesson in quality 
those republicans in washington love to blame american workers 
first he said

the senior republican senator from 
flameravaged wyoming insisted today that the reagan administration 
dismiss the head of the national park service over the 
controversial policy that allowed fires to burn unhindered for 
months in the west 
sen malcolm wallop repeated his call for park service director 
william penn motts dismissal despite a white house spokesmans 
statement thursday that we have no plans to fire anybody 
wallop speaking on abctvs good morning america program 
said comments by mott and other officials responsible for 
maintaining the nations forests have deeply harmed the morale of 
those battling millions of acres of western fires 
again i would say director mott has reason to offer his 
resignation wallop said in the interview 
their efforts to persuade the people of wyoming and others 
that they are doing what they can to control these fires are 
completely undermined by the actions of director mott said 
wallop 
agriculture secretary richard lyng before leaving today with 
interior secretary donald hodel for a tour of the burning lands 
said the policy of allowing natural fires to burn out has been 
abandoned since july 
and lyng insisted on cbstvs this morning i dont think 
theres going to be anyone fired 
in fairness i think these people have done what anyone 
objectively looking at it would have to say a tremendous job of 
trying to bring this very difficult situation under control he 
said 
the calls for motts resignation came from capitol hill 
wednesday and president reagan moved to quell the discontent by 
dispatching hodel lyng and deputy defense secretary william h 
taft iv today to survey the damage 
almost all of yellowstone national park in wyoming has been 
closed because of fires that have burned 12 million acres

a former nightclub owner and his exbodyguard 
have arrested in a gruesome 7yearold set of slayings for which 
authorities unsuccessfully prosecuted the late porn star john 
johnny wadd holmes 
the 1981 bludgeoning deaths of four people in a home in rustic 
upscale laurel canyon down the road from a home owned by thengov 
edmund g brown jr have been one of the citys most notorious 
unsolved murder cases 
adel nasrallah known as eddie nash 59 of tarzana and gregory 
dewitt diles 40 were charged thursday with four counts of murder 
and one of attempted murder the charges carry the possibility of 
the death penalty 
they were arrested wednesday and held without bail for a court 
appearance sept 19 
holmes a film star who claimed thousands of sexual conquests on 
and off screen was the only person tried in the slayings he was 
acquitted holmes died of aids in march 
he never took the witness stand and his subsequent testimony 
before a grand jury remains sealed but his former wife sharon 
told the los angeles times earlier this year that holmes had 
confessed his role in the killings to her less than three weeks 
after the crimes 
shortly before his death holmes was questioned again by 
authorities but deputy district attorney dale davidson said the 
actor did not lead prosecutors to the unspecified new evidence that 
he said resulted in thursdays charges 
we are going on the same theory as we did then that the 
murders were a retaliation for a drug robbery some 48 hours before 
the murders he said 
prosecutor ronald s coen alleged at holmes trial that nash 
who owned several nightclubs ordered the killings in revenge for a 
robbery at his home 
coen said holmes led the killers to the laurel canyon house on 
orders from nash who supplied drugs to holmes 
nash wasnt tried at the time because of insufficient evidence 
said police investigator tom lange diles was arrested in 1981 but 
released for lack of evidence 
nashs attorney paul caruso speculated that authorities 
probably were pressured to bring charges and that the political 
ambitions of district attorney ira reiner played a part 
i think mr reiner has his eyes set on higher goals i think 
well see him declare for attorney general caruso said 
slain were william deverell 42 joy audrey miller 46 barbara 
richardson 22 and ronald launius 37 his wife susan launius 
survived a severe beating but was unable to identify her attackers

sailors set off firecrackers and 
passengers threw colorful streamers to shore as a luxury liner 
pulled out of this northern port today in the first ferry service 
between archrivals taiwan and china 
many of the 68 taiwanese passengers bound for shanghai on the 
excelsior neptune are visiting the chinese mainland for the first 
time since taiwans nationalist government eased a fourdecadeold 
travel ban to china last year 
tsao chengchih president of the excelsior marine transport 
inc said the passengers would disembark at okinawa early saturday 
and transfer to the excelsior mercury for the remainder of the 
threeday journey to bypass the nationalists ban on direct 
shipping links with china 
we have been waiting for this sea voyage for months it is 
really convenient said king tawei a clerk who left his native 
shanghai 42 years ago 
king and his wife carried dozens of mooncakes a traditional 
snack of the chinese moon festival that falls on sept 25 and 
winter clothes as gifts for relatives 
among the passengers were 13 reporters including a fourmember 
television crew and about 30 retired servicemen who came to 
taiwan in 1949 when the chinese nationalists fled the mainland 
after losing a civil war to communist forces 
i am anxious to know how my cousins are said wang shiwei 
a 65yearold army veteran who said he was excited at returning to 
his hometown in northeastern shandong province 
more than 150000 taiwan residents have visited china since the 
travel ban was eased in october to allow family reunions first 
flying to hong kong or other intermediate points because direct 
travel remains forbidden by the nationalist government 
shanghai is 370 miles northeast of keelung but the trip will 
cover more than twice that distance because of the okinawa stop 
the nationalists still ban official contacts with china but 
decided at a july party congress to gradually open up more civilian 
exchanges such as allowing chinese to visit sick relatives in 
taiwan 
an 80member taiwanese and philippine crew was aboard the liner 
which can carry 330 passengers tsao said he blamed a poor 
advertising campaign for the small number of passengers on the 
maiden voyage 
tickets cost 517 for economy cabins and 590 for firstclass 
cabins the 5070ton sovietmade liner which the taiwan company 
purchased through hong kong brokers earlier this year features a 
pool music hall and bar 
the taiwan visitors will be welcomed by shanghai city officials 
and residents when the line arrives monday tsao said 
the liberal liberty times hailed the ferry service which will 
run once every four days as a move that opens the door for 
shipping exchanges across the taiwan straits it said many 
leading taiwanese businessmen have visited various chinese ports to 
arrange for other ferry services 
a ministry of communications official tony tung said the 
liners voyage to okinawa was approved by keelung harbor bureau 
authorities because we consider it a regular shipping service 
between two international ports we dont question where and how 
the passengers are transshipped after okinawa 
three other companies plan to inaugurate indirect passenger 
ferry services to china later this month on saturday the 
tokyobased naha holiday travel center sent two liners carrying 
about 300 taiwanese from keelung to the eastern chinese coastal 
city of xiamen amoy via okinawa

pravda today acknowledged for the first time in 
decades that leon trotsky played a key role in the russian 
revolution but it said lenin considered him a judas 
for decades trotskys name has been virtually banned from the 
soviet staterun press and his role in the creation of the worlds 
first socialist state virtually wiped from the historical record 
the article in the government daily was an excerpt from a 
biography of josef stalin being written by col gen dmitri 
volkogonov the biography described trotsky in language that 
during stalins rule might well have cost its author his life 
being quite a gifted publicist speaker and organizer trotsky 
played a wellknown role in the october armed uprising and 
eventually in the civil war years when he was peoples commissar 
for military and naval affairs and chairman of the revolutionary 
council pravda quoted the biography as saying 
the words used to describe trotsky would have been unimaginable 
in the pages of the communist party daily as recently as a year 
ago their publication in pravda indicated highlevel party support 
for a reexamination of trotsky 
although recognizing trotskys abilities and his deeds on behalf 
of the revolution the article noted that vladimir lenin the 
leader of the bolsheviks had called trotsky a judas in 1911 
the headline of the fullpage pravda article called trotsky 
the demon of the revolution indicating that a fullblown 
return to official favor is unlikely 
by the time he was murdered in exile in mexico city in 1940 
trotskys image had been cut or airbrushed from archive photographs 
of the 1917 bolshevik revolution and he was portrayed in official 
histories solely as a revolutionary turncoat who opposed both lenin 
and stalin 
as part of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs drive for 
glasnost or increased openness on some issues soviet 
historians have been more frankly assessing their countrys past 
including the role of stalin foes like nikolai bukharin lev 
kamenev and trotsky 
in a major kremlin speech last november gorbachev credited 
stalin with preventing a taeover of the communist party by trotsky 
and his supporters in the late 1920s and said stalin was defending 
the orthodox line set down by lenin 
but since then the official staterun press has stepped up its 
attacks on the bloody legacy left by stalins 29 years in power 
including a system of political and economic control based on 
terror and purges in which millions died 
during the years of revolution and civil war the most popular 
leader after lenin was trotsky the article said there are 
grounds to consider that trotsky during the years of his most 
active participation in party life 191724 was not an enemy of 
the revolution and of socialism but already at that time he was 
an enemy of stalin 
that phrasing is at odds with the way the soviet press depicted 
trotsky for decades as a turncoat and traitor to the working class 
and to the revolution 
before lenin died in 1924 he called trotsky and stalin 
outstanding communist party officials but drew the attention of the 
party to the serious negative personal qualities of both men 
the article said the struggle between them became one of the 
most dramatic pages of our history it added 
after lenins death the article said the soviet founders 
appraisal of trotsky as a selfconfident perennially dodging and 
shifting and tricky politician became confirmed 
after being expelled from the party and the country trotsky 
slipped down to antisoviet and antimarxist positions the 
pravda article said

would jump up and down and kick 
he screamed marine as he was kicking me said carlson 
then he set a deadline for my life fifteen minutes said 
carlson 
hamadi several times extended the deadline for refueling with 
the tower carlson said he said hamadi became more and more 
agitated as the negotiations dragged on 
angry he said in english one american must die carlson 
said suddenly i heard him scream marine and i felt a metal bar 
come down on my head twice i knew that third blow would be the 
death blow because i heard him climb on a console 
carlson said he managed to roll slightly on the floor and did 
not take the full force of the blow 
hamadi then kicked me in the jaw to see if i was alive 
carlson said that hamadi then dragged him to the front passenger 
door opened the door and with the gun at my head extended the 
deadline for another 10 minutes 
hamadi then went back to the cockpit and carlson said he lost 
feeling from the waist up and started to cough up blood at that 
point i felt that id certainly die within 10 minutes carlson 
said 
carlson said that after the hijacking was over stewardess uli 
direckson told him that after the deadline passed hamadi came 
back to kill me but both she and hamadi thought i was already 
dead

turks are expressing concern over 
longterm problems that may have been caused by allowing about 
60000 kurdish refugees fleeing iraq to enter turkey in the past 
week 
primary concern is over security at a time when turkey slowly 
has been gaining the upper hand in a war of attrition against its 
own band of kurdish guerrillas known as the kurdish labor party 
the marxist group aims to set up an independent state in the 
southeast provinces 
intelligence and military officials fear that members of the 
party often denied sanctuary or assistance by turkeys kurdish 
minority of 10 million in the region can now find a safe haven to 
organize and recruit in the new refugee camps near the border 
today the foreign ministry denied reports that several thousand 
kurdish refugees given sanctuary in turkey had later been forced to 
go to iran 
it is out of the question to send any of the refugees to 
another country against their will we categorically deny these 
reports foreign ministry spokesman nazim belger said 
on sunday the leftist istanbul daily cumhuriyet quoted a local 
opposition politician in semdinli township near the iraqi border as 
saying that 4000 to 5000 kurdish refugees had been sent to iran 
against their will 
the report was later picked up by foreign news media 
security forces are taking precautions to prevent infiltration 
of the camps by the kurdish labor party regional governor hayri 
kozakcioglu has said 
since 1984 about 700 people have died in clashes between 
turkish government forces and the guerrillas 
local residents feel turkeys acceptance of the refugees who 
have relatives or other ties in turkey will win the loyalty of the 
countrys kurds and reduce any motivation to cooperate with the 
kurdish labor party 
all action against the government must now stop because of the 
goodness shown our ethnic brothers said selim kaya a driver 
from the hakkari province where the refugee influx was centered 
while the security problem was being debated over the past two 
days guerrillas killed eight soldiers and one police officer five 
rebels were slain by the army 
another possible problem stemming from the admission of the 
refugees could be the deterioration of turkeys relations with 
baghdad diplomats and officials say 
throughout the eightyear iraniraq war turkey maintained good 
relations with both sides meeting their export needs but refusing 
to sell arms 
iraq sees the kurdish guerrillas as traitors who sided with the 
enemy and attacked them when they were engaged with iranian forces 
seen in that context turkeys admission of the refugees can be 
seen as rendering aid to the enemy 
the refugees include many guerrillas according to reports from 
the border area several thousand already have crossed into iran 
from where they are likely to slip back into iraq to fight again 
iran has been supporting the guerrillas 
iraq launched its offensive against kurds fighting for autonomy 
in northern iraq soon after iran agreed to a unsponsored 
ceasefire in the iraniraq war the ceasefire began aug 20 
iraq has declared amnesty for the kurds reportedly at turkeys 
urging but kurdish leaders have already said they will not accept 
the promised pardon 
the kurds have not struggled to be pardoned but to achieve 
their national and democratic rights within autonomy said 
massoud barzani president of the kurdish democratic party one of 
the major rebel groups in iraq our struggle will continue until 
these goals are fulfilled 
the refugees originally spread along a 60mile stretch of land 
a few miles from the iraqi border are being resettled in tent 
cities set up at five locations in diyarbakir mardin and hakkari 
provinces 
protecting the refugees against the cold feeding them and 
providing for medical and other needs will severely strain turkeys 
resources which are scarcely sufficient for its own population in 
the backward eastern region commentators in turkish newspapers 
said 
do not be surprised if the condition of the camps one day is 
criticized as cruelty of the turks by some imaginative 
antiturkish groups in western europe columnist hasan pulur 
wrote thursday in the independent daily milliyet

starting in 1990 eastman kodak co 
employees will stop working 13 months a year 
kodak is abandoning the 13month calendar developed by founder 
george eastman in 1928 the change follows a task force report that 
concluded its time to harmonize the calendar 
the change actually makes little difference to kodak employees 
except that department heads who make out 13 financial reports a 
year now will fill out only 12 
a calendar steering committee has been formed to help ease the 
transition and minimize the culture shock according to kodakery 
the companys internal newspaper 
eastman a busy man probably wished he could cram more than 24 
hours into a day or seven days into a week but his 13month 
calendar was intended to smooth out variations in the standard 
calendar in which months can be anywhere from 28 to 31 days long 
and have four and sometimes five weekends 
those variations could cause kodaks financial performance to 
vary from one month to another even though there was no real 
change 
so kodak departments report expenses and revenues every four 
weeks with each month containing 20 work days and eight weekend 
days thirteen of those periods make one year 
eastman was so convinced of the value of his calendar that he

sen gordon humphrey has apologized to a 
congressional candidate for saying she should stay home with her 
two children a remark he called just plain stupid 
in plain english i made a mistake i am sorry and i 
apologize the new hampshire republican said in a statement 
thursday 
humphrey unleashed protests both by foes and supporters of 
republican betty tamposi on tuesday when he said it was 
selfevident that you cannot work 12 to 14 hours a day in 
congress and have time left over for a child 
its difficult enough being a father of a young child and a 
member of congress as i am said humphrey who has a 3yearold 
son 
for the mother who in our society is the primary care giver 
working 1012 hours a day makes it impossible to give the nurturing 
the child would need 
tamposi has two daughters ages 22 months and 4 a millionaire 
officer in her fathers real estate company she is married and has 
a nanny care for her children 
on thursday humphrey retracted his statement even though he had 
insisted for two days he stood by his remarks 
while everyone knows of the strains congressional families 
experience as a result of the long working days of members of 
congress i had no right to impugn the motives of any person 
wishing to serve in congress he said 
my statements of tuesday that betty tamposi was prepared to 
place her ambitions ahead of the welfare of her children were 
unjustified and just plain stupid humphrey said 
tamposi and chuck douglas are viewed as the frontrunners in the 
sixperson gop primary for a us house seat on tuesday humphrey 
supports douglas but cannot vote for him because he lives in a 
different district 
tamposi campaign aide clark dumont had called humphreys 
statement the lowest attack ever experienced in new hampshire 
politics

opponents of housepassed amendments adding 
the death penalty and other tough measures to an antidrug bill say 
the provisions turn the war on drugs into an attack on the 
constitution one congressman said today the changes are more 
antipeople than antidrug 
the amendments would deny government benefits such as housing 
loans and college grants to convicted users and allow the use of 
illegally seized evidence 
some of the things that sound rough and mean and antidrug are 
antipeople said rep charles rangle dny who offered 
alternatives to both the death penalty and benefitsdenial 
provisions 
rangle interviewed on cbs this morning said the measure 
if it becomes law could penalize innocent family members of 
drugabusing veterans by kicking them out of public housing and by 
denying pensions to widows 
rep bill mccollum rfla appearing on the same program 
defended the amendments saying rangles proposals would have left 
no sanctions against college students he called the veterans issue 
bogus since drug convictions could not deny them retirement 
disability or health benefits 
others joined rangle in criticising the amendments 
weve assaulted a great many bill of rights provisions rep 
john conyers dmich and chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on criminal justice said following thursdays votes 
i have yet to count how many are still standing 
rep gv montgomery dmiss and conservative chairman of the 
veterans affairs committee complained that the benefit takeaways 
would be so severe that convicted medal of honor winners could not 
be buried at arlington national cemetery 
but rep dan lungren dcalif sponsor of the illegal evidence 
provision responded i reject the notion that someone here is 
assaulting the constitution thats the argument you hear when 
youve lost the argument unfortunately 
the hardliners on drug penalties overwhelmingly won amendments 
to allow a federal death penalty deny government benefits to 
convicted drug users and dealers and admit in court evidence that 
was seized illegally but in good faith 
the house added the measures to legislation that would add some 
2 billion to the 39 billion the government now spends to attack 
illegal drugs the bill pours money into every weapon used to 
reduce demand increase arrests and seizures and rehabilitate 
abusers 
debate on the comprehensive legislation is set to resume next 
wednesday with a final vote possible on thursday the senate has 
not begun consideration on its version of the drug bill 
the house still must vote on proposals that would hold back 
highway money from states that refused to suspend or revoke drug 
abusers drivers licenses and to strip from the bill a sevenday 
waiting period on handgun purchases during the seven days police 
would have the option of conducting a background check 
after sometimes emotional debate thursday the house 
voted 299111 for an amendment by rep george gekas rpa 
that would allow federal judges to impose the death penalty for 
someone convicted of a murder during a narcoticsrelated felony 
approved 33567 a proposal by mccollum that would deny many 
federal benefits to anyone convicted of two drug offenses 
including possession or for a single drug distribution offense 
benefits that could be refused include student loans public 
housing and veterans assistance 
passed 259134 lungrens amendment for admission of evidence 
seized illegally by police acting in good faith 
the death penalty amendment would give a judge the option of 
imposing a 20yeartolife sentence a separate amendment approved 
4101 would require a mandatory life sentence for those who kill 
during a drug felony those measures could be in conflict but no 
immediate effort was made to reconcile them 
the senate voted 6529 last june to permit the death penalty for 
narcotics dealers convicted of murder in drug crimes and for drug 
kingpins defined under law as those who supervise five or more 
people commit at least three federal drug felonies and derive 
substantial income from a continuing criminal enterprise 
most federal death penalty provisions are not enforceable 
because unlike some state laws they were never brought into 
compliance with supreme court guidelines on capital punishment 
gekas said he crafted his amendment to meet the requirements 
mccollums amendment would deny benefits for five years to 
anyone convicted of two or more drugrelated offenses within a 
10year period and for 10 years in cases of a single conviction 
for drug distribution 
heads of federal agencies could restore benefits for those who 
completed a drug rehabilitation program or were otherwise 
rehabilitated 
veterans benefits would be denied only to those convicted of 
drug distribution retirement welfare health and disability 
benefits would be exempted from the penalty 
mccollum argued that education and rehabilitation are not 
enough to stop demand and added if we dont have a deterrent 
we wont win the war on the demand side and if we dont win on the 
demand side we wont win the war period 
lungren asked if the house wanted to let a drug trafficker send 
the message that i got involved in drugs in vietnam and therefore 
im excused

israeli security forces today arrested more 
than 200 proplo activists and claimed to have broken up a 
clandestine network that organized subversive activities in the 
gaza strip the army said 
the roundup came as islamic militants mounted a strike that 
closed most of the occupied lands in a challenge to the proplo 
united national leadership of the uprising in some areas 
fundamentalists fought supporters of plo chairman yasser arafat 
with stones and fists 
meanwhile police said a palestinian who allegedly collaborated 
with israel was assassinated in jaffa near tel aviv 
in another development hospital officials said four 
palestinians including a 14yearold boy were shot and wounded in 
clashes with israeli troops near the west bank town of nablus 
elsewhere several hundred israeli soldiers using a new tactic 
to combat the 9month old palestinian uprising sealed off the west 
bank village of kfar malik 15 miles north of jerusalem at dawn 
today and arrested about 25 palestinians accused of antiisrael 
activities arab residents said 
an army spokesman said soldiers carried lists of suspects who 
allegedly carried out subversive activity and hostile acts such as 
throwing rocks and bottles 
on tuesday soldiers entered qalqilya a town of about 25000 
and arrested about 200 arabs the town located on a strategic 
highway linking israel and dozens of jewish settlements remained 
under curfew today 
the crackdown in gaza broke up a regional leadership that 
extended to 37 socalled popular committees which organized 
community affairs in towns villages and city neighborhoods 
an army spokesman said those arrested were linked with fatah 
arafats faction of the palestine liberation organization 
the army claimed to have captured the gaza leader of the plo 
network but the spokesman declined to identify him except to say 
he had been arrested previously 
those detained in gaza were responsible for 40 to 50 firebomb 
attacks against the shops of merchants who failed to heed strike 
calls the army spokesman said adding the groups also planned 
about 30 attacks against israeli army patrols 
maj gen yitzhak mordechai commander of the gaza strip was 
quoted by israel radio as saying he may recommend deportation for 
some of those detained israel has deported 33 palestinians since 
the uprising began in december despite international protests 
israel radio said three members of the gaza ring were suspected 
of killing rachel weiss an elderly woman found near her negev 
desert home on aug 3 
the army spokesman said the arrest campaign had severely 
weakened the plo we are not saying that new leaders will not 
emerge but they will not have the same influence or 
organization said one spokesman who demanded anonymity 
the strike called by the fundamentalist hamas or zeal 
stopped workers from going to jobs in israel and closed stores and 
businesses but in some cases fundamentalists fought plo supporters 
with stones fists and angry words 
shortly before todays strike was scheduled to begin masked 
youths rode bicycles through the largely christian town of 
bethlehem warning shopkeepers to close within five minutes the 
merchants complied reluctantly 
if the strike is going to take place then i will observe it 
not because i want to but because i am afraid that my shop will be 
burned said bassam jaber owner of a car spare parts store 
arguments broke out between hamas supporters and shopkeepers 
near bethlehems market after islamic militants shouting allahu 
akbar god is great started burning tires and warning merchants 
to observe the strike witnesses said the fighting ended when 
israeli troops approached 
most of arab east jerusalem including the walled old city 
remained open despite the strike call 
the strike is part of a power struggle between islamic militants 
who oppose any negotiated settlement with the jewish state and 
supporters of the plo who have been urging peace talks 
hamas has a large following among the 650000 residents of the 
gaza strip but their support has traditionally been weaker in the 
west bank where 850000 palestinians live 
the islamic fundamentalist strike was called to mark the start 
of the 10th month of the palestinian uprising since the rebellion 
began dec 8 260 palestinians and five israelis have been killed 
in jaffa police said an assailant shot and killed ahmed 
fanjari 55 the assailant escaped a police commander on israel 
army radio linked the shooting to a dispute in the moslem community 
over fanjaris selling of land 
palestinian sources said graffitti seen on walls in the area 
accused him of collaborating with israeli officials

the vatican today said that john paul ii 
who is skirting south africa on a fivecountry pilgrimage starting 
saturday hopes to visit the racially troubled nation at a later 
date 
in an unusual statement issued on the eve of his departure the 
vatican emphasized that the pope would welcome such a stop so 
that he may become more closely acquainted with the vast and varied 
reality of their south african local church 
as is well known however the conditions prevailing in that 
country are marked by complex problems affecting the coexistence of 
the various ethnic groups problems which give rise to anxiety and 
considerable concern 
the vatican statement appeared directed at reports the pope had 
ruled out a visit to segregated south africa which has a white 
minority government 
the vatican statement said that while the pope would have liked 
to visit other nations in southern africa on this trip the 
intense program already arranged some time ago has made it 
impossible 
in july the pope said that south africas roman catholic 
bishops had advised against a trip at this time but that maybe he 
could visit the country some day he didnt elaborate at the time 
many south africans are expected to travel to the five countries 
bordering south africa which the pope will visit zimbabwe 
botswana lesotho swaziland and mozambique 
the vatican statement pointed out that the south african bishops 
whom the pope will meet in zimbabwe had sent the pope an invitation 
as long ago as 1982 and that the government had also extended its 
own bid 
mentioning without elaborating the complex problems 
affecting the ethnic coexistence the statement added in such 
circumstances a visit by the pope could nevertheless favor a 
positive development of the situation 
one of its many good results would be to encourage the efforts 
of those especially the catholics who are involved with 
generosity and good will the quest for peaceful solutions for the 
life of the whole of south african society 
south africa dominates communications trade transportation and 
politics in southern africa and its influence will be felt strongly 
during the 10day trip john paul has been critical of south 
african apartheid throughout his nearly 10yearold pontificate 
he has frequently visited countries whose policies local bishops 
and the vatican have criticized ranging from marxist nicaragua to 
authoritarian governments in paraguay and chile

mayor edward i koch urged a judge to send 
parking meter thieves to jail but she rejected his advice and 
scolded him for singling out the little people in his first 
court appearance in 11 years 
then she made him sit in the courtroom despite what he said was 
important city business awaiting him 
supreme court justice ruth moskowitz said she thought koch 
should stay to learn more about the defendants and see the 
sentencings 
he has never appeared when a commissioner was being sentenced 
he has never appeared when a borough president or someone in high 
political office was being sentenced moskowitz said thursday 
these are the little people and the little people commit 
crimes too she said little people are going to be treated 
just the way the big boys are treated they are human beings and 
they have rights too 
koch in his statement to the court said he was outraged by 
moskowitzs promise to spare some of the 34 former meter collectors 
a jail term or probation 
koch then asked to leave to conduct important city business but 
the judge refused 
if you are ordering me i will stay but i dont believe you 
have the right to koch said returning to his seat in the 
gallery 
about 10 minutes later when the first sentencing moskowitz 
said im going to release the mayor from custody 
koch and his entourage then left the courtroom 
koch called moskowitzs comments about him never appearing in 
court before a cheap shot 
he said he had previously submitted written statements to judges 
in the howard beach racial attack and the case of a former bronx 
democratic leader convicted of corruption 
i believe that if you commit a crime against government 
whether you are in a high place or a low place you deserve to go 
to jail he said 
inside the courtroom after the mayor had left moskowitz said 
i have never had a victim come into court make a speech for the 
cameras and rush out again

christ opened in london today to poor reviews a small protest 
outside a theater and a ban on advertising in the london subway 
system 
about 150 viewers attended the first public showing of the 
martin scorsese film about christs life in a 600seat cinema on 
shaftesbury avenue half a dozen protesters gathered outside 
the film opens in two other london theaters today but national 
distribution dates have not been set 
first into the moviehouse was michael fadel who said i seek 
no publicity i seek knowledge 
another viewer glenn petrie said im here to see a good 
movie im also making my own private protest as a christian 
against this 
nearby protesters handed out leaflets and copies of the gospel 
according to st mark a man chanted verses from the bible there 
were no incidents 
one protester ruth bowhill 23 from st mary churchs in 
reading south of london said i as a christian would never 
spend money to support such a blasphemous film 
she said she had not seen it but i know enough to know it is 
abominable in gods sight and that men are going away from god in 
seeing the film 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie spiritual head of the 
church of england and leader of the 70million worldwide anglican 
communion and cardinal basil hume leader of 52 million roman 
catholics in england and wales have urged christians to shun the 
film 
london transport advertising a subsidiary of london regional 
transport said it banned posters advertising the movie from the 
subway system 
the movies distributors united international pictures said in 
a statement that the decison amounted to censorship 
it is regrettable that london transport advertising should 
take this action despite having advised me that they have not 
received any letters from the public encouraging this course of 
action said ken green the companys marketing director 
a spokesman for london transport advertising who demanded 
anonymity said it doesnt matter that we have had no complaints 
it is very clear this film is going to offend religious groups 
because church leaders like cardinal hume have urged christians not 
to see it our job is to protect our passengers 
london transport advertising said that while the poster itself 
was not offensive it was certain to upset many passengers 
reaction among london critics who saw the film at a press 
preview thursday ranged from scathing criticism and charges it was 
theologically offensive and artistically incompetent to lukewarm 
praise 
one part of the film shows jesus christ hallucinating while on 
the cross about marrying and having sex with mary magdalene 
the british board of film classification which decides which 
movies can be shown to children and which can be seen only by 
adults on aug 25 granted the film a certificate allowing it to be 
shown in britain to audiences over the age of 18

sen dan quayle was met by protesters and 
by workers wearing dukakisbentsen tshirts today when he arrived 
to tour a steel plant 
steelworker eugene autry a vietnam veteran carried a sign 
saying draft dodger quayle who died in your place a 
reference to quayles service in the national guard in indiana 
during the vietnam war 
autry standing at the plant as the indiana senators motorcade 
drove past said hes asking american men to vote for him men 
whose sons died in vietnam whose fathers died in korea whose 
grandfathers fought world war ii 
inside the stainless steel plant machinist john ledrich one of 
the workers wearing a shirt promoting quayle and george bushs 
democratic rivals said im here to tell you that him and bush 
are against the 60day plan on plant closings theyve come to the 
wrong place 
one day earlier joe coyle director of united steel workers 
district 27 which organized the demonstration said sen 
quayles record in congress is one that is in opposition to almost 
everything working people stand for 
quayles campaign was aware of the planned demonstration but 
senior adviser ken kachigian said hes not going to run away 
he said quayle has had a great rapport with steelworkers in 
his home state of indiana 
george niarchos manager of production services at the plant 
said it had about 440 employees about 100 of them trained under 
the job partnership training act sponsored in the senate by quayle 
he said the plant has been operating for two years and had been 
closed for bankruptcy before that 
earlier this week bush the republican presidential nominee 
ran into taunts and jeers when he addressed workers at an oregon 
shipyard 
meanwhile in a report that recalled stories on quayles 
academic past that surfaced shortly after his nomination the 
cleveland plain dealer reported today that quayle was admitted to 
law school under an experimental affirmative action program 
the newspaper quoted officials at the indiana university school 
of law who said the program was intended to increase admissions 
opportunities for minorities the economically disadvantaged and 
others of differing backgrounds 
cleon h faust the law school dean who approved the program in 
1969 said i can only remember blacks as the aim of the 
program he added the program sort of made up for their 
background the suggestion was that many blacks had not had the 
scholastic background to cut the mustard in graduate school 
quayle on his way out of his hotel in canton ohio this 
morning told reporters i got into law school fair and square 
and i did rather well there 
the newspaper said records of who was admitted under the program 
were not released by the university 
the visit to massillon and later speeches to the canton rotary 
club and the copco metal products co in youngstown follow a day in 
which quayle sought to tout the congressional foreign policy 
credentials he brings to the republican presidential ticket 
in a speech to the city club of chicago he called for a 
skeptical view of the soviet union saying the jury is still 
out on soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs intentions 
the thursday speech following his earlier attacks on democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis as weak and inexperienced in 
foreign policy was designed to show the breadth and knowledge 
and experience he brings to the ticket on defense and foreign 
policy issues said press secretary david prosperi 
departing from the prepared text quayle said the united states 
must move ahead on modernization of conventional forces and 
development of the strategic defense initiative system 
he also blasted the congress where he sits on the senate armed 
services committee for blocking foreign policy initiatives through 
micromismanagement 
congress doesnt even know what the definition of depressed 
trajectory of a ballistic missile is quayle said derisively 
yet they prohibit it and they ask the secretary of defense to 
please define what the depressed trajectory of a ballistic missile 
is but while youre defining it mr secretary we are going to 
prohibit it 
that is the kind of micromismanagement that we can do 
without 
quayle said he wants to see more proof of gorbachevs commitment 
to reforms in eastern europe whether he will honor treaty and arms 
reduction agreements and whether there will be human rights 
progress 
the soviet union as long as it has its ideology of marxism 
and leninism will always be an adversary will always be a 
competitor he said

a soviet space official said today that a ground 
control operator sent an incorrect message to a soviet space probe 
bound for mars and the unmanned spacecraft is now worthless 
only a miracle can save it roald z sagdeyev head of the 
soviet space research institute said in an interview with the 
associated press 
earlier the official tass news agency announced that ground 
control had lost communications contact with the phobos 1 probe 
which is millions of miles from earth and racing toward a 
rendezvous with the planet mars 
the phobos 1 mishap follows a foulup earlier in the week that 
delayed the landing of a soviet space capsule carrying a soviet and 
an afghan cosmonaut 
the unmanned mars probe phobos 1 was launched july 7 and a 
twin spacecraft phobos 2 on july 12 
the probes were scheduled to go into orbit around mars and in 
january drop behind phobos the larger of the red planets two 
moons to study the martian surface atmosphere and magnetic field 
sagdeyev however said that a ground control operator at the 
soviet mission control center near moscow sent an incorrect command 
to phobos 1 during the night of aug 2930 that left the spacecraft 
sleeping and frozen 
he said the mistake was discovered three days later and that 
ground control operators were trying to correct the problem by 
sending new commands to phobos 1 but the spacecraft was not 
responding he said 
sagdeyev said the probe could virtually be written off as a 
total loss 
the soviet space research chief spoke to a reporter during an 
afternoon reception at the us ambassadors residence in honor of 
andrei d sakharov the soviet physicist and human rights activist 
who is the 1975 nobel peace prize laureate 
tass in its report indicated that soviet space officials had 
not had any contact with phobos 1 for at least a week 
in the two months that elapsed after the blastoff the space 
probes performed 75 radio communications sessions during which 
measurings of trajectory parameters were made and operation on

george bush today charged opponent michael 
dukakis with shifting positions on military programs and said 
its sometimes hard to keep up with the democrats line on 
defense 
does he believe in defense against strategic missiles or 
doesnt he bush asked in a speech to the illinois federation of 
republican women 
dukakis in louisville on thursday told a news conference he 
would consider deploying the strategic defense initiative or star 
wars if research showed it would work and if it were in the 
national interest 
it was the first time the democrat had suggested any 
circumstances under which he would support deployment of the reagan 
administrations spaceshield proposal designed to destroy 
incoming soviet missiles in space 
his position on sdi calling it a fantasy one day something 
he wont rule out the next suggests a confusion on basic 
facts bush told his audience 
he also questioned dukakis claims that he would modernize 
landbased weapons if essential while reexamining the mx and 
midgetman missiles 
how do you modernize the landbased leg if you oppose the mx 
and midgetman bush asked 
ive tried to be fair and accurate as to my opponents 
positions but lately they seem to have been shifting so rapidly 
its sometimes hard to keep up bush said 
bushs sharp criticism comes a day after he accused dukakis of 
seeking to restrain the nuclear capability of the united states 
when he advocated a nuclear freeze 
while insisting he wasnt challenging dukakis patriotism bush 
slammed the democratic presidential nominee after overseeing the 
destruction of two us pershing nuclear missile engines on 
thursday 
the engines were destroyed under a ussoviet armsreduction 
pact the vice president claimed could not have been negotiated 
under a dukakis presidency 
in his speech today to the gop womens group bush said what he 
witnessed at the army ammunition plant in east texas the day before 
was unforgettable 
these acts of destruction were acts of peace he said but 
he added yesterday would not have been possible had dukakis 
been in office 
meanwhile bush said he was pleased with the agreement with the 
dukakis camp to have two presidential and one vice presidential 
debates 
it sounds very good got the right number bush told 
reporters upon his airport arrival here late thursday 
the bush campaign had held out for only two presidential 
debates while dukakis forces had sought three or more 
bush said he believed the more modest schedule finally adopted 
will have widespread support of the american voters 
the missiles actually the solidfuel rocket first stages 
were among 859 such missiles the united states has agreed to 
destroy over the next three years under the agreement to eliminate 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles the soviets agreed to destroy 
1752 under the pact and began the process last july 
bush in a somber and nonpartisan address to a group of us 
european and soviet officials who witnessed the fiery destruction 
of the rocket engines called it a moment we will be able to tell 
our children and grandchildren about 
this was the day we began to reverse the arms race this was 
the day we began destroying the weapons of destruction bush said 
at the longhorn army ammunition plant in karnack tex 
but bush quickly shed his nonpolitical tone at a 
conventioncenter rally a few hours later in nearby tyler texas 
bush cited dukakiss past support freeze on nuclear weapons 
asserting dukakis had taken such a stand to keep the united states 
from expanding its nuclear arsenal 
he wanted to restrain us not the soviet union bush said 
therein lies a big difference between george bush and the 
governor of massachusetts 
i dont question his patriotism bush said i question his 
judgement 
i want to build on the record of peace through strength and 
it cant be done if we have a naive view of the soviet union 
bush said reminding audience that he was met with mikhail s 
gorbachev bush described the soviet leader as tough 
we must not and if i am elected i will not make unilateral 
concessions to mr gorbachev or to the soviet union he said 
bush also praised sen dan quayle rind calling him my 
young vigorous running mate who understands defense 
however bush has not appeared with quayle since right after the 
gop convention last month and aides said that there are currently 
no plans for any joint appearances 
after arriving in rockford last night bush and his entourage 
went unannounced to a local italian restaurant where he spent 
about two hours eating and posing for snapshots afterwards bush 
plunged into the crowd that had gathered outside shaking hands and 
lifting several toddlers into his arms

burmas former leader said today he has 
formed a rival government to take power from the forces that ousted 
him 26 years ago and imposed singleparty rule about 500 soldiers 
mutinied and joined the ranks of protesters demonstrating for 
democracy 
former prime minister u nu in a letter distributed to 
diplomatic missions also announced that general elections will be 
held oct 9 and unveiled a 26member cabinet with himself as prime 
minister former president mahn win maung as president and retired 
gen tin oo as defense minister 
there was no immediate reaction to the move which is regarded 
as high treason under current law from the government of president 
maung maung or the military but one prominent opposition figure 
not included in the cabinet called the move preposterous 
diplomats said u nus chances of success are difficult to 
access burma remains on the brink of chaos and the powerful 
military is still intact todays also announcement was not the 
first time u nu has tried to regain control in the 1970s he 
attempted to lead an antine win insurgency from bases along the 
thaiburmese border but the attacks failed 
the mutinies from the military and u nus declaration came one 
day after about 1 million people surged through the city of rangoon 
in the largest antigovernment protest since aug 21 
as a precautionary measure embassies and other foreign 
organizations evacuated more than 230 dependents and nonessential 
staffers aboard a commercial thai aircraft to bangkok thailand 
according to diplomats the evacuees included 46 americans 29 
thais 28 south koreans 13 british citizens two russians and 
others from japan and australia 
foreigners are not in danger at present but life is very 
difficult said one world bank official who arrived in bangkok 
theres no fuel and less and less food the evacuations are 
scheduled to continue saturday 
about 400 air force personnel along with about 100 from the navy 
and army marched in a studentled demonstration and called on a 
large contingent of troops inside city hall to join them they 
received no response 
most of the deserters were enlisted men but reporters saw 
several officers of lieutenant rank there have been numerous 
reports of military defections to protesters seeking to toppled the 
authoritarian system but this was the first time a large group was 
seen in the capital defying the government 
about 200 of the mutinous soldiers joined student leaders at 
rangoon university we side with democracy and not with 
fascists and our military training is not to shoot people 
the rebel soldiers shouted 
i have taken back the power which gen ne win has robbed from 
me u nu said in his letter from this hour sovereign power no 
longer rests with gen ne win it has come back into my hands and 
i announce this fact with joy 
the veteran 82yearold politician was toppled in a 1962 coup 
led by ne win who held the reins of power for the next 26 years 
although ne win officially retired as head of the ruling burma 
socialist program party in july many analysts believe he still 
exercises decisive control 
hardline leader sein lwin replaced ne win but resigned after 17 
days and massive street protests that resulted in at least 112 
deaths maung maung replaced sein lwin becoming burmas first 
civilian leader in 26 years but protests have continued as 
opponents try bring about a multiparty system 
u nu said he would stand for election but immediately turn over 
power to anyone who obtained a majority of votes since his 
government cannot provide ballots and other equipment elections 
will be held at mass town meetings and will not under existing 
conditions be conducted in rural areas the letter said 
the absence from u nus government of opposition leaders aung 
gyi and aung san suu kyi indicated internal splits among government 
opponents 
i am glad my name is not there it is simply preposterous 
aung gyi told reporters when asked about u nus action aung gyi is 
the nations most outspoken critic of the government he was 
arrested in july and spent a month in prison after writing a series 
of letters critical of the government 
a western analyst in bangkok said that despite the great show of 
antigovernment force burmas leaders appeared to be going ahead 
with their own timetable of holding a special congress monday to 
pave the way for a referendum on oneparty rule he said the 
powerful military also appeared to be basically intact despite 
defections and wavering 
maung maung took power aug 19 on aug 24 he announced a 
planned congress of the ruling burma socialist program party on 
monday to consider a popular referendum on oneparty rule but 
protesters have rejected his call and demanded immediate formation 
of an interim government

american education but as commendable as this effort has been we 
still have much to accomplish cavazos told a committee 
considering his nomination 
the texas tech university president who if approved would 
become the first hispanic ever appointed to the cabinet credited 
the reagan administration with spearheading education reform by 
creating the national commission on excellence in education which

once again returns to america he said

educator a consistent friend of education and an excellent choice 
to fill the post being vacated by bennett later this month

and weaken the programs designed to help the most vulnerable 
members of our society 
before the hearing gramm said he didnt expect cavazos 
nomination to be controversial 
youre talking about the dean of a major medical school the 
president of a great university who has served this nation on 
numerous boards and commissions around the world he is clearly 
loved by everybody that knows him this confirmation is a 
certainty said gramm 
a senate education subcommittee staff member added i dont 
anticipate hell have any trouble theres a very good chance it 
will be unanimous 
the aide who spoke only on condition of anonymity said a 
strong committee vote likely would herald a quick and easy 
confirmation in the full senate possibly next week 
cavazos would serve only until january when the next 
administration takes over unless the new president reappoints him 
to the post 
he was the first hispanic to serve as president of texas tech 
he also serves as the president of its medical school but is not a 
medical doctor 
a registered democrat cavazos has opposed cuts in student 
financial aid he is described by colleagues as a skilled 
administrator a delegator and a consensusbuilder 
his leadership in education on a nationwide basis is well 
known gramm said 
known informally as larry cavazos is one of three brothers who 
left the king ranch to attend what was then texas technological 
college

who now has his own ranch while the third brother dick became a

workers on rail lines to the citys northern suburbs and 
connecticut forced 95000 commuters to scramble to get to work a 
judge later ordered the employees back to work 
teamsters local 808 set up picket lines at grand central 
terminal and several other stations and other unions including 
train engineers honored the picket lines said metronorth 
commuter railroad spokeswoman susan gilbert 
we are not running trains on any of the lines ms gilbert 
said 
by 11 am the railroad obtained a backtowork order from us 
district judge inzer wyatt gilbert said 
if its legitimate and our lawyers tell us its legal of 
course well comply said john mahoney union secretarytreasurer 
a spokesman for the national mediation board which oversees 
railroad labor disputes said the strike was illegal 
in chicago today an estimated 2600 employees went on strike 
against the chicago amp north western railroad in a walkout timed to 
begin as soon rush hour ended to avoid disruptions campnw is a 
leading midwestern freight hauler and also runs commuter trains 
serving 40000 people a day in chicagos suburbs 
the fate of the evening rush hour remained in the hands of 
congress where the house today was to consider a measure imposing 
a settlement 
the new york city strike prompted by overtime practices that 
the union said endangers passengers forced thousands of commuters 
to find other ways to get to work metronorth caught by surprise 
by the walkout had no contingency plan 
i am advising people to either take regularly scheduled buses 
or somehow get to the bronx to take subways ms gilbert said 
at pelham north of the city commuters piled into taxis for a 
4 ride to a bronx subway station this is screwing everything 
up isnt it said one man 
as a cab driver pondered whether to take a fifth passenger the 
dispatcher cajoled him over the radio tell them to sit closer to 
the driver no extra charge 
cars headed for manhattan from the northern suburbs backed up 
during the morning rush and traffic on connecticut highways into 
new york was heavier than usual police said 
at a bronx subway stop a man in cufflinks who would not give 
his name looked long and hard before deciding that the newsstands 
did not carry the wall street journal

eight hours and wanted to go home

force the railroad to recognize its responsibility to provide a 
safe railroad for its commuters and its employees 
local 808 has been without a contract since january 1986

metronorth trains serving 95000 commuters daily run between 
manhattan and the citys northern suburbs and connecticut 
its an illegal strike said charles barnes executive 
director of the national mediation board its a disruption of 
the status quo by the union i should think that as soon as they 
can get to a judge it will stop 
commuters who tried to board amtrak trains at bridgeport 
stamford or new haven in connecticut or in new rochelle the only 
stops amtrak make along metronorth routes were told they would 
have to buy a trip to newark nj even if they wanted to get off

we dont sell tickets today or any day from new haven to 
penn station new york said amtrak spokesman clifford black 
we are not a commuter railroad that is the territory and 
business of metronorth

but black said amtrak depends on metronorth dispatchers for all 
trains the run north of new york city we have ordered backup 
buses in the event that we have to ferry passengers over 
metronorth territory

george bush ridiculed michael dukakis views on star wars 
today while bushs running mate dan quayle switched his focus from 
defense to jobs and ran into an unfriendly welcome at an ohio steel 
plant 
does he believe in defense against strategic missiles or 
doesnt he bush asked in a speech in rockford ill to the 
illinois federation of republican women ive tried to be fair 
and accurate as to my opponents positions but lately they seem to 
have been shifting so rapidly its sometimes hard to keep up 
dukakis who was on his way to campaign in texas today said 
thursday in louisville ky that he would consider deploying the 
strategic defense initiative or star wars if research showed it 
would work and if it were essential to the national interest 
his position on sdi calling it a fantasy one day something 
he wont rule out the next suggests a confusion on basic 
facts bush said today 
in massillon ohio quayle was met by protesters and by workers 
wearing dukakisbentsen tshirts today when he arrived to tour a 
steel plant 
one steelworker vietnam veteran eugene autry carried a sign 
saying draft dodger quayle who died in your place a 
reference to quayles service in the national guard in indiana 
during the vietnam war 
quayle was politely received when he spoke to the employees of 
the mercury stainless corp and the dukakissupporting workers 
said plant management had asked them to be polite 
the senator told the group he had worked with the reagan 
administration to reach voluntary restraint agreements that 
resulted in reduction of steel imports from foreign countries 
also today the cleveland plain dealer reported that quayle was 
admitted to law school as a young man under an experimental 
affirmative action program 
the newspaper quoted officials at the indiana university school 
of law who said the program was intended to increase admissions 
opportunities for minorities the economically disadvantaged and 
others of differing backgrounds quayle is white and a member of a 
wealthy family 
quayle told reporters today i got into law school fair and 
square and i did rather well there 
bush had encountered a hostile bluecollar audience this week in 
portland ore but quayle campaign officials said the visit wasnt 
intended to test his mettle 
dukakis received a friendly greeting when the massachusetts 
governor visited a general motors corp engine plant in tonawanda 
ny near buffalo 
dukakis hammered at bushs comment last week that a recent rise 
in the number of unemployed was statistically irrelevant 
on november 8 hes going to find just how relevant they 
are he said reminding the audience of the remark bush made in 
the soviet union that soviet workers could give a lesson in 
quality dukakis said those republicans in washington love to 
blame american workers first 
the dukakis campaign had prepared pink slips for today to show 
that the election is 60 days off the notice period required under 
legislation opposed by the reagan administration that would require 
notification of plant closings 
dukakis visiting texas today on bushs heels was in manhattan 
on thursday night with his running mate sen lloyd bentsen for a 
gala fundraiser the event yielded more than 5 million for the 
democratic party dukakis money raiser robert farmer said 
the texas senator was visiting a farm show in iowa before 
addressing a union rally in california 
bush in rockford ill was addressing the illinois federation 
of republican women before other appearances in illinois and 
pennsylvania 
the vice president flew to illinois after witnessing the first 
destruction of a set of pershing missile rocket engines under the 
new ussoviet agreement to ban intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
at a rally later in tyler texas bush criticized dukakis for 
his past support of a freeze on nuclear weapons he wanted to 
restrain us not the soviet union bush said 
quayle also criticized dukakis telling a rally in springfield 
ill americans are not going to turn over the peace and 
prosperity to some inexperienced governor of massachusetts 
quayle earlier had given a foreign policy speech in which he 
said he was skeptical about soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
policies of openness and restructuring 
dukakis told the 70th annual convention of the american legion 
in louisville ky that the budget deficits of the reagan years 
were hindering efforts to build up the nations military forces 
he also backed continued research on star wars the spacebased 
missile defense system and said he would support deployment if it 
were proven the system would be effective and was in the national 
interest 
however when questioned by reporters he also said deployment 
would violate the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty and that he 
wanted to keep that agreement 
a new poll by louis harris amp associates for business week 
magazine said bush had a 50 percent to 44 percent lead over dukakis 
among likely voters the survey of 1299 people was taken sept 16 
and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points either way 
meaning the two candidates could be in a dead heat 
another poll released in boston by the boston herald and 
wbztv gave bush a lead of 45 percent to 41 percent that suvey 
taken among 1000 registered voters from monday through wednesday 
also had a 3point margin of error 
a tentative debate agreement was announced by dukakis campaign 
chairman paul brountas who said the two candidates would meet

the nations largest labor 
federation staged an eighthour strike today that interrupted 
public transportation and stopped thousands of people from getting 
to work 
the 35million member general labor confederation also 
organized a huge rally in the plaza outside government house 
the strike the 12th since president raul alfonsin took office 
in december 1983 was called to protest the economic policies of 
the government 
we want people to publicly show their desire for a change 
their repudiation of the selling off of national assets and their 
rejection of using our funds for interest payments on the foreign 
debt the confederations generalsecretary saul ubaldini said 
thursday 
the strike and rally were endorsed by the opposition peronist 
and communist political parties and a variety of business and 
labor groups 
supporters of alfonsins radical civic union have said the 
strike is a ploy to undermine an antiinflation plan implemented 
last month and coalesce support for peronist presidential candidate 
carlos menem in the elections in may 
the economic plan alfonsins third in less than five years 
devalued the austral cut government spending implemented 
voluntary wage and price controls and lifted restrictions on some 
imports 
the goal was to reduce inflation that amounted to a combined 
532 percent in july and august and to secure new loans from the 
international monetary fund and commercial banks to help repay 
interest on argentinas 56 billion foreign debt alfonsin predicts 
inflation this month will be below 10 percent 
a component of alfonsins general economic plan is the 
privatization of some of the dozens of state companies including 
the phone company the national carrier aerolineas argentinas and 
the national shipping line 
unions representing workers at the companies generally oppose 
privatization fearing that jobs will be cut 
the opposition peronist party closely tied to the unions has 
raised obstacles in congress to the sale of stateowned companies 
interest on argentinas foreign debt amounts to about 46 
billion this year it is a political as well as economic burden to 
repay given peoples clamor for more public services at lower 
costs 
early today train signalmen went on their own 24hour strike 
that forced thousands of suburban commuters to drive to work or 
stay home city buses were to go on strike beginning at noon 
unions in the provinces outside the capital of buenos aires also 
called 24hour strikes 
the general labor confederation called for an eighthour strike 
so people would come to work as usual walk off the job at noon 
attend the rally and be able to take public transportation home 
beginning at 8 pm 
union supporters plastered the walls of the capital with posters 
saying dont mess with the people 
private businesses bakeries offices hardware and department 
stores opened as usual today they have generally ignored the 
past several strikes

one of the radar operators on board the uss 
vincennes was so nervous in the moments before the cruiser shot 
down an iranian airliner that he tried and failed five times to 
punch a button providing radar images of the plane a navy 
investigator said today 
the problem was one of a series of stresscaused errors which 
led to the us destruction of the jetliner which killed 290 people 
on july 3 rear adm william m fogarty told the house armed 
services committee 
the radar operator finally got the correct image on his sixth 
try fogarty said 
the navy will try to make its training more realistic but 
theres no way to simulate combat and eliminate the stresscaused 
errors that led to the us action service officials told the 
panel in a second day of hearings on the incident 
unless you get shot at youre not trained in combat 
fogarty said thursday 
fogarty headed the navy investigation into the shooting down of 
iran air flight 655 by the guided missile cruiser uss vincennes on 
july 3 in the persian gulf the vincennes command thought it was 
firing at an iranian f14 military jet when it launched two 
missiles and killed all 290 persons aboard the airliner 
fogartys investigation found the sophisticated aegis tracking 
equipment aboard the vincennes worked well but the data was 
misread by crew members who were taking the fouryearold ship into 
combat for the first time 
although the equipment functioned as it should navy officials 
told congress they plan to add new radio equipment to ships 
assigned to the persian gulf area and is upgrading the ships 
tracking sensors 
fogartys report was released three weeks ago and he repeated 
its general conclusions to senators who were generally supportive 
i believe this was a tragic mistake said sen james exon 
dneb echoing other legislators 
fogartys investigation concluded that the vincennes which 
carries some of the navys most sophisticated electronic sensors 
and weaponry was adequately trained when it sailed into the 
persian gulf region in late may 
she entered the gulf trained he said adding that unless 
you get shot at youre not trained in combat 
capt george n gee director of the navys surface combat 
systems division said the service doesnt give specific stress 
training to our people although that is something were going 
to look at 
fogarty detailed a confused and highstress situation in the 
vincennes combat center the iranian plane was approaching as the 
ship was concluding a firefight with iranian gunboats that had 
attacked the vincennes helicopter while the chopper was on patrol 
we try not to be hysterical we try not to be yelling 
fogarty said although on that day there were a lot of items 
that caused the excitement level to rise there were people 
raising their voices above what we would like to see 
the vincennes guns were firing as it made a highspeed turn to 
bring its aftdeck guns to bear fogarty said 
amid the confusion one unidentified officer called out a 
warning to the vincennes skipper capt will c rogers that the 
approaching plane might not be military 
the officer was standing behind rogers and called out possible 
comm air commercial aircraft and rogers acknowledged the 
warning with a wave of his hand fogarty said 
but other factors prompted rogers to order two missiles 
fired at the jet in the mistaken belief it was an iranian military 
plane 
those factors included the justfinished firefight the 
assumption that any plane coming from iran was a potential military 
threat intelligence warnings about possible iranian attacks over 
the july 4 weekend and the memory of the frigate uss stark fogarty 
said 
the stark was hit by an iraqi missile in the persian gulf in may 
1987 killing 37 us seamen the starks top officers were 
disciplined for not firing their weapons to protect the ship 
in the vincennes shooting two errors never could be explained 
satisfactorily fogarty said including the mistaken belief the 
iranian airbus was descending and the initial identification as an 
f14 
iran air 655 was climbing continually from the time it took off 
from bandar abbas and was at 13000 feet when it was struck by the 
two missiles eight miles from the vincennes 
officers in the combat center correctly identified the airbus as 
climbing until the plane came to within 15 miles of the vincennes 
when they inexplicably concluded the plane began descending toward 
the cruiser fogarty said officials have said the aegis sensors 
were functioning correctly 
the misreading of the altitude was one of the most puzzling 
aspects fogarty said but the investigators were never able to 
figure out how that occurred the investigation was unsuccessful 
in satisfactorily reconciling the discrepancy between electronic 
data which showed the plane was still climbing and shouted verbal 
statements that it was descending he said 
one radar operator in the combat center said the approaching 
plane had sent a mode 2 transmission a transmitter used only 
by military planes civilian aircraft use a mode 3 
transmission and the airbus transmitted information only on mode 
3 the investigation noted 
a nearby warship the frigate sides had tracked the airbus as a 
possible iranian military plane but it concluded the plane was not 
a threat fogarty said

a chance of rain and snow 
raised firefighters hopes in matchstickdry yellowstone national 
park but high wind today threatened to spread fires that have 
charred 12 million acres and all but closed the tourist spot 
a lot of acreage could burn over the weekend david 
freeland a commander on a 221800acre fire said thursday as 
firefighters extinguished flareups near old faithful geyser in 
americas oldest national park 
residents of cooke city and silver gate mont just northeast 
of the park who were among 150 townspeople evacuated tuesday were 
told to leave again thursday night for fear of flareups in another 
119000acre fire at the park 
they knew when they came back in that this could happen 
fire information officer craig flentie said in cooke city fire 
closed the main road into town 
were back into another critical situation information 
officer bob mchugh said today noting that the forecast called for 
30 to 40 mph wind today and 50 to 60 mph wind on saturday 
all but a small section of the 22 millionacre park was closed 
to visitors to ensure an open path for fire trucks and to protect 
tourists from flames that have blackened 12 million acres in and 
around yellowstone 
elsewhere near the utah town of whiterocks a 12000acre 
brushfire destroyed five homes and cabins and forced the evacuation 
of more than 20 families officials said the fire today burned to 
within a mile of town 
fires also burned in alaska california colorado idaho and 
washington wildfires have blackened 365 million acres an area 
larger than connecticut in what federal officials have called the 
worst fire season in 30 years 
president reagan directed agriculture secretary richard lyng 
interior secretary donald hodel and deputy defense secretary 
william h taft iv to visit the western states this weekend and 
assess the situation said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
congress passed a bill thursday clearing the way for canada to 
help battle wildfires with firefighters aircraft and other 
equipment reagan was expected to sign the bill allowing the us 
forest service to reimburse canada for its help today according to 
the office of rep dick cheney rwyo 
canada has 35 planes ready and available said house agriculture 
committee staffers 
the weekend forecast for yellowstone called for winds increasing 
to 40 mph by sunday with gusts up to 50 mph 
freeland said the result could be worse than aug 20 when winds 
whipped blazes over thousands of acres in the worst day of the year 
for firefighters 
but the weather was expected to be much cooler with 
temperatures possibly below freezing by saturday said denny 
bungarz a fire commander there was a chance of rain with snow at 
higher altitudes by monday bungarz said 
it will obviously slow things down he said if it 
continues to bring moisture well be in pretty good shape if 
theres a few inches of snow and then several more weeks of warm 
weather wed be in trouble again 
man will not put these fires out himself idaho gov cecil 
andrus said in an interview on abcs nightline we need help 
from above 
bungarz said that even if the weather worsens fire conditions 
the old faithful complex and the town of west yellowstone mont 
at the parks west entrance should have little to fear 
we may see some flareups here and there from the strong winds 
but we wont see anything like we did when the fires hit old 
faithful wednesday 
it looks as if the burn that went through pretty much 
fireproofed the old faithful area by removing fuel that could 
feed the fire if it approaches the area again bungarz said he 
said the same conditions were seen at west yellowstone 
the south east and northeast entrances to yellowstone were 
closed although calmer weather allowed reopening of the parks 
west entrance 
the only tourist attraction open was mammoth hot springs which 
like old faithful includes a hotel and campground a restaurant 
visitor center employee dormitories and a small grocery store 
the complex was surrounded on three sides by smoke and flames 
and by early afternoon helicopters were dropping water on the 
flames while firefighters took the precaution of applying foam to 
some of the buildings 
meanwhile in nearby bridgerteton national forest a search for 
a firefighter who disappeared from fire lines on an 86345acre 
fire was suspended when 36yearold peter alire returned to his 
fire camp 
firefighters in glacier national park on the montanacanada 
border struggled to flank a 27500acre forest fire that has burned 
more than a dozen homes

the navy captain who ordered the destruction 
of an unidentified plane that turned out to be an iranian 
commercial jetliner made the right decision based on what he 
knew at the time rep les aspin dwis said friday 
i believe he did the right thing given what he knew said 
aspin chairman of the house armed services committee after 
hearing navy investigators detail the series of stresscaused human 
errors which led to the july 3 incident 
all 290 people aboard iran air flight 655 were killed when the 
plane was shot down over the strait of hormuz by two missiles fired 
by the uss vincennes the cruiser thought it was shooting at an 
iranian f14 possibly headed for an attack on the ship 
aspins conclusion echoed statements made by other legislators 
during two days of hearings on the investigation led by rear adm 
william m fogarty 
fogartys report was made public three weeks ago and he 
provided few new details in his testimony to congressional 
committees 
but the decision by the vincennes skipper capt will c 
rogers to fire two standard missiles at the approaching iranian 
warplane was not criticized 
that reaction was in sharp contrast to criticism of officers 
aboard the uss stark a navy frigate hit by an iraqi missile in may 
1987 killing 37 american naval personne 
in the one case the stark you criticize the officers for not 
protecting their ship for not protecting their men i dont see 
how you can turn around and then criticize the vincennes captain 
for acting to protect his ship aspin said i think you have to 
give the captain latitude 
fogartys investigation found that the sophisticated aegis 
tracking equipment aboard the vincennes worked well but concluded 
that the data was misread by crew members who were taking the 
fouryearold ship into combat for the first time 
i think a kind of groupthink takes over in this kind of 
situation and leads to this kind of happening aspin said 
as one example he said the aegis equipment showed the iranian 
a300 airbus was climbing from the time it left bandar abbas but 
that observers in the vincennes combat center misinterpreted the 
data and believed the plane was descending directly toward the 
cruiser 
you had one person make a mistake and then hes talking about 
in the combat center and no ones going to walk over to his console 
and read and tell everyone hes wrong aspin said 
the fogarty report detailed a number of human mistakes in one 
instance it said an operator failed on five attempts to get the 
computers to select a weapon to shoot at the plane the sixth 
succeeded 
fogarty and other navy officials said the service plans to try 
to improve training so that it will be as realistic as possible 
but they admitted there is a psychological and emotional component 
to combat which cannot be simulated 
aspin agreed he said the committee will hold hearings later 
this year to consider this entire question of stress and 
combat with testimony from psychologists

presidential politics overtook the house when 
democrats killed a republican proposal friday to begin each day 
with the pledge of allegiance then came back with a plan to recite 
the pledge twice next week 
rep john rowland rconn using one of gop nominee george 
bushs frequent campaign themes started it all with a resolution 
calling on the speaker or his designee to lead house members in a 
daily recitation of the pledge 
rowland noted that the pledge is routinely recited in 
classrooms at athletic events and elsewhere and declared its 
about time that we set a good public example of our love and our 
patriotism for our great nation by reciting the pledge of 
allegiance each morning in this chamber 
bush has repeatedly attacked his democratic rival massachusetts 
gov michael dukakis for vetoing a bill that would have penalized 
teachers who didnt lead their classes in the pledge dukakis said 
had been advised by the state supreme court that the bill was 
unconstitutional 
rep ken gray dill presiding over the house at the time 
said the rowlands resolution would change house rules and 
therefore was not in order rowland appealed the ruling but the 
house agreed 226168 to let it stand 
seven democrats joined every republican present in voting with 
rowland 
lest the democrats be perceived as antipledge house speaker 
jim wright dtexas then made an unusual appearance on the floor 
to defend grays parliamentary ruling and accuse the gop of trying 
to play politics with the pledge 
all of us embrace the pledge of allegiance but it is 
important that all of us recognize that the pledge of allegiance to 
the flag is something intended to unite us not intended to divide 
us wright said he got a standing ovation from cheering 
colleagues 
wright said he would ask reps sonny montgomery dmiss 
chairman of the veterans affairs committee and jerry lewis 
rcalif to lead the pledge on tuesday and wednesday next week 
let us seriously reaffirm that the rules of the house are 
important and that the rules of the house are not subject to 
temporary emotions and sudden whims wright said and that all 
of us embrace the flag and the constitution of the united states 
one nation under god indivisible 
lewis was not satisfied he said he was unsure of wrights 
intentions beyond wednesday and would keep trying to bring 
rowlands resolution to the floor what is needed is a fullscale 
debate on the pledge of allegiance he said

patients with floodrelated diseases 
clog the hospitals of dhaka and millions of gallons of raw sewage 
is being poured into stagnant waters where children swim and people 
wade 
water levels in major rivers continued falling friday but 
remained far above flood stage thwarting relief efforts the 
floods have covered threequarters of bangladesh and up to 
onefourth of its 110 million people are homeless 
helicopters can land only in dry areas and even short distances 
are difficult by boat as a foreign diplomat put it in one case 
its only 30 miles by crow but you cant get there by crow 
dhaka newspapers reported 101 more deaths in 24 hours and put 
the total at 1402 the government count remained at 609 and is 
considered far too low 
the government health center said 135537 diarrhea cases have 
been reported nationwide including at least 8254 among dhakas 6 
million people 
official statistics put the death toll from diarrhea at 93 
across the country but reports of illness and death come only from 
areas that can communicate with the capital 
health officials estimated 40 million gallons of raw sewage a 
day was being dumped into stagnating flood waters where children 
swim for fun and adults wade to food markets and relief centers 
doctors at the international center for diarrheal disease 
control said the number of patients admitted has more than doubled 
since dhaka was flooded two weeks ago 
they said 376 patients most of them babies and small children 
were admitted to the hospital in the previous 24 hours compared 
with an average 155 a day during all of august floods began in 
june with the monsoon season abated then became devastating late 
last month 
cots with green plastic sheets filled the wards and halls of the 
center which is financed by foreign donors 
rajia begum sat crosslegged on a cot tending her 9dayold son 
not yet named the whites of her eyes were yellow with jaundice 
which dr md abdus salam said probably was caused by hepatitis 
she brought her wan infant to the hospital three days ago after 
neighbors with a boat rescued them from her flooded home 
abdus salam chief physician at the hospital said the babys 
chances of survival were good because he received medical attention 
in time 
the diarrhea center pioneered the manufacture of a simple saline 
rehydration solution in bangladesh and in normal times supplies it 
to other hospitals abdus salam said friday however that the lab 
now works around the clock just to supply the centers own needs 
at least two large cargo planes brought in relief supplies 
friday but the problem still was how to get the material to people 
marooned in spots where even helicopters cannot land normal 
operations resumed thursday at the dhaka airport which was closed 
to all but small aircraft for six days 
among the places in desperate need was the rupganj area 20 miles 
south of dhaka the englishlanguage bangladesh observer said 
50000 people were stranded there fighting a grim battle for 
their survival as no relief material has reached them yet 
such relatively short distances are difficult to cover by boat 
because a craft large enough to carry a useful amount of relief 
goods must follow rivers with water deep enough to support it 
the diplomat who said you cant get there by crow was 
recounting the plight of a flooded hospital whose nurses and 
doctors put their patients in boats a speed boat would take 2 
hours to reach the hospital he said but a relief launch will 
take all day

imprisoned and exiled for 18 years 
former prime minister u nu once appeared to have accepted his 
position as burmas forgotten man 
that is until friday when the 82yearold politician sallied 
forth in an attempt to lead antigovernment forces to restore the 
democracy he was forced to surrender 26 years ago 
u nu who spent the last few years translating buddhist 
scriptures said friday he has formed a government to challenge the 
authoritarian system imposed by military leader ne win in 1962 
but his chances of success are not known burma is on the brink 
of chaos and the powerful military is still intact in addition 
the opposition appears fragmented 
in his favor diplomats said u nu is probably the least 
controversial of the opppositon leaders but they added much will 
depend on his advisers 
born in the irrawaddy delta town of wakema u nu joined the 
nationalist drive against british colonialism at rangoon 
university where he was elected president of the influential 
student union 
with the assassination of his close friend independence fighter 
aung san u nu took over the leadership of a free burma 
u nu served as prime minister for most of the period between 
1948 and 1958 when ne win took charge of a caretaker government u 
nu was reelected prime minister in 1960 but toppled two years 
later by the ambitious general who imprisoned him for the next 
four years 
u nus record was mixed he was unable to curb muscleflexing 
generals and squabbling politicians crime soared and some of 
burmas many ethnic minorities began their now fourdecadelong war 
against the central government 
but the economy improved and u nu maintained the trust of other 
ethnic groups both the press and the political arena were alive 
with debate 
one of the original members of the third worlds nonaligned 
movement u nu laid the foundations of burmese neutralism but 
unlike ne win he maintained open relations with the worlds 
superpowers 
in 1955 u nu proudly told stunned soviet leaders that he had 
broken the back of the domestic communist movement the same year 
he lectured washington about opening diplomatic relations with 
communist china 
in 1969 u nu left burma and spent the next 11 years as an exile 
in thailand and india from bases along the thaiburmese border he 
attempted to lead an antine win insurgency he even sent a small 
aircaft over rangoon to drop leaflets calling for an uprising 
but u nu proved a poor insurgent and in 1974 thailand asked him 
to leave the country indira gandhi then prime minster of india 
gave him with a yellow stucco house on a hillside in the city of 
bhopal where he lived a quiet life newspaper articles called him 
burmas forgotten man 
he returned to burma in 1980 under a general amnesty offered by 
his archrival ne win promising to stay out of politics and devote 
the rest of his life to translating buddhist works into burmese 
a writer of plays poems novels and political works u nu also 
has been a keen translator among his renderings into burmese have 
been the works of karl marx and dale carnegies how to win 
friends and influence people

hundreds of radical students shouting 
slogans against the government and olympic games hurled firebombs 
and rocks at riot police friday 
the battle began at yonsei university in western seoul when 
police stopped about 600 students from marching off the campus to 
protest the arrest thursday of the head of the student association 
he was charged with leading an antiolympic campaign 
students attacked about 1000 riot officers who responded by 
firing tear gas grenades and flinging rocks back at the protesters 
thousands of students remained indifferent inside the campus 
during the melee along the fences which lasted about half an hour 
at least five students were seen bleeding hit in the face by 
stones no arrests were reported 
oppose dictatorial olympics suppressing democratic forces 
protesters shouted 
radicals claim the government is using the olympics scheduled 
for sept 17oct 2 in seoul to perpetuate division of the korean 
peninsula and what they describe as dictatorship 
they say the games heighten the risk of war with communist north 
korea which decided to boycott them after its demand to be cohost 
was rejected 
the radical students are a small powerful minority on campus 
but lack public support 
authorities ordered a crackdown friday leaflets denouncing the 
olympics and demanding they be shared with north korea 
police said security guards arrested a student volunteer at the 
main olympic stadium thursday who was caught trying to bring in 
about 100 of the leaflets 
special squads stand ready to cover campuses in seoul and 
security forces are posted throughout olympic venues in case of 
terrorism 
president kim il sung of north korea said in a speech marking 
his nations 40th anniversary friday he would welcome a visit by a 
south korean delegation to discuss national reunification 
many officials in seoul believe his proposal responded to an 
offer aug 15 by president roh taewoo of south korea to improve 
relations with the north roh said he is willing to meet kim at 
any time any place without any condition to discuss all pending 
issues 
south korean reaction to kims remarks was cautious we need 
time to scrutinize the proposal one senior government official 
said privately 
a summit would be the first between the heads of the two korean 
states since partition at the end of world war ii 
if a south korean delegation visits pyongyang kim said its 
sole purpose should be to discuss his longstanding confederate 
system of unification 
that calls for the two koreas to retain their own political 
structures while operating as one nation internationally south 
korea calls it an attempt to unify the peninsula under a communist 
government

drug enforcement agent seriously wounded in the line of duty friday 
and said the call makes him want to take on congressmen opposed to 
the death penalty in drug cases 
reagan described his telephone call to bruce travis a special 
agent with the drug enforcement administration who was shot during 
a drug arrest in new york city tuesday night as he ended a speech 
to the federalist society a lawyers organization 
reagan told the audience he had just received word of the 
shooting he said the agent was sitting in a car he was actually 
providing protection to a home where the people in the home had 
been threatened their lives threatened because of their work 
against drugs 
just before coming over i made a telephone call to the 
hospital he said 
the president said travis was shot in the head and the bullet 
came out from the forehead very close to the eye 
the voice on the phone turned out to be his fathers because 
he cannot speak the president said it will probably be a year 
of continuous surgery before he is able to come back among us 
reagan said the agents father identified by the white house as 
buddy travis told me his son couldnt speak but could hear so 
he said ill hold the phone to his ear and when you hear the 
tapping that means he is on and listening 
so i was able to tell him of our pride in him how much we 
appreciated his sacrifice and how much he would be in our prayers 
then the president said he said goodby and the wounded agent 
tapped on the telephone to show he had heard 
well in this mornings paper i had read some of the 
statements by the opposition in congress to the death penalty 
amendment that was passed yesterday expressing sheer horror at 
the idea that we should be taking someones life away in connection 
with drugs reagan said 
i have been thinking about that ever since this telephone 
call he said i would like to engage some of them in personal 
conversation in fact ill go out of my way to do it

administrationbacked amendment to an omnibus drug bill that calls

a multimilliondollar space probe designed to 
unlock the secrets of mars fell into a deep lethargic sleep and 
is worthless because of a ground controllers error a scientist 
said friday 
it was the second soviet space mishap revealed this week 
only a miracle can save it now roald z sagdeyev head of 
the soviet space research institute said in an interview with the 
associated press 
groundcontrol operators are unable to communicate with the 
phobos 1 probe now millions of miles from earth 
this week a soyuz tm5 capsule carrying two cosmonauts came 
close to being marooned in space because of equipment problems and 
mistakes by the ships commander delayed its return to earth 
sagdeyev said scientists would now have to rely on a sister 
ship phobos 2 that is also racing toward the red planet phobos 1 
was launched july 7 and phobos 2 five days later in missions that 
cost 480 million 
the probes were scheduled to go into orbit around mars and in 
january drop behind phobos the larger of the planets two moons 
to study the martian surface atmosphere and magnetic field 
phobos 1 was to drop a lander that would stay in one place on 
the surface of the moon for a year phobos 2 was to deploy a lander 
that would hop around on the moon in 20yard leaps gathering and 
analyzing soil samples 
phobos 1 is still moving in space but it may not be on its 
planned trajectory because the orientation and guidance systems 
arent functioning it was not immediately known how the original 
plan would be modified now that one of the probes is useless 
sagdeyev said a ground control operator at the soviet mission 
control center near moscow sent an incorrect command to phobos 1 
during the night of aug 2930 and that a computer failed to detect 
the error and flash the signal bad command he did not say 
whether the faulty computer was on the ground or on board the 
spacecraft 
the command signified the slow suicide of the machinery 
phobos 1 said sagdeyev it lost orientation and the solar 
panels stopped looking at the sun in two to three days a 
coolingdown of the craft occurred 
the machinery has simply frozen it fell into a deep 
lethargic sleep the scientist said 
the mistake was only discovered three days later sagdeyev said 
investigators also determined that no second operator was on duty 
to check the work of the controller who made the mistake violating 
the control centers rules he did not say if either controller was 
punished 
sagdeyev the most prominent soviet space scientist and a major 
supporter of the exploration of mars said ground controllers were 
still sending signals to phobos 1 to restore orientation but were 
having no luck he suggested they now turn their attention to 
phobos 2 and do everything to prevent a repetition of the mistake 
with the second machine 
the space research chief spoke to a reporter during a reception 
at the us ambassadors residence in honor of andrei d sakharov 
the soviet physicist and human rights activist who is the 1975 
nobel peace prize laureate 
on tuesday soviet cosmonaut vladimir lyakhov and his afghan 
crewmate ahad abdul mohmand had to postpone landing of their 
soyuz tm5 capsule because a sensor used to orient the craft and a 
computer malfunctioned 
in addition to the equipment problems lyakhov said later he 
acted improperly during one landing attempt and made the problems 
worse the two who were running low on air and food returned to 
earth safely wednesday 
nasa the american national aeronautics and space 
administration was to have helped the soviets track phobos 1 next 
month but nasa official raymond j amorose said thursday the 
soviets reported they lost contact with the craft 
nasa was also supposed to have worked with phobos 1 in a joint 
ussoviet study of the sun 
the tass news agency indicated that scientists were in normal 
contact with phobos 2 and said it was 118 million miles from earth 
after a 111 millionmile trip both craft were to have fallen 
into orbit behind phobos for a threemonth remote study meant to 
help unlock mysteries of mars which some scientists believe may 
once have hosted life in april the craft were to drop out of 
their orbit and swoop to within 30 yards of the moons surface 
where they were to release two small landers 
it is the most ambitious of about 18 soviet and us unmanned 
missions to study mars which next to venus is believed to be 
most like earth

thousands of ethnic germans from 
eastern europe are coming to west germany and state officials are 
seeking ways to cope with the burden on schools housing and social 
services 
several state leaders met friday with federal officials to 
discuss the crisis they are demanding the government pay a larger 
share of the added costs 
more than 200000 people almost all of them ethnic germans are 
expected to arrive in west germany this year from the soviet union 
poland and other east european countries the same number is 
expected next year 
although german by heritage many do not speak the german 
language 
government facilities have long since overflowed and many 
newcomers are housed in gymnasiums and other makeshift quarters 
the influx is in large part the result of a change of policy in 
many east bloc countries although the bonn government has worked 
for years to gain permission for ethnic germans to emigrate it was 
not prepared for the response 
weve got to get these people out of gymnasiums herbert 
schnoor interior minister for north rhein westfalia state told 
reporters at a press conference in bonn 
schnoor was among the state officials who met with government 
leaders friday 
the federal government has proposed a 450 million program to 
build 30000 new apartments state leaders are demanding a 19 
billion program to build 54000 new apartments 
these people are being found housing but not in the manner we 
would like schnoor said 
he said the government must provide an additional 405 million 
in emergency help 
without this money we cant begin to solve the problem 
schnoor said 
schnoor said chancellor helmut kohl was receptive to the 
suggestions and that he made it clear that solutions would not 
break down because of financial disputes 
the majority of the ethnic germans are from poland and the 
soviet union government officials said the soviet union alone has 
granted exit visas to 15715 ethnic germans this year 
bavarian interior minister max streibl said the federal 
government should pay twothirds of the costs leaving the states 
to pay the final third 
three government crisis groups have been formed and the 
interior ministry is developing an overall program in conjunction 
with the housing ministry the chancellors office is working on a 
program of language instruction and job placement for the 
immigrants

president reagan seeking a greater federal 
role in promoting the family institution ordered departments and 
agencies friday to report quickly on ways the government can better 
protect men women children and the unborn 
following up on his 1986 state of the union pledge to thoroughly 
analyze the state of families in america reagan accepted a series 
of recommendations by his white house office of policy development 
on how to build family cohesiveness 
several of the new initiatives would be focused on the drug 
abuse problem and reagan embraced a call for making the receipt of 
federal funds contingent on the willingness of educational and 
other institutions to promote drugfree environments 
he also backed a proposal to find safeguards designed to protect 
the newborn and the unborn against possible exploitation in medical 
research experimentation and organ transplantation 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said no final decisions 
had been made on a possible executive order to ban the use of 
tissue from intentionally aborted fetuses 
he labeled as premature news accounts to that such decisions 
had been made 
reagans directive to several departments and agencies was aimed 
at implementing among other things these policy changes 
ensure that family violence be treated by law enforcement 
agencies as a criminal law violation not primarily a social 
service problem 
require that legislation being considered by either the house 
or the senate be accompanied by a family impact statement 
make the receipt of federal grant funds for education and other 
purposes contingent on an institutions demonstrated ability to 
move toward creation of a drugfree environment 
create new federal initiatives particularly within the 
agriculture department to push the use of housing vouchers to 
improve housing opportunities in rural america 
seek to have federal human sexuality and family planning 
educational and informational materials promote sexual abstinence 
among young people and to prevent the use of federal money for the 
distribution of contraceptives in schools without parental 
permission 
have the department of housing and urban development find a way 
to substantially increase resident management and ownership of 
public housing projects 
develop legislative proposals requiring mandatory minimum 
sentences for those who sell and distribute drugs to minors and 
those who use adolescents in the trafficking of drugs 
reassess how current tax laws affect the institution of the 
family 
the white house report voiced reservations about a push by 
congress to have the federal government play a larger role in 
supporting and financing day care centers 
many proposals currently pending in congress would subsidize 
only daycare centers but would provide no assistance for families 
who choose other child care options such as an extended family 
member or neighbor it said 
reagan instructed the various departments and agencies to report 
back to him no later than december one month before he leaves 
office 
fitzwater acknowledged that the reagan family initiatives were 
coming late in the administration but said many could be achieved 
by executive orders and actions rather than through congressional 
legislation 
the move to protect newborns and unborns against medical 
experimentation was among the most controversial of the initiatives 
laid out in the report on families 
the administration moved to prohibit the use of tissue from 
intentionally aborted fetuses in research before a special national 
institutes of health advisory committee meets on this matter sept 
14 and 15 
gary l bauer reagans assistant for policy development and 
principal author of the report on families told health and human 
services secretary otis r bowen he wanted the secretarys comments 
on a proposed executive order quickly 
a copy of bauers memo dated sept 2 along with a copy of a 
draft presidential executive order that reagan would sign was 
obtained thursday by the associated press

mayor andrew young defended on thursday the 
assignment of a county deputy to the martin luther king jr center 
for nonviolent social change and the family of the slain civil 
rights leader 
atlanta also has a police officer stationed at the center as his 
regular base of operations young said 
young said he was concerned that recent media reports have 
singled out the publicly financed security and he described 
the king family as a valuable asset to the city 
whatever it takes to see that they function safely and 
securely we have an interest in maintaining he said 
fulton county sheriff richard b lankford said last week he 
assigned a deputy full time to the king center to serve as a 
security consultant and to protect the king family including 
kings widow coretta scott king and his son fulton county 
commissioner martin luther king iii 
young who was one of kings lieutenants in the southern 
christian leadership conference and is a member of the king center 
board of directors said the city has contributed about 23000 to 
the center this year 
i wish we could do more he added 
the king center visited by an estimated 800000 people 
annually is one of the states most popular tourist destinations 
he said 
the city young said routinely provides police details for such 
attractions as the high museum of art and zoo atlanta 
he added that the city also sends 25 to 50 officers to atlanta 
braves baseball games where they perform duties ranging from 
security and crowd control to traffic direction 
the king center outdraws all of them but it brings with it a 
unique set of problems and one of the problems is security he 
said its one of those kinds of places where the nuts seem to 
gather

dan quayle got a polite but skeptical 
reception from largely prodemocratic steelworkers friday at a 
factory where the republican vice presidential nominee touted his 
support for job training and curbs on foreign steel imports 
his motorcade whizzed past about 150 union demonstrators who 
chanted go home at an entrance to the mercury stainless inc 
plant which he toured wearing a hard hat 
other protesters carried placards reading open season on 
quayle and i toured nam not indiana a reference to quayles 
service in the indiana national guard during the vietnam war 
the indiana senator told the workers many of whom stood 
silently wearing dukakisbentsen tshirts that he had fought to 
protect american steelworkers against foreign imports he also said 
the job partnership training act he had cosponsored in the senate 
had helped their plant when it emerged from bankruptcy 
he later told a canton ohio rotary club luncheon that 88000 
people had received job training under the law and that 62 percent 
had found work 
some of the mercury demonstrators joined several hundred 
supporters of democratic nominee michael dukakis who picketed the 
luncheon site 
you are to be congratuled quayle told the mercury 
employees who applauded politely you are a success story and 
you did it yourself you did it through partnership a partnership 
of labor and management 
the plant was closed because of bankruptcy in february 1985 
shortly after the justice department ordered it sold to facilitate 
the merger of ltd and republic steel mercury then bought the plant

plant vice president rick harbert said 193 workers had been 
trained under the law using 191000 in federal funds 
quayle took credit for lobbying president reagan to support 
socalled voluntary restraint agreements under which foreign steel 
imports are restricted 
he said he had preferred import quota legislation which reagan 
didnt like but that the restraint agreements did offer some 
relief 
i wasnt afraid to cosponsor that quota bill he said 
i wasnt afraid to stand up for the steelworkers of indiana or 
the steelworkers of ohio or the steelworkers of america because we 
said enough is enough 
though silent during quayles speech some mercury employees 
were not reticent about expressing their opinions to reporters 
hogwash we dont buy it said plant electrician mike 
mcelfresh after quayle spoke 
others said quayle and gop presidential nominee george bush 
would have trouble justifying quayles vigorous opposition to 
legislation requiring 60 days advance notice of mass layoffs or 
plant closings which reagan vetoed in its original form 
theyve come to the wrong place fumed machinery operator 
john ledrich who criticized quayle for his position on the 
plantclosings bill but ledrich said mercury management had asked 
dukakis supporters to be polite to quayle and make him feel at 
home 
said mechanic brian reamy it takes a lot of courage to come 
in here in the middle of a highly unionized place 
quayle adviser jim cicconi said he was pleased with the 
candidates performance in massillon he said that at quayles 
prespeech meeting with plant officials and union leaders we 
were told he would get more boos than cheers

in a stunning reversal of a halfcentury of 
communist orthodoxy pravda on friday acknowledged that leon 
trotsky played a key role in the russian revolution before he was 
purged by stalin and murdered in exile 
during the years of revolution and civil war the most popular 
leader after lenin was trotsky declared soviet historian col 
gen dmitri volkogonov using language that might once have cost a 
soviet citizen his life 
the fullpage article in the communist party newspaper an 
excerpt from a biography volkogonov is writing of stalin is the 
latest example of the kremlins new willingness to confront 
longhidden aspects of soviet history 
it represents a significant change in the official medias 
treatment of trotsky the goldentongued hottempered 
revolutionary who was long reviled officially as a traitor and 
accused of heading an antisoviet plot 
but the title chosen by pravda for the article the demon of 
the revolution showed that soviet officialdom still apparently 
opposes any full rehabilitation of trotsky who was killed in 1940 
in mexico city reportedly on orders of josef stalin 
in a forward pravda pointedly noted that soviet founder 
vladimir i lenin called trotsky a judas in 1911 and that he 
joined lenins bolsheviks only in 1917 the year they seized power 
after the overthrow of the russian czar 
but pravda added having his share of the abilities of a 
publicist orator and organizer trotksy played a well known role 
in the october armed uprising and in the years of the civil war 
when he was peoples commissar for war and naval affairs and 
chairman of the revolutionary military council 
that well known role was expunged from the official soviet 
record during stalins 29year rule when documents and even 
photographs that showed trotsky at historic events or at lenins 
side were doctored to remove him 
under stalin those suspected of being trotskyites the 
most loathesome appellation in the soviet political lexicon were 
hunted down and then imprisoned or killed 
trotsky the son of a prosperous jewish farmer helped direct 
the 1917 coup that brought the bolsheviks to power in russia as a 
deputy to lenin he was first commissar for foreign affairs then 
commissar for war creating and commanding the red army in a civil 
war against counterrevolutionaries 
he is known as the main advocate of the theory of permament 
revolution which held that the russian revolution was a prelude 
to a rising by the proletariat throughout europe 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in a major speech last nov 
2 became the first soviet leader in decades to mention trotsky 
publicly but he condemned the call for world revolution 
this was essentially an attack on leninism all down the 
line gorbachev said the partys leading nucleus headed by 
josef stalin safeguarded leninism in an ideological struggle 
since gorbachevs speech however the kremlins policy of 
glasnost or openness has been broadened to include sharper 
attacks on the political terror and rigid centralized management 
system that were hallmarks of stalins rule 
some other prominent stalin foes killed in the 1930s purges 
like nikolai bukharin whose ideas are similar to those advocated 
by gorbachev were cleared this year of the criminal charges used 
to justify their executions 
volkogonov wrote there are grounds to consider that trotsky 
during the years of his most active participation in party life 
191724 was not an enemy of the revolution and of socialism but 
already at that time he was an enemy of stalin 
after the death of lenin in 1924 stalin rallied his forces 
under the slogan of socialism in one country he argued against 
trotsky that a socialist state should be created first in the 
soviet union without waiting for worldwide revolution 
stalin forced trotsky out of the communist party in 1927 and out 
of the soviet union two years later 
the tribute must be paid to trotsky he did not break down as 
did most of the people facing the dictatorship of stalin the 
pravda article said 
both of lenins lieutenants wanted to become his political heir 
but neither stalin nor trotsky was suited to lead the communist 
party or fledgling soviet state volkogonov wrote 
the great misfortune for history and the people was that when 
the old leninist guard was left without lenin it removed one from 
the helm but left the other one on the captains bridge of the 
party but both should have been removed volkogonov said

the house on friday refused to go along with a 
senate expansion of medicaid to cover abortions for rape and incest 
victims prolonging an impasse over a 140 billion social spending 
bill 
the vote after several hours of impassioned debate was 216166 
house and senate negotiators came to agreement on every aspect 
of the massive labor education and health and human services 
spending bill except the abortion section 
the controversy stems from senate approval on july 27 of an 
amendment permitting medicaid funding in cases of promptly reported 
rape or incest states would still have the option of barring 
payments for all abortions except those necessary to save a womans 
life 
it was the first time either chamber had voted to liberalize 
medicaid abortion eligibility since 1981 existing law permits 
federal medicaid money to be spent on abortions only where the life 
of the mother is endangered 
president reagan is threatening to veto the entire 
appropriations bill over the abortion provision putting the senate 
under enormous pressure to surrender to the house and retain 
existing law 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva said the senate 
could take up the spending bill and the abortion amendment as early 
as monday 
much of the house debate reflected the conflicting bedrock 
beliefs of the members some argued for compassionate and humane 
treatment of women victimized by brutal crimes others focused on 
the welfare of the fetus 
you cant avoid injustice in a rape situation you cant avoid 
injustice in an incest situation but why compound the injustice by 
putting on top of it exterminating an innocent human life asked 
rep henry hyde rill author of the existing medicaid abortion 
policy 
dont make us a part of that double tragedy hyde said 
out of great great tragedy some good can come 
hyde allies also said medical procedures are available to 
prevent conception after rapes or incest and contended the 
proposed exceptions would turn women into liars in their efforts to 
secure governmentfunded abortions 
proponents of the expanded eligibility said it was only fair to 
give a poor woman the same medical choices available to a woman 
with money 
all this amendment says is that she not i not you 
should be able to make that choice without regard to whether she 
is rich or poor if her state allows that choice said rep david 
obey dwis 
kate michaelman president of the national abortion rights 
action league issued a statement that assumed the senate would 
give in to the house next week we are disappointed but not 
defeated she said we shall redouble our efforts with the new 
congress and the new administration and well try again 
before embarking on the abortion debate the house voted 33560 
to approve the other portions of the 140 billion fiscal 1989 
spending bill for the three federal agencies 
the bill includes among other things 12 billion for aids 
research treatment prevention and education 43 billion in 
education grants for disadvantaged students 55 billion in 
college student financial assistance and 37 billion for the job 
training partnership act

boston university plans to revive dormitory rules 
barring students from having overnight guests of the opposite sex 
and reducing the amount of alcohol brought into their rooms 
twenty years ago there was a move toward openness and now 
the pendulum is swinging back said university spokesman kevin 
carleton many people including students their parents and 
college administrators have seen that wide open dorms of years 
past did not work well for the serious student 
the new parietal rules came partly in response to complaints 
from parents including a letter from the mother of a female 
student whose roommate frequently entertained a boyfriend 
overnight carleton said 
ronald l carter dean of students declined to comment until 
after the rules are officially released sept 15 
at present as many as four guests can sign into a dormitory 
room and stay overnight if all roommates and resident assistants 
agree 
under the new guidelines which carleton said go into effect in 
late fall guests must hand in identification cards and leave the 
dormitory by 11 pm on weekdays or 1 am on weekends 
overnight stays by members of the same sex will be allowed if 
roommates agree but members of the opposite sex will not be 
allowed overnight officials said 
greg lang editor of the college newspaper the daily free 
press said friday that we sense a lot of students are very 
unhappy with the plan which he said would be difficult to 
enforce 
compared to a lot of issues on campus this really hits home 
with the majority of students lang said if they do go ahead 
and put this into practice therell be a lot of students opposed 
to it and who knows what will happen right now its a 
waitandsee situation 
parietal rules were abandoned by many american colleges and 
universities including bu in the 1960s and 1970s at the same 
time that coeducational dormitories were instituted such rules 
remain mostly at smaller colleges with strong religious 
affiliations 
carleton said the applicant pool for bus freshman class has 
increased dramatically in recent years allowing the university to 
choose serious students who prefer a traditional lifestyle the 
3650 students in this years freshman class were selected from 
23921 applicants 4000 more than last year 
were providing the kind of housing serious students want and 
need carleton said we are recognizing our obligation as 
university administrators and not as the operators of hotels or 
apartment houses

something there is that doesnt love a 
wall robert frost wrote but thats something a gentleman farmer 
cant agree with 
robert t vanderbilt was so upset a part of an old stone wall on 
his property was taken apart by neighbors that he called upon a 
19thcentury tradition to settle the dispute 
the law calls for town selectmen to become fence viewers and 
settle such disputes for a fee of 2 each 
the neighbors jack and nancy oken are willing to replace as 
much stone as their builder took four truckloads but they 
maintain that the wall was nothing more than a pile of rocks the 
builder used the stones in constructing their home 
vanderbilt wants them to rebuild the wall the section in 
dispute is about 3 feet high and 600 feet long 
fairfields three selectmen this week agreed with the okens that 
the wall was a little more than a pile of stones and said the 
neighbors were only obligated to replace the rocks 
vanderbilt must now decide how much he loves a wall hes 
received estimates from contractors of 22 a foot not including 
materials to rebuild it

the death rate from leukemia was nearly 60 percent 
higher among smokers of more than 10 cigarettes a day than among 
nonsmokers according to a study published friday 
while no direct link has been established between smoking and 
leukemia research published in the british medical journal showed 
that the leukemia death rate among people who smoked fewer than 10 
cigarettes a day was 34 percent higher than among nonsmokers 
for smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day it was 57 percent and 
for smokers of 21 or more cigarettes 63 percent the study showed 
if the findings in our study represented a direct relationship 
between smoking and leukemia then it must follow that smoking is 
responsible for more cases of leukemia than all the hitherto 
established causes combined said dr leo kinlen director of the 
cancer epidemiology unit at the university of edinburgh 
kinlen conducted the study of 248000 us military veterans 
with e rogot a statistician at the national heart lung and blood 
institute of the national institutes of health in bethesda 
maryland 
they wrote that it was the largest study of leukemia and 
smoking habits to date and represents additional evidence that 
leukemia is a smokingrelated disease 
in an editorial in the prestigious weekly professor nicholas 
wald of st bartholemews hospital in london cautioned that no 
causeandeffect relationship had been established 
but he added whatever the mechanism the balance of evidence 
suggests that smoking may cause leukemia 
it should therefore be added to the world heath organizations 
list of tobaccorelated causes of death he wrote 
the study was conducted on data collected from 248000 veterans 
between 1954 and 1969 the researchers wrote during that period 
723 died of leukemia of these 330 were cigarette smokers 185 were 
exsmokers 46 smoked cigars or and 162 were nonsmokers 
the study found that in some types of leukemia the death rate 
among smokers was sharply higher than the average 
thus for monocytic and myeloid leukemias the rate among smokers 
of more than 20 cigarettes a day was 93 percent higher compared 
with 48 percent for lymphatic leukemias 
for smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day the rate of death from 
lymphatic leukemia was 76 percent higher and for one to 10 
cigarettes 40 percent higher 
when the data was broken down into smokers and exsmokers it 
suggested that exsmokers also are significantly more at risk the 
death rate among smokers was 53 percent higher and among 
exsmokers 39 percent

next week transporting six fiberglass boats six outboard motors 
one boat trailer 150 tents and 4000 blankets 
about 46 million had been allocated previously by the

above average rainfall since the start of the 1988 monsoon 
season has contributed to unprecedented flooding in bangladesh 
bangladesh officials estimate that the floods have left 510 
people dead and up to 28 million homeless much of dhaka the 
capital is under 34 feet of water

country side and are finding thousands of stranded villagers still 
clinging to rooftops said nick weber who oversees care 
operations in the dhaka area 
he said many of the victims had had nothing to eat and no clean 
water to drink since flooding began aug 31 
their situation is desperate and its not likely to get any 
better for some time said weber 
stafford clarry director of cares overall floodrelief efforts 
in bangladesh said officials believe the countrys rice crop has 
been destroyed thus leaving farm families without any food for the 
next six to nine months

a senior iraqi diplomat again rejecting us 
charges his country attacked kurdish guerrillas with chemical 
weapons offered friday to consider an impartial inquiry into the 
allegations 
but the state department showed no immediate interest in the 
offer spokesman charles e redman insisted that iraq issue a 
declaration disavowing the use of chemical weapons in the future 
and on capitol hill the senate gave swift voicevote approval 
to a bill imposing stiff economic sanctions on the arab country 
the iraqi army is waging a campaign against the kurdish 
population that can only be described as genocide said the 
measures sponsor sen claiborne pell dri 
sadoon hamadi minister of state for foreign affairs said 
observers would not be permitted in the northern border area of 
iraq where many of the kurds live so long as hostilities 
persisted there 
but he said if the fighting subsided this is a possibility 
which we will not rule out 
secretary of state george p shultz told hamadi on thursday he 
was convinced that iraq had used poison gas against kurdish 
guerrillas he condemned its use as abhorrent and unjustifiable 
hamadi at a news conference friday said shultz had not 
substantiated the allegation no evidence was produced to us 
he said we have seen no evidence at all 
the iraqi diplomat whose meeting with shultz initially was 
scheduled to deal with sputtering efforts to end the iraniraq war 
said he told shultz the allegation was not true 
i said categorically we deny this he told reporters 
hamadi said he did not ask shultz to provide evidence and said 
he hoped us relations with iraq would continue to improve 
the iraqi official again accused kurds manipulated by iran 
of spreading the accusation that iraq used cyanide and other 
chemical weapons against kurds killing or injuring thousands of 
them 
he said negotiations to end the eightyear persian gulf war were 
in a difficult stage because iran was unwilling to accept the 
principle of free shipping 
hamadi said iraq must have access to shatt al arab historically 
its only access to the gulf despite irans opposition he said 
we will resist any attempt to suspend the negotiations 
redman the state department spokesman was asked later if the 
iraqi demand for freedom of shipping had us support noting the 
united nations is overseeing the negotiations he replied that we 
are not attempting to insert ourselves into these kinds of 
details 
the sanctions bill offered by pell chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee and sent to the house would 
require the us representative to international financial 
institutions top vote against all loans to iraq 
bar all us financial credits or guarantees to iraq 
ban the importation of iraqi oil 
forbid us economic and military aid 
bar the transfer of sensitive hightechnology items subject to 
us export controls 
i think this is as strong a set of sanctions as has ever been 
passed pell told reporters

president pw botha will make 
his first official visit to neighboring marxistruled mozambique 
the countries said friday 
bothas meeting monday with mozambican president joaquim 
chissano will underscore the improving relations between the 
longhostile countries although mozambique continues to charge 
that south africa supports an 11yearold guerrilla insurgency in 
mozambique 
botha during his 10 years as head of south africas 
whitecontrolled government has paid an official visit to 
swaziland and made a secret visit to south african troops fighting 
in angola 
but he has not made an official state visit to neighboring 
botswana mozambique or zimbabwe three of the socalled frontline 
states that vehemently oppose south africas apartheid policies of 
racial segregation 
mozambiques national news agency aim quoting unidentified 
official sources in maputo said botha and chissano would meet in 
the town of songo in the farnorthern province of tete 
the south african department of foreign affairs confirmed 
bothas visit but did not release any details the department also 
said botha would travel tuesday to malawi the only african nation 
that has full diplomatic relations with south africa 
the sources quoted by aim said botha and chissano would discuss 
matters of common interest and would meet in the spirit of 
the nkomati accord 
the accord is a mutual nonaggression treaty signed in 1984 by 
botha and chissanos predecessor samora machel during a ceremony 
at the two countries border 
machel was killed in a plane crash on south african territory in 
october 1986 mozambique blamed south africa for the crash saying 
a false radio beacon lured the plane off course but a south 
africanorganized panel of international experts blamed the 
accident on errors by the soviet crew 
chissano chosen in november 1986 to succeed machel has 
increased mozambiques contacts with the west which now provides 
extensive aid to the war and droughtwracked country 
the soviet bloc continues to supply weaponry and military 
training but most western governments support chissanos 
government and have denounced the often brutal tactics of the 
rebels 
mozambique has repeatedly accused south africa of violating the 
1984 nkomati accord by assisting the mozambique national resistance 
guerrilla movement south africa which aided the rebels before the 
accord says it has halted the assistance 
in the past year south africa has expanded its trade mission in 
maputo pursued economic development possibilities in mozambique

the soviet union has bought an additional 
350000 metric tons of us corn for delivery in the coming year 
the agriculture department said friday 
the sale brought total corn sold to the soviets in the last nine 
days for delivery in the 198889 year that started sept 1 to more 
than 26 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 350000 tons of 
corn would be about 138 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 275 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of around 38 million 
as with the other recent sales no indication was given whether 
the new sales of corn to the soviets would count under the current 
longterm grain supply agreement between the two countries or be 
carried forward separately in case a new pact is forthcoming 
the current fiveyear pact is set to expire sept 30 and 
negotiators are trying to work out a new one or at least an 
extension of the current agreement to take effect oct 1 
according to the agreement the annual purchases are supposed to 
include a minimum 4 million tons each of wheat and corn the 
soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as 
wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting as two 
tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
prior to sales announced since sept 1 the soviet union had 
purchased 905 million tons of wheat and 517 million tons of corn 
for delivery in the fifth year of the agreement plus 830000 tons

the government rejected a us offer 
of 502 million in annual aid in return for continued use of 
military bases in the country the foreign secretary said friday 
foreign secretary raul manglapus made the disclosure at a news 
conference two days before his scheduled departure for the united 
states to discuss the matter with us officials 
he was asked to comment on reports quoting unidentified us 
state department officials as saying the united states offered an 
annual 489 million aid package in exchange for use of the six 
military facilities 
it would have to be unacceptable manglapus said it is 
probably insufficient 
manglapus said the offer actually totaled 502 million and was 
made by us ambassador nicholas platt when the two sides resumed 
negotiations over the bases in august 
the talks were recessed aug 17 because platt had to go to 
washington for consultations the two sides said the talks are 
expected to resume this month 
negotiations began in april and were to have lasted three 
months but they dragged on and finally broke down over philippine 
insistence that washington pay 12 billion annually for subic 
naval base clark air base and four smaller installations 
asked if he would insist on the same figure when he meets with 
us officials manglapus replied oh yes we shall be 
clarifying that our position is reasonable 
manglapus is to meet secretary of state george shultz defense 
secretary frank carlucci and members of congress 
under an agreement that expires in 1991 the united states gives 
the philippines 180 million a year through 1989 the talks are to 
determine the amount of compensation for the remaining two years 
sources close to the talks say the americans refuse to give in 
to the philippine demands because of uncertainty they will be 
allowed to keep the bases after 1991 
president corazon aquino who is under pressure not to renew the 
pact has not disclosed her position she says she wants to keep 
her options open until 1990

an 11yearold hemophiliac says he is 
afraid to be tested for aids because he might lose his friends and 
he wants the state to stop mandatory identification of those who 
test positive for the aids virus 
the boy said he worries constantly that he is infected with 
aids but is afraid that if he tests positive his name might be 
leaked from state files 
the boy and his mother agreed to be interviewed by the arizona 
daily star on the condition that they not be identified by name 
i told this friend i have hemophilia and he went and told his 
mom and she said i couldnt come over no more he said 
twentynine doctors lawyers and others have signed a petition 
on the boys behalf and it is to be presented monday to state 
health director ted williams 
the petition asks that the state drop the requirement for 
reporting by name those people who test positive for the human 
immunodeficiency virus that causes to aids 
id be helping all the other hemophiliacs and all the people 
with aids in arizona the boy said 
hemophilia is a hereditary condition in which one of the normal 
bloodclotting factors is absent causing prolonged bleeding from 
even minor cuts and injuries it occurs in males and is 
transmitted by females 
hemophiliacs and others who received blood transfusions before 
1985 when screening became available were at risk of being 
infected with the aids virus 
the boy has had at least 45 transfusions since 1981 his mother 
said 
williams told the associated press on friday that his department 
is working on strengthening the confidentiality policy for aids 
patients rather than dropping the requirement that names be 
reported 
this child is making our case for us williams said hes 
concerned about getting tested because hes worried the information 
will somehow leak out 
the boy who moved from indiana to tucson this summer is a 
former schoolmate of ryan white the indiana boy who was barred 
from public school in 1985 after he contracted aids from a blood 
transfusion 
white also a hemophiliac returned to school under court order 
and he and his family later moved to another indiana town 
the 11yearold talked of being harassed and shunned by 
schoolmates in indiana who thought that because he was a 
hemophiliac he must also have aids 
before you know it youre sitting on one end of the 
playground and nobodys sitting with you and you dont know why 
he said 
williams would not discuss the specifics of the proposed changes 
in the law because they are still in draft form one change would 
allow the state to notify school districts of students who had 
tested positive 
williams said any changes would require public hearings 
we want people to come and get tested we want them to know 
thats the best way we have to fight this epidemic williams 
added

shootings described the ira members as dedicated and ruthless 
terrorists who were likely to carry arms and who had explosives 
ready to construct a bomb

the ptl bankruptcy trustee friday 
extended indefinitely the deadline to accept bids for the ministry 
and said jim bakker provided no proof he has the money to back up 
his 172 million offer to buy back the television network and 
religious theme park he founded 
bakker left a twohour meeting with trustee mc red benton 
at ptls executive offices behind two security guards who knocked 
down several television cameramen in their rush to leave the 
building at ptls heritage usa christian theme park 
bakker would only tell reporters were all working on it 
its going good its going great 
neither bakker nor his attorney jim toms could be reached for 
further comment 
benton however said i think hes exhausted about all 
offers he can in this situation certainly we were not assured 
that bakker has the funds 
when asked if bakkers deal was falling through benton said 
evidently its not obvious to him bakker 
the trustee said the latest deadline he had set to accept offers 
for the ministry 5 pm friday has been extended indefinitely 
and he said he may soon talk to canadian real estate executive 
peter thomas who had offered 113 million for ptl but withdrew the 
offer earlier this week 
i want to make it clear that we cant tell you anything 
positive today benton told reporters were sort of in a 
quandary at this point we may be at that point where we talk to 
him thomas 
benton had given bakker until friday to come up with 3 million 
to secure his officer and to show proof that funds exist for the 
overall loan 
ptl filed for protection from creditors in us bankruptcy court 
in columbia sc in june 1987 three months after bakker admitted 
having a sexual encounter with church secretary jessica hahn and 
left the ministry 
benton who met thursday with unidentified canadian investors 
who were interested in buying the ministrys assets has said he is 
considering other offers he did say the investors were not thomas 
or his associates 
benton has declined to give details of those offers he said he 
will report the status of negotiations to us bankruptcy judge 
rufus reynolds on monday the judge had said he wanted benton to 
recommend a buyer by that point

atop clay butte lookout 
near the northern border of the shoshone national forest pat moore 
cant see the fires for the smoke 
but she knows the flames are out there burning wildly in and 
around yellowstone national park to the west southwest and south 
of the us forest service lookout tower built in 1942 
moore a forest service secretary normally based in atlanta and 
verna nachu a bureau of indian affairs employee from white river 
ariz help fight the flames by relaying communications between 
fire camps 
they normally use us for repeater service nachu said 
between communications thursday evening they call us human 
repeaters 
sitting at 9811 feet the lookout towers radio messages are 
unimpeded by the surrounding mountains which frequently block 
communications among the fire camps based on the forest floor 
on clear days from their glassy perch moore and nachu can see 
the huge columns of smoke rising from forest fires in both the 
shoshone and adjacent yellowstone at night flames dance wildly in 
the dark 
on thursday though wind from the west encapsulated the lookout 
in a thick haze of smoke visibility to several hundred yards 
we had beautiful weather until the wind changed and the smoke 
came this way we really had a beautiful vantage point for 
watching moore said 
before fires surrounded nearby cooke city and silver gate 
mont the two women had frequent visitors when townspeople stopped 
by to watch the fires 
they ask a lot of questions about the fire said moore 
naturally they were concerned about their homes their friends 
homes 
moore who spent 30 days in california last summer during the 
fire season is in the middle of her third week in wyoming her 
first visit to the rockies and is in no rush to leave 
it is magnificent she said of of the surrounding 
countryside its so different from what im used to ive never 
seen the wildlife that i see here 
she said she daily spots moose deer elk and grouse although 
she has yet to spot a grizzly bear 
she does admit though that at times the lookout post can be 
quite boring 
were pretty well stuck up here with no driver no truck no 
nothing said moore it can be very boring after a while 
when theres no radio communications it can get slow really

federal savings institution regulators on 
friday announced another in a series of large rescue packages 
providing 557 million in aid to a michigan homebuilding company 
to acquire four insolvent texas savings and loans 
bank board chairman m danny wall said the federal savings and 
loan insurance corp which insures deposits in the nations 3000 
sampls will provide 312 million in promissory notes and 245 
million in additional cash assistance and guarantees over the next 
10 years 
pulte diversified companies inc the acquiring company is 
putting up 45 million for an 80 percent stake in the four thrift 
associations all in the houston area and for a fifth institution 
which was not identified 
wall said the details on acquisition of the fifth institution 
would be released in a few days he said several technical but not 
serious snags had developed in wrapping up the deal 
pulte is investing 22 million for the four associations named 
friday and 23 million for the fifth 
officials declined to say how much government assistance would 
be injected into the fifth institution but bank board member roger 
martin noted that the transactions were parallel possibly 
indicating that as much as another 500 million would be required 
pulte based in bloomfield mich a detroit suburb is a group 
of companies with 3 billion in assets it has homebuilding 
mortgage financing and home insurance operations in arizona 
california colorado florida georgia illinois maryland 
michigan north carolina texas and virginia 
this transaction represents its first venture into the savings 
industry 
wall said pultes new sampls will be permitted to lend to and make 
investments in the projects of other pulte subsidiaries 
stuart root fslic director said interaffiliate transactions 
would be strictly controlled and monitored quarterly by regulators 
many thrift institutions in texas got into trouble in the first 
place through real estate construction and development loans and by 
directly investing in those projects real estate values in the 
region were dependent on the health of the oncebooming but now 
moribund oil industry 
sen william proxmire dwis chairman of the senate banking 
committee said he was not familiar with the details of the pulte 
arrangement but that he is very concerned in general about real 
estate and other speculative investments by savings institutions 
im very concerned about having institutions that have 85 
percent of their liabilities insured by the federal government get 
involved in any kind of speculative activity thats a serious 
mistake and youre bound to have real problems in a recession he 
said in an interview 
wall said pulte is an example of the bank boards efforts to 
bring outside investors into the texas savings industry adding 
other investors like pulte who are waiting in the wings will 
help us fulfill the strategy of consolidation we adopted to restore 
the texas thrift industry to health 
the bank board has now resolved the cases of 35 of texas 124 
insolvent institutions nationally it has resolved 102 cases this 
year compared with 48 last year 
in just the last four weeks sampl regulators have pledged nearly 
13 billion to rescue more than 50 institutions regulators are 
rushing to complete many deals before the start of the new fiscal 
year on oct 1 so that they will not count against the 1989 budget 
deficit wall said he hopes to finish 65 rescues during september 
the four institutions being acquired by pulte are the heights 
savings association houston allenpark federal savings and loan 
association houston bay city federal savings and loan 
association bay city and gulf coast savings and loan association 
richmond combined the sampls have 25 branches 
wall said the insurance fund which gets its money from an 
assessment on the industry could recover some of its 557 million 
contribution by eventually selling its 20 percent stake in the new 
pulteowned institution fslic will also share in the new 
institutions profits and reap 25 percent of the tax benefits of 
the deal

if wouldbe miss americas use tape or 
surgery to improve their figures thats ok pageant judges say as 
long as the contestants also show theyre modern articulate women 
the pageants six preliminaryrounds judges agreed friday that 
they have no qualms about figureenhancing techniques 
such techniques often questioned during this 
scholarshipawarding pageant have been a consistent topic of 
discussion in the first days of the 1988 competition here this week 
a new miss america will be picked on saturday by a panel of 
celebrity judges theyll choose from among 10 semifinalists 
picked this week by the preliminary judges 
the preliminary judges say they wouldnt be put off if some 
contestants used unnatural gimmicks 
those techniques long discussed on the pageant circuit 
include surgical breast implants adhesivetaped chests and a 
sticky spray used to make swimsuits cling 
does it really matter if her breasts are taped asked judge 
trudy haynes an entertainment reporter on philadelphia television 
its their choice added william goldman a screenwriter 
whose credits include butch cassidy and the sundance kid 
according to the judges figure enhancing is fine so as long as 
its done with overall appearance in mind and not specifically to 
win the miss america title 
such techniques arent against pageant rules even if they were 
the judges say they probably wouldnt know which contestants were 
using the gimmicks 
cosmetic surgery is a product of the 80s said judge mary 
jennings an opera soprano and former third runnerup in the 
pageant 
miss mississippi carla haag who won a preliminary swimsuit 
event thursday also endorsed the use of artificial techniques to 
make bodies look better she declined to say whether she had had 
cosmetic surgery 
miss haag said surgery could be considered if it helped make a 
woman a much better person and to feel better about yourself 
the judges said they support retaining the swimsuit event 
despite continung criticism that it undermines the pageants 
credibility as a scholarship competition 
the event where competitors must walk the 200footlong runway 
clad only in a taut suit and highheeled shoes is designed to 
gauge physical fitness and poise pageant officials say 
pageant executive director leonard horn has said he will 
consider replacing the swimsuits with another measure of fitness 
but miss america insiders believe the swimsuits help draw the 
annual television audience so important to the pageants financial 
success 
judges said the fitness and poise evidenced in the event help 
indicate how able a miss america a young woman might be 
as important is a contestants showing in the talent event and 
in a sevenminute interview with the judges behind closed doors 
she probably wont have to put a swimming suit on with high 
heels again but shes got to be able to put a noun and verb 
together said judge rick lester managing director of the san 
antonio texas symphony orchestra

federal money cannot be used to construct 
roads for a shopping center being built adjacent to a historic 
civil war battlefield lawmakers agreed friday 
members of a house and senate conference committee adopted a 
measure introduced by rep robert mrazek dny that prohibits 
federal funds from being used for the planning design or approval 
of an interchange near the proposed william center development 
about 27 miles west of the nations capital 
the conference committee is seeking to reconcile house and 
senate versions of a 108 billion transportation appropriations 
bill 
the measure which was included the appropriations bill will 
expire in two years but mrazek said it could be renewed if a 
dispute between the shopping center developer and preservationists 
is not resolved by then 
the result today makes it manifestly clear that the congress 
does not want to assist in the development of this land said 
mrazek who predicted that a substantial amount of the 
development tract would ultimately be saved 
the 542acre development is adjacent to the manassas national 
battlefield park site of two crucial civil war battles 
historians argue that the project which would include a 12 
million squarefoot shopping mall 17 million square feet of 
office space and 560 homes would destroy the rustic sanctity of 
the 4200acre park 
sen john warner rva is preparing legislation that would 
seize a section of the site and direct the developer john t 
hazel to eliminate the shopping mall from his plans and greatly 
reduce the amount of office space 
warners plan would add to the park a hill from which 
confederate gen robert e lee commanded his troops during the 
second battle of manassas historians and preservationists argue 
that this parcel is the most significant in the entire development 
tract 
transporation officials have estimated that the interchange 
would cost up to 50 million

crack to an undercover police officer for 25 
under the guidelines one defendant would receive a prison term 
of 12 to 18 months while the other would be sentenced to 17 to 21 
years for the same offense jackson said 
the presentence reports reveal that both defendants are in 
their early 30s they have similar prior criminal records and 
similar personal histories and they are for practical purposes 
on the basis of information presently known indistinguishable as 
coparticipants in a routine smallquantity drug sale such as occur 
daily in distressing numbers jackson said 
jackson said the disparity in the two sentences under the 
guidelines derives primarily from evidence identifying only 
mcduffie with possession of drugs found in a nearby car 
the judge said he would not apply the guidelines when the two 
defendants appear to be sentenced on sept 14 
the guidelines which were established by a commission set up 
under the 1984 sentencing reform act provide an elaborate formula 
for calculating prison terms according to a defendants criminal 
history and the severity of his offense 
the supreme court is scheduled to hear arguments oct 5 on the 
constitutionality of the sentencing guidelines which provide for 
prison terms without parole 
federal judges began sentencing prisoners under the guidelines 
late last year since then 142 federal district judges have 
declared them unconstitutional while another 104 have upheld their 
constitutionality according to figures compiled by the us 
sentencing commission 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals also voted 21 to strike 
them down 
in the case before jackson gary d mcduffie and aubrey f 
martin pleaded guilty to distribution of a controlled substance 
after they were arrested april 16 after selling a vial of crack 
to an undercover officer 
officers who searched a nearby automobile which was registered 
to mcduffies girlfriend found personal papers bearing mcduffies 
name a 38caliber revolver and 109 grams of crack 
mcduffie also pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm in 
connection with narcotics trafficking for which he will receive a 
mandatory fiveyear prison term that must be served after he 
completes the prison term for the drug conviction 
another difference the judge noted was that mcduffie was still 
on parole for a seven to 21year sentence at the time of his 
arrest martin received three years probation in 1978 instead of a 
five to 15year prison sentence for a felony conviction that was 
suspended

archbishop desmond tutu 
inspected the bombed headquarters of the south african council of 
churches on friday then prayed for those who planted the 
explosives 
police later surrounded and entered the nearby central methodist 
church where the black prelate gave a news conference and tried to 
hold a private meeting with members of the church council staff 
the only surprising thing is it took so long tutu said of 
the bombing while a security police video team filmed him 
an explosion before dawn aug 31 heavily damaged khotso house 
where the council and several other antiapartheid groups have 
their offices more than 20 people in the area suffered slight 
injuries and the building was declared unsafe for further use 
the council moved into khotso house during tutus tenure as 
general secretary 19781984 tutu won the 1984 nobel peace prize 
for his work against south africas apartheid policy of racial 
discrimination and now heads the anglican church in southern africa 
foul foul foul tutu muttered bending under crumpled 
doorways and crunching shattered glass beneath his feet during a 
tour of three of the buildings six floors 
tutu and the church councils current general secretary the 
rev frank chikane entered through a balcony from a temporary 
metal staircase over the wrecked main entrance 
they went to each floor via the back fire escape because the 
buildings staircases were impassable walls were knocked down 
glass was broken and doors were blown out in every room 
surveying the elevator shaft which apparently took the brunt of 
the explosion tutu said it was done by an expert 
he stepped on a small table as he entered his old office and it 
collapsed then a partition fell over next to him i left this 
office in better shape he told chikane 
at the news conference tutu said the forces of darkness 
were behind the bombing and declared that the government and its 
supporters have tried before to destroy the council 
when asked who he held was responsible tutu said sometimes i 
amaze myself at how diplomatic i can be but people who are wise 
like yourselves know exactly who we mean 
police have not reported significant progress in their 
investigation antiapartheid activists believe the attackers were 
rightwing vigilantes or a covert security force unit 
if the police make arrests in the case i will give them a 
prize tutu said 
police allowed a crowd of blacks to sing and dance in the street 
outside khotso house for nearly an hour riot police moved in as 
tutu came out to deliver his prayer for the bombers but took no 
action 
soon afterward however officers scuffled with a guard at the 
door of the methodist church conference hall when he tried to keep 
them out of the meeting 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

workers staged a general strike 
in argentina friday and dozens of people were reported hurt in 
buenos aires as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to scatter 
thousands of demonstrators 
the independent news agency diarios y noticias said four people 
were seriously injured when a rally in the broad plaza de mayo 
outside government house turned into a street brawl including 
fights between members of rival unions it said 23 policemen were 
hurt and 60 demonstratorsprotesters were treated for injuries at 
the scene 
the strike was organized by the countrys largest labor 
federation to protest argentinas deteriorating economy and the 
policies of president raul alfonsin 
this is a referendum of the people against the hunger and 
misery the government is trying to impose on us 
secretarygeneral saul ubaldini of the general labor confederation 
told the plaza de mayo rally 
every day theres less work and my family cant live on what i 
earn said daniel rio a truck driver who attended the rally 
thats why im here 
the strike was called for noon to 8 pm so people would show up 
for work and then take part in rallies and demonstrations 
striking signalmen shut down commuter trains before dawn 
however and many bus drivers took a long midday break some 
businesses closed early particularly the expensive shops on 
florida street a pedestrian mall near the plaza de mayo 
strikes shut down or interrupted business in cordoba san miguel 
de tucuman rio negro santa fe and other cities 
the rally in this capital city began peacefully with unions and 
political parties waving banners and chanting slogans to the beat 
of rubber hoses on bass drums 
demonstrators from rival unions began quarreling and then 
fighting and police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at one point 
clubswinging police waded into the crowd 
ubaldini rubbing his eyes smarting from tear gas pleaded from 
the stage for order as police trucks with water cannon scattered 
the remaining crowd some protesters broke store windows as they 
left 
argentina is suffering inflation in which prices increased 53 
percent in the past two months unemployment and underemployment 
are near 14year highs real personal income has declined for three 
straight years the government acknowleges 
five weeks ago alfonsin implemented his third major 
antiinflation plan in five years it included devaluation of the 
austral argentinas currency the lifting of restrictions on some 
imports and voluntary controls on wages and prices 
in addition to reducing inflation the goal was to secure new 
loans from the international monetary fund and commercial banks to 
help repay interest on argentinas 56 billion foreign debt 
the general labor confederation and member unions complained 
that prices were rising despite the controls and pressed for higher 
wages the federation to which virtually every union belongs also 
demanded that economy minister juan sourrouille resign 
i want the government out of the international monetary 
fund said oscar zanetich a 41yearold public school teacher 
when questioned on the street by a reporter he also complained 
about teachers salaries 
argentinas debt the thirdhighest in the developing world and 
the billions of dollars it pays every year in interest are 
criticized by leftists unions and the opposition peronist party 
i repudiate the economic policies of the government said 
23yearold history student faviana as she spraypainted people 
power on the wall of a building outside the plaza she would not 
give her last name 
the strike was the 12th staged by the labor federation since 
alfonsin took office in december 1983 ending years of military 
rule 
supporters of alfonsins centrist radical civic union said the 
strike was meant to undermine the antiinflation plan and to unite 
support for peronist presidential candidate carlos menem in 
national elections set for next may 
one component of alfonsins general economic plan is the 
privatization of some of the dozens of state companies including 
the telephone company the national air carrier aerolineas 
argentinas and the national shipping line 
unions representing workers at the companies generally oppose 
privatization fearing that jobs would be cut the peronist party 
closely tied to the unions has raised obstacles in congress to the 
sale of stateowned companies

opposition sen juan ponce enrile 
said friday the government may have lost up to 5 million on the 
sale of a building in california and he demanded an investigation 
in a speech to the senate enrile claimed the government 
violated laws that require government property be sold by public 
bidding 
president corazon aquino said in a statement the 10 million 
price for the building which housed offices of philippine 
airlines was deemed the best practicably obtainable in the 
circumstances because of building restrictions in san francisco 
she did not elaborate 
the building was sold in april 1986 two months after mrs 
aquino assumed office after a civilianmilitary uprising drove 
president ferdinand marcos into exile 
a week ago enrile accused relatives of mrs aquino of the 
systematic looting of staterun companies the president and 
her family denied the charges and challenged enrile to present 
proof 
senate president jovito salonga and sen rene saguisag both 
members of mrs aquinos cabinet when the building was sold said 
they would welcome an investigation 
enrile presented documents at a news conference after his speech 
that he said showed mrs aquino and the board of the government 
service insurance system owner of the building gave official 
approval four months after the sale 
i am not enjoying this work because i have to assault the 
sensibilities of my fellow human beings enrile said the fact 
is this property was sold hastily at a loss almost 
surreptitiously 
the documents showed the building on the corner of stockton and 
geary streets was purchased in 1982 for 10 million the same price 
for which it was sold four years later enrile said it should have 
brought 1215 million 
one of the documents enrile presented quoted feliciano belmont 
manager of the government insurance system as telling mrs aquino 
irregularities may have been involved in the 1982 purchase by the 
marcos administration because the building was worth only 68 
million 
in defending the sale saguisag said there was an urgent need 
to sell the property to cut losses he did not elaborate 
tourism secretary jose antonio gonzalez who also was involved 
in the sale told reporters the sale was necessary even at a loss 
because the building was heavily mortgaged and the government could 
not afford the payments

republican vice presidential candidate dan 
quayle said friday he got into law school fair and square and 
not through an affirmative action program designed to help 
minorities 
reacting to a published report quayles wife who also attended 
the indiana university school of law said the special orientation 
program quayle participated in was unrelated to any affirmative 
action plan 
a law school official said affirmative action for blacks or 
other minorities was not a strong consideration at that time 
the cleveland plain dealer reported earlier friday that the 
admissions program quayle went through in 1970 was intended to 
offer equal opportunity to minority group members the economically 
disadvantaged and other students of different viewpoints and 
backgrounds 
the newspaper quoted cleon h foust dean of the law school when 
quayle entered as saying i can only remember blacks as the aim 
of the program 
the program sort of made up for their background he said 
the suggestion was that many had not had the scholastic 
background to cut the mustard in graduate school 
foust declined comment when contacted by the associated press on 
friday 
law school officials and marilyn quayle said friday the program 
was designed to help any aspirants whose college grades and 
entrance exam scores werent good enough to ensure admission but 
who had other credentials that indicated they might succeed in law 
school 
as he left canton ohio quayle told reporters i got into law 
school fair and square no rules were broken 
asked if he had enrolled in a special program he said he had 
taken a summer course it was just a class that was recommended 
to me by the dean 
he refused to speak about the plain dealer story saying im 
going to talk about the issues that the american people are 
interested in not some story 
g kent frandsen who was in charge of admissions when quayle 
applied in 1970 said there were probably less than three 
minorities among about 30 students admitted into the school 
during the programs two years 
he said law schools traditionally had little data other than 
college gradepoint averages and law school admission tests to use 
as criteria for admissions in the late 1960s the universitys law 
school faculty authorized faculty member charles kelso to conduct a 
program by which he would review other information 
among such information frandsen recalled were a students 
undergraduate major courses taken the school attended and letters 
of recommendation 
affirmative action was not a strong consideration at that 
time frandsen said 
larrie wilkins associate dean for academic affairs at the 
school was quoted by the plain dealer as saying the affirmative 
action element is implicit if not explicit in documents 
describing the program but since affirmative action was not the 
exclusive aim we would not expect all participants in this program 
to have been minority candidates 
mrs quayle said the preentrance program wasnt an affirmative 
action program 
it was this special admissions program for any student who the 
dean and professors thought could make it through law school and 
would be a good attorney she said while campaigning in 
indianapolis 
dan quayle made it through law school did a good job passed 
the bar exam on the first time which a number of people who have 
run for president have not done mrs quayle said 
the law school in indianapolis directed all inquiries friday to 
the universitys news bureau where the staff said law school 
officials were trying to put together an accurate portrait of the 
preentrance program 
the information about it is sketchy said charlotte wright 
an editor at the news bureau she said the program certainly 
wasnt called an affirmative action program 
meanwhile in washington 12 house democrats held a news 
conference to accuse quayle of hypocrisy for using the special 
program and then voting in congress against education programs such 
as teacher training head start and aid for disadvantaged students 
it seems to me dan quayle owes an explanation about how he got 
into law school and took advantage of a program clearly 
designed to help minorities and the disadvantaged said rep 
barbara boxer dcalif 
the democrats called on the university to release records 
surrounding quayles admission to its law school and they asked 
quayle to release copies of his academic records 
the university has said it will not release quayles record 
until he grants permission

republican george bush said friday his 
opposition to abortion should not be a litmus test that everybody 
has to agree with 
bush reiterated that he opposes abortion except in cases of 
rape incest or when the life of the mother is endangered he said 
many of his key supporters disagree with him on the subject while 
there are a lot that agree with me 
commenting on numerous subjects at the beginning of a campaign 
swing through illinois and pennsylvania bush also 
said the government should reexamine its policy of letting 
wilderness fires burn 
tried to distance himself from a man fired from a campaign 
advisory committee after complaints about antisemitism 
ridiculed democratic rival michael dukakis recent statements 
on the strategic defense initiative accusing him of contradictions 
and confusion 
with more than 1 million acres charred at yellowstone national 
park bush said i think we ought to take another look at the 
policy nobody can argue this is the best way to do it 
he commented briefly on the antisemitism issue one day after 
his campaign fired a member of a bush committee after disclosure 
that the man had defended ohio autoworker john demjanjuk who was 
convicted in israel as a nazi war criminal 
he wasnt on my staff bush said of jerome brentar 
cochairman of the bush 88 coalition of american nationalities 
it was an advisory committee the list came over from the 
republican national committee 
bush said i just dont want people associated with me who 
have a record of bigotry of any kind racial bigotry religious 
bigotry whatever it is 
i dont know this person but if thats the record why were 
better not to have any question raised of that nature and have the 
person do something else 
bush made his comments in an interview in rockford ill before 
flying to pekin near peoria where he attended a courthouse rally 
and was applauded by a large crowd 
bush later closed his campaign week with a rally before a 
cheering flagwaving crowd of thousands in york pa i 
understand that today the liberal governor of massachusetts 
attacked me for questioning the patriotism his patriotism im not 
questioning his patriotism bush said im questioning his 
judgment he added 
dukakis had compared bushs attacks on him to joseph mccarthys 
accusations in the 1950s dukakis said of bush i dont question 
his patriotism but i do question his judgment the democratic 
nominee said republicans were returning to tactics of the 1930s and 
1950s in attacking my patriotism but the american people can 
smell the garbage 
earlier in illinois at one point after bush spelled out his 
position on abortion a reporter noted that rep lynn martin 
rill the cochairman of his campaign who joined him in rockford 
is prochoice on the subject 
i have a lot of key supporters who agree with lynn and a lot 
that agree with me bush said 
saying he was proud to have her in a leadership role bush said 
whos going to have a litmus test that everybody has to agree 
with everybody on every single issue 
when it was noted that the gop platform takes a hardline stand 
against abortion bush said the platform states the position of 
the platform but nobody in our party takes a litmus test that says 
that everybody has to agree on every issue i expect the democrats 
could say the same thing 
on other points 
bush refused to comment on a report that his running mate dan 
quayle a wealthy indiana senator got into indiana university law 
school on an affirmative action program for the poor and 
minorities i never comment on rumors and thank god i didnt when 
they were all flying around back there at the republican 
convention about my running mate and everyone now sees that they 
were grossly unfair so i dont 
he said he has not decided how much the minimum wage should be 
increased bush who has long opposed any increase is expected to 
announce a change in position soon well im talking to some of 
our experts and im going to do whats fair ill tell you one 
thing though i will insist that there be a minimum wage 
differential he did not elaborate 
in a speech in rockford bush accused dukakis of changing his 
position on the star wars missiledefense program 
dukakis said thursday he would consider deploying star wars if 
research showed that it worked and was essential to the national 
interest a day earlier dukakis a frequent critic of the program 
had called it a fantasy in the sky 
bush who supports the program said calling it a fantasy one 
day something he wont rule out the next suggests a confusion 
in my view on the basic facts confusion in terms of what he really 
believes and where he would take this country 
bush spoke before the illinois federation of republican women in 
rockford before flying to peoria for the rally at the tazewell 
county courthouse in pekin and then on to pennsylvania 
illinois and pennsyvlania are key states in the presidential 
race commanding a total of 49 electoral votes the race is close 
in both states with dukakis believed to have an edge in 
pennsylvania 
bushs campaign had considered a stop at peorias caterpillar 
plant but after the hostile reaction he got from a union audience 
in portland ore earlier in the week decided on going to pekin 
addressing the gop womens group bush hinted at a new proposal 
that could help close the gender gap in support among women for 
his campaign 
departing from his text bush said look we also need to 
assure that women dont have to worry about getting their jobs back 
after having a child or caring for a child during a serious 
illness he did not spell out what he had in mind 
bush devoted a good chunk of his speech to chiding dukakis for 
seeming to soften his position on star wars which is formally 
known as the strategic defense intiative and on modernization of 
strategic weapons 
does he believe in defense against strategic missiles or 
doesnt he bush asked

democrat michael dukakis endorsed full 
statehood for the district of columbia on friday and won a strong 
statement of support from former rival jesse jackson in an 
appearance before a black religious group 
accept my recommendation jackson said of dukakis he can 
be trusted to help keep hope alive 
both appeared before the baptist national convention usa the 
largest black religious denomination with 8 million members the 
group is politically active and most in attendance stood up to 
demonstrate their endorsement of the democratic presidential 
nominee following the speech 
dukakis and jackson also met privately for about 15 minutes 
before addressing the group 
in just 60 days we can elect a president who will strengthen 
our voting rights laws not undermine them dukakis said who 
will fight for the universal voter registration bill now before the 
congress and who will stand by the people of the district of 
columbia in their struggle for full statehood and equal rights 
statehood for the district of columbia would give washington 
dc voting representation in the house of representatives plus 
two members of the senate it is an issue jackson has pressed 
dukakis to highlight 
jackson delivered a stirring endorsement of dukakis and blasted 
republican george bush as insensitive to the needs of the poor and 
minorities 
bush sees america from the penthouse down somebody must be 
concerned about the basement the foundation where the common 
people live jackson said 
why do i support michael dukakis why do i ask you to go and 
support him with fervor because bush does not care and gop 
running mate dan quayle does not understand dukakis cares and 
understands jackson said 
dukakis won one of his warmest receptions of the campaign from 
the predominantly black audience he repeatedly reminded the crowd 
that the election was in 60 days and in spontaneous responses the 
audience comprised largely of black ministers responded with 
loud shouts of just 60 days

a surprise rail strike in new york citys northern suburbs 
forced 95000 commuters to find another way to get to work friday 
in chicago a railroad strike disrupted rushhour evening service 
despite a bill signed by president reagan to impose a settlement 
the new york area employees returned to work under court order 
hours after the strike began and officials said train service was 
nearnormal during the evening rush hour legislation to force the 
chicago workers to do the same thing passed in congress on friday 
afternoon but it was too late to get commuter trains rolling on 
time from chicago 
the strike by 780 track workers in new yorks metronorth 
commuter railroad was prompted by the suspension of 37 employees 
tuesday for refusing to work overtime the teamsters said the 
union contends that forcing tired workers to continue on the job 
could be dangerous 
other unions quickly honored the teamsters picket lines 
shutting down the line and catching morning commuters in 
connecticut and new york northern suburbs without warning 
the train problem today is a surprise to me said jim grant 
at the south norwalk conn train station i wasnt even 
listening to radio or tv he said he would drive to a town that 
has bus service to new york 
friday evening metronorth operated about a third fewer trains 
out of grand central terminal because much of the commuter lines 
equipment was left at the northern part of the system by the 
strike said spokesman dan brucker 
in chicago 2600 united transportation union workers struck the 
chicago amp north western railway at 9 am cdt when the railroads 
parent company began posting layoff notices eliminating 1150 
brakemens jobs 
the strike could have begun just after midnight when a 
federally mandated coolingoff period expired but the company and 
union had agreed to hold off the actions until after the heaviest 
part of the morning rush hour 
the delay assured some 41000 commuters in the north 
northwestern and western suburbs a ride to work but many commuters 
sought alternate methods of getting to work and ridership was down 
about 40 percent 
this is terrible i think it very unfair and just plain 
stupid said marge miller of chicago you just cant believe 
something like this can happen 
a bill imposing a compromise settlement in the dispute was 
approved by the senate on thursday the bill which would trim the 
number of brakemens jobs by 689 then passed the house on friday 
afternoon reagan signed the bill early friday evening 
the first train pulled out of the companys downtown terminal 
after 5 pm cdt but railroad spokeswoman robin bournecaris said 
the company was having difficulty finding full work crews adding 
to the delays 
some of the union people left today and not all have come back 
even though many of the pickets are down she said 
most of our people were docked pay during a brief strike on 
aug 4 the day the coolingoff period was imposed said david 
wells a brakeman we informed our commuters that we didnt 
anticipate there would be an evening rush hour 
in new york the strike was halted after us district judge 
inzer wyatt ordered the teamsters back to work 
we are going back because we felt we got the point across 
said john mahoney secretarytreasurer of teamsters local 808 we 
had the attention theres a lot of people involved a lot of 
politicians involved now the commuters are screaming 
the judge set a hearing monday afternoon on whether to issue a 
permanent injunction and whether to award damages the railroad 
contending the strike was illegal sought 1 million in damages and 
also vowed disciplinary action against the strikers 
the house vote imposing the settlement in chicago almost did not 
take place friday 
under house rules members must unanimously agree before a bill 
can be brought to the floor without a waiting period one chicago 
congressman with close ties to labor briefly blocked that quick 
action raising fears that the chicagoarea strike could have 
dragged on until at least wednesday but he later withdrew his 
objection 
congress and the president have authority under the railway 
labor act to to settle railroad disputes that threaten national 
commerce 
the dispute stems from the railroads effort to reduce the size 
of freight crews by eliminating two brakemen per train saying 
those jobs are obsolete the union contends that to eliminate those 
workers would compromise safety 
the strike also halted campnws 10state freight operation but 
the company was prepared to resume those runs with management 
personnel said campnw spokeswoman leslie cleveland

michael dukakis compared george bushs 
attacks on him friday to joseph mccarthys accusations in the 1950s 
and said of his republican rival i dont question his 
patriotism but i do question his judgment 
he said the republicans were returning to tactics of the 1930s 
and 1950s in attacking my patriotism but the american people 
can smell the garbage 
in dallas later where dukakis endorsed making the district of 
columbia a state the democratic nominee gained a strong statement 
of support from former rival jesse jackson appearing as dukakis 
did before a black religious group jackson said of the 
massachusetts governor accept my recommendation he can be 
trusted to help keep hope alive 
bush asked by reporters on a campaign stop in illinois if he 
were indeed questioning dukakis patriotism responded im not 
saying that im just questioning his judgment on the issues 
the american people are interested in 
later at a rally in york pa before a flagwaving crowd bush 
responded to dukakis remarks saying i understand that today 
the liberal governor of massachusetts attacked me for questioning 
the patriotism his patriotism im not questioning his 
patriotism then the vice president added im questioning his 
judgment the crowd of thousands roared its approval 
in washington bush campaign aide mark goodin accused dukakis of 
strident namecalling and said the american people are 
getting a good look at the real michael dukakis and his views and 
they simply dont like what they see 
bush in criticizing dukakis on national defense and other 
issues in recent days has used the phrase about not questioning an 
opponents patriotism but questioning his judgment 
the democratic presidential nominee campaigning in bushs 
adopted home state delivered a stinging assault his strongest 
yet in an effort to put his campaign back on the offensive at a 
time when he is slipping in the polls 
dukakis referred to recent news accounts that top advisers to 
the bush campaign represented a bahamian official under 
investigation for involvement with drugs and said i dont 
question mr bushs patriotism but i do question his judgment 
he repeated the sentence over and over as he cited bushs role 
in the irancontra affair alleged corruption in the reagan 
administration and other charges 
today here in texas and in nearly 30 states throughout the 
country were giving george bush 60 days notice 60 days notice 
that were going to beat him on election day dukakis said 
the speech was still being written as dukakis flew to texas from 
new york and campaign chairman paul brountas said much of the 
rewriting was done by dukakis himself 
he spoke to an estimated 5000 people at east texas state 
university a site that was selected because it was the alma mater 
of the late us house speaker sam rayburn a revered figure in the 
east texas area that is considered a key battleground in the 
dukakisbush race 
dukakis said that when rayburn led legislative reforms of wall 
street and public utilities in the 1930s republicans put 
together the biggest and most vicious campaign against him 
they attacked sam rayburn and franklin roosevelt and they 
called them communists dukakis said rayburn he said replied 
im a conservative but even a conservative can smell garbage in 
his front yard 
sam rayburn knew that when you fight for the real people the 
other side will attack your patriotism dukakis said he saw it 
again in the 1950s when the republicans cheered as joseph mccarthy 
slandered good democrats as communists 
and those republican tactics havent chagned dukakis said 
just as they did to franklin roosevelt and sam rayburn theyre 
now attacking my patriotism and just as they did in the 1930s and 
the 1950s the american people can smell the garbage 
dukakis spoke of his support for a new federal law opposed by 
bush and running mate dan quayle that requires employers to give 
60 days notice to employees before factories are closed 
the dukakis campaign began airing commercials in texas this week 
hammering at the republicans on that plant closing bill 
the campaign was holding rallies around the country noting that 
there are now about 60 days to election day they were circulating 
pink handbills pink slips that said bush would be put out 
of work 
dukakis later went to dallas where speaking to the national 
baptist convention usa a large predominantly black religious 
group he endorsed the idea of statehood for washington dc he 
also met privately with jackson for about 15 minutes before 
addressing the group 
in just 60 days we can elect a president who will strengthen 
our voting rights laws not undermine them who will fight for the 
universal voter registration bill now before the congress and who 
will stand by the people of district of columbia in their struggle 
for full statehood and equal rights dukakis said 
the candidate canceled plans to then fly to new orleans for a 
rally and fundraiser campaign trip director jack weeks said the 
threat posed by hurricane florence was the reason 
brountas said dukakis tough new attack on bush followed a 
number of events that have occurred he referred to reports that 
people with antisemitic views were given posts in the bush 
campaign and that a firm with ties to bush campaign manager lee 
atwater received 800000 for lobbying on behalf of the bahamian 
prime minister who is under a drug investigation 
this is the issue of leadership leadership differentiated by 
judgment and hes talking to the vice presidents judgment 
brountas said 
dukakis flew to nearby greenville texas where he was greeted 
outside the airport by school children and a high school marching 
band dukakis stopped his motorcade in front of the band which was 
playing a republican theme god bless the usa he borrowed a 
trumpet and played happy days are here again a democratic 
standard 
dukakis citing bush campaign officials ties to the firm that 
lobbied for the bahamian official said these advisers or their 
representatives had over a dozen meetings with the vice 
presidents staff and used their personal relationships throughout 
the government to help their client 
he blasted bushs silence as dozens of administration 
officials were indicted and convicted or forced to leave public 
service 
republicans have been trying to cut social security and 
medicare for eight years until yesterday they had opposed every 
effort to increase the minimum wage dukakis said 
i dont question their patriotism i do question their 
judgment and their lack of concern for real people 
dukakis speech was interrupted momentarily when supporters 
began chanting to drown out the heckles of a small group of 
protesters some of the protesters carried antiabortion signs a 
familiar scene at dukakis rallies others carried signs that read 
go home yankee

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen told farmers on friday that his party would reverse 
republican trade and market policies that have punished our 
farmers in the past eight years 
bentsen speaking to hundreds of farmers and their families 
sitting on hay bales at the world ag expo said 235000 farmers 
have been driven off the land while george bush has been vice 
president 
its time for a change from the policies and personalities 
that devastated our farms punished our farmers and left rural 
america in the dust he said 
the democrats he said would pursue an aggressive trade policy 
that bush and the republicans have fought and work to research new 
uses for agricultural products to expand farm product demand 
ive worked around farmers all my life and the farmers i know 
would much rather be making their money from the market place 
than from the government though subsidies he said 
bush and sen dan quayle his running mate are not what farmers 
want bentsen said 
republican sen bob dole rkan hit the nail on the head 
when he said bush doesnt know whats going on when it comes to 
agriculture bentsen said 
he continued saying he was still quoting dole agriculture is 
not his strong suit i dont know what it is but its not 
agriculture 
as for quayle bentsen noted that the indiana senator passed up 
an invitation to speak at the huge agriculture exposition farmers 
bentsen said just might ask him about agricultural policy and if 
you did he just might not have an answer 
the texas senator was making his first trip to iowa since 
receiving his nomination 
a poll in june by the des moines register showed dukakis with a 
60 percent to 28 percent lead over bush in the state however a 
new poll released by the newspaper last weekend showed the edge had 
shrunk to just 47 to 42 
bentsen who was raised on a south texas ranch joined in the 
spirit of the agricultural fair by mounting a big green john deere 
tractor with an eightbottom plow and driving it for about 20 feet 
a highlight of the expo is a furrowdigging contest 
afterward bentsen met with reporters and said he was confident 
dukakis now knows more about midwest agriculture since he made 
controversial remarks in the primaries about how farmers should 
start looking into belgian endives 
im sure he does bentsen said 
rep neal smith diowa told reporters the big early lead in 
the polls for dukakis was inaccurate based on soft voter 
opinions the latest poll was probably more accurate he said 
having a democrat lead in iowa is an unusual event he said 
bentsen then went to california to take part in the democrats 
day of giving the republicans 60 days notice of getting voted out 
of office a play on the plant closing bill that president reagan 
bush and quayle fought before reagan allowed it to become law 
at a rally in a union hall in bloomington calif bentsen told 
a cheering crowd that were here today to give the republicans a 
better break than they give the american worker 
sure we could provide notice the republican way he said 
we could go there election eve and change the locks on the door 
we could take the vice presidents white house mess card and 
cancel that and we could take away air force ii he said but 
we agree with the vast majority of the american people who say 60 
days notice is fair

firefighters and 
equipment were redistributed friday to prepare for wind gusts up to 
60 mph while fires kept two small towns evacuated and the oldest 
national park mostly closed to visitors 
saturday may be the worst day since this entire episode 
began us forest service official brian h avery said friday 
were trying to prepare for that today because tomorrow will be 
too late to prepare for it 
elsewhere a firefighter battling a blaze that doubled overnight 
to 27500 acres in glacier national park and adjacent forest in 
northwestern montana was killed by a falling burning tree 
becoming the first death directly attributable to this years 
forest fires 
that blaze destroyed 15 homes and dozens of outbuildings and 
burned structures at two ranger stations a bridge and several 
historic cabins 
last month a helicopter involved in battling a blaze in 
wyomings bighorn national forest crashed after losing power 
killing a passenger a bureau of land management technician 
meteorologists had been predicting that an advancing weather 
front would produce extremely high winds during the weekend in 
yellowstone but might also bring some rain or snow by monday 
a revised forecast friday no longer anticipated any rain or 
snow avery said at a briefing on fire conditions 
we see no direct relief in site and we are anticipating major 
fire activity avery said adding that probably in excess of 
150000 acres could be burned by windwhipped flames 
emphasis shifted from the old faithful complex which should be 
in reasonably good condition because wednesdays firestorm 
burned an area around the perimeter that should provide a buffer 
against any further major burning there avery said 
the clover mist fire is our no 1 priority currently avery 
said by friday it had burned more than 263000 acres in the 
northeast quadrant of the park and the adjacent shoshone national 
forest 
were looking at fire danger to a lot of structures in the 
clarks fork of the yellowstone river and also in sunlight basin 
sunlight creek he said many ranches and a few lodges down 
there are going to need some additional protective measures 
the sparsely populated sunlight basin in the national forest was 
evacuated friday afternoon as flames threatened ranches 
thirteen fires burned almost 12 million acres as of friday in 
the greater yellowstone area and 115 million acres of national 
parks and forests in wyoming montana and idaho in 22 
millionacre yellowstone itself 816225 acres have burned 
fires also burned friday in alaska california colorado idaho 
utah and washington 
so far this year 68396 fires in the west have burned 3799550 
acres including just over 2 million acres in alaska in what 
federal officials have called the worst fire season in 30 years at 
the same time last year 49492 fires charred 1272412 acres

some of the worlds leading 
nazi hunters predicted many war criminals would die unpunished and 
said the united states was not aggressive enough in tracking down 
former nazis 
we must do all that is possible so that we dont give adolf 
hitler a posthumous victory said neal sher director of the us 
justice departments office of special investigations 
sher was among dozens of war crimes investigators attending a 
conference marking the 30th anniversary of west germanys central 
office for the investigation of nazi war crimes 
others at the meeting held in 18th century ludwigsburg palace 
included renowned nazi expert simon wiesenthal and shmuel 
krakowski director of the yad vashem holocaust archives in 
jerusalem 
sher rejected any suggestions that investigators should end 
their work just because many of the more notorious nazis who 
participated in largescale massacres have been convicted are dead 
or have disappeared 
sometimes i hear that only the small fry are left he told 
the associated press before addressing the conference but for 
each of the victims there was a family that suffered and if the 
family members werent themselves killed they were emotionaly 
scarred 
sher said the united states did not do enough to find nazi 
criminals in the first decade after the war 
i believe that the united states dropped the ball in not 
pursuing as vigorously as we should have war criminals in the 
united states he said 
one example he gave was klaus barbie the butcher of lyon 
who succeeded in entering the united states after the war and is 
now in a french prison 
tragically for every visa that was granted to a persecutor a 
legitimate refugee was denied an opportunity to come to the united 
states sher said 
wiesenthal told the ap there were such big possibilities 
after the war the ones who have escaped they are a special 
chapter the lost possibilities 
of the remaining war criminals he said they are getting old 
this is my daily problem we have cases we can never bring to 
court they may die but they wont die innocent wiesenthal said 
in his speech to the conference sher said we have to accept 
the fact that vast numbers of those involved in crimes of 
persecution will never be brought to justice in any form 
he said nazi leaders policies of killing witnesses and 
destroying documents has hindered investigators and survivors of 
the atrocities are dying from old age 
the efficiency of the third reichs genocidal policies made it 
a virtual certainty that many would go to their graves never having 
been called to account for their pasts sher said 
a czech speaker karel kamis earlier accused west germany of 
not doing enough to prosecute czech cases in the 1960s and 70s 
kamis an official with czechoslovakias commission for the 
investigation of nazi crimes said that during those years his 
country turned over 89 reports on suspected war criminals who were 
living in west germany 
but not one of those cases resulted in prosecution kamis 
said the testimony of witnesses from czechoslovakia was not 
believed 
he said cooperation between the two countries in nazi 
investigations has improved in recent years

former prime minister u nu burmas last 
elected leader before the military ousted him 26 years ago defied 
the countrys authoritarian rulers friday and announced the 
formation of a rival government 
about 500 soldiers mutinied and joined the massive movement for 
an interim government and full democracy in the first major 
defection of troops to the opposition 
more than 200 dependents from several diplomatic missions 
including 46 americans left burma as a precautionary move leaving 
about 400 others still to be evacuated 
in a letter to embassies u nu called for general elections oct 
9 he announced a 26member cabinet with himself as prim minister 
former president mahn win maung as president and retired general 
tin oo a vocal critic of the current authoritarian regime s 
defense minister 
diplomats said u nus chances of success are difficult to 
assess his country remains on the brink of chaos and the powerful 
military is still intact some opposition leaders criticized the 
move 
the move which follows weeks of massive occasionally bloody 
turmoil in this isolated southeast asian nation is considered high 
treason under present burmese law 
but neither president maung maungs government nor the military 
responded publicly to the act some of u nus fellow opposition 
leaders said formation of a parallel government could cause 
disunity among the people 
i have taken back the power which general ne win has robbed 
from me the 82yearold u nu wrote from this hour sovereign 
power no longer rests with general ne win it has come back into my 
hands and i announce this fact with joy 
ne win led the 1962 coup that toppled u nu ne win resigned as 
head of the ruling burma socialist program party in july but many 
analysts believe he still controls it 
todays announcement was not the first time u nu has tried to 
regain control of burma in the 1970s he attempted to lead an 
antine win insurgency from bases along the thaiburmese border but 
the plan failed 
about 400 air force personnel and about 100 troops from the navy 
and army marched in a studentled demonstration calling on troops 
inside city hall to join them but they received no response 
most of the deserters were enlisted men but reporters saw 
several lieutenants 
earlier friday about 200 air force men fled to the rangoon 
university campus the headquarters for student revolt it was the 
first major military defection to demonstrators seeking to topple 
the authoritarian system 
the soldiers shouted we side with democracy and not with 
fascists and our military training is not to shoot people 
asked about the significance of u nus move a western diplomat 
in bangkok said hes a good figurehead rather than a leader at 
this point it will depend on who his advisers are and also on the 
attitude of the military 
his main value will be as a symbol said another western 
diplomat he seems to enjoy the support of the majority 
but key opposition leader aung gyi called u nus move 
preposterous and aung san suu kyi another major oppositionist 
told newsmen i am only worried that such a move could cause 
disunity among the people if people support it i will have to 
support it 
aung gyi urged people to wait until monday when a special party 
congress decides on a referendum that could lead to democracy it 
doesnt pay to be rash at this delicate moment he said 
protesters have demanded immediate formation of an interim 
government to oversee a transition to democracy they blame the 
partys military autocracy for repression and economic policies 
that transformed resourcerich burma into one of the worlds 
poorest nations 
our country was ahead of thailand before the army took over 26 
years ago we are about 50 years behind thailand now aung gyi 
told a news conference friday 
some analysts believe u nu may be trying to take the initiative 
from the maung maung government and entice the military to his 
side others say the formation of a rival government could provoke 
the military into a crackdown or coup 
a special thai airways flight evacuated more than 230 dependents 
and nonessential staffers from numerous embassies diplomats said 
the evacuees included americans australians filipinos 
malaysians indonesians british japanese south koreans soviets 
and thais 
foreigners are not in danger at present but life is very 
difficult said one world bank official after arrival in bangkok 
theres no fuel and less and less food 
a rangoon diplomat speaking anonymously noted supplies of 
water and electricity also were becoming irregular 
students rioted in september 1987 to protest economic policies 
and led broaderbased street protests in march and june riots 
flared anew after ne win resigned july 23 and the party chose 
hardliner sein lwin to succeed him 
the government said 112 people died in rangoon in rioting 
against sein lwin who resigned after 17 days as leader diplomats 
believe many more people were killed 
maung maung took power aug 19 as the countrys first civilian 
leader in 26 years he lifted martial law in rangoon and curfews 
nationwide five days later but protests continued

opposition delegates made a lastditch 
attempt friday to stall chamber of deputies confirmation of ruling 
party candidate carlos salinas de gortari as mexicos next 
president 
through weeks of stormy debate the institutional revolutionary 
party known as the pri for its initials in spanish has brushed 
aside opposition claims that the election was rigged 
an elderly opposition deputy alejandro martinez camberos of the 
northern state of durango fell ill about 130 am while waiting 
for a chance to speak and was rushed to the hospital according to 
a spokesman for martinez camberos popular socialist party 
the raucous debates reflect the largest opposition presence in 
the legislature since the pri was founded nearly 60 years ago the 
ruling party has a majority in the chamber however and the 
opposition is diverse 
if its up to us it the confirmation could last three days 
we plan to destroy their arguments one by one francisco ortiz 
mendoza a popular socialist spokesman said shortly before the 
session resumed friday afternoon several hours late if they 
allow an open debate 200 speakers will go up to the podium 
his party belongs to the leftofcenter democratic front 
coalition headed by presidential candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas 
leader of a democratic reform movement 
orlando arvizu a pri deputy from hidalgo state told the 
associated press friday evening the chamber debate would continue 
without further interruption until we certify the presidential 
election 
asked how long that could take he noted the chamber had worked 
24 hours straight to certify the results of the congressional 
elections 
cardenas and the rightist opposition say the confirmation 
session is the last chance for the pri and the government it has 
controlled since 1929 to set a fraudtainted election right 
opposition delegates walked out on a key legislative committee 
but failed to prevent the panel from recommending confirmation 
early friday 
the pri members of the committee declared the july 6 election 
valid and said salinas won with 5074 percent slightly more than 
the 5036 the pridominated federal election commission gave him a 
week after the election 
it said cardenas received 3106 percent and manuel clouthier of 
the rightist national action party or pan got 1681 percent 
the pri and the government have consistently rejected opposition 
charges 
on friday the party accused the opposition of trying to derail 
an orderly presidential transition what they are seeking is to 
destabilize the government and degrade the republic its 
institutions and its politics a pri statement said 
the 500member chamber has been sitting as an electoral college 
since midaugust certifying the results of the legislative races 
it began working on the presidential certification friday 
about 150 riot police looked on as several thousand opposition 
supporters gathered outside the legislative palace on friday 
yelling chants against fraud as they have every day the chamber 
has met

with contempt fines at 1 million a day and 
massive layoffs a day away the city council scheduled an 
eleventhhour meeting friday night for yet another vote on a 
courtordered desegregation plan 
the council which has refused to implement the plan for 
lowincome housing planned a meeting at 1155 pm said mayor 
nicholas wasicsko if the plan is approved the city could avoid 
the layoffs and the 1 million fine 
a lawyer for the national association for the advancement of 
colored people michael sussman said late friday that the civil 
rights group and the council had hammered out a fairly complex 
agreement but the judge who imposed the potentially bankrupting 
fines refused to consider the revised plan 
hes not even going to listen to us sussman said of federal 
district judge leonard sand i asked to present the proposal to 
him and he didnt want to hear the details or the outline he asked 
only if the city was in compliance 
the city is being held in contempt of court for the city 
councils refusal in a 43 vote to carry out a housing 
desegregation order 
the biggest stumbling block remains the four recalcitrant 
councilmen sussman said 
their position is they cant go in and vote on the ordinance 
unless the changes we agreed to are made and the judge just wont 
give that agreement his position is you comply and after you 
comply you can come to me and i will consider your proposal 
sussman said 
he would not disclose the proposed modifications 
changes in the plan also would have to be approved by the 
justice department which brought suit against the city with the 
naacp and the department of housing and urban development 
earlier two of the defiant councilmen spurning the chance to 
change their stance on the issue stayed away from a noon meeting 
at which another vote on the plan was scheduled 
but councilmen peter chema and nicholas longo showed up at city 
hall more than an hour later with longo confirming negotiations 
were under way to end the segregation stalemate 
were only closer to the degree that theres communication 
going on and thats certainly a lot better than what was going on 
a week ago a month ago a year ago said longo theyre not 
hostile conversations 
longo and chema along with councilmen henry spallone and edward 
fagan jr have refused to accept a federally ordered housing plan 
the entire council and mayor nicholas wasicsko gathered friday 
afternoon and voted to transfer 819200 to pay thursdays fine 
as the councilmen entered city hall some of the crowd outside 
angered by the report of negotiations shouted sellout 
sellout but another section applauded the vote to pay the fine 
while i appreciate the sentiment of the cheers there is 
nothing to cheer about the mayor said weve just authorized 
to pay fines in excess of 800000 i sincerely hope this is 
the last time we have to make such a transfer 
the fine payment came as support for opposition to sands plan 
was starting to wane 
weve done all we can we went to the supreme court and didnt 
get anywhere said henry knetter 65 a northeast yonkers 
resident theres no garbage pickup there might not be any 
police protection it may be time to wise up 
knetter spoke for an increasing number of residents whose 
opposition to lowincome housing has softened as the realities of 
sands fines began hitting home 
phone lines at city hall were jammed this week with callers 
urging one councilman to change his vote wasicsko said 
uncollected garbage sits outside many homes children going to 
school have no crossing guards the three town libraries close 
saturday 
but at a contentious meeting thursday fagan and other 
councilmen criticized sand saying i hope theres a god up there 
that will strike him down 
the fines which began at 100 per day doubling daily until 
hitting a 1 million cap on friday forced the state emergency 
financial control board to impose a doomsday plan aimed at 
providing public safety services while delaying bankruptcy 
phase one starts saturday with 447 of the citys 1834 
employees receiving layoff notices as part of a 20 million savings 
package the parks and recreation department will close the 
panning department will be slashed to two employees 
other layoffs will come from the departments of real estate 
civil service fiscal services and public works control board 
chairwoman gail shaffer new yorks secretary of state said the 
cuts will keep yonkers solvent until 1989 
if the council refuses to back down additional cuts are set for 
sept 17 and 24 oct 8 and 22 and nov 5 shaffer said 
sand who in 1985 ruled the city had practiced segregation in 
housing and education for 40 years imposed the fines after the 
four councilmen refused to implement part of his plan 
city schools were desegregated under a plan approved by sand 
and the city council initially agreed to build 1000 units of 
lowincome housing in january but they rejected the housing plan 
at an aug 1 meeting prompting sand to impose fines which would 
double every day 
the us supreme court upheld sands fines on appeal but placed 
a 1 million cap on the daily amount

despite continuing economic setbacks african 
governments are coping well with vital tasks of adjustment for the 
future the world banks vice president for africa said thursday 
those things which were manageable were being managed very 
well by the africans during the past year vice president edward 
vk jaycox told reporters 
still the general economic situation in africa south of the 
sahara desert continues to cause concern because the regional gross 
product declined in 1987 a reversal of 1986 attributed mainly to 
drought he said 
but recognizing that there is nothing we can do about 
weather war or terms of trade it was an extremely positive 
year jaycox said 
in the last two or three years about 30 governments have 
undertaken structural economic adjustments and have seriously 
come to grips with problems that were blocking economic growth 
he said 
jaycox an american was named to head the new world bank 
department for all african countries south of the sahara formed in 
the 1987 reorganization of the washingtonbased lending 
institution the bank has been working with governments in the 
region to reduce subsidies promote realistic pricing and exchange 
rates and encourage private initiative 
governments that once trumpeted support for a new world economic 
order rather than waiting for the day when somehow there is a 
change in the economic order are in fact coping with the 
existing system and its going to pay off he said 
with substantial reforms under way in half to twothirds of the 
countries south of the sahara desert evidence is growing that 
sustained reforms do lead to improved economic performance and 
growth jaycox said 
he added that in contrast to generally shrinking world market 
shares in the past africa actually increased its share of world 
exports of some commodities in 198687 
the best real growth performances were registered by ghana 
guinea guineabissau and kenya with 5 to 6 percent increases in 
gross national product jaycox said

george bush said friday michael dukakis must explain how he 
could say he would consider deployment of star wars after 
denouncing the proposed missile defense system as a fantasy in 
the sky dukakis called bushs attacks on him mccarthyism and 
said voters can smell the garbage 
meanwhile bushs republican running mate indiana sen dan 
quayle was peppered with new questions about his entry into law 
school 
jesse jackson speaking to a black religious group in dallas 
voiced strong support for dukakis saying that his former rival 
can be trusted to help keep hope alive and cares and 
understands dukakis told the same group that he supports 
statehood for the district of columbia 
blasting bush as insensitive to the needs of the poor and 
minorities as someone who sees america from the penthouse 
down jackson said why do i support michael dukakis why do i 
ask you to go and support him with fervor because bush does not 
care and quayle does not understand dukakis cares and 
understands 
bush and dukakis campaign leaders settled on los angeles as the 
site of the second debate between the nominees said paul brountas 
the democrats campaign chairman earlier the leaders agreed the 
first bushdukakis debate will be in winstonsalem nc and 
tentatively settled on sept 25 as the date for it 
the los angeles round will be either oct 13 or oct 14 
depending on the length of the american league baseball playoff 
series 
bush speaking to gop women in rockford ill said of dukakis 
and the strategic defense initiative calling it a fantasy one 
day something he wont rule out the next suggests a confusion 
in my view on the basic facts a confusion in terms of what he 
really believes and where he would take this country 
the governors going to have to explain himself he said 
the democratic nominee said this week he supports continued 
research on a spacebased missile defense system and would back 
deployment if it were shown to be feasible and essential to the 
national interest 
dukakis was campaigning in texas after attending a 5 million 
democratic fundraiser in new york at which he told the blacktie 
audience i wont kid you this is not going to be an easy 60 
days 
the massachusetts governor was striving to regain momentum in 
the face of recent polls that have said bush had surged into the 
lead in the presidential race 
speaking at east texas state university the alma mater of the 
late house speaker sam rayburn dukakis said that republicans once 
attacked rayburn as a communist 
sam rayburn knew that when you fight for the real people the 
other side will attack your patriotism dukakis said he saw it 
again in the 1950s when the republicans cheered as joseph mccarthy 
slandered good democrats as communists 
and those republican tactics havent changed just as they did 
to franklin roosevelt and sam rayburn theyre now attacking my 
patriotism and just as they did in the 1930s and the 1950s the 
american people can smell the garbage 
bush spokesman mark goodin responded the american people are 
getting a good look at the real michael dukakis and his views and 
they simply dont like what they see we arent questioning his 
patriotism were questioning his judgment 
and in pennsylvania bush said it himself closing his campaign 
week with a flagwaving rally in york the vice president told the 
crowd 
i understand that today the liberal governor of massachusetts 
attacked me for questioning the patriotism his patriotism im not 
questioning his patriotism im questioning his judgment 
democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen campaigning 
in iowa quoted republican sen bob dole of kansas as saying that 
bush doesnt know whats going on when it comes to agriculture 
dole sharply critical of bush when the two were competing for 
the republican presidential nomination trounced the vice president 
in the iowa gop caucuses last winter 
speaking at the world ag expo in amana iowa bentsen said 
its time for a change from the policies and personalities that 
devastated our farms punished our farmers and left rural america 
in the dust over the past eight years 
quayle went to a steel plant in massillon ohio where many 
workers wore dukakisbentsen tshirts 
i wasnt afraid to stand up for the steelworkers of indiana or 
the steelworkers of ohio or the steelworkers of america the 
indiana senator told workers at mercury stainless inc the dukakis 
supporters stood silent while other workers applauded 
at the factory gate qayles car drove by about 150 protesters 
who held up such signs as draft dodger quayle who died in your 
place 
quayle also was confronted with questions about a cleveland 
plain dealer story saying that he was admitted to law school under 
an experimental program designed primarily to benefit minority 
students 
the affirmative action element is implicit if not explicit 
in documents describing the program said larrie wilkins associate 
dean for academic affairs of the indiana university law school 
but since affirmative action was not the exclusive aim we would 
not expect all participants in this program to have been minority 
candidates 
quayles staff released a statement saying i got into law 
school fair and square nothing improper was done and no rules were 
broken the newspaper article makes that point clear in the body of 
the story 
i never comment on rumors was bushs response when asked 
about the story 
the vice president devoted most of his speech to the republican 
federation of women to attacking what he portrayed as a shift in 
dukakis position on star wars officially known as the strategic 
defense initiative 
does he believe in defense against strategic missiles or 
doesnt he asked bush 
i am committed to go forward fully with this research and then 
to deploy when ready he said i do think that the governors 
going to have to explain himself on these contradictions and the 
questions are going to be how does he plan to defend america and 
how can he pretend he wants to modernize when he has said he wont 
modernize

republican legislators said thursday that the 
state budget signed by gov michael s dukakis in july is out of 
balance by as much as 12 billion because the democratic 
presidential candidate is overestimating tax collections and is 
spending too much 
the results are very sobering and very disquieting about the 
future of this state house minority leader steven pierce said 
senate minority leader david locke joined pierce in calling once 
again on dukakis to demand that the legislature return to session 
immediately to address the fiscal situation and other concerns 
noting that the house and senate have been in recess since early 
july and may remain on vacation until after the nov 8 election 
locke denounced what has to be the longest vacation of any 
legislative body in the history of mankind 
although the legislature voted for the current 116 billion 
budget in july and dukakis does not have the power to 
singlehandedly summon the legislature back to work the 
republicans laid both problems at dukakis feet 
dukakis has made the federal deficit a leading theme of his 
presidential campaign 
based on our analysis there is going to be a shortfall that 
may exceed a billion dollars locke rsherborn said adding 
that the voters have a right to know whether dukakis and democratic 
legislative leaders plan tax increases 
michael lellyveld spokesman for finance secretary frank keefe 
insisted that the budget was balanced their numbers dont add 
up lellyveld said 
the fiscal year which began in july is now two months old 
according to the revenue department tax receipts in july dropped 
156 percent from july 1987 and rose 28 percent in august compared 
to the same month in 1987 
according to the republican analysis the twomonth average 
increase of 14 percent is far below the traditional pace of 
receipts in the first two months of the fiscal year indeed based 
on the traditional proportion of all taxes brought in during those 
two months the 12month total could be off by more than 437 
million 
moreover the republicans assert that the governor is depending 
on ephemeral and flimsy projections of 245 million in 
extra revenues this year based on steppedup enforcement by the 
revenue department and the state auditor

republican us sen gordon humphrey on 
thursday retracted his remark that betty tamposi shouldnt run for 
congress because she has small children calling the statement 
just plain stupid 
in plain english i made a mistake i am sorry and i 
apologize humphrey said in a statement 
while everyone knows of the strains congressional families 
experience as a result of the long working days of members of 
congress i had no right to impugn the motives of any person 
wishing to serve in congress he said 
the controversy began tuesday after a speech when humphrey 
suggested tamposi was negligent to run for the us house with two 
daughters ages 22 months and 4 tamposi a millionaire officer in 
her fathers real estate company pays a nanny to care for her 
children 
its selfevident that you cannot work 12 to 14 hours a day in 
congress and have time left over for a child he said 
its difficult enough being a father of a young child and a 
member of congress as i am said humphrey who has a 3yearold 
son for the mother who in our society is the primary care 
giver working 1012 hours a day makes it impossible to give the 
nurturing the child would need 
the remarks drew criticism from tamposis campaign which 
denounced them as irresponsible and insulting and demanded an 
apology 
tamposi is one of six candidates in the 2nd district republican 
primary on tuesday humphrey supports another candidate chuck 
douglas 
after two days of insisting he wouldnt back down humphrey 
apparently changed his mind after he got a call from douglas 
humphrey issued the retraction a spokesman for tamposi said 
humphrey also telephoned her to apologize 
i want to make it clear that i did not represent the douglas 
campaign in making statements critical of betty tamposi said 
humphrey 
chuck douglas is blameless neither he nor anyone in his 
organization had advance knowledge of my statement he said 
at a concord news conference thursday douglas reiterated that 
he had nothing to do with the remark 
how she raises her children is her own business said 
douglas i have not delved into the personal lives of my 
opponents nor will i

nazi hunters from the united 
states israel and other countries gathered thursday to pay tribute 
to a west german office that has helped track down war criminals 
for 30 years 
at a thursday night reception at the ludwigsburg palace west 
german officials praised the offices work and said their 
countrymen must remember the nazi era so that such atrocities are 
never committed again 
we owe this office profound thanks for 30 years of work 
said ulrich hartmann a regional administrative official 
the west german central office for the investigation of nazi war 
crimes has helped convict more than 6000 people on various war 
crimes charges since its founding in 1958 
a total of 160 war criminals have been sentenced to life 
imprisonment because of the offices work life in prison is the 
highest possible sentence in west germany which has no death 
penalty 
speakers at the reception said the search for nazi war criminals 
was far from over 
today 30 years after the creation of the central office the 
job is still not done said heinz eyrich baden wuerttemberg 
states justice minister 
nazi hunters including simon wiesenthal traveled to 
ludwigsburg to attend a special symposium friday marking the 
anniversary of the central office others gathering for the event 
were nazi hunters from austria israel and east bloc countries 
neill sher from the office of special investigations for the us 
justice department was also attending 
despite its successes the central office like other groups 
that track down suspected nazi war criminals is having increasing 
difficulty in its work because the crimes happened so long ago 
said alfred streim head of the ludwigsburgbased office 
it is becoming more and more difficult to have a successful 
case because witnesses are dead or they dont want to talk 
anymore streim told the associated press 
some of them witnesses just say please let me have my 
peace he said 
streim pointed to the aug 29 acquittal of former ss sergeant 
wolfgang otto on charges of participating in the 1944 execution of 
ernst thaelmann head of germanys communist party 
otto was convicted in 1986 but a higher court overturned the 
verdict saying there was no evidence to prove that otto had been at 
the scene of thaelmanns execution 
the appeals court acquitted otto for the same reason having to 
rely on evidence from the original trial 
but streims office continues to contribute to some significant 
successes even though the crimes occurred long ago 
in january of this year a west german court convicted gottfried 
weise a former ss guard at the nazis auschwitz concentration camp 
the 66yearold weise charged with fatally shooting five 
auschwitz inmates including an 8yearold child was sentenced to 
life in prison

the debate about debates began a few weeks ago in low

for their voters she said 
the explanation given by political analysts about the

new south wales on friday became the 
first state in australia to ban koala and platypus exports saying 
that sending the marsupials to zoos overseas amounted to a virtual 
death sentence 
their survival rate is unacceptable said new south wales 
environment minister tim moore we simply cannot guarantee their 
safety 
news reports noted that moore announced the ban after a japanese 
request for three more koalas and a pair of platypuses to boost 
japans breeding program 
at least eight koalas have died in overseas zoos in the last 
three years five of them in japan besides japan the only other 
overseas zoos with koalas are at san diego and los angeles 
moore also ruled that no platypuses be sent overseas until more 
research is done into their failure to breed in captivity 
zoologists said only one pair of platypuses had bred in captivity 
in australia during the past 40 years 
the pouched animals are unique to australia 
moore said he was not suggesting there is anything wrong with 
conditions in japanese zoos but that australia was probably the 
only country with veterinary surgeons skilled in the treatment of 
koalas 
he said most deaths seemed to be caused by stress and chlamydia 
a venereal disease that has been ravaging koala colonies in recent 
years moore did not mention old age as a cause of death 
moore said the export ban would remain in force until there is 
an immunization program for chlamydia or methods found to deal with 
koala stress 
koalas feed on only a few varieties of eucalyptus trees and are 
found only on the east coast of australia 
a spokesman for federal environment minister graham richardson 
said exports of koalas and platypuses already are restricted 
because the animals fall under the category of rare or endangered 
species

a barge ran aground and cracked open thursday 
near natchez miss spilling more than 5000 gallons of a 
flammable chemical into the mississippi river the us coast guard 
said 
the coast guard revised its initial estimate of a 40000gallon 
spill after closing a 50mile stretch of the river to shipping 
from the point of the spill to angola la the river would reopen 
early friday officials said 
the barge was loaded with styrene a clear chemical which floats 
on water and catches fire easily meidt said authorities said the 
vapors can irritate the eyes and throat and can cause loss of 
consciousness direct contact with styrene can burn the skin 
the chemical is used principally in the manufacture of plastic 
and rubber 
meidt said a tug owned by apex towing co of st louis mo was 
pushing 13 barges when at least one went aground and cracked 
at least three crew members reported some queasiness after the 
accident but they did not seek immediate medical attention he 
said 
the cause of the accident had not been determined he said 
the styrene began drifting downstream immediately meidt said 
there was little evidence of the chemical spill at natchez thursday

a floating fence was suspended in the water to stop the chemical 
from flowing into the atchafalaya river 
the coast guard did not known how long the river would be closed 
to traffic no northbound vessels were reported waiting and only

republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle 
shifted from his attacks on democrat michael dukakis on thursday 
delivering a foreign policy speech praising what he said were 
reagan administration gains and expressing skepticism about the 
soviet union 
the soviet union will always be an adversary will always 
be a competitor he said 
addressing the city club of chicago the indiana senator spoke 
in offthecuff remarks tossing out a speech text that had been 
prepared by his staff and approved by the bush campaign 
his press secretary david prosperi had said the speech would be 
the first of several designed to showcase quayles experience on 
the senate armed services committee 
the text went into great detail about weapons systems and 
national security philosophy 
in his remarks as delivered quayle said there had been foreign 
policy gains in places such as grenada and afghanistan during the 
reagan years he also praised the president for the armsreduction 
treaty with the soviet union and criticized congress for 
micromanagement of foreign policy 
he emphasized what he said was a need for a skeptical attitude 
toward the soviet union saying the jury is still out on 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs commitment to reforms in 
eastern europe and whether he will honor treaty agreements and 
human rights progress 
quayle said in his speech the soviets must demonstrate whether 
they will allow their citizens wishing to leave to do so or are 
they going to selectively let out one or two at a time have a lot 
of publicity about it and get brownie points for that 
prosperi said afterward that quayle stands behind the text 
that had been released earlier to reporters but that he decided not 
to read it because thats his style prosperi said of the 
speech changes that quayle beefed it up quite a bit based upon 
his own expertise 
he said quayle was not rebelling against a text written 
principally by others and had informed his advisers ahead of time 
that he would not be delivering it 
quayle has a team of top political advisers put together by the 
bush campaign 
on one of the only specific points that he took from the 
prepared text quayle said the war powers act should be repealed 
or drastically rewritten 
while hitting some of the same themes that were outlined in his 
prepared speech quayle did not go into the same detailed analysis 
for pushing forward with research and testing of the strategic 
defense initiative or for his call for europe and japan to share 
more of the cost of their own defense 
senior adviser ken kachigian said later that theres nothing 
mysterious about quayles abandoning the text 
he had the speech he had no problem with it kachigian 
said but quayle is so familiar with the subject matter that he 
felt more comfortable speaking from his own outline 
he said the staff knew that when the text was passed out to 
reporters on the plane that quayle would not deliver it verbatim 
as the initial controversy over his national guard service and 
personal background subsides the 41yearold quayle is seeking to 
project himself as a substantive politician 
in another matter the cleveland plain dealer reported in its 
friday editions that quayle entered law school in 1970 through an 
experimental program that was a precursor to affirmative action 
efforts at the indiana university law school 
the plain dealer said the law school admissions program was 
intended to offer equal opportunity to minorities the 
economically disadvantaged and other students of different 
viewpoints and backgrounds 
quayle spokesman jeff nesbit said the program was for kids who 
didnt make the first cut but showed promise had something in 
their application that showed they had what it would take in dans 
case graduation from one of the finest colleges in the midwest 
depauw the harvard of the midwest the top of the top 
quayle generally has refrained from attacking lloyd bentsen the 
democratic vice presidential candidate who has a long highprofile 
congressional record but has instead targeted dukakis blasting 
the massachusetts governor as being weak on defense and 
inexperienced in foreign policy 
although he did not mention the democratic ticket in the chicago 
speech because the audience was a nonpartisan group quayle went 
back on the offensive in springfield ill 
americans are not going to turn over the peace and prosperity 
to some inexperienced governor of massachusetts he said 
in the text of the city club speech quayle said that the 
foremost threat to our existence and to our values comes still 
from the soviet union he said gorbachevs new openness and 
restructuring policies will produce economic gains that may only 
benefit the soviet military machine 
the text also went into defense burdensharing with the allies 
saying this nation should plan a harmonious approach of 
responsibilitysharing between the united states and our allies

window service at the nations post offices 
cut last february to save money is being restored starting 
saturday 
most post offices cut hours by about a halfday a week to help 
cope with 160 million in congressionally imposed spending cuts 
the service reductions came two months before postage rate hikes 
which took nearly a year to put into effect were instituted to 
cope with a rising deficit by the postal service 
the unexpected spending reduction came as part of overall cuts 
in government expenditures aimed at reducing the budget deficit 
even though the postal service no longer receives a taxpayer 
subsidy 
while the the postal window hours will be restored the new 
hours will not necessarily be the same as those that were in effect 
at each office before the closings were imposed officials said 
local managers were given the option to adjust hours to suit the 
needs of their communities

in an unprecedented move the state department 
announced friday tentative approval of a plan to allow the export 
of usmade communications satellites to china for launching into 
orbit aboard chinese rockets 
the announcement represented a victory for the state department 
which overrode contentions by the transportation department and 
private industry that the deal will place us producers of 
satellite launchers at a competitive disadvantage 
the plan was denounced by martin marietta corp which makes 
rockets for commercial use and by members of congress who saw it 
as undermining the us aerospace industry and causing the loss of 
thousands of amerrican jobs among other threats 
rep gerald solomon rny introduced legislation to ban such 
exports under the arms export control act congress has 30 days to 
act on the resolution and solomon predicted quick approval

seoul gourmets continue to enjoy dog 
stew and korean olympic stars have been consuming barrels of snake 
soup despite government attempts to ban the traditional delicacies 
during the summer games 
the government has outlawed sales in seoul of dog meat snake 
blood worm soup and other exotic dishes to avoid offending 
foreigners during the olympics which begin sept 17 officials 
said visitors might be disgusted by the unusual culinary offerings 
and koreans would be called barbaric 
but the ban has had little or no effect on seoul restaurants or 
the eating habits of their customers dog meat is still a lunchtime 
favorite in many backstreet eateries 
korean athletes training for the olympics have been eating dog 
snakes and deer antlers to help build up their strength and 
stamina boxers wrestlers and others believe eating dog and snake 
will give them the endurance and strength of the animals

tonight usa today the television show meets 
usa the television audience 
according to its producers the show intends to avoid the icky 
ugly side of the news and concentrate on journalism of hope 
often presented in the form of a video version of the polls that 
are a staple of the newspaper of the same name 
the premise sounds like happy news a red flag to tv 
critics and has elicited concerned comments that the show if 
successful might have the same kind of impact on television news 
that usa today has had on some newspapers which it seems have 
been forced to become more colorful and entertaining 
so far broadcast journalism has survived foxs a current 
affair and the more recent hootable the reporters geraldo 
rivera became a talkshow host and the walls of government are 
still standing 
theres no reason journalism wont also survive usa today the 
television show which doesnt really threaten to be anymore than 
yet another tv newsmagazine albeit a nightly halfhour one jazzed 
up with expensive graphics and networklevel talent 
the show comes from some responsible folks grant tinker the 
former head of mtm productions and nbc and gannett the publisher 
of usa today the newspaper the shows studios are at the 
newspaper headquarters in rosslyn va the executive producer is 
steve friedman former executive producer of nbcs today show 
the show was quickly sold to about 160 stations an indication 
the stations expect a hit 
i think we will have a success said tinker at a news 
conference in july i think we may get a few people expressing 
disappointment in that first week because they were looking for 
magic and all were giving them is a very presentable show 
usa today is indeed presentable the graphics will knock 
your socks off the anchors are telegenic beyond belief its as if 
everybody who was popular in junior high school when you werent 
ended up on the same television show 
usa today the newspaper serves as something of a generic 
libretto for the tv version which is partitioned into four 
sections like the paper there is the usa frontpage section 
reported by edie magnus the money section reported by anchorman 
kenneth walker sports reported by bill macatee and the life 
section reported by robin young 
the cover story will come from whatever section looms largest 
that night this week the cover story is a series called living 
in america an examination of a poll of american attitudes about 
romance physical appearance kids finances and the future 
other feature reports are on the olympics a school where 
ambassadors learn to fend off terrorist attacks and tough new 
jersey school principal joe clark 
these are all typical stories for any tv newsmagazine a slick 
watchable more immediate style is what the producers of usa 
today the television show hope will make it different 
there will be no sadness or desolation 
the first show was not available in time for reviewing but 
friedman and tinker showed a prototype to tv critics in july that 
included a report on the drought in the midwest the story was not 
about the devastation but rather about nebraska which is doing 
just fine thank you thanks to its vast natural underground water 
supply 
friedman argued that the piece taught people something true 
but how many people spinning by on remote control are just going to 
pick up the subliminal message drought no problem 
we cant go out and say good evening ladies and gentlemen 
the dow jones industrials lost 200 points today but dont worry 
theres still 2000 to go said friedman but he added we 
would rather deal with problem solvers than problem causers were 
not saying that dealing with problem causers is wrong its just 
that most people are doing that we choose to do something else 
so can tv viewers

elsewhere in television 
the news times are achanging the new york affiliate has moved 
the cbs evening news from 7 pm edt to 630 pm putting it 
against abc world news tonight so the nbc nightly news now 
has the 7 pm slot to itself in the first two days after the 
change nbc saw a rise in its new york rating of 45 percent the 
increase might not continue but even if it does says nbc it 
would only make a change of 02 in the national rating in the most 
recent nielsens nbc lagged behind secondplace abc by 04 and 
behind cbs by 08 a 10 rating represents 1 percent of the 
nations 886 million television homes the time change did not 
significantly affect the ratings for cbs and abc

during the hot days of a texas summer 
scratchedup old records would probably suffice for a true fan of 
bob wills and the texas playboys 
but theres nothing like live music said leon rausch who 
used to play guitar for the band rausch is concerned that western 
swing as wills made it might not be around much longer 
i couldnt hold a beer joint job these days because i couldnt 
keep up with the tunes the 60yearold rausch figured these 
younger guys are playing what they do to make a living 
i know you have to change with the times but i sure would 
hate to see what we did fade away 
leon mcauliffe who played steel guitar for the band from 1935 
to 1942 and with wills wrote the classic san antonio rose 
took a lot of the bands history with him when he died aug 20 at 
the age of 71 
some say he could make that steel guitar talk like no one else 
old band members hope to put it together again and remember 
wills and mcauliffe who led the band after wills death and was 
the chief spokesman for the texas playboys in the latter years 
herb remington who played steel guitar for wills from 1946 to 
51 and now lives in houston said a group of former band members 
now calling themselves playboys ii played at a recent western 
swing festival in canton texas 
we all attribute our careers to bob wills the 62yearold 
remington said you would have enjoyed the band 
as for the absence of mcauliffe said johnny gimble who fiddled 
for the band from 1949 to 1951 i think leons in a lot better 
shape than anybody now hes in heaven 
gimble also 62 said hundreds of musicians played with the band 
over the years and that wills made them all better than they 
originally were 
everbody claims to have played with bob wills gimble said 
from his home in round rock texas i think when i was in the 
band there were about 350 claiming to have played with him there 
are a lot of them still in texas 
and although many of them are alive and still playing the 
band was never on fire after he died he said the audience 
came to see him its one of those things you cant put your finger 
on 
mcauliffe and the others decided to regroup in 1973 to work on a 
texas playboys retrospective lp but wills suffered a stroke before 
the album for the last time was finished and died in 1975 
after veteran texas playboys pianist al stricklin died in 1986 
the band staged what was intended to be a final concert at will 
rogers auditorium in fort worth on nov 16 1986 
mcauliffe said the band had decided not to go out one by one and 
with stricklin gone the texas playboys would play no more 
we loved each other and we loved al mcauliffe said at the 
time 
however the band came together one more time to film with such 
country artists as mel tillis george strait and willie nelson an 
austin city limits public television music program a special 
tribute to wills that ironically aired only hours after mcauliffe 
died 
rausch said the bands music came from wills mind and influence 
from other music such as the big band sound mexican horn music 
and blues from the 1920s 
his favorite singer was bessie smith the biggest black singer 
of his day in the 20s rausch said he thought bessie smith 
hung the moon 
in his early days rausch said wills used mostly string 
instruments 
he decided to put horns in his band to compete with big dance 
bands rausch said they didnt want to hear just a fiddle and 
a guitar in a big dance hall he took a little sampling of this and 
a little sampling of that and put it all together 
band members say when it was all put together there was nothing 
like it 
you can hear it in the records gimble said he might not 
have anything to do with what you do but he inspired you 
according to rausch the word inspire is an understatement 
when wills used his famous ahhh fill in the blank with any band 
members name take it away theyd take it away 
he was a whale of a guy he said guys didnt even think 
they could play until the old man pointed at them youd give him 
115 percent when he pointed at you 
he was always hollering for you to do something and you 
jumped in there and did what you did when he jumped up and down 
and hollered that stuff it drove people crazy

like other frequent fliers pilots suffer the 
effects of jet lag and sleep loss from flight delays late arrivals 
and crossing time zones for them however the consequences are 
potentially disastrous the second story of a threepart ap extra 
series 6 miles up and sleepy describes the growing medical 
evidence showing how fatigue and disruption of the bodys 
biological clock upset performance in the cockpit 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when pilots struggle to hold their eyes open on late night 
flights they are fighting the rhythms of their own bodies the 
builtin timekeepers that rule their cycles of sleep and alertness 
pilots schedules often require them to get up early stay up 
late or fly at times when their bodies tell them they should be 
fast asleep 
sleep experts say the effects on the pilots are clear they grow 
agonizingly drowsy when they should be alert but at bedtime they 
frequently have trouble nodding off the result is a potentially 
dangerous combination of inattention and cumulative sleep loss 
just as we want our planes maintained so mechanical factors 
dont crash them we should equally be concerned about the 
maintenance of our pilots so biological problems dont crash 
them said dr david dinges a sleep expert at the university of 
pennsylvania 
when people traveled by ship they crossed one time zone a day 
their bodies adapted easily now jets span five or six time zones 
in a single night the human body cannot keep up 
under a fairly typical longhaul schedule a crew might fly from 
san francisco to london one day to seattle the next then back to 
london to seattle to london to seattle in eight days they cross 
time zones 48 times 
a vacationer landing in london after one of those legs might 
feel wooly for a couple of days but no harm is done however for 
the pilot crisscrossing the planet there is no chance to recover 
from jet leg the price a spiraling sleep debt 
while flights that span continents and oceans provide the most 
dramatic examples of sleep disruption shorter domestic trips can 
be exhausting too a pilots work day can last 16 hours experts 
say that after a late evening arrival there often is simply not 
enough time for a decent nights sleep between checkin at the 
hotel and the trip back to the airport for the next days duty 
if a pilot gets just one hour less sleep than normal each night 
the debt after several days can significantly weaken attention 
diligence and motivation 
pilots have disrupted sleep and significantly shortened sleep 
while away from home said dr martin mooreede a sleep expert 
at harvard medical school over longer distances they find 
themselves fatigued are inalert in the cockpit and drop off to 
sleep 
pilots of course are not alone in this singlevehicle traffic 
accidents in which cars and trucks simply veer off the road are 
most likely to happen in the middle of the night 
so are industrial accidents the nuclear power plant disasters 
at three mile island and chernobyl resulted from mistakes made in 
the small hours 
in the last two decades many experiments on volunteers have 
documented the effects of working and thinking while short of sleep 
or out of synchronism with the bodys builtin clock the circadian 
system 
this research underscores the belief that fatigue is as risky 
for pilots as it is for nuclear plant operators and longhaul 
truckers or anyone else who must make lifeanddeath decisions but 
proving this in the cockpit is difficult 
no blood test can measure sleepiness after a crash or near miss 
even if one could a crash almost always results from a series of 
mistakes and bad luck fatigue may be only one link in the chain of 
disaster so a few sleep experts have begun flying with pilots to 
see what really goes on 
ive been all over the world with these guys i know what 
happens said dr r curtis graeber a psychologist at the 
nasaames research center at moffett field in california 
weve seen fuel mismanagement two engines being flamed out 
and nobody could figure out why for 20 minutes he said weve 
seen tires blown because the brakes were misset 
was fatigue to blame theres no smoking gun graeber said 
i cant prove to you that the guy mismanaged the fuel because he 
was tired but i can tell you that he did it on the segment in 
which we had seen the greatest fatigue we dont tend to see those 
errors on the first flight of the trip

graeber and others hook pilots and engineers to monitors while 
they fly they hope to see whether crew members make more mistakes 
when such physical signs as body temperature and heartbeat suggest 
they are less alert 
much of that data is still being collected and analyzed but 
graeber said its clear that by the third night of such schedules 
as the san franciscolondonseattle tour the cockpit crew becomes 
increasingly lethargic 
dr mary carskadon of brown university has shown in the 
laboratory what graeber sees in the cockpit the effects of lost 
sleep accumulate over time 
most people particularly those who are trained as pilots are 
can cope with the effects of chronic sleep deprivation fairly well 
most of the time she said but a vulnerability is set up 
that puts them at risk for catastrophic events to occur 
experts say that when people are tired they become sloppy 
motivation flags inertia sets in they take shortcuts and ignore 
small details 
flying a big plane however is mostly a matter of paying 
attention to small details setting instruments following 
checklists getting weather reports watching dials 
its the errors of omission that occur because of lapses in 
attention that are the hallmark of fatiguerelated accidents 
said dr charles czeisler of harvard medical school such omissions 
would include not noticing an indicator thats not right 
anticipating a problem before it occurs thinking many steps down 
the line he said 
sometimes pilots and flight engineers fall asleep on long 
cruises especially over oceans this is not terribly dangerous as 
long as someone in the cockpit stays awake but sleep is 
contagious the sleep experts say their research has turned up many 
tales of entire crews nodding off 
another concern is microsleep a shadowy state in which people 
are half asleep with the brain waves of sleep intruding on those 
of wakefulness people in this condition can continue to perform 
duties while only vaguely aware of whats going on around them 
its much worse than being frankly fully asleep because 
they can continue to carry out routine tasks said czeisler if 
they were truly asleep someone else at least might notice 
these problems occur in part because jet travel ignores the 
circadian timekeeper the product of millions of years of evolution 
on a planet rotating once each 24 hours each day the clock 
oversees a symphony of changes in body temperature alertness and 
hormonal secretions all of them geared to roughly a 24hour cycle 
for most people the daily swing reaches its low point from 330 
to 5 am this is when they are sleepiest there is another less 
pronounced valley of drowsiness in the afternoon from 4 to 5 the 
body temperature is also lowest at these times 
consider the pilot who leaves california on a latenight 
crosscountry flight even if he slept during the day hes likely 
to feel sleepy early in the morning as his body temperature falls 
by the time he checks into a new york hotel his body temperature 
is rising again his body clock is telling him to wake up even 
though he is tired sleep is difficult he awakens feeling ragged 
and has to fly again 
the pilot who flies across multiple time zones faces the 
problem that his body continues at the old time zone said 
dinges he is forced to try to sleep when his body clock wants 
him to be awake and to be awake when his body clock wants him to 
sleep

todays federal rules for pilot rest and duty hours come out of 
the era of the dc3 when propellerdriven airliners droned along 
at speeds less than 200 mph and took eight hours to fly from new 
york to miami 
revised in 1964 and again in 1985 many of the federal air 
regulations differ little from rules first issued in the 1930s 
crews for large airlines on domestic routes cant be scheduled 
to fly longer than eight hours between required rest periods they 
cant fly more than 30 hours in seven days 100 hours a month and 
1000 hours a year crews may exceed the eighthour limit if their 
scheduled flights are delayed by weather traffic or equipment 
problems 
commuter airline pilots may fly 34 hours in 7 days 120 hours in 
a month and 1200 a year 
crews must be given at least nine hours rest in a 24hour 
period however that can be cut to eight hours if the next rest 
period is increased by two to three hours based on an faa formula 
threemember international crews can fly up to 12 hours a day 
they must get 18 hours rest if they fly more than 24 hours in 72 
hours or 20 hours within 48 hours larger crews can fly longer 
twomember crews can fly only eight hours between rest periods 
however the rules dont speak to duty hours measured from the 
time a pilot reports to the airport usually an hour before first 
takeoff through the days schedule including sitting on the ground 
between flights to departure after the final flight such 
reckoning can stretch a crews time on the job to 16 hours 
west germany britain and the netherlands limit their pilots 
hours by calculating duty time the number of takeoffs and 
landings the time of day and the number of time zones crossed 
none of these factors is considered under us commercial 
regulations 
the latest faa rules are the result of socalled regulation by 
negotiation union and airline representatives met in 198384 
with faa officials and a mediator to work out minor changes in 
domestic rules 
these rules are often used by airlines and their unions as a 
baseline for schedules stricter than government guidelines 
our own rules go on beyond the far federal air 
regulations said george hof head of american airlines flight 
operations we find the far is a place to begin 
faa administrator t allan mcartor strongly denies federal 
regulations run second in safety to union contracts 
our standard is not the thinnest ice you can skate on he 
said 
yet in 1975 an faa investigation of a series of pan american 
crashes in the pacific raised questions about the adequacy of faa 
regulations 
dr stanley mohler then chief of the faas aeromedical 
applications division suggested us regulators look to the 
factors that the europeans use to set flying limits 
it was the feeling at the faa to leave it up to the unions to 
negotiate relative to their airlines specific type of flying 
said mohler now head of aerospace medicine at wright state 
university it seemed to make sense up until deregulation 
with deregulation airlines stretched into new markets added 
new routes and faced new competition efforts to cut costs and keep 
fares low put pressure on various parts of the industry including 
the pilots according to the airline pilots association the 
average pilot flies 13 percent more each month today than 10 years 
ago 
mcartor says he has an open mind to change the faa is 
supporting fatigue research being done by nasa on several airlines 
i dont know of any carrier that wont voluntarily do all they 
can to ensure efficiency in the cockpit he said but i dont 
believe we know all that we will know about this phenomenon as we 
understand it better the scheduling i think will reflect that

one oftenproposed solution to the dangers of pilot fatigue is 
legalization of a remedy that is obvious and widely practiced but 
forbidden naps in the cockpit 
passengers may blanch at the idea of their captain snoozing 
while they watch a movie six miles above the earth but sleep 
researchers contend this is a sensible way to cope with the flight 
crew exhaustion caused by latenight arrivals earlymorning 
departures and timezone crossings 
while air travel is generally safe the experts say it could be 
safer still if human frailties were considered in the design of 
flight rules pilot schedules and the planes themselves 
some in the flying business however are reluctant to 
acknowledge fatigue as a concern the federal aviation 
administration has publically voiced skepticism that sleepy pilots 
create a hazard in the skies the airlines seem to fear that 
proposed rule changes would make scheduling more difficult and 
some pilots fret that they would lose the large blocks of free time 
they now enjoy 
industry observers moreover contend that one of the most 
powerful impediments to change is the very image of the airline 
pilot fit trim and male calm confident and capable surely such 
a person can deal with a little thing like sleepiness 
there is a widely held belief that mental toughness good 
management or physical fitness will overcome sleepiness that is 
categorically incorrect said dr david dinges a sleep 
researcher at the university of pennsylvania your brain still 
needs sleep and you get yoursef into serious trouble when you try 
to tough that out 
several approaches are being considered cockpits that monitor 
their operators medicines that help flight crews sleep when off 
duty schedules that figure in the time of departure and the 
direction of travel as well as the length of the work day 
but one of the easiest and simplest solutions is the nap 
its common knowledge that people are napping in the cockpit 
because they are so tired said r curtis graeber a sleep 
scientist at the nasaames research center in california we are 
looking very closely at the potential safety benefits of allowing 
limited napping in the seat 
the us air force encourages its crews to nap on long cargo 
flights and some foreign countries britain and west germany among 
them allow sleeping in airline cockpits under federal aviation 
administration rules however napping is considered careless and 
reckless operation of the aircraft 
yet on the long midflight stretches across continents and 
oceans pilots have little to do but monitor their dials nature 
takes its course in interviews with the associated press pilots 
reported frightening instances of awakening to find their two 
colleagues sound asleep as the airliner cruises through the night 
skies 
graeber proposes that naps be carefully scheduled so each member 
of the flight crew anticipates a rest period 
napping will be very helpful if its ever implemented 
agreed mary carskadon a sleep researcher at brown university it 
makes so much more sense to schedule it in than to all of a sudden 
have all three members of the flight crew asleep because no one is 
scheduled to sleep 
far more difficult the experts agree is improving pilot 
schedules rules set by the faa and union agreements dictate how 
many hours a day pilots can be on duty and in the air but the 
standards allow myriad permutations of day and night departures and 
arrivals that often leave crews out of synchronism with their 
internal circadian clocks 
i think pilot scheduling is as good as it can be right now 
reflecting what we know said alan mcartor head of the faa as 
we understand it better the scheduling i think will reflect 
that 
mcartor and airline officials are awaiting results of research 
now being conducted jointly by nasa the airline pilots association 
and united airlines 
beginning this fall graeber and other researchers will fly with 
pilots on long overocean routes monitoring their body 
temperatures and brain waves as they fly through the night 
the resulting advice may not please either pilots or airlines 
pilots often vehement critics of schedules might find their 
flight time spread over a longer calendar period eliminating the 
intense two to three weeks of flying that gives them the rest of 
the month off

airlines already pinched by deregulatory competition and a 
pilot shortage may have trouble staffing their cockpits and paying 
additional salaries if researchers say pilots should fly reduced 
schedules 
faa scheduling regulations have changed little since the 1930s 
when lumbering prop planes rarely crossed more than one time zone a 
day among those who think they can be improved is john lauber a 
sleep researcher on the national transportation safety board 
an arbitrary restriction on flight and duty time and mandatory 
rest time that doesnt take into account circadian factors is 
simply not 20th century he said we know that an hour of sleep 
is not an hour of sleep depending on when you take it one of the 
biggest improvements we could make in our regulations would be to 
recognize those factors and adjust schedules appropriately 
the experts contend that schedules should consider the time of 
departure the number of time zones crossed and the direction of 
travel the body adjusts more quickly when traveling west to east 
than east to west 
another part of the problem is the plane itself the modern 
cockpit is a fine place for involuntary slumber the lights are 
dim the seats are comfortable the air rushes past with a soothing 
hum 
planes are so automated that they quite literally fly 
themselves except while landing and taking off there is often 
little for crew members to do the newest planes dont even require 
a flight engineer so standard crew size is being reduced from 
three members to two some pilots and sleep experts complain that 
this increases the odds the entire crew will doze off 
the fewer people in the cockpit the fewer safeguards you 
have said dr martin mooreede of harvard a sleep expert at 
harvard medical school its easier for two people to nod off 
than three 
but delmar fadden a boeing administrator asserts just the 
opposite is likely if there are only two in the cockpit both 
know that they cant rely on a third person so they are more 
attentive to the tasks they are doing and are much less likely to 
allow themselves to go to sleep 
fadden who establishes design requirements for the boeing 747 
and 767 said we cant do a lot about the fact that the crew 
might be fatigued what we try to do is make the airplane tolerant 
of the crews reaction 
this means designing planes to be safe even when flown by bored 
drowsy inattentive pilots if something goes wrong such as a 
generator failure the plane automatically compensates without 
waiting for the crew to act 
fadden said some planes being built will monitor their crews 
alarms will sound if pilots do nothing for 20 minutes such a lapse 
of activity could mean the pilots are daydreaming or worse 
another possible solution used by the british during the 
falkland islands crisis is a drug to help pilots sleep before 
night flights bill storm a psychologist at brooks air force base 
in san antonio texas said the us military is experimenting with 
the drug temazepam 
all of these suggested changes are intended to lessen the chance 
that cockpit fatigue will combine with bad weather equipment 
failure and other random hazards to trigger a disaster 
we run a very safe air transportation system said lauber 
but we are pushing people harder we know from anecdotal data 
that people are not as alert as they should be they are falling 
asleep in some circumstances i think its appropriate that we 
reexamine the way we approach these things

imagine this work week 
leave los angeles at 815 pm and fly 5 hours to honolulu 
rest the second day but leave late that night at 1 am which 
is 4 am los angeles time for the 8hour flight to auckland 
new zealand where you wait 90 minutes then fly three more hours to 
sydney australia after a days rest in australia you do the same 
thing in reverse landing back in los angeles seven days after you 
left 
or consider this schedule 
leave boston at 615 am fly two hours to cincinnati leave an 
hour later on a 4hour flight to los angeles twelve hours after 
landing youre back in the cockpit flying all night to cincinnati 
and after an hour on the ground on to newark arriving back on 
the east coast 26 hours after you left 
it is schedules like these the first flown by united airlines 
crews the second by delta airlines that pilots say wear them 
down sometimes leaving them groggy and prone to mistakes 
what were doing with these schedules is taking human beings 
and saying lets get the maximum out of them said one united 
captain interviewed by the associated press who asked not to be 
identified out of concern for his job as a result weve got 
crews who are in rough shape out there 
yet another united captain who makes transpacific flights said 
his most recent sixday tour of duty went like this 
1015 am arrive los angeles international airport for 1135 
jumbo jet trip to tokyo go through paper work check flight plans 
weather fuel passenger load 
flight promises to be particularly heavy requiring unscheduled 
fuel stop in alaska several passengers fail to show making extra 
stop unnecessary but threatened schedule change and a mixup 
getting departure clearance mean plane is pushed away from the gate 
40 minutes late 
1235 pm after starting the engines taxiing out to runway 
going over checklist plane takes off 
after liftoff we run a sterile cockpit until top of climb 
the captain says that means all business no chitchat no pa 
announcements we check the instruments seeing that the systems 
are running as we expect and check the inertial navigation system 
to make sure it is tracking with ground navigation aids 
the plane leaves the california coast north of san francisco and 
passes over the aleutian islands from then on the flight is 
routine the crew makes regular position checks watches the 
navigational instruments listens to an emergency frequency chats 
with other planes and eats crew meals are better than coach but 
not as fancy as first class 
as plane approaches tokyo about 10 hours after takeoff there 
are more checklists and instructions from air traffic controllers 
you have to screw up your level of concentration because 
insidiously you often are not aware of your fatigue the captain 
says 
248 pm tokyo time following day plane lands at narita 
international airport pilots cockpit time between leaving the 
terminal in los angeles and parking in tokyo block to block as 
they say is 11 hours and 33 minutes 
the crew is on duty for 30 minutes more finishing up paper 
work they clear customs and immigration and are picked up by a bus 
for the 15minute ride to a hotel 
the captain stays up a couple of hours more having dinner 
reading and unwinding he finally goes to sleep at 8 pm which is 
5 am los angeles time he sleeps five or six hours wakes up well 
before dawn he has breakfast reads and exercises at noon he 
tries unsuccessfully to sleep again 
5 pm bus picks up crew for 630 departure for seattle 
before this tour is over the pilot flies back to tokyo via 
anchorage alaska then returns to los angeles when he gets home 
he sleeps 13 hours straight 
such schedules are relatively common and uniformly grueling 
the problem say officials is that to schedule the 18500 daily 
flights to get people where they want when they want to remain 
competitive and costeffective some pilots must fly through the 
night across multiple time zones then come back eight hours later 
and do it again 
typically each airline presents its monthly flights to both 
human schedulers and computers programmed to consider the vagaries 
of economics fuel consumption regulations contracts and human 
and equipment limits 
men and machines come up with possibilities that are 
doublechecked 
we take a look at it based on the safety issues said george 
hof head of flight operations at american airlines the 
computer in optimizing the costs in crewing the series of flights 
will take a look at the duty time available and cram a lot of 
flying into that 
once approved the crew lists are put up for bid the pilots bid 
for schedules based on their desirability and hourly pay rate 
those who fly the bigger faster planes get paid more pilot wages 
range from about 70000 a year to a top of 160000 
according to the airline pilots association the average pilot 
is in the cockpit about 80 hours a month and spends another 80 
hours on duty preparing for flights or waiting for passengers to 
load and unload 
this total of 160 hours is crammed into an average of 16 days a 
month 
management and pilots agree there is little way to avoid some of 
the overnight multiple time zone schedules that test pilots 
endurance 
youre not going to work it all out said dick stone a 
delta captain and chairman of the pilots unions human performance 
committee we work silly hours and thats just the way the 
business is

with youngsters back in school satiated by the 
usual overflow of mindless summer entertainment the fall movie 
season traditionally turns to more adult fare particularly high 
caliber dramas destined for academy award consideration 
this season social comment which has not been in strong supply 
in recent years makes a return to the screen with such subjects as 
armed hate groups infanticide political protest fugitives as 
well as another look at the vietnam war 
already playing in the nations theaters is betrayed a 
drama starring debra winger and tom berenger about the rightwing 
underground in the midwest 
at the other end of the political spectrum is sidney lumets 
running on empty with christine lahti judd hirsch and river 
phoenix the movie concerns a family of 1960s radicals who have 
been living underground and on the run for 15 years 
bat 21 with gene hackman and danny glover takes another 
hard look at the vietnam war 
the american movies of the 1930s and 1940s made a big impact 
on me because of their social content says costagavras the 
greekfrench director of betrayed and other political films 
including z and missing 
when i first saw the grapes of wrath it made an indelible 
impression on me i deplore the fact that hollywood retreated into 
a dream world in the last few decades but i see hope for the 
future there are too many young and talented filmmakers who want 
to comment on the worlds ills 
social commentary wont be the only significance of the autumnal 
movie season following a record summer at the nations box 
offices hollywood anticipates a rousing fourthquarter finish to 
what may be its biggest boxoffice year 
no drought at the box office bannered the trade paper 
variety in predicting a record 165billion theater gross for the 
summer with crocodile dundee ii coming to america and 
who framed roger rabbit breaking the 100 million barrier and 
big well on its way chances are good that 1988 will top last 
years 425 billion 
the 22week hollywood writers strike apparently will not affect 
the supply of films to the worlds theaters 
there is an abundant supply of product said herb steinberg 
spokesman for the alliance of motion picture and television 
producers the christmas pictures are in the can and films now 
in production will carry into next year and there are plenty of 
scripts ready to be filmed 
cheryl rhoden of the writers guild of america acknowledged that 
the strike slowed some projects down but she said the effects 
of the walkout on theatrical production are harder to measure than 
television where the fall season was decimated 
fall moviegoers may notice a few more rough edges than usual 
because the numerous script revisions normally made in the course 
of theatrical filming were not permitted during the lengthy walkout

free of the colonial yoke for three decades the

many north africans fought for still eludes them but now the five 
are seeking solutions in unity

soaring 300 feet into the air on the 
heights overlooking algiers is a monument to the heroes of the 
national liberation struggle the three intertwining concrete 
leaves are of polish design and canadian execution 
in neighboring morocco a french engineering company is building 
the worlds largest mosque 
in tunisia a dutch company is draining the evilsmelling lake 
between the capital and its wealthy suburbs 
in mauritania french engineers operate the iron mines and the 
railroad providing the countrys main source of income 
in libya foreigners operate the oil fields and work at many 
other jobs in the country 
the first three decades of independence have left a vague legacy 
of disappointment in the five north african arab countries known as 
the maghreb the arab west and a reliance on foreigners to 
do the important work remains widespread 
no one dares question the wisdom of going it alone that would 
put in doubt the very core of their existence but citizens in the 
five maghreb countries are asking themselves whether their leaders 
have gone the right way about getting the most out of their 
sovereignty 
this public discussion has provided the context for the current 
debate on unity 
not one of the five countries can be described as democratic 
with the exception of morocco none has had a genuinely free 
election since the end of what was mainly french colonial rule 
algeria which became known as the democratic peoples republic 
after winning its independence war against the french in 1962 is 
still recovering from the 13year dictatorship of col houari 
boumedienne who died in 1978 his successor chadli bendjedid is 
trying to remove the old guard without rocking the boat 
tunisia shook off the 32year dictatorship of its president 
for life habib bourguiba removed from office on grounds of 
senility in 1987 only to fall into a more moderate form of 
autocratic rule under zine el abidine ben ali 
morocco has a limited form of democracy but king hassan ii is 
the supreme arbiter of all political events no one rules but the 
king 
libya is known as the jamahiriya or republic col moammar 
gadhafi is its heavensent ruler and no one dares oppose him 
mauritania has plunged from one military coup into another 
with such a legacy it is surprising that the maghreb countries

the gesture failed and tunisia today is as religiousminded as

descent from the prophet mohammed islamic fundamentalism is on the

in algeria the authorities tried to meet this revivalism with a

with the 19th century collapse of the turkish empire most of 
the maghreb became a french preserve only libya then a gathering 
of impoverished tribes fell to italy 
the discovery of major oil deposits throughout the region made 
all the difference 
morocco alone had no oil but it did have massive deposits of 
phosphates the natural chemical needed for fertilizers morocco 
has nearly onefourth of all the worlds known deposits of 
phosphates without counting the western sahara 
this former spanish colony which continues the moroccan 
coastline 1600 miles to the southwest was intended mainly as an 
outer defense for the canary islands most of it was left as a 
wilderness under moroccan pressure spain abandoned the territory 
in 1975 and it ultimately fell to morocco 
for the past 13 years a forgotten war has raged between the 
moroccan army and the algerianbacked polisario movement seeking 
independence for the western sahara but the guerrillas have made 
little headway 
the moroccans assembled superior firepower and a 1500mile wall 
that barred access to the territory the guerrillas proved unable 
to breach the wall in strength or to prevent its extension 
mauritania which at first joined with morocco in suppressing 
the guerrillas and then flipped to the opposite side ended up on 
neither side 
as a result of these moves the polisario was gradually 
eliminated from the struggle king hassan accepted a un proposal 
for a controlled international referendum to settle the territorys 
future unless the polisario finds some way to block it the 
referendum is likely to take place some time in 1989 it is 
generally expected to lead to a moroccan victory 
in his vigorous campaign for the moroccan cause hassan forged a 
treaty of union with libya the treaty stopped libyan support to 
the polisario but it seriously upset moroccos american friends 
when the polisario had been defeated the treaty was no longer 
needed and hassan used the first pretext to cancel it 
meanwhile gadhafi made a series of illfated attempts to merge 
with his neighbors they all ended in failure everyone likes 
gadhafis money but no one wants to be seen selling his 
independence to the highest bidder 
at the same time the north african leaders bowed to widespread 
public pressure and began a serious attempt to find some kind of 
unity the five met in algiers in june and agreed to work toward a 
north african confederation 
tunisia and libya hurriedly restored the diplomatic relations 
they had broken over libyas expulsion of more than 30000 tunisian 
workers three years earlier algeria and morocco agreed to ignore 
polisario protests and did likewise 
hassan arrived in algiers in a chartered car ferry and when 
bendjedid came to meet him the two men fell into each others 
arms all present felt they saw history in the making 
gadhafi again was the odd man out he played the clown walking 
up and down on the terrace outside the meeting room declaring the 
summit was a gathering of hasbeens 
it took all the diplomatic skill of president ben ali of tunisia 
and secretarygeneral chedli klibi of the arab league to persuade 
gadhafi to join the meeting 
ultimately they worked out a plan for a greater maghreb 
confederation it is only on paper so far and all the real work 
remains to be done 
but hassan had learned at firsthand about the advantages of the 
european economic community which turned down moroccos request to 
join he is a fervent advocate of creating a similar community in 
north africa his arguments won the day 
the summit instructed the bureaucrats to work out the details 
it remains to be seen how far they will succeed

the forgotten war that has been raging 
across the barren wilderness of northwestern africa may soon draw 
to a close as the two sides morocco and the marxist polisario 
front are forced into a compromise over the territory of western 
sahara 
the framework for the compromise is likely to be suggested by 
the united nations it could be a long way from the extreme demands 
made by the polisario front 
the main reason for the change will be the algerian governments 
disillusionment with the polisario fighters whose 13 years of 
guerrilla war has not brought them control of a single saharan city 
a referendum is to determine the wishes of the original 
inhabitants of the disputed territory whether they now are in the 
moroccanheld cities or in the polisariorun camps in algeria 
everything lies in the question to be put in the referendum 
will the estimated 100000 inhabitants and their adult children be 
asked simply whether they want independence or will they be asked 
to endorse the polisario as their sole legitimate 
representative 
endorsement of the polisario would give the guerrilla movement 
the right to determine the territorys future even if trson i feel a

the securities and exchange commissions 
longawaited civil suit against junk bond pioneer drexel burnham 
lambert inc has had little effect on the market for the 
highyield highrisk securities 
late thursday junk bond prices in the secondary market were 
little changed from wednesday many analysts predicted few future 
price fluctuations would result from the suit filed by the 
securities and exchange commission 
i think it was anticipated that this suit was going to take 
place and when it actually happened it was a bit of a 
nonevent said anthony naylor a corporate bond analyst at the 
securities firm rodman amp renshaw inc the federal civil complaint 
filed wednesday charged drexel its junkbond chief michael 
milken and others with securities violations ranging from insider 
trading to falsifying records as part of a secret arrangement with 
former speculator ivan f boesky 
the government acknowledged more than a year ago that it was 
investigating drexel and its junk bond operations which have been 
used to finance some of the biggest corporate takeovers of the 
1980s the probe began after boesky was charged in the nations 
biggest insidertrading scheme 
there also has been widespread speculation that the us 
attorneys office which is conducting a parallel investigation of 
drexel would file criminal charges perhaps as early as next month 
its unlikely those chrages would have any effect on the 
market said marshall b front a partner at the stein roe amp 
farnham which manages a 100 million junk bond mutual fund none 
of my clients have expressed any concern 
milken pioneered the use of junk securities in the late 1970s as 
a way of providing capital to a vast majority of companies that 
otherwise had limited access to public bond markets because their 
credit ratings were too low 
the only way of raising money for many of those companies had 
been through stock sales or loans from banks and insurance 
companies which generally carried numerous restrictions and higher 
interest rates 
junk bonds generally pay about four percentage points higher 
interest than comparable us treasury securities essentially 
giving investors a higher return to compensate for the higher risk 
of default 
the bonds have since become a staple for many small and 
mediumsize companies looking for financing and for institutional 
investors such as pension funds and savings associations seeking 
income 
junk bonds also have been a major financing weapon for corporate 
raiders seeking to raise millions or billions of dollars for 
hostile takeovers 
the lucrative market initially was almost solely dominated by 
drexel but in recent years attracted a host of more traditional 
wall street firms drexels market share has eroded to about 50 
percent of the 17 billion in underwritings so far in 1988 
the market has grown so large it transcends the act of any 
individual brokerage firm or underwriter said robert waill a 
managing director at the securities firm lf rothschild amp co 
thats why the sec charges against drexel are having no effect 
on the market 
still some bond analysts said the drexel charges might prompt 
some companies to put off future issues until the market has time 
to digest the consequences of the suit about 20 deals valued at 
between 6 billion and 8 billion could be affected estimated 
gene wong a managing director for prudentialbache securities inc 
wong said drexelunderwritten issues of highly leveraged 
volatile companies might also be hurt

drexel burnham lambert inc is getting support 
from wickes cos inc a californiabased company that the 
government says was a victim of insider trading by drexel 
wickes said thursday it did not expect civil insider trading and 
fraud charges against drexel to have any effect on a proposed 
leveraged buyout that depends 423 million in financing through an 
issue of junk bonds by drexel 
the securities and exchange commission charged wednesday that 
drexel acted behind wickes back in 1986 while wickes was trying 
unsuccessfully to take over national gypsum co the charge was part 
of a broader civil suit brought by the sec accusing drexel and 
others of numerous securities frauds 
obviously if the charges are ultimately proven this would be 
distressing said wickes spokesman michael sitrick 
however based on our current knowledge of the situation we 
would not anticipate that the filing of this complaint will have 
any negative impact on our relationship with drexel or any of its 
people with whom we work sitrick said 
wickes a buildingsupplies retailing company based in santa 
monica calif on aug 21 announced plans for a managementled 
buyout that values the company at about 600 million 
drexel is the dealermanager and investment banker on the 
transaction which is being held open until oct 20 while bear 
stearns amp co searches for bidders that might be willing to offer 
more than the managementled group 
the sec charged that drexel michael milken who is head of its 
junkbond business and his brother lowell milken secretly used the 
organization of speculator ivan boesky to improperly sell wickes 
common stock for drexels benefit 
the government also alleged that drexel michael milken and 
milken associate cary maultasch used boeskys organization to buy 
stock in national gypsum in breach of fiduciary duties owed 
to wickes 
drexel made about 67 million off the illicit purchases while 
being paid about 1 million for its services by wickes the sec 
said 
even though wickes bid for national gypsum failed the episode 
was not a loss because wickes came away with a profit of 3 million 
after selling its shares back at a higher price than it paid for 
them 
maxxam industries inc of los angeles which the sec said also 
was cheated by drexel declined comment thursday on the 
allegations the sec said drexel used the boesky organization to 
buy for drexel the stock of pacific lumber co which was the 
target of a maxxam tender offer in 1985 
the complaint says drexel received more than 22 million in fees 
from maxxam for services rendered in connection with its 
acquisition of pacific lumber 
drexel was supported wednesday by triangle industries inc 
which has floated about 18 billion in junk bonds through drexel 
for various deals over the past five years 
drexels dealings with triangle were not named in the sec 
complaint 
were standing behind drexel at this point certainly we do 
not intend to stop doing business with a firm on the basis of an 
sec complaint especially one weve had such a long and fruitful 
relationship with said triangle spokesman mark dorsett

a proposed law to further limit imports of 
textiles apparel and shoes also will lead to increased costs and 
tighter supplies for the nations retailers and higher prices for 
consumers storeowners say 
the bill now before the senate opens up a lot of problems 
said david jackson a spokesman for the apparel retailer gap inc 
under the bill this years textile and apparel imports would be 
frozen at 1987 levels and growth would be limited to 1 percent 
annually in succeeding years 
that would create what the retail industry calls sourcing 
problems stores will have a harder time obtaining merchandise 
it opens up a whole parade of horribles for us said jackson 
rob longendyke a spokesman for spiegel inc the catalog 
retailer that also owns the apparel retailers eddie bauer and 
honeybee agreed the first effect would be to send us and other 
companies scrambling to find what sources we can onshore that can 
produce the merchandise we need 
the infrastructure for the textile industry does not exist in 
this country anymore longendyke said but there are some small 
resources and the first thing that would happen is everyone would 
go scrambling after those small resources 
in some cases the consumer says he wants a particular kind of 
sweater weave or fabric but we may not be able to find any kind 
of sources to supply them jackson said 
consumers may find some garments which now are heavily 
imported hard to find and much more expensive retailers said the 
cost of many other apparel items likewise would be affected if the 
bill passed and was signed into law by president reagan 
the bill most definitely will have a serious effect on prices 
both in wholesale costs of goods as well as the retail price 
said jackson 
higher prices would put retailers between a rock and a hard 
place industry watchers say one reason for sluggish apparel sales 
has been sticker shock consumer rebellion against higher 
clothing prices 
some manufacturers and stores already have absorbed some of the 
higher costs for clothes but would be unable to do so if the bill 
became law 
retailers could hold the line on prices longendyke said but it 
would mean compromising on quality for example retailers could 
use more domestic wool rather than australian wool which is 
considered the highest quality he said 
wall street analysts differed over how much of an impact the 
bill might have imports to some extent already have been slowed in 
recent years by the rise of the dollar which makes them more 
expensive 
it would probably drive up prices to some extent said 
eileen gormley an analyst who follows the textile and apparel 
industries for thomson mckinnon securities inc she said some 
clothing categories would be affected more than others 
jay meltzer an analyst at goldman sachs amp co doubted the bill 
would have a major effect on the apparel industry 
imports are down this year vs a year ago to date and will 
surely be down for the year he said theres really not much 
indication that theyre going to go soaring next year so a 1 
percentayear growth limit would have no effect on present 
conditions for some time 
meltzer predicted the competitiveness of the apparel industry 
would keep prices in line 
some retailers already have taken steps that would blunt the 
impact of the bills enactment 
we have been busily going about trying to develop textile 
resources onshore said longendyke 
whether the bill ever will become law is uncertain reagan 
vetoed a similar measure three years ago and the administration is 
suggesting the same fate may await the latest version 
us textile and apparel manufacturers have sought import limits 
since a wave of asian textile and apparel imports jolted the 
industry in the early 1980s 
the companies and labor unions say restrictions are needed to 
salvage jobs in an industry whose existence they claim is 
threatened by foreign competition 
retailers say the apparel industry does not need the bill 
al dietzel a spokesman for the apparel retailer limited inc 
said the textile and apparel industry probably has the highest 
rate of employment and they are working at the highest level of 
capacity of any industry in the us

oldsmobile is setting its marketing 
sights on younger consumers for the coming automobile model year 
with an advertising campaign saying this is not your fathers 
oldsmobile 
the general motors corp division introduced its 1989 cars at a 
news conference thursday with executives constantly pointing to 
the 35 to 45yearold consumer as being in the bulls eye of olds 
marketing target 
in the past said warren christell oldsmobiles general 
marketing manager the average oldsmobile buyer has been about 50 
years old 
to introduce the 89 models to the public oldsmobile on 
thursday previewed a series of television ads to begin running 
during the summer olympics which begin next week in seoul south 
korea 
among the people in the advertisements are deborah moore and her 
father actor roger moore of james bond movie fame melanie shatner 
and her father william shatner who starred in the original star 
trek television series and motion pictures and jay carpenter 
son of former astronaut scott carpenter 
in each of the ads a narrator says this is not your fathers 
oldsmobile 
we want young and old alike to identify with oldsmbile said 
oldsmobile general manager williams lane 
we think our products are ahead of our image christell 
said we havent done a good job of telling people about it 
we think our advertising campaigns were on target for 
strategy but were werent communicating with the consumer 
along with expanding the target market for 1989 oldsmobile 
executives stressed the companys focus on new design and advanced 
technology 
one of the technical innovations to be introduced in a limited 
number of 1989 models later in the model year is a head up 
display which projects a digital speedometer turn signal 
indicators lowfuel warning and highbeam indicator onto the 
windshield a driver does not have to look away from the road to 
get the information 
olds executives said the display system would be offered as an 
option on some 1989 cutlass supremes 
however larry lyons general engineering and planning manager 
said the company doesnt plan to expand the system quickly into 
other cars 
we are purposely going slow on that he said 
another new bit of electronics coming out with some of the 89 
oldsmobiles is a color television screen in the dashboard which 
will display a variety of functions such as heating and stereo 
controls and a compass 
that device will be available as an option in toronados and 
trofeos

thirtyeight prospective jurors have been 
selected in a giant fraud lawsuit over the default on bonds sold to 
build two washington public power supply system nuclear power 
plants 
us district judge william browning said he expected to have a 
full panel of 20 jurors by the end of today 
meanwhile four small utilities were being sidelined thursday in 
an effort to ease confusion in the complicated case 
browning questioned jurors en masse before trimming the number 
to 38 thursday with time off early next week for a jewish holiday 
and primary elections opening arguments were expected on wednesday 
and thursday 
dismissal of a couple of jurors indicated how farreaching the 
washington public power supply fraud case is one woman was let go 
because she said her husbands retirement fund might include supply 
system bonds 
the civil case one of the largest in the history of american 
law revolves around the default in 1983 by wppss on 225 billion 
on bonds sold to finance construction on two nuclear power plants 
in washington state 
settlements have removed most of the original 100plus 
defendants sued by bond buyers and plaintiff attorneys on thursday 
said four small utilities were being removed in a tableclearing 
move that will make the trial easier to understand for jurors 
attorney mel weiss of new york an attorney for class action 
plaintiffs said the four utilities are central oregon cooprative 
in oregon and steilacoom municipal alder mutual and mason public 
utility district no 1 of washington formal announcement was 
expected early next week 
weiss said agreements included a settlement with the 
15000customer central oregon utility the other three with just 
6000 customers among them were severed from the lawsuit with 
agreement of the plaintiff attorneys 
removal of the four leaves 17 utilities among defendants and 
all 17 are members of the wppss board of directors 
six other members of the wppss board including seattle city 
light have already settled with plaintiff bondholders and class 
action plaintiffs 
generally it has cost wppss board members more to settle than 
the nonwppss members that were among the 88 utilities contracting 
with the supply system to build the two nuclear plants however 
insurance money accounted for much of the settlements made by the 
six wppss members off the hook in the lawsuit the remaining 17 
reportedly have little insurance money available and they had 
contracted for about twothirds of the output of the two nuclear 
power plants 
weiss said leaving just wppss member utilities at the 
defendants table would be less confusing to jurors while the 
steilacoom alder and mason utilities were severed from the case 
it did not remove them as defendants and they presumably still 
could face legal action by plaintiffs or could figure in a 
settlement 
other defendants include the construction engineering firms of 
united engineers and ebasco and the financial advisory firm blyth 
eastman 
while warning that trial could last for several months 
judge william browning told jurors he would do what he could to 
accommodate those selected as jurors including maximum payment of 
35 per day parking assignments and accommodations in town for 
people from beyond the metropolitan area 
the trial had originally been expected to take eight months to 
two years but settlements have cut that time to one year at most 
browning told jurors they would serve monday through thursday 
most weeks but because they might have to work an occasional 
friday he would pay them for five days a week 
he also said the government would pay as much as 72 a day for 
jurors outside the tucson area who would have to move to town for 
the duration of trial 
though 20 will be selected for trial only some of those will be 
called upon to render a verdict a minimum of six is required in a 
federal civil suit browning also said court would not be held for 
most of the month of december and for a month next summer if the 
trial is still in session

wholesale price inflation rose 06 percent in august a rate 
that would amount to 69 percent if it continued for 12 straight 
months the government said today 
energy prices rose at their steepest clip since april 22 
percent but food costs posted a moderate 04 percent rise in spite 
of the drought 
the august figures confirmed that inflation is running well 
ahead of 1987s pace when wholesale prices rose 22 percent 
there was a sign of business confidence on thursday when the 
government said us companies plan to increase their spending on 
plant and equipment by 116 percent this year compared to 1987 
the commerce department said thursday that a survey indicated 
businesses plan to spend 4294 billion after adjusting for 
inflation topping the previous high of 3916 billion set in 1985 
elsewhere activity was quiet thursday in the financial markets 
stock prices were little changed with the dow jones average of 
30 industrials slipped 267 to 206312 bond prices and the dollar 
rose slightly the 116 percent capital spending increase over the 
1987 spending total if realized would mark the biggest percentage 
jump since a 166 percent rise in 1984 when american industry was 
still recovering from the steep 198182 recession 
capital spending is the main driving force in the economy at 
the present time and there are no signs that it is going to ease 
off said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
so far this year business spending on plant and equipment and a 
boom in export sales have accounted for almost threefourths of 
total economic growth 
the two developments are closely related as american 
manufacturers have rushed to expand production facilities in an 
effort to meet growing overseas demand for their goods 
sinai estimated onethird of us industry is operating at full 
capacity providing a strong incentive to boost investment 
overall american industry is operating at 835 percent of 
capacity the highest rate in eight years 
the high operating rates have led to concerns that the economy 
is beginning to push against capacity constraints and tight labor 
markets resulting in rising inflationary pressures

a case of mistaken identity spurred a 2 million 
run on a chinatown thrift 
hundreds of customers most of them chinese lined up thursday 
at elmhurst federal savings and loan association to withdraw money 
after confusing the thrift with a financially troubled bank in the 
suburb of elmhurst 
the assets of that institution united security bank inc were 
frozen by a judge last week after a business customer reported 
receiving a 18 million loan in the form of a check that bounced 
the bank was not properly licensed the state said 
the headline was elmhurst bank fails said david g 
plummer president of elmhurst federal savings and loan 
association i think many of our customers dont even know 
theres a town named elmhurst 
despite a sign in the thrifts window explaining the difference 
in chinese customers werent taking any chances and about 300 
showed up thursday to withdraw their money plummer said 
withdrawals for the week totaled nearly 2 million by the end of 
the day he said although he did not expect the run to threaten 
his institution 
this is a 35 million branch were one of the strongest 
savings and loans in the nation he said if we lost 3 
million thats no problem 
plummer said he believed the worst was over thursday because 
community leaders were working to get the word out talking with 
customers in the thrifts lobby and through a local chinese 
newspaper 
i understand that they say this one is not in trouble but 
its better to be safe said tom moy 34 a depositor who stood 
in line for an hour before getting in the door thursday 
barry yee translated to the crowd outside trying to explain the 
mixup 
my parents told me that in china banks were not insured and 
when one closed you just lost your money he said thats what 
they believe is happening here today they just believe in old

the white house is studying a possible veto of 
legislation that would bar the reagan administration from any 
lastminute oil lease sales in portions of the pacific and atlantic 
oceans and the gulf of mexico an official said today 
we are still considering our position said barbara clay a 
spokeswoman for the white house office of management and budget 
we are carefully reviewing the legislation 
the proposed prohibitions opposed by the administration are 
contained in the fiscal 1989 spending bill for the interior 
department us forest service and some energy department research 
programs 
the 99 billion appropriations package is heading toward the 
presidents desk following its approval by congress on thursday 
the senate passed it by voice vote the house endorsed it on a 
35945 roll call 
the margin of approval in the house indicates the legislation 
has sufficient support to ensure its backers could win a 
vetooverride vote 
the bill would continue through september 1989 a ban on 
interior department sales of oil leases off the coasts of northern 
california and massachusetts and reinstitute a drilling ban for the 
waters off southwestern florida 
this would stop the administration from holding lease sales for 
these areas during its final months in office both presidential 
candidates republican george bush and democrat michael dukakis 
have said they oppose petroleum development in sensitive offshore 
waters 
dropped from the compromise package was a house provision also 
drawing fire from the administration that sought to require at 
least 50 percent us labor and materials for petroleum facilities 
along the outer continental shelf 
the spending bill which contains no major new programs would 
provide 190 million for the energy departments cleancoal 
research efforts in fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 
this is 335 million less than the administration said it needed 
to fulfil president reagans pledge to canada to spend 25 billion 
over five years in a search for ways to curb us emissions of 
pollutants that cause acid rain 
in a letter to lawmakers last month james c miller iii 
director of the white house office of management and budget cited 
the refusal of congress to commit 525 million to the cleancoal 
program in fiscal 1989 as another reason the bill might be vetoed 
since then however administration officials and congressional 
leaders have discussed their differences and may be near an 
agreement that could make the partial funding acceptable to the 
white house according to an administration source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
miller also has objected to giving states more than 150 million 
for energy conservation programs which he said should not be 
federally financed his letter also complained about putting more 
than 60 million into indian health facilities when existing 
facilities have a 50 percent vacancy rate 
the bill calls for the national park service to receive 1 
billion in fiscal 1989 some 280 million more than reagan proposed 
in his budget and about 100 million higher than fiscal 1988 
the us forest service would receive 184 billion in fiscal 
1989 an increase of about 625 million over the current level and 
about 230 million more than the administration requested 
the bill sets a goal of selling 1145 billion board feet of 
lumber from public forests 198 million more board feet than the 
administration proposed roadbuilding money would total about 176 
million down some 20 million from fiscal 1988

wholesale prices rose a brisk 06 percent in 
august as energy prices rose at their steepest clip since april but 
food costs posted only moderate gains the government said today 
if the august increase held for 12 straight months inflation at 
the wholesale level would amount to 69 percent more than triple 
the 22 percent 1987 price rise 
food prices one step short of the retail level were up a 
moderate 04 percent the same as in july and another indication 
that the effects of the drought are moderating after steep rises in 
may and june 
energy prices rose a sharp 22 percent with gasoline costs up 
38 percent natural gas prices rose 36 percent as heating oil 
costs fell 02 percent 
for the first eight months of 1988 the labor departments 
producer price index for finished goods was up 43 percent 
calculated on an annual basis and adjusted for normal seasonal 
variations 
although the overall august rise was the steepest gain since an 
identical 06 percent leap in march there were some optimistic 
signs in last months report 
passenger car prices which had risen steeply early in the 
summer were up a moderate 03 percent last month 
clothing costs after soaring earlier in the year were down 04 
percent for men and boys and up a slight 01 percent for women and 
children 
among food costs a sharp 126 percent rise for eggs and a 96 
price gain for vegetables were offset by a 64 percent drop in 
fruit prices and by declines for rice chicken and beef 
analyst donald ratajczak of georgia state university said fruit 
trees stressed by the summer heat had produced their fruit early 
as for meats the 06 percent dip in beef prices was more 
moderate than the 25 percent july decline as pastures began to 
recover from the drought and farmers sent fewer animals to 
slaughter 
analysts expect meat prices to rise through the winter because 
droughtinduced summer slaughtering will produce shortages in the 
coming months 
ratajczak said a shortage of unleaded gasoline at the peak of 
the summer vacation season contributed to the energy price rise 
weve had a very strong driving season and heavy demand for 
gasoline we expect that to fall off as soon as the driving 
season ends which traditionally is after labor day he said 
however he warned that natural gas prices will continue rising 
as the weather turns colder 
analysts however expect energy prices to level off as crude 
oil prices have recently fallen anticipating production increases 
resulting from the cease fire between iran and iraq 
excluding the volatile food and energy categories wholesale 
prices rose a moderate 03 percent in august after an increase 
double that in july 
because food and energy costs fluctuate widely from month to 
month most analysts look to prices for other goods as a better 
indication of underlying inflation 
ratajczak said the july increase in nonfood and energy items 
was likely an aberration caused by what he called the catalog 
effect producers adjusting their price lists at midyear 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
fluctuations of this size are commonly observed we still believe 
inflation is under control 
wholesale prices for intermediate goods provided another 
optimistic sign rising only 04 percent their smallest gain since 
february raw material prices were up a sharp 11 percent but had 
fallen by a like percentage in july 
the producer price index measures prices at three levels of 
production crude or unprocessed such as wheat or cotton 
intermediate flour or cloth and finished bread and clothing 
the august increase for finished goods overall put the index at 
1088 meaning that a variety of goods costing 100 at wholesale in 
1982 would havecost 10880 last month that compares with a 
10850 in july and 10590 in august 1987 
unlike the monthtomonth percentage changes the index numbers 
are not adjusted for seasonal variations 
price changes at the retail level usually lag one to three 
months behind those at the finishedgoods level monthly consumer 
price inflation has averaged 45 percent on an annual basis this 
year august figures for consumer prices are to be released sept

now that the securities and exchange commission 
formally has accused drexel burnham lambert inc of extensive 
fraud seasoned attorneys for the wall street giant are eager to 
get hold of the evidence and face sec adversaries who are largely 
inexperienced at trial work 
were going to press ahead one of the people familiar with 
drexels legal strategy said thursday as the nations fifthlargest 
securities firm moved quickly to begin preparing its defense 
against the secs civil charges 
the wall street journal reported today that the manhattan us 
attorneys office which has been conducting a parallel probe of 
drexel had issued target letters to the firms junkbond chief 
michael milken and at least four others indicating they will seek 
criminal indictments of them soon 
the newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying the letters 
were issued when the sec filed its civil charges in manhattan 
federal court against drexel milken and others late wednesday 
attorneys for milken and the other prospective defendants declined 
comment as did the us attorneys office 
lawyers watching from the sidelines said the secdrexel 
confrontation probably would be the decades biggest securities law 
story and they expected the securities firm to scrap it out in 
court 
its hard to say they welcome the suit but i suspect they 
welcome the opportunity to fight out in the open as opposed to 
dealing with innuendos said sam scott miller a new york 
securities attorney 
others said drexel attorneys likely would aggressively request 
information from the sec in the pretrial factgathering process 
known as discovery under civillaw procedures the sec must comply 
with many of these requests 
some lawyers familiar with the secs enforcement strategies said 
drexel now enjoys a significant advantage because it had reserved 
tens of millions of dollars for a legal brawl and retained talented 
attorneys to face a budgetstrapped federal agency with seasoned 
investigators but rookie trial lawyers 
the commission is superb at conducting investigations but 
once it moves into the litigation arena it doesnt have the same 
strengths said one former sec attorney now in private practice 
who agreed to discuss the matter only if not quoted by name 
this is going to be a scorched earth defense you press them 
as hard as you can the attorney said you come out with 
discovery press them with all kinds of document requests and a 
more detailed articulation of the charges that will keep them on 
the defensive 
representing drexel is a battery of attorneys that includes the 
new york firm of cahill gordon and reindel which has a highly 
skilled litigation staff drexel junk bond chief michael 
milken another key defendant has retained a legal defense force 
that includes paul weiss rifkind wharton amp garrison another 
highpowered new york firm 
nevertheless the drexelsec court battle could be weeks and 
even months away largely because the case may stall until the us 
attorneys office finishes a criminal investigation of the firm 
manhattan us attorney rudolph w giuliani known to have 
impaneled a grand jury inquiry of drexel could intervene to halt 
the civil discovery process if he believes it would compromise his 
effort 
although there has been widespread speculation that the criminal 
probe may be completed over the next several weeks federal 
prosecutors persistently have declined to confirm or deny it 
the people familiar with drexels strategy said senior 
executives already had acted to calm staffers nervous about the 
scope and seriousness of the secs civil charges 
they contended the charges contained no surprises and appeared 
to mirror what drexels lawyers anticipated after the sec disclosed 
to the firm in late may that it had authorized an enforcement 
action 
at the same time these people said drexels attorneys had 
started preparing documents to demand the secs evidence they said 
a conference of both sides was expected soon before us district 
judge milton pollack who was assigned the case 
the sec charged in a 184page complaint filed wednesday in 
manhattan federal court that from 1984 to 1986 drexel secretly 
schemed with nowimprisoned speculator ivan f boesky to cheat the 
firms clients trade illegally on inside information manipulate 
stocks lie to the government and falsify records 
the enforcement agency depicted drexel and key employees as 
systematically having violated a range of securities laws involving 
some of the biggest takeover deals of the decade in which drexel 
often played a role as financier the defendants have denied 
wrongdoing and predicted vindication

venezuela and algeria have called 
for a special meeting of opecs pricemonitoring committee to help 
stem the decline in oil prices a saudi arabian newspaper reported 
friday 
the newspaper alsharq bali quoted unnamed highlevel arab oil 
sources as saying the two opec member nations proposed a meeting 
for sept 21 in bali indonesia 
some oil futures prices meanwhile moved slightly higher 
following the report on the new york mercantile exchange october 
contracts for west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude 
rose 5 cents to 1453 per 14gallon barrel 
the saudi newspaper said a moderate member of the 
fivemember pricing committee was opposed to holding a special 
meeting saying it expected world oil prices to improve as winter 
approaches 
the unidentified member also was opposed the newspaper said 
because the pricing committee would have to call for an emergency 
full session of the 13nation cartel and a regular meeting already 
was set for nov 21 in vienna 
besides venezuela and algeria the other members of the opec 
pricing committee are the oil ministers of saudi arabia nigeria

an estimted 26000 rail employees went on strike 
today against the chicago amp north western railroad in a dispute 
over the companys move to eliminate the jobs of more than 1000 
union brakemen 
the orchestrated walkout began at 9 am cdt as agreed thursday 
between the company and members of the united transportation union 
to avoid snarling thousands of chicagoarea commuters who ride campnw 
trains from the suburbs 
but the fate of the evening rush hour remained in the hands of 
congress where the house was scheduled to consider a version of a 
senate bill passed thursday that would impose a settlement between 
the utu and railroad 
it is scheduled to be the first thing up it will be rushed 
to the president the president should sign it within an hour or 
so said sen paul simon dill 
however consideration of the bill was delayed and a vote was 
not expected until the afternoon said mike bushman an aide to 
rep terry bruce dill 
campnw is a leading midwestern freight hauler and also runs 
commuter trains serving 40000 people a day in chicagos suburbs 
union members had planned to walk out at 1201 am when a 
36day coolingoff period in the dispute ran out but held off 
until 9 am after simon and bruce helped persuade the railroad to 
postpone layoffs of freight brakemen 
the bill would implement recommendations of a presidential 
emergency board and cut 689 brakemen in its 10state freight 
operations the railroad had sought to lay off 1150 the board was 
appointed by president reagan in april 
right now we know of no opposition in the house simon said 
thursday 
union representatives said thursday the dispute should be 
resolved at the bargaining table and not on capitol hill 
it would be a great injustice to the working man if they pass 
this simon law said don markgraf general chairman of the utu 
the politicians should be home getting elected instead of fooling 
around in labor disputes 
some union members threatened to stay off the job no matter what 
congress decides 
david wells a brakeman said union members planned to disperse 
within a 100mile radius of chicago and not be available to be 
called back to work today because they were angry about campnws 
handling of the dispute 
most of our people were docked pay during a brief twohour 
strike aug 4 wells said we informed our commuters that we 
didnt anticipate there would be an evening rush hour 
markgraf said he hadnt heard of such a plan and attributed it 
to rumors 
campnw officials said intervention was needed to avert a strike 
in this case collective bargaining did not work and were 
happy sen simon stepped in said leslie cleveland a railroad 
spokeswoman 
under the railway labor act congress and the president have 
authority to settle railroad disputes that threaten national 
commerce 
the railroad and the union have been battling for more than a 
year over the size of crews on campnw freight trains 
the company contends the brakemens jobs are obsolete the union 
argues the brakemen two on each trains crew are neeeded to 
maintain safety 
the utu struck campnw for about four hours aug 4 after an 
earlier coolingoff period imposed by president reagan congress 
however ended that strike quickly by imposing a second coolingoff 
period which expired today

evangelical christian books and music began facing those external 
problems after it posted net losses for the first time in 198485 
the losses were revealed in an investigation by the securities and 
exchange commission prompting lawsuits and finally a takeover 
attempt by disgruntled shareholders in 1986 
the company struck a deal with the shareholders in october 1986 
and agreed to find a buyer 
said 
and buick said selected works from harper amp rows list of about 
300 religious titles might fit zondervan bookstores most of which 
are located in shopping malls 
zondervan carries about 1500 titles including its popular 
christian romance series serenade and such best sellers as 
charles colsons kingdoms in conflict and in the past 
autobiographies by john hinckleys parents and former automaker 
john delorean 
zondervans flagship product though is its new international 
version of the bible a popular modern translation available in 
more than 30 editions 
zondervan family bookstores carry printed and recorded gospel 
music greeting cards audiocassettes on topics ranging from how to 
save a rocky marriage to cooking as well as posters and smaller 
items like key rings and note pads all with a christian message 
buick said he hopes the merger will mean the company can expand 
its retail operations by about 10 bookstores a year and acquire 
other smaller christian publishers

a nationwide shortage of rubber gloves appears 
to be easing but you wouldnt know it from talking to estella 
williams 
the obstetricsgynecology nurse at st lukesroosevelt hospital 
center isnt even using rubber gloves because they have become too 
expensive she gets vinyl ones oversized instead 
you can pull a glove on and it rips sometimes youre washing 
instruments and you find out it has a hole in it so what good is 
that she said recently 
ms williams employer says there is no hospitalwide problem 
with gloves but across the country the aids crisis has led to a 
dramatic increase in the use of gloves resulting in shortages 
high prices and the importation of millions of defective gloves 
a leap in production has alleviated the shortage somewhat in 
recent months and most forecasters say it will continue to ease as 
new factories in the united states and southeast asia gear up 
production 
but some people say the shortage could worsen again if the fear 
of aids prompts people in other countries to become as fastidious 
about covering their hands as americans have become 
if all the industries that have physical touching with people 
start to use gloves theres not enough gloves in the world 
ever said edward skonezny president of american consolidated 
products inc in santa ana calif who imports gloves and has an 
interest in promoting the idea that the shortage could worsen again 
the increased glove use stems from a new wariness about bare 
hands in a diseaseconscious society so many people are wearing 
gloves now that those who need them most doctors dentists 
nurses and the like are having trouble getting their hands in 
them 
in the united states gloves are being worn by people ranging 
from hairdressers toll station attendants and prison guards to 
foodservice workers even though the centers for disease control 
says there are no reports of aids being spread by food preparation 
the aids virus surprisingly is very difficult to transmit 
a lot of this is hysteria or paranoia or whatever you want to 
call it said chuck fallis a spokesman for the national centers 
for disease control in atlanta 
its almost a habit youre putting on gloves even when you 
dont know if youll be doing anything that would require them 
said dr robert auerbach a new york dermatologist 
when my local bartender gives me a glass of whisky with a 
glove on ill really start to get worried said ted presler 
vice president for marketing at guthrie latex inc in tucson 
ariz the us unit of malaysiabased kumpulan guthrie berhad 
so far at least glove use has not caught on overseas the way 
it has in the united states 
in britains national health service the system of socialized 
medicine workers generally do not use gloves except in the 
operating room for lab work and when coming in contact with blood 
and other body fluids 
japan has had only 90 aids cases since 1985 when the first was 
diagnosed and glove use remains low although it is growing 
rapidly an importer in osaka said demand had doubled in the last 
two years 
africa has the worlds worst aids problem but the continents 
poverty and lack of good medical care are likely to limit the use 
of gloves there 
southeast asia the world center of rubber production is a big 
winner from the boom in glove use prices have nearly tripled for 
latex the milky liquid form of rubber from which gloves are made 
and glove factories are opening by the dozens 
malaysia the worlds biggest rubber producer expects to churn 
out 2 billion gloves from 30 factories this year and aims for 4 
billion from 60 or more factories next year said dr lim sow 
ching head of the malaysian rubber research and development 
boards economic planning division 
that much production could drive prices back down nearly to 
their precrisis levels even with increasing use of gloves also 
gearing up glove production are indonesia thailand taiwan and 
china as well as the united states 
global demand is hard to estimate but malaysia estimates 
current annual demand is about 13 billion to 15 billion gloves a 
year 
some glove users have never felt the pinch of the shortage 
because they have been sheltered by usbased medical supply 
companies which kept prices down to avoid alienating customers 
the reputable manufacturers of latex medical products have not 
taken advantage of the situation at all our major concern is 
really to increase capacity said eugene freed senior vice 
president for marketing at ansellamericas of tinton falls nj 
the nations biggest maker of nonsterile exam gloves 
a lack of factories is the main cause of the glove shortage 
along with a lack of centrifuges which spin excess water out of 
raw latex latex prices although they have roughly tripled still 
account for a relatively small portion of the price of gloves 
increased condom use has not had much effect on latex prices 
because they use less of it a pound of latex makes 60 gloves but 
nearly 300 condoms 
speculators as well contributed to the shortage by buying up 
supplies and withholding latex from the market said douglas kerr 
vice president of production at national latex products co in 
ashland ohio 
kerr said he was not accusing his own suppliers of speculation 
but he believes that kind of activity drove latex prices up 
similar accusations have been made about the glove market 
they saw this as a commodity like sugar or rice they got in 
quick and they got out quick these people had money said edward 
sun vice president for marketing in the new york office of at 
general pacific international corp a trading company with 
headquarters in hong kong 
hoarding is also contributing to the shortage kerr said he 
compared it to the gasoline crisis of the early 1970s when people 
kept their tanks topped off 
prices for a box of 100 gloves rose in the spot market to 15 a 
box and some desperate doctors and dentists reportedly paid more 
than 20 a box since then prices have fallen back below 10 a box 
distributors say 
problems with the quality price and availability of gloves all 
stem from the panic over contamination and even many in the 
industry believe the fears are overblown 
i think weve created our own crisis here i can say from my 
own point of view its been a very nice crisis but i dont know 
that its helped the cause of health care any said jack bennett 
sr president of medical companies of america inc in phoenix 
ariz

the chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission said friday that his agencys sweeping stockfraud suit 
against drexel burnham lambert inc is not attack on the securities 
industry overall 
it is my opinion that the securities industry in the united 
states is essentially an honest wellrun industry chairman 
david ruder told a house subcommittee in the drexel case he said 
the sec is attempting to find those people in the industry who do 
not fit the mold of the industry itself 
ruder defended wall street when asked by rep edward j markey 
dmass chairman of the house commerce subcommittee on finance 
whether the drexel allegations reflect widespread abuse or whether 
the problem is confined to a few companies 
these allegations if true represent a blistering scalding 
commentary on the culture of wall street in the 1980s markey 
said 
in a suit filed wednesday in federal court in new york the sec 
accused drexel michael milken the firms executive vice 
president and three other drexel employees of violating securities 
laws including prohibitions against insider trading stock 
manipulation and defrauding clients 
drexel has denied the civil allegations which could lead to 
stiff fines and even to removal of the companys brokerage license 
federal prosecutors have not disclosed whether they will file 
criminal charges ruder said sec investigators have maintained a 
continuing relationship with the us attorney in new york but he 
would not elaborate 
ruder and the secs chief enforcer gary lynch said the drexel 
litigation and similar cases have stretched the agencys resources 
to the limit because of staff limitations they said the drexel 
case may force the sec to forgo other initiatives 
there is a growing tendency in the securities industry to 
challenge sec complaints rather than settle out of court ruder 
said two years ago 18 sec cases were being litigated today there 
are 60 he said 
ruder said the 160 million sec budget the reagan administration 
sought for the fiscal year starting oct 1 is the minimum for the 
commission to fulfill its responsibilities 
the commission has reached the limits of its resources in 
efficiency and now needs additional resources he said 
ruder and lynch discounted suggestions that the drexel case if 
successful could doom the junk bond industry in which drexel 
is a leader that is the term given a relatively new form of 
highrisk highyield security often used to finance corporate 
takeovers or now enterprises 
one can characterize the complaint as not involving junk 
bonds and therefore there is not any connection ruder said 
there is nothing inherent in the trading of junk bonds that 
requires one be involved in fraud or manipulation said lynch 
ruder said the sec is absolutely confident we are going to 
prevail in the drexel case and defended the fact the agency 
spent two years and documented 17 allegations before filing the 
complaint 
rep howard c nielson rutah complained that you could have 
shaken us congress nicely with only three or four allegations 
several months earlier when there was still time for this 
session of congress to act 
we have a potent array of weapons against fraud already 
ruder replied indicating no new legislation would have helped in 
the pursuit of the drexel case 
nevertheless he said he supports a bill sponsored by markey and 
others due for a house vote next week that would toughen laws 
against insider trading the profiting from access to nonpublic 
information 
an increase in sanctions in the insidertrading area will be 
helpful ruder said

window service at the nations post offices 
cut last february to save money is being restored starting 
saturday 
most post offices cut hours by about a halfday a week to help 
cope with 160 million in congressionally imposed spending cuts 
the service reductions came two months before postage rate hikes 
which took nearly a year to put into effect were instituted to 
cope with a rising deficit by the postal service 
the unexpected spending reduction came as part of overall cuts 
in government expenditures aimed at reducing the budget deficit 
even though the postal service no longer receives a taxpayer 
subsidy 
while the the postal window hours will be restored the new 
hours will not necessarily be the same as those that were in effect 
at each office before the closings were imposed officials said 
local managers were given the option to adjust hours to suit the 
needs of their communities 
for example saturday hours will not be restored in heavily 
jewish sections of new york city where little business was done on 
that day anyway because of observance of the sabbath instead 
managers will experiment with staying open later some days or 
perhaps having some sunday office hours 
in other areas instead of extending hours overall managers 
will add more clerks to handle business during peak times 
while the hours of window clerk service are returning other 
moneysaving cuts imposed in february remain in effect including 
the curtailment of sunday mailsorting and the moratorium on 
construction of new post offices 
congress meanwhile is considering bills to remove the postal 
service from the federal budget as a means to avoid similar 
service reductions in the future the window closings saved about 
40 million officials reported 
unless action is taken the postal service faces another 270 
million in spending cuts in the 1989 fiscal year that starts oct 1 
that will not mean that hours will be cut again however 
postal managers say they have found ways to cut spending 
although at the cost of slower service by such things as 
switching some mail from airplanes to trucks changing trucking 
schedules reducing management travel and training expenditures and 
cutting research and development 
the postal service expects to finish the current fiscal year 
with a deficit of between 500 and 550 million 
higher postage rates which took effect last april 4 are 
expected to help boost the agency into the black in fiscal 1989 
however 
the postal service has managed to break even on average over 
the last decade losing money in some years and showing a surplus 
in others

convicted insider trader dennis b levine whose 
squealings led to the ivan boesky scandal and a crackdown on wall 
street corruption has finished his prison term but remains under 
justice department supervision federal officials said friday 
levine was released thursday from a manhattan halfway house for 
federal inmates bureau of prisons spokeswoman kathryn johnson said 
in a telephone query he had been transferred there july 5 from a 
prison camp in lewisburg pa where he had been confined since 
april 6 1987 
martin flumenbaum levines attorney confirmed his client had 
been released but would not disclose his whereabouts or whether he 
was employed 
formerly a mergers specialist at the investment firm drexel 
burnham lambert inc levine was arrested in may 1986 after the 
securities and exchange commission accused him of making 126 
million in profits through illegal trading on inside information 
after pleading guilty in a cooperation agreement with federal 
prosecutors levine was sentenced to a twoyear prison term on 
charges of securities fraud tax evasion and perjury 
technically he was not scheduled for release until next april 
3 but his time was reduced for good behavior under federal 
criminal sentencing laws 
hes not serving his sentence any longer but hes still 
subject to the supervision of the us probation office said 
david chapman executive assistant at the lewisburg camp any 
violation at all and he would have to serve the rest of his 
sentence 
for example if levine failed a drug test consorted with other 
felons carried a gun or left the probation offices jurisdiction 
area without permission he could be returned to prison chapman 
said 
but with a whitecollar criminal like this he probably wont 
have too many restrictions on him chapman added 
michael luciano chief probation officer for the southern 
district of new york who is in charge of levines supervision 
said he expected no special restrictions would be established for 
levine except for the standard rule of no travel outside the 
district without permission 
the district comprises the manhattan and bronx districts of new 
york city plus six counties north of the city 
luciano said levine also was expected to work unless he was 
attending school he would not comment on levines living or 
employment status 
whatever work levine does it will not be related to wall 
street under an sec order against him levine is barred from any 
participation in any form of the securities business in any 
capacity 
a 36yearold father of two who grew up in a queens ny 
middleclass family levine was once regarded as an ambitious 
securities professional who drove a ferrari ate 200 lunches and 
spent more than 250000 to renovate his swank park ave apartment 
when the sec caught up with him in 1986 levine admitted he had 
parlayed 40000 into a profit of 126 million through a fiveyear 
scheme of insider trading on impending corporate takeovers 
it was levines cooperation with federal authorities that led 
them to boesky the wall street speculator who used sensitive 
information provided by levine to profit on insider trading himself 
boesky paid the sec a record 100 million in illicit insider 
trading profits and penalties in november 1986 he is now serving a 
threeyear federal prison term for conspiracy to lie to the sec 
both men provided extensive information to prosecutors and 
implicated other securities professionals in a widespread insider 
trading scandal that has jolted the securities business and raised 
a clamor about wall street ethics 
the latest fallout from the boesky scandal was a massive sec 
enforcement action wednesday against drexel burnham lambert 
levines former employer the sec accused drexel and several key 
employees with insider trading stock manipulation cheating 
clients falsifying records and other alleged frauds the 
defendants denied the charges

american telephone amp telegraph co said friday 
progress is being made toward ending a bitter dispute over control 
of unix the base computer software that has pitted it against such 
rivals as international business machines corp and digital 
equipment corp 
were still in negotiations with the open software 
foundation which was formed by ibm digital hewlettpackard co 
and others to create a version of unix that would not be under 
atampts control atampt spokesman john skalko said 
unix which was invented by atampt has become popular with other 
computer makers because it allows programs to run on a wide variety 
of computers without alteration however the software has 
splintered into many versions 
the open software foundation confirmed friday it plans to base 
its new version of unix on ibms version aix but atampt is trying 
to get the group to change its plans and use the atampt version 
skalko denied a report friday which said atampt chairman robert e 
allen told securities analysts the open software foundation had 
agreed to use atampts version 
skalko said the report was apparently based on a 
misinterpretation of allens speech thursday in boston in which he 
said we see the computer industry moving towards agreement on 
some version of our own unix operating system as an industry 
standard 
allen only meant to assert that unix was originally developed by 
atampt skalko said

retired employees of singer co have 
filed a 100 million class action suit seeking guarantees of their 
health and life insurance benefits 
the civil suit was filed tuesday in federal court here on behalf 
of more than 9000 singer retirees against the company and florida 
investor paul bilzerian who acquired singer in january for 106 
billion 
the singer retirees action committee said bilzerian prompted the 
suit by refusing several attempts by to discuss the benefits 
i think we had to do what we had to do because of 
bilzerians actions said committee cochairman ralph g seel of 
anderson sc 
a woman answering the telephone at bilzerians office in 
stamford said neither singer nor bilzerian had received 
notification that the suit was filed she declined further comment 
before bilzerian acquired the company singers companyfinanced 
benefits program had agreed to pay full health insurance for 
retirees and their spouses for life life insurance payments for 
the retiree in that program only were reduced on retirement 
the suit contends bilzerian has failed to make adequate 
provisions for the continuation of retirees health and life 
insurance benefits 
the action does not apply to pension benefits which the 
committee does not feel are threatened seel said 
seel said the suit had to be filed while singer still has enough 
assets to guarantee the contested health and life insurance 
benefits which singer has said cost about 10 million a year 
singer completed the sale last month of its two south carolina 
plants to ryobi ltd of japan 
bilzerian has made eight sales of singer divisions with 
agreements pending on others he has said he plans to sell all 12 
of singers divisions 
larry magarik a new york attorney representing the committee 
said thursday a retirees victory would mean that 
asyetunidentified singer assets would be attached to ensure that 
the benefits are paid

willing to sweeten its 234 billion tender offer for macmillan 
inc which also is the target of a hostile lower offer from 
robert m bass group inc 
maxwell also said it would be prepared under certain 
circumstances to raise its alternative offer for the us 
publishers information division to 14 billion from its original 
11 billion bid 
macmillan has rejected as inadequate maxwells offer of 80 a 
share for all of its outstanding stock 
wall street apparently expected the bidding for macmillan to 
continue the publishers stock rose 362 to 8387 a share in 
new york stock exchange composite trading friday 
maxwells latest move followed a second meeting on thursday 
between its chairman robert maxwell and macmillan chairman edward 
evans 
at this meeting mr maxwell indicated that based on the 
information provided to mcc maxwell communication corp by 
macmillan mcc would be prepared to consider subject to certain 
conditions raising its alternative offer for macmillan information 
from 11 billion to 14 billion maxwell communication said in 
a statement 
however mr maxwell also reiterated mccs primary wish to 
acquire the whole of macmillan and mccs willingness to discuss 
increasing the price offered above 80 a share maxwell 
communication added 
maxwell communication previously had not disclosed publicly any 
willingness to raise its tender offer 
maxwell launched its original tender offer aug 12 the bidder 
has said from the start that if the tender offer was not acceptable 
to macmillan it would be prepared to purchase only the information 
division 
macmillan has proposed a restructuring plan that would involve 
spinning off the information division as part of an effort to ward 
off the bass offer of 75 a share macmillan has rejected the bass 
offer as inadequate 
bass won a temporary injunction in june blocking the 
restructuring plan the delaware supreme court has scheduled a 
hearing sept 20 to consider macmillans appeal against the 
injunction 
the court meanwhile had asked macmillan to file a memo by 
friday informing it about recent events and explaining whether the 
company intended to go forward with the proposed restructuring in 
light of the offers from maxwell and bass 
macmillan spokesman david jackson said macmillan had asked the 
delaware court for a delay in filing the memo until monday jackson 
said macmillans board plans to meet saturday to prepare a 
definitive response for the court 
last tuesday the court criticized macmillan for failing to keep 
it informed about the publishers discussions with maxwell 
robert maxwell held his first meeting with evans in london aug 
30 at which he was supplied with information about the macmillan 
information division and the company as a whole

us ball bearing makers warned congress 
thursday that unfair and they alleged sometimes illegal 
competition from foreign manufacturers is devastating the domestic 
bearing industry and is leaving the nation unable to gear up for 
wartime production 
i dont think the american bearing industry will wither away 
but it will continue to grow smaller and what is left will probably 
be quite competitive but it wont support military needs in a 
national emergency said donald k brush general manager at the 
barden corp in danbury conn 
brush joined sens lowell p weicker jr rconn and alfonse 
damato rny in a call for administration protection of the 
industry 
the health of the domestic industry has declined to the point 
that it now endangers our national security weicker said at a 
senate small business committee hearing he called to look at the 
impact of foreign competitors 
without a secure domestic supply of bearings our national 
defense could become gridlocked said weicker who represents a 
state with 16 bearing plants when it comes to the question of 
bearings i dont want to have to depend on any foreign nation 
bearings are critical to a variety of weapons systems including 
nuclear missiles jet engines tanks and atomic submarines 
the pentagon recently installed a new policy to buy only 
americanmade bearings for at least three years industry 
executives said that would help but the problem would largely 
remain because pentagon purchases make up only 15 to 20 percent of 
the market 
how does us business compete with the low wages and other 
costs of singapore and thailand no amount of modernization could 
reduce costs to compete with labor rates one19th ours brush 
said 
last month commerce secretary c william verity said president 
reagan would delay a decision on a 1987 industry petition urging 
government restrictions on the amount of bearings imported verity 
said the president first wants to see the impact of the pentagons 
buyamerican policy 
under the omnibus trade bill the president must make a decision 
by nov 21 
weicker said domestic bearing production has dropped by more 
than 30 percent since 1978 damato said nearly 15000 jobs and 11 
billion in sales have been lost since 1979 and 31 bearing and 
parts plants have closed down 
in addition to cheaper labor costs enjoyed by foreign companies 
and in some cases subsidies from their own governments us agents 
are investigating charges that some foreign bearing makers are 
violating customs and trade laws dumping their products in the 
us market and in some cases avoiding us tariffs by 
underreporting

pentland industries the british industrial 
conglomerate that holds a 32 percent stake in the reebok athletic 
shoe company has agreed to acquire parker pen in a deal valued at 
about 326 million the financial times reported in its friday 
editions 
the newspaper britains leading business daily said full 
financial details were not disclosed thursday 
however it said pentland would buy between 85 percent and 90 
percent of parker for about 287 million with the balance of the 
equity being set aside for british executives who led a 100 
million management buyout of the former us company in 1986 
the paper quoted parkers chief executive jacques margry as 
saying reeboks marketing strength in the united states and far 
east would greatly help parkers international development more 
than 60 percent of parkers operating profits now come from europe 
you will not see reebok pens or anything like that but the 
strategy of building global brands is the same if you are selling 
shoes pens or whatever margry said 
reebok international ltd is based in canton mass 
the deal also resolves parkers recent difficulties which 
started when a stock issue planned for last fall was scrapped as 
world stock markets crashed in october the newspaper stated 
parker aborted a second stock issuance attempt in june this year 
after a dispute over the size of the issue between the companys 
financial advisers and its venture capital investors 
despite its troubles parker has prospered with its present 
management an investor group led by managment acquired the 
business in january 1986 from its former owner manpower inc of 
milwaukee wis 
parker formerly of janesville wis lost more than 43 million 
in the three years before the buyout from manpower the temporary 
employment concern that last year was itself acquired by blue arrow 
plc 
last year parker posted pretax profit 29 million and results 
in the first half of 1988 are expected to show further improvements

the dollar was mixed against major currencies 
friday as gold prices plunged in us trading reflecting what some 
analysts said was a developing deflationary attitude about the 
economy 
republic national bank of new york said gold fell to a bid 
42125 a troy ounce as of 4 pm edt down from 42850 late 
thursday 
gold analysts said the governments report on wholesale or 
producer prices prompted a selloff of the precious metal after the 
market failed to respond to what at first appeared to be a 
higherthanexpected increase in inflation 
the producer price index was the source of disappointment 
early said stephen platt a metals analyst with dean witter 
reynolds inc when the market couldnt attract buying off the ppi 
numbers a lot of skepticism set in about the markets ability to 
hold 
investors traditionally have used gold as a hedge against 
inflation 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold closed down sharply 
at 42120 a troy ounce compared with 42880 late thursday 
in earlier london trading gold slipped to a late bid price of 
42680 a troy ounce compared with late thursdays 428 dollars 
in zurich gold climbed higher closing at a bid 42950 an ounce 
compared with 42850 late thursday 
in hong kong gold edged up 4 cents to close at a bid 43055 an 
ounce 
silver bullion prices rose on the london market where the metal 
was trading at a late bid price of 663 a troy ounce compared 
with thursdays 658 
on the new york comex silver for current delivery fell to 
6440 a troy ounce from thursdays 6612 
meanwhile uncertainty gripped the foreign exchange market soon 
after fridays inflation report traders said 
the foreign exchange market didnt know how to respond said 
george palfi vice president of foreign exchange marketing for 
first national bank of chicago 
traders said the market rallied briefly after the report that 
wholesale prices rose 06 percent in august but the market quickly 
settled back as it digested the numbers and found that excluding 
the volatile food and energy categories wholesale prices rose a 
moderate 03 percent 
the dollar usually firms on news of higher inflation because it 
indicates a possible rise in interest rates if the federal reserve 
moves to tighten credit higher interest rates in turn increase the 
value of dollardenominated assets 
last friday the dollar plunged on reports that unemployment had 
risen and the pace of production had slowed suggesting the economy 
was softening since then the dollar has seesawed as investors 
remained undecided 
but analysts said fridays activity in the dollar and gold 
markets suggest a change in investor sentiment that the economy 
is no longer booming but slowing down 
investors are now turning their attention to next weeks 
economic reports primarily the us trade deficit for july 
analysts said 
in tokyo where the business day ends before europes begins 
the dollar fell 125 japanese yen to a closing 13295 yen later 
in london it moved back up to 13320 yen 
in new york trading the dollar closed down at 133615 yen 
compared with 133625 late thursday

the senate approved new curbs on textile 
clothing and shoe imports friday defying the threat of a 
presidential veto just weeks before the november elections 
we ought to pass this now and not put it off and deprive 
american workers of jobs they could have sen strom thurmond 
rsc said minutes before the senate approved the measure 5732 
the bill aimed at protecting american manufacturers from 
foreign competition would freeze this years imports of textiles 
apparel and nonrubber footwear at 1987 levels and limit their 
growth to one percent annually thereafter 
it also would bar foreign manufacturers of nonrubber footwear 
from increasing their share of the american market beyond existing 
levels 
senate supporters of the textile industry and their opponents 
came away from the roll call frustrated with 11 lawmakers not 
voting sponsors fell short of the vetoproof margin and critics 
lacked the 34 votes needed to assure that a veto would be sustained 
on the roll call 17 republicans joined 40 democrats in 
supporting the measure and it was opposed by nine democrats and 23 
republicans 
the senate voted 6829 on wednesday to limit debate to 30 hours 
fridays roll call thus appeared to represent an 11 vote falloff in 
support for the textile apparel and shoe industries 
seven democratic senators who voted wednesday to curb debate on 
the issue voted against the bill itself on friday and five others 
who had favored a time limit on debate did not vote at all on 
friday 
they appeared to be making good on an agreement by leaders 
guaranteeing textile forces a vote on their bill if they would 
refrain from offering it as an amendment to omnibus trade 
legislation approved by congress earlier this summer 
afterward us trade representative clayton k yeutter issued a 
statement calling the action regrettable 
i am pleased that the margin was far short of the 67 votes 
necessary to override a presidential veto yeutter said a 
veto which will undoubtedly come if the bill reaches the 
presidents desk should clearly be sustained 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater noted that president 
reagan had vetoed a 1985 textile protection bill and said the 
president will veto the 1988 version if it reaches his desk 
the bill the senate passed today is protectionism at its 
worst the spokesman said in a statement it would bring 
retaliation against us exports harm us international 
competitiveness and cost american jobs that is a disastrous 
prescription for americas economic future 
the bills sponsor sen ernest hollings dsc said he was 
not trying to avoid the label protectionist 
yes im a protectionist he told the senate on thursday 
man foreign importers are trading our shirts off of us were 
going broke we need protection 
sponsors of the bill face another obstacle opponents are 
seeking to delay until next week sending the bill back to the 
house which passed a similar version in september 1987 but now 
must decide whether to go along with the senate changes 
supporters say the bill would save american jobs that would be 
lost to overseas competition without some protection for 
hardpressed us companies critics say textile companies are 
thriving partly because of import restraints already in place and 
also due to modernization that followed a surge in imports in the 
early 1980s 
additional protection would merely dull us industrys 
competitive edge the critics say 
somewhere along the way we became slack or fat and we did not 
have to compete sen bob packwood rore said anything we 
made good or shoddy could be sold in the united states or sold 
overseas 
he said the rejuventation of european and japanese industry 
after world war ii and the resulting surge of competition came as a 
shock to american industry 
we werent used to it but were getting used to it now 
packwood said theres no question that we can compete and we are 
competing now 
the united states must compete or die said sen phil gramm 
rtexas another outspoken critic 
the us textile and apparel industries were battered in the 
early 1980s by a wave of imports and underwent a largescale 
modernization that caused layoffs some 300000 textile jobs and 
70000 in the apparel sector have been lost since the start of the 
decade 
the industries concede that automation as much as foreign 
competition claimed a large number of the textile jobs but note 
that apparel manufacturing remains heavily labor intensive giving 
lowwage countries an edge in price competition 
sponsors say lower price tags have not always resulted and that 
shippers importers and retailers who have lobbied against the 
legislation have often absorbed the cost difference the 
industries say the real problem is simply that foreignmade goods 
entering the us market are squeezing americanmade products off 
the shelves 
but textile industry earnings did shoot up sharply last year 
hollings said after the vote that he was not worried about an 
expected veto 
veto or no veto ill be back next year hollings said 
ive been doing this for 25 years and each year we pick up more 
and more support because each year we pick up more understanding as 
to the dilemma the united states finds itself in in industrial 
competition 
if the legislation as now seems likely arrives on president 
reagans desk the administration will be forced to make a 
political decision 
us trade representative clayton k yeutter and six other 
cabinet members said in a letter to lawmakers on aug 5 that they 
would recommend a veto 
but a veto would hand democrats the material to paint 
republicans as insensitive to the bluecollar workers vice 
president bush is attempting to court there has been some talk in 
the cloakroom about dragging out the proceedings long enough to 
enable reagan to use a socalled pocket veto after congress 
adjourns a month from now 
when congress is not in session the president may in effect 
veto the legislation simply by refusing to sign it

crude oil futures plunged friday on the new york mercantile 
exchange amid rumors saudi arabia had vetoed proposals for a 
special meeting of the opec pricing committee 
on other exchanges contracts for future delivery of precious 
metals grains soybeans livestock and meat all finished 
moderately to sharply lower while stockindex futures advanced 
crude oil futures had rallied thursday after hitting their 
lowest levels in nearly two years on unconfirmed rumors that the 
secretariat of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
had called a special meeting of the cartels pricing committee 
traders clung to expectations of such a meeting until friday 
afternoon when new rumors surfaced that any meeting plans had been 
vetoed by saudi arabia 
panic selling ensued with the contract for october delivery of 
west texas intermediate crude oil briefly touching 1405 a barrel 
before rebounding to 1418 at the close 
the contract had closed at 1416 a barrel on wednesday the 
lowest price for nearmonth delivery since oct 29 1986 when the 
nearmonth contract closed at 1373 
reports that some opec members had produced crude oil in excess 
of their quotas last month were mainly responsible for the sharp 
drop in prices earlier this week 
but charles j maxwell senior energy strategist with the new 
york brokerage house cj lawrence morgan grenfell inc cited 
five factors underlying the bearish trend in the oil market 
the factors include the slow world economy competition from 
gas coal nuclear and other energy sources increased oil 
production in brazil oman egypt and other nonopec countries the 
continuing trend toward energy conservation and discord within opec 
maxwell said oil prices probably would continue to fall until 
opec members agree to firm production limits 
if they are fearful enough and they decide to cut back 
production i can see us muddling through with prices at 14 to 15 
a barrel while we work off inventories he said 
the disaster theory is that we go down to 9 or 10 a barrel 
which would force opecs hand and they would order production 
curbs that would bring us up to 15 or 16 a barrel by 
midwinter 
west texas intermediate settled 30 cents to 51 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in october at 1418 a barrel heating 
oil was 88 cent to 110 cents lower with october at 4097 cents a 
gallon unleaded gasoline was 93 cent to 107 cents lower with 
october at 4206 cents a gallon 
the inflationsensitive preciousmetals market fell sharply in 
reaction to the oil markets plunge after rallying earlier in the 
day in response to the governments report of a 06 percent rise in 
wholesale prices last month 
the rally ended when traders decided the rise in wholesale 
prices was not as inflationary as it looked at first blush said 
jim steel metals analyst with refco inc in new york 
silver futures began falling at that point while gold and 
platinum remained relatively firm he said 
but when the energies fell and the dollar remained strong 
there was no way that platinum and gold could resist he said 
you could describe it as almost panic selling 
gold closed at its lowest level since april 1987 steel said 
on the new york mercantile exchange platinum settled 1120 to 
1170 lower with october at 52580 a troy ounce 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold was 770 to 870 lower 
with october at 42310 a troy ounce silver was 172 cents to 192 
cents lower with september at 644 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures finished lower on the chicago board of 
trade on preweekend profittaking ahead of mondays government 
crop production report analysts said 
the grain markets were shaken by a prediction from respected 
grain analyst conrad leslie that the usda will report little 
drought damage to crops last month 
wheat settled 3 cents to 7 cents lower with september at 4 a 
bushel corn was 2 cents to 4 cents lower with september at 
285 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 5 cents lower with september 
at 263 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents to 16 cents lower with 
september at 877 a bushel 
cattle futures moved sharply lower on the chicago mercantile 
exchange on expectations of larger supplies and slack demand next 
week analysts said pork futures fell in sympathy with the cattle 
live cattle were 65 cent to 130 cents lower with october at 
6960 cents a pound feeder cattle were 50 cent to 93 cent lower 
with september at 7977 cents a pound hogs were 05 cent to 25 
cent lower with october at 3792 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 18 cent lower to 25 cent higher with february at 4730 cents

discouraging government report on inflation 
the labor department said wholesale prices rose a brisk 06 
percent in august if the august increase held for 12 straight 
months inflation at the wholesale level would amount to 69 
percent more than triple the 22 percent 1987 price rise 
prices then rebounded slightly when traders took a closer look 
at the inflation figures and noted that much of the august increase 
came from volatile energy and food prices 
a lack of sustained buying brought another decline in bond 
values but falling prices of oil and other commodities lifted them 
again traders said 
it was up down up down said john v sebastian executive 
vice president of clayton brown amp associates an investment firm 
based in chicago this was a real roller coaster day 
traders are awaiting next weeks spate of economic data which 
include government reports on the nations trade deficit for july

show continued growth in the economy which is bearish for the

the nations big three automakers on friday 
announced they had formed a partnership for joint research into 
plastics in car structures 
for years general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler 
corp have toyed with the moving from metal to plastic bodies in 
cars and light trucks gm used plastic body parts in its pontiac 
fiero which it recently stopped making gms chevrolet corvette 
has had a fiberglas body for years 
the three companies said in a joint statement two people from 
each corporation would form the board of the new consortium 
each of the car makers will share with the others through the 
partnership its precompetitive or generic research data 
into polymerbased composites gm ford and chrysler will determine 
by themselves what data each company will show the others for the 
next 12 years 
officials of each of corporation said friday the research would 
include structural plastics 
what they are looking at are composite materials said don 
postma a spokesman for the gm technical center in warren mich 
the advantages to the composites are the combination of light 
weight and considerably more strength not to mention corrosion 
resistance 
it is the kind of strength factors that lead composites to be 
considered for vehicle frames and loadcarrying members of the 
cars he added 
the goal is to develop technologies to allow plastic 
structural parts for cars chrysler spokesman ben dunn said 
the applications that could revolutionize the industry are the 
major body structural components and that is the goal of this 
research 
its a very positive step that theyve taken said joseph 
miller director of engineering materials for du pont automotive 
products of troy mich its a recognition by them of potential 
future benefit to composite polymers used in primary structural 
applications 
without elaborating miller said weve got some confidential 
programs with all the car companies with fenders and 
quarterpanels du pont is a major supplier of plastics to the 
automobile industry 
dunn postma and joyce stilton of ford each said it was too 
early to say how much money or staff would be involved in the joint 
venture each of the big three would take on onethird of the 
financial burden the companies said 
the consortium to share the research is the first such agreement 
among the big three and falls under guidelines of the national 
cooperative research act passed in 1984

a federal jury friday awarded a woman 
nearly 9 million in finding that gd searle amp co made 
intentional misrepresentations of the copper7 intrauterine device 
leading to the womans sterility 
the jury also decided the company was negligent in its testing 
of the copper7 but not in its design or manufacture of the 
copper7 worn by esther kociemba 
mrs kociemba 30 of elk river was awarded 7 million in 
punitive damages 1 million for emotional distress and 750000 
for pain and disability 
the jury decided mrs kociembas husband william did not 
experience the loss of consortium as a direct result of his wifes 
use of the copper7 and did not award him damages 
jurors refused to comment on the verdict 
searle attorney paul strain of baltimore said the verdict will 
be appealed 
it was a complex case there was a lot of emotional rhetoric 
in this case but the safety of the copper7 will be established by 
judge renner in this case or on appeal strain said 
some 500 lawsuits have been filed over the copper7 the most 
widely used iud in the united states before being withdrawn from 
the us market in january 1986 in the midst of the litigation 
searle won 15 of the previous 18 cases to be decided but 
kociemba lawyers have said that none of the previous cases included 
as many documents or deposition testimony as this one kociemba 
lawyer roger p brosnahan said before the trial started that it 
would be the first real trial involving the copper7 
were gratified that a jury that has finally heard all the 
evidence has come to a decision we think is just brosnahan said 
friday 
asked if the damages award was fair he said that is 
difficult to assess money cant recover fertility money cant 
give you the children 
mrs kociemba was not in court when the verdict was read her 
whereabouts were not immediately known 
the three previous cases lost by searle awarded damages totaling 
550000 strain said earlier including one damages award of 
250000 that is being appealed 
mrs kociemba used a copper7 for just under 1 years in 1977 
and 1978 she claims that the iud triggered a pelvic infection two 
weeks after insertion and that the infection scarred her fallopian 
tubes leaving her sterile 
her lawyers throughout the 3month trial sought to establish 
through the testimony of searle employees and former employees and 
through the companys internal documents that searle knew of 
potential health risks with the copper7 but did not adequately 
disclose those risks to doctors or the public 
the jury was in its 10th day of deliberations friday after 
hearing testimony that began may 17 and ended aug 25 
the lead attorney for the plaintiffs michael ciresi of 
minneapolis alleged in his closing argument that searle was 
negligent in designing the device with a tailstring he said 
provided a haven for bacteria that produced pelvic infections 
calling searle a corporation which allows greed to be its 
guiding beacon he said the company rushed the copper7 to market 
without proper testing he charged it was sold to women without 
adequate warning that it could cause pelvic inflammatory disease 
and without warning that it was too large for many young women who 
had never given birth 
but strain said the company exceeded fda requirements in 
marketing copper7 he said ciresi did not even prove that mrs 
kociemba suffered from pelvic infection let alone that it was 
caused by the copper7

roy e disneys shamrock holdings inc 
went directly to polaroid corp shareholders friday with a cash bid 
that values the company at about 26 billion 
polaroids board of directors last month unanimously rejected an 
unsolicited offer from the burbank califbased shamrock that 
would have paid 40 a share plus 40 percent of the eventual award 
in polaroids patent infringement lawsuit against eastman kodak co 
a percentage of that potential settlement was not included in 
the new hostile tender offer of 42 a share which bypasses the 
directors 
shamrock said it would add 2 a share to its bid raising it to 
44 a share if directors dropped their resistance to the takeover 
attempt 
on wall street polaroid stock rose 187 a share to 4175 
they shamrock have to start making their move and they 
have said chuck ryan an analyst with the investment firm 
merrill lynch capital markets in new york now the ball is in 
polaroids court you have to watch what polaroid will do 
ryan suggested polaroid still had the option of looking for 
friendly suitors 
the company issued a statement touting the potential of its 
restructuring plan for improving profitability but added that the 
new offer would be considered by top management 
analysts had said a 40 percent share of the kodak litigation 
proceeds could total 400 million to 800 million but the increase 
in the bid to 42 a share from 40 would give shareholders a 
definite 124 million in cash without waiting 
shamrock said that if its bid succeeded it would drop 
polaroids embryonic venture into 35mm film it also said it would 
sell all or much of polaroids undeveloped real property minimize 
the excess capacity in the companys manufacturing facilities 
refocus the companys research and development activities on the 
companys core businesses and negotiate a commercially 
reasonable settlement of the kodak litigation 
the latest offer is contingent on the invalidation of polaroids 
recent issuance of 97 million shares to a new employee stock 
ownership plan a move polaroid made early in its attempt to block 
shamrock 
if the stock ownership plan is not invalidated the offering 
price would be reduced to 40 a share shamrock said 
the 42ashare offer values the company at roughly 26 
billion for 62 million shares while the 40ashare offer puts a 
value on the company of nearly 29 billion because it assumes the 
existence of nearly 10 million more shares 
about 5 million of the shares are already owned by shamrock 
shamrock which is owned by the family of roy e disney nephew 
of the late animator walt disney has filed a lawsuit seeking to 
overturn the ownershi plan it is scheduled to go to trial in 
delaware chancery court on oct 19 
shamrock also said that if polaroids management agreed to 
support a merger the offer would be amended to increase the price 
to 44 a share if the new stock issue was invalidated or 42 a 
share if it was not 
in an effort to fend off hostile bidders polaroid has begun a 
corporate restructuring offering early retirement to hundreds of 
employees 
polaroid spokeswoman marcia phillips issued a brief statement 
asserting that the company has been making excellent progress 
with its comprehensive strategic program designed to dramatically 
improve profitability and deliver value to all of its 
shareholders 
the statement added that we are proceeding with that plan 
but of course our board and management will consider the offer 
from shamrock and base their determination on the best interests of 
all our shareholders 
polaroid is incorporated in delaware 
the investment banking firm of drexel burnham lambert inc 
along with wertheim schroder amp co is providing financing for 
shamrocks takeover attempt 
in addition shamrock said that commitments for 1 billion of 
financing have been received from wells fargo bank and the bank of 
nova scotia
