a jury found a blood bank negligent thursday 
for improperly screening its blood in the case of a 5yearold boy 
who contracted aids through a transfusion a verdict believed to be 
the first of its kind lawyers said 
we just feel this is a great moral victory i think the blood 
industry particularly in highrisk areas like san francisco has 
got to shape up said mary osborn whose son michael was the 
plaintiff in the case 
michael who has a brain tumor and lymphoma was diagnosed with 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome in september 1987 he has only a 
few months to live said the osborns lawyer michael moriarty 
at least michael will be around in some way in the future at 
least his name will not be forgotten added mrs osborn 
the jury found irwin memorial blood bank of san francisco which 
supplies blood to about 40 hospitals to be negligent in failing to 
screen the blood adequately although some aids screening was done 
at the facility at the time 
in addition the jury ruled that the blood bank erred in not 
allowing family members to target their blood donations for michael 
moriarty said the blood bank had rejected requests by the boys 
family and friends to donate blood for the transfusion saying they 
had no policy to accommodate such requests when in fact they did 
the blood banks attorney duncan barr denied that the blood 
bank acted negligently and said the decision will be appealed 
the jury awarded the sacramento family 550000 in compensatory 
damages the child suffering from a congenital heart defect 
received the transfusion feb 24 1983 when he was three weeks old 
the boys parents were awarded 200000 to pay for past and future 
medical bills but were denied any damages for pain and suffering 
the jury voted unanimously to award the damages and split 93 on 
the question of liability said moriarty 
defending irwins decisions in the case barr said in 1983 the 
blood bank had a policy of allowing socalled directed donors only 
for medical reasons such as blood donations from organ donors 
barr and dr thomas asher founder and chairman of hemacare 
corp a private blood bank in sherman oaks said the case was the 
first time a blood bank was found responsible for a 
transfusionrelated aids case 
a denver jury in june cleared a blood bank of liability in the 
case of a woman who contracted aids through a transfusion a similar 
case in california in 1986 ended in a settlement before the trial 
ended 
aids is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread 
most often through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by 
drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from pregnant 
women to their offspring

president daniel ortega wants to meet 
with mikhail gorbachev during the soviet union leaders visit to 
un headquarters in new york the opposition daily la prensa 
reported wednesday 
ortega asked the us embassy for more than 20 visas for his 
entourage la prensa said in its afternoon edition 
nicaraguan government sources told the associated press they were 
unable to confirm the visa request because ortega has been in mexico 
since sunday he is in mexico to attend the inauguration of 
presidentelect carlos salinas de gortari on thursday 
la prensa said that ortega plans to leave for the united states 
next weekend shortly after returning from mexico 
it is not known if gorbachevs tight schedule in new york 
includes a visit with ortega la prensa said 
gorbachev plans to meet with president reagan and presidentelect 
george bush on dec 5 
political observers and diplomats said ortegas trip 
indicated sandinista concern about possible negotiation between 
the two powers regarding soviet presence in nicaragua la prensa 
said 
in a separate editorial la prensa said that for gorbachev to 
develop his perestroika he must seek better relations with the 
united states 
here is where nicaragua enters the picture the paper said 
the sandinistas with their politics of alignment toward the soviet 
union have put nicaragua into the field of the eastwest fight 
making a place for itself in the agenda for any dialogue between the 
superpowers ortegas potential trip to new york confirms that 
the paper also said ortega runs to the united nations 
undoubtedly to seek concessions from the soviet delegation 
perestroika russian for restructuring refers to gorbachevs 
program for reforming soviet economy and society for efficiency

scientists said today they have found the 
earliest direct evidence for use of fire by apemen or early humans 
bone fragments that were burned as long as 15 million years ago 
fires were apparently a regular event in the south african cave 
where the fragments were found although it is unclear whether they 
were for cooking warmth or scaring predators scientists said 
were not absolutely certain those bones were there in fire 
because they were food remains said researcher andrew sillen 
they could have been thrown into the fire as kind of a refuse 
heap 
sillen of the university of cape town in south africa and ck 
brain of the transvaal museum in pretoria south africa describe 
their analysis in todays issue of the british journal nature 
the fires may have been set by ancestors of humans called homo 
erectus or by apemen called australopithecus robustus which are 
not direct human ancestors they wrote 
in an interview sillen said the bone fragments could be 1 
million to 15 million years old but most likely they are 12 
million years old 
previous research suggests fire was being used in kenya a bit 
more recently than 14 million years ago a date many experts accept 
but with some hesitancy said eric delson professor of anthropology 
at lehman college of the city university of new york 
that research is supported by indirect evidence magnetic 
irregularities in the ground thought caused by ancient fire on the 
surface he said in a telephone interview 
the evidence from the new study is certainly the strongest to 
date in favor of early humancontrolled fire delson said 
other research suggests fire was used slightly less than 500000 
years ago in hungary france and china and certainly less than 
150000 years ago in africa and europe he said 
in the new work researchers used bones recovered from south 
africas swartkrans cave wellknown for providing remains of homo 
erectus and the apeman robustus 
to make sure they could identify signs of ancient burning 
researchers took a fresh leg bone from a south african antelope 
called a hartebeest and heated bone slices to different 
temperatures 
then they used the chemical and microscopic characteristics found 
in the heated slices to analyze the fossils they concluded that 270 
fossil fragments had been burnt with most identifiable ones from 
antelope 
fragments from zebra warthog baboon and a finger bone of 
robustus were also identified the robustus bone does not 
necessarily mean an apeman was eaten since the purpose of the 
fires is unknown sillen said 
the fragments color and structure showed they had been heated to 
a range of temperatures similar to that recorded in experimental 
campfires set by brain the experimental fires used what was 
probably the most common wood in the vicinity in ancient days 
sillen said 
in the interview sillen said no burnt bones were found in older 
sections of the cave even though the conditions for deposition of 
fossils were identical that suggests the burnt fragments mark the 
beginning of the use of fire he said 
delson said the idea that the fragments burned in natural fires 
rather than deliberate blazes cannot be ruled out but randall 
susman a researcher at the state university of new york at stony 
brook who has studied the ancient inhabitants of the swartkrans 
cave said he believes the fires were deliberate 
its highly unlikely that these bones would have been burned in 
a naturally occuring situation he said range fires would not 
have reached the campfirelike temperatures identified for the bone 
fragments he said 
in addition homo erectus was known to use fire elsewhere he 
said 
homo erectus appeared about 16 million years ago and evolved 
into a more advanced form by about 250000 years ago robustus 
appeared about 25 million years ago and survived until at least 1 
million years ago before extinction

wally m schirra one of the first seven 
mercury astronauts says the united states no longer leads the world 
in space technology and should renew its commitment to space 
exploration 
in an address at the us naval academy tuesday night the former 
navy captain called on the bush administration to make building a 
space station the top priority of americas space program 
such a station could serve as a port for manned and unmanned 
exploratory missions to other planets and their moons said schirra 
65 
schirra a 1946 academy graduate who is now a business executive 
wore a beat army pin the same message he carried on a placard 
during a 1965 gemini mission the annual armynavy football game is 
this weekend 
schirra said the skylab project marked the beginning of the 
decline of the us space program budget cuts forced the national 
aeronautics and space administration to allow skylab to break up in 
orbit and no serious financial commitment has been made since he 
said 
the former astronaut speaking on the eve of the launching of the 
secret military shuttle atlantis said space shuttle missions have 
had no place to go they were just supposed to go into outer 
space and come home we did that 25 years ago 
schirra praised the soviet unions space program for its 
longrange goals the soviets have done extensive research on how 
weightlessness affects humans and have worked to develop ships that 
can stay in orbit for years but the united states has attempted 
neither he said 
schirra was selected as a mercury astronaut in april 1959 in 
1962 he became the fifth astronaut to fly in space

tehran is a city full of contrasts showing the 
effects of war tradition and modern lifestyles an associated press 
correspondent accompanied west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher on a recent visit and here is his report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the bustle of tehrans main bazaar young 
women wearing blue jeans under their traditional islamic chador 
robes stroll past crippled war veterans hobbling on rickety wooden 
crutches between merchant stalls 
a few blocks away curious children and young people flock to 
gaze at the magnificent former residence of the late shah of iran 
some people on the streets of tehran openly indicated their 
displeasure with irans revolutionary government which toppled the 
shah in 1979 
a book vendor asked for an uptodate city guidebook told a 
western reporter there has been nothing like that since the 
revolution 
the merchant then held up a tattered guidebook dating back before 
the islamic revolution she pointed to a photograph in the book of 
the shahs family the picture had been crossed out with thick black 
censorship marks 
it really is a shame the book vendor said angrily 
journalists accompanying west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher to tehran were not allowed to tour the city 
freely or take pictures during the threeday state visit that ended 
tuesday 
but the glimpses they were allowed showed tehran is a city full 
of contrasts the westerners witnessed clear evidence of moslem 
fundamentalism but also signs of modernism 
iran has been making efforts to increase its contacts with some 
western nations such as west germany as it tries to recover from 
its crippling eightyear war with iraq after a ceasefire 
but west german businessmen who accompanied genscher to tehran 
said it is still not certain whether irans commitment to 
conservative moslem principles will hinder efforts to build up the 
country 
whoever plans to invest here must carefully weigh each step 
said rochusernst freiherr von luettwitz a west german involved in 
business discussions with iran 
there are signs everywhere that a fundamentalist islamic 
philosophy that has governed life in iran since the shahs ouster 
still holds sway 
iranian revolutionary guards carrying automatic rifles were 
plainly visible on tehrans streets watching the western 
journalists to make sure they did not violate any of the 
restrictions under which their presence was permitted 
the iranian governments disdain for the late shah who was 
friendly with the united states becomes bitterly clear with a visit 
to the grand palace where he and his family had lived 
pictures of the shah have been turned upsidedown inside the 
rooms of the palace now a museum photographs showing poverty and 
squalor during the shahs rule have been placed near tables 
exhibiting valuables once owned by the former ruler 
plaques tell visitors the purpose of rooms in the palace during 
the shahs reign but in a belittling fashion 
former working room of the shah who fled reads one plaque 
but along with such clear evidence of moslem fundamentalism 
there are also signs tehrans people do not totally reject western 
ways 
many of tehrans young women wear blue jeans or short skirts 
under their traditional black chador robes the fabric pushed back 
just enough on their foreheads to reveal a lock or two of hair 
several young women were also wearing highheeled shoes 
tehran residents on the streets did not stare at the western 
visitors but actually seemed to welcome them 
there were also signs of the devastating war with iraq crippled 
young men hobbled along the streets and the westerners saw empty 
lots where they were told bombedout homes once stood 
there are also signs of stymied progress within tehran 
just behind the hotel esteghlal called the royal tehran hilton 
before the 1979 revolution chickens raced among building materials 
at the site of an uncompleted structure rusty steel girders were 
scattered on the ground giving the impression the structure had not 
been worked on for some time 
inside the hotel itself the climatecontrol system was able to 
churn out only humid blasts of air 
genscher and his entourage were greeted with open arms by iranian 
officials 
but western journalists were told through the west german embassy 
that while in iran they would be permitted to write only about 
genschers meetings and that their visas were valid only for the 
duration of the official visit 
in addition it was made clear to western photographers that the 
iranians would not allow pictures to be taken of life on tehrans 
streets

westinghouse electric corp said wednesday it 
will not be a scapegoat for what it calls politically motivated 
opposition in the philippines to a nuclear power plant it built 
under former president ferdinand marcos 
philippines president corazon aquino says the 23 billion plant 
60 miles northwest of manila in bataan province is unsafe in part 
because of its design and its location on an earthquake fault near a 
volcano 
her government has said it plans to sue westinghouse for damages 
and breach of contract regarding the plant which never went into 
operation because of alleged safety defects 
her legal adviser adolfo azcuna said in late october that a 
lawsuit was ready and likely would be filed within a month in the 
united states an agreement barring either the government or the 
company from taking legal action was due to expire thursday 
formal announcement of the lawsuit was scheduled thursday in 
manila for 230 pm 130 am est at the presidential palace 
what were finding here are the results of a political policy 
that came to life when they were running for office said 
nathaniel d woodson general manager of the westinghouse nuclear 
fuels unit they now feel they have a political albatross around 
their neck and theyre trying to blame us 
the reactors opponents also allege that bribes were paid over 
the awarding of the prime contract we won fairly and squarly 
woodson said in an interview 
woodson and deputy general counsel louis j briskman said that 
philippines officials have acknowledged during private talks that no 
matter how safe the plant is they dont intend to allow nuclear 
power production in the country 
safety has nothing to do with it woodson said 
with all but 20 million to 30 million still due from manila for 
the power plant westinghouse could walk away from the 10yearold 
controversy said woodson the bigger risk perhaps is damage to the 
companys international standing as a designer and builder of 
nuclear power plants 
all over the world we have built plants and we havent had 
this problem if they dont want to operate this plant thats 
theyre decision but dont make westinghouse a scapegoat he 
said westinghouse will not be a scapegoat 
the company cited investigations by the us justice department 
and the securities and exchange commission that produced no evidence 
warranting charges 
further a safety study commissioned by the aquino government 
concluded that the plant is safe westinghouse said a trade journal 
published a draft of that report the government says the final 
report concludes otherwise but officials have refused to release 
the document 
the 620megawatt plant powered by a westinghousepressurized 
water reactor was completed three years ago 
in its early stages the project was shaken by allegations of 
kickbacks to officials of the marcos regime and by safety concerns 
communist rebels have bombed transmission towers leading from the 
plant and people have cut and sold the copper lines as scrap the 
plants corps of operators has largely disbanded and westinghouse 
has only a handful of employees still in the philippines woodson 
said 
yet the cost of the plant continues rising westinghouse said 
interest on the loans the philippines took to build cost an 
estimated 300000 per day

house speaker jim wright on wednesday called 
for george bush to quickly present congress with an honest and 
responsible budget saying the presidentelect has a duty to spell 
out in detail his plan for attacking the countrys deficit problems 
wright joined a chorus of witnesses before the national economic 
commission who urged quick and decisive action on the part of the 
new administration and congress to break the sevenyear deadlock 
over huge budget deficits 
former federal reserve chairman paul volcker who also testified 
said that failure to act could trigger a loss of confidence by 
foreigners in the value of the dollar sparking higher interest 
rates and possibly a severe recession in this country 
we are entirely unnecessarily in my view undercutting the 
economic foundation of united states world leadership volcker 
said 
wright said bush should submit his own spending blueprint no 
later than midfebruary and this should be followed by the 
recommendations of the economic commission by march 1 
we do not have the luxury of a leisurely schedule wright 
said the problems wont wait indefinitely while people try to 
read our lips or read our minds 
wright and other democrats want to force bush to be specific on 
how he would cut the deficit without raising taxes while still 
keeping his other campaign promises to boost spending in such areas 
as education day care and environmental cleanup 
they fear that unless the presidentelect is forced to spell out 
how his spending cuts would work bush will try later to blame 
congress for boosting taxes while ignoring his flexible freeze 
approach 
bush said last week he intends to appoint people to begin deficit 
negotiations with congress on his first day in office but he has 
not said whether he will submit his own spending plan or simply use 
president reagans final budget as the starting point for 
discussions 
wright said if bush did not want to submit a separate budget then 
reagan should consider allowing bush to incorporate his own 
recommendations into the administrations 1990 budget which reagan 
will submit on jan 9 
this would be an act of smooth transition and the kind of 
resolute leadership which could inspire greater confidence both from 
the public and from financial markets at home and abroad wright 
said 
volcker in his testimony sounded many of the same warnings as 
his successor at the fed alan greenspan in testimomy before the 
commission two weeks ago greenspan said the deficit had begun to 
eat away at the foundations of our economic strength and the need 
to deal with it is becoming ever more urgent 
volcker said since the current economic recovery began in late 
1982 the country has been on a consumption binge fueled by the huge 
budget deficits and large flows of foreign capital into the country 
to keep foreigners from losing confidence in the us economy 
volcker said the government needed to launch a credible deficit 
reduction program that would bring the deficit down by between 30 
billion to 40 billion each year until the budget reaches surplus 
the deficit in the last fiscal year was 1551 billion 
volcker said he would favor using a gasoline tax to raise extra 
revenues saying each 1centpergallon boost in the tax raises 1 
billion annually in new revenues this tax would promote 
conservation volcker said thus reducing us dependence on foreign 
oil and helping to trim americas huge trade deficits 
the council on competitiveness composed of 157 chief executives 
from business organized labor and higher education presented the 
commission with a list of proposals to trim the deficit by 120 
billion by 1993 with a combination of spending cuts and 48 billion 
in higher taxes 
among the taxes the council suggested were a boost in excise 
taxes on cigarettes and alcohol which would raise 8 billion 
annually a 20centpergallon increase in the gasoline tax which 
would raise 20 billion annually and higher income tax rates for 
families earning more than 220350 a year which could bring in 7 
billion in additional revenues the council said 
former rep robert giaimo dconn and cochairman of the 
committee for a responsible federal budget said a nationwide series 
of town meetings had shown him that americans support balancing the 
budget even it means tax increases and a freeze in costofliving 
hikes for social security 
charles bowsher head of the general accounting office presented 
the commission with a gao transition report which came to the 
conclusion that bushs flexible freeze would not be enough to 
eliminate the deficit and consideration would have to be given to 
increasing taxes 
when the longterm health of our nations economy is at stake 
everything must be negotiable including defense spending 
entitlements and taxes bowsher said 
meanwhile health and human services secretary otis r bowen has 
registered his objections to proposals by the white houses office 
of management and budget to cut medicaid payments to states next 
year and to reduce the growth in spending on aids 
in a letter bowen wrote to omb director joseph r wright jr 
reported in thursdays editions of the washington post the 
secretary called the medicaid proposal unrealistic 
omb wants to slash federal medicaid payments to states by 11 
billion and to allow aids spending to grow from 13 billion to 
16 billion bowen wants the government to spend 19 billion on 
aids

the general assembly voted 1512 to condemn 
the united states for not letting yasser arafat enter the country 
and gave it until today to reverse the decision us officials said 
they would not budge 
if arafat the plo chairman is not granted a us visa arab 
nations will offer a resolution to reconvene the general assembly in 
geneva so arafat can address it diplomats said passage was assured 
the united states and israel opposed wednesdays condemnation 
britain abstained because it said the criticism was too harsh but 
all other us allies supported the denunciation 
the vote was conducted in a rare and dramatic roll call 
requested by jordan 
in a departure from the standard electronic voting delegates 
voted in the official un languages arabic english chinese 
french russian and spanish they called out nam yes 
zan cheng 0ui da si and in the case of israel 
and the united states no 
absent from the roll call were dominica grenada paraguay st 
kitts nevis and south africa 
the resolution asked un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar to inform the general assembly by tonight of the us 
response secretary of state george p shultz said the united states 
would not change its mind 
the state department denied arafat a visa on security grounds 
saying he condones and encourages terrorism perpetrated by the 
palestine liberation organization 
arafat had said he wanted to explain to the general assembly the 
position taken by the palestine national council in its recent 
meeting in algiers the council the plos parliament in exile 
implicitly recognized israels right to exist accepting key un 
resolutions on the middle east calling for negotiations with states 
in the region 
iraqi ambassador ismat kittani said if arafat does not receive a 
visa it will constitute a grievous blow to the process of peace 
in the middle east 
i feel very pained to see that the united states is the odd 
couple with israel in the united nations said clovis maksoud 
ambassador of the arab league which sponsored the resolution 
we are hopeful the international outcry against the us 
position will jolt the subsequent us administration into a 
reassessment of its policies of bias toward israel he said 
arab diplomats said they would quickly introduce a resolution to 
shift the general assembly to geneva in middecember the second 
resolution would likely be voted on by early next week and the 
diplomats said they had the votes to pass it 
the united states says it does not oppose a move to geneva and 
would participate in debate there 
undersecretarygeneral joseph verner reed said plans were already 
under way to move the assembly to geneva the european headquarters 
of the world body it would be the first time the assembly has moved 
as an act of protest 
the plo has had a un mission in new york since 1975 and holds 
nonvoting observer status it is considered the sole legitimate 
representative of the palestinian people and is invited to speak on 
all debates concerning palestinians and the middle east 
under the 1947 usun headquarters agreement the united 
states is required to grant visas to un diplomats and invitees on 
un business 
in debate wednesday us ambassador herbert s okun reiterated 
the state departments assertion that the headquarters agreement 
allows the united states to protect its security interests 
the general assembly debate on the palestinian issue originally 
was scheduled today friday and dec 6 but has been postponed 
diplomatic sources said the week of dec 1216 would be the most 
likely time for the session in geneva 
the resolution on moving must first be heard by a 16member 
budgetary advisory committee because it has financial implications 
it then would go to the general assemblys finance committee 
formally called the fifth committee which would vote on it and send 
it to the general assembly for action 
the cost of the move to geneva was not known but un sources 
have said it would be relatively modest perhaps 150000 covering 
the travel of a small number of un personnel most nations would 
send their geneva ambassadors to the session

buyout specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
won the freeforall takeover war for rjr nabisco inc late 
wednesday with a record 2453 billion offer for the 
cigaretteandfood giant 
the 109ashare offer shattered a rival effort by an rjr 
management group and came in a day of frantic maneuvering that at 
times left the unprecedented auction for the company in utter 
confusion 
kohlbergs offer of 81 in cash 18 in stock and additional 
securities worth 10 beat out a lastminute offer valued at 112 or 
252 billion by the management group that instigated the takeover 
struggle last month at a price that was 83 billion cheaper 
the value of kohlbergs offer was nearly double that of the 
previous record a 134 billion takeover of gulf corp by chevron 
corp in march 1984 
although the management offer looked higher in face value rjr 
said in a statement that its board of directors concluded the 
kohlberg offer was worth substantially the same 
the board of directors of rjr nabisco by unanimous vote of all 
directors present adopted the kkr offer as being in the best 
interest of the company and its shareholders rjr said 
kohlberg the undisputed leader in the business of buying 
companies with borrowed money in deals known as leveraged buyouts 
issued a statement that it was pleased with the decision that capped 
the biggest takeover in history 
we are also pleased that this process has come to an end so 
that the employees of rjr its consumers and suppliers and the 
communities it serves can be assured that business will now return 
to normal and stability will be restored kohlbergs two 
principals henry r kravis and george roberts said in the 
statement 
kohlbergs victory caps a struggle that broke all previous 
takeover records and raised major questions about the frenzy of 
leveraged buyouts and other debtfinanced restructurings 
transforming much of corporate america 
the end of the rjr battle also signaled a spectacular defeat by 
its chief executive f ross johnson who began the takeover struggle 
last month with a 75 a share offer that he later raised four times 
johnson known as a scrappy adversary unafraid of taking risks 
had no immediate comment on kohlbergs victory it wasnt 
immediately clear whether he would take another tack in what has 
been an unpredictable battle 
earlier in the day johnsons group made an 11thhour effort to 
raise its bid from 101 a share to 108 a share after a 
companydecreed deadline for all offers had expired the move 
temporarily upended a 106ashare 238 billion offer from 
kohlberg kravis that was about to be approved sources said 
that development made the already unwieldy auction even more 
chaotic and raised questions about whether all bidders were 
receiving equal treatment it also sent rjrs stock roaring higher 
partly in anticipation that the unprecedented auction might be 
prolonged yet again 
sources familiar with the bidding also said the offer of a third 
contender first boston corp was rejected as too tentative 
although the bidder valued it as high as 115 a share or 2587 
billion 
a crucial element of each proposal was the portion of cash each 
bidder intended to pay because the value of the securities segment 
is difficult to determine these securities often are worth less 
than their face amount 
rjr stock surged on the new york stock exchange and the big board 
briefly halted trading when buy orders overwhelmed sell orders on 
wednesday the stock resumed trading by midafternoon and closed up 
225 to 93 on volume exceeding 67 million shares 
rjr stock was trading at less than 56 a share when the battle 
began in late october 
johnsons group incited the battle when he proposed to take the 
nations 19thlargest industrial company private via a leveraged 
buyout 
rjrs board of directors then put the company up for sale to 
attract rival bids and conducted the first round of an auction nov 
1820 they decided to prolong it because the offers received were 
too vague and inadequate 
rjr is one of the largest consumer products companies with more 
than 120000 employees it makes wellknown brands that range from 
camel cigarettes to shredded wheat cereal to life savers candy

the pentagon citing technical difficulties has 
cut links for several days between an unclassified military computer 
network and a nationwide academic and corporate computer network 
the new york times reported thursday 
several computer security experts said wednesday that they had 
been told by pentagon officials that the network connection was 
severed after an unknown intruder illegally gained entry recently to 
several computers operated by the military and defense contractors 
according to the times 
the computer specialists said they thought the pentagon broke the 
connection which permits military and academic researchers to 
exchange information while it tried to eliminate a security flaw in 
the computers in the military network the newspaper reported 
an unidentified spokesman for the defense communication agency 
told the times in a statement that the links between the two 
networks were cut at 10 pm monday and were expected to be restored 
thursday 
the department of defense apparently acted after a computer at 
the mitre corp a bedford mass company with several military 
contracts was illegally entered several times during the past 
month according to the times 
officials at several universities in the united states and canada 
said their computers had been used by the intruder to reach the 
mitre computer 
marcia cohen a spokeswoman for mitre told the times wednesday 
that one of the companys computers had been entered but she said 
no classified or sensitive information had been handled by the 
computers involved and the problem was fixed within hours of being 
detected 
the military computer network known as milnet is linked through 
seven gateways to another larger computer network arpanet which 
was jammed last month by a rogue program introduced by a cornell 
university graduate student 
the decision to disconnect the military computers upset a number 
of computer users around the country 
john rochlis assistant network manager at the massachusetts 
institute of technology said that a computer user complained 
tuesday night that he could not send mail 
initially we were given the run around but eventually they 
unofficially confirmed to us that the shutoff was security 
related he added

federal authorities are investigating an alleged 
scheme to illegally ship a chemical used to make nerve gas to iran 
from the united states the st louis postdispatch reported 
documents filed in us district court in st louis say a company 
in baltimore attempted to ship thiodiglycol a chemical precursor of 
mustard gas to iran via singapore and pakistan the postdispatch 
said in its thursday editions 
the documents were filed in an application for a search warrant 
which sought telexes computer printouts and records of messages 
between alcolac international inc of baltimore maker of the 
chemical and two companies in west germany and singapore 
in the 8year war between iran and iraq both sides but 
particularly iraq were accused of using chemical weapons both 
sides denied using the weapons which are outlawed under the geneva 
convention 
thiodiglycol has permissible applications in the textile 
industry but its export is restricted under us export laws to 
prevent diversion to iran iraq and syria for use in chemical 
warfare the affidavit says 
the us customs service outlined the scheme in a 14page 
affidavit file in their application for the search warrant 
the affidavit says alcolac began shipping thiodiglycol in 
february 1987 for colimex gmbh a west german company now called 
chemco gmbh amp co kg 
alcolacs shipping documents referred to the cargo by its trade 
name kromfax rather by its chemical name the documents had been 
manipulated to make it possible to divert the cargo to karachi 
pakistan in violation of us export administration regulations 
the affidavit says 
the cargo began its journey by barge from baltimore to norfolk 
where customs agents intercepted it and switched the kromfax drums 
with drums of water 
customs agents then monitored the cargos route to singapore and 
its transshipment to karachi 
in late june agents with the drug enforcement administration 
learned from customs officials in karachi that the shipment had been 
transferred to an iranian flagship named ss iran ekram 
the cargo then made its way to the iranian port at bandar abbas 
it was set to be delivered ultimately to a company in tehran the 
capital of iran 
the affidavit says an undated telex from walaschek to alcolac 
indicates that he intended to cause the shipment of thiodiglycol 
to be transshipped from singapore to pakistan and ultimately iran 
and that alcolac knew that singapore was not the ultimate 
destination for the shipment 
alcolac international was incorporated in baltimore in 1955 paul 
jones vice president and general manager of the performance 
chemicals division said the company manufactured specialty 
chemicals like those in shampoos thiodiglycol is a solvent he 
said

chicken rather than beef and pork and fresh 
vegetables rather than canned or frozen ones are likely to be the 
best bargains for consumers in 1989 according to a top agriculture 
department food economist 
prices for eggs are likely to shoot upward as much as 20 percent 
and substantial price increases for fresh fruits cereals and bakery 
products also can be expected department economist ralph parlett 
says in a 1989 outlook report issued wednesday 
overall consumer food prices should rise about 3 to 5 percent 
next year parlett said roughly equaling this years 4 percent 
increase this years rise means food prices have about kept pace 
with price increases in the rest of the economy although consumers 
may notice their food bills more because of more frequent trips to 
the grocery store he said 
a variety of factors influence food costs including the amount 
farmers make for the raw commodities the costs of packaging 
materials and charges for processing and distribution in 1988 
packaging cost increases were the main contributor to a 5 percent 
increase in processing and distribution expense while farmers 
averaged 35 percent more for their raw products 
for 1989 parlett said increases in egg prices will be the 
sharpest in the marketbasket 15 to 20 percent in part because of a 
squeeze produced by increased use of eggs in processing and a 
decline in production because of higher feed costs and poor returns 
to producers 
other steep increases are likely in fresh fruits which may go up 
6 to 9 percent because of strong consumer demand both domestically 
and in the export market orange prices are likely to remain strong 
because of growing purchases by japan and a smaller apple crop will 
lead to higher prices there 
continued effects of the 1988 drought will be felt in the area of 
cereals and bakery products parlett said prices are expected to 
rise 4 to 7 percent next year due to a combination of grain price 
increases and strengthened demand from healthconscious consumers 
who see cereals as a good and easytoprepare nutrition source 
the biggest bargain for shoppers compared to current prices 
will be in poultry parlett said growing supplies will bring prices 
down by at least 4 percent and possibly as much as 7 percent he 
said beef production next year is likely to drop by 6 to 8 percent 
leading to a moderate 1 to 3 percent price increase similar to that 
expected for pork 
prices for fresh vegetables which climbed this year because of 
the drought will show little change next year because of expanding 
production the economist forecast parlett said he expects an 
increase in the range of 0 to 3 percent compared to a 4 to 7 
percent increase for processed vegetables

prices farmers received for raw products in 
november declined slightly from a month earlier but remained nearly 
8 percent above their level of a year ago the agriculture 
department says 
the departments agricultural statistics board said in its 
preliminary report wednesday that lower prices for hogs corn 
grapefruit and soybeans were partly offset by higher prices for 
tomatoes potatoes milk and sweet corn resulting in an overall 
drop of nearly 1 percent for the month 
in part driven by the summers drought prices received by 
farmers had been rising throughout most of 1988 until september 
when the increase leveled off novembers decline was the first drop 
in the price index since february 
despite the decline of the overall price index some commodities 
continued higher in november wheat for example rose an additional 
6 cents per bushel to a us farm price average of 390 per bushel 
the most since it was 395 in may 1981 
prices of livestock and livestock products as a group were off 
just less than 1 percent from october hog prices at 36 per 
hundredweight were the lowest since june 1980 while beef cattle 
prices were unchanged at 6710 dairy products and eggs were 
higher while broiler prices declined compared with november 1987 
the index was up 56 percent 
the departments allcrops price index for november although 
unchanged from october was up 11 percent from a year earlier 
prices of feed grain and hay as a group declined 37 percent from 
last month and averaged 49 percent above the yearearlier level 
prices of commercial vegetables were up 22 percent from october 
but off 30 percent from november 1987 tomatoes led the price 
increases while carrot prices decreased slightly 
although the projections are subject to change usda economists 
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of 55 
billion to 60 billion this year compared with the record level of 
571 billion in 1987 that is the difference between cash receipts 
and cash expenses during the calendar year 
preliminary figures show that food prices for 1988 will average a 
4 percent increase about the same as last years increase for 
1989 department economists are projecting food cost hikes in the 
same range about 3 to 5 percent

vice presidentelect dan quayle may spend more 
time than his predecessors presiding over the senate a move that 
could spell conflict between the democraticcontrolled chamber and 
the administration 
in an interview quayle on wednesday also made his strongest 
public rejection of the notion that he will act as the link between 
the administration and the republican partys far right 
he also said his verbal gaffes during the campaign gave him some 
hard lessons about his own tendency to talk too much being besieged 
with questions and jokes about his qualifications was painful but 
educational he said 
i know myself better now im a stronger person he said 
quayle said his focus now is on the task ahead picking his vice 
presidential staff during the transition period and working with 
presidentelect george bush 
since the election conservatives have beaten a path to quayles 
transition office seeking his ear quayle himself is an ardent 
conservative who has largely supported reagan administration 
positions during his eight years in the senate 
ive worked with a number of conservatives in the past a lot 
of good friends are conservatives but im not the point man for the 
conservatives in this administration you wont see me being the 
socalled spear carrier for all the socalled conservative issues 
quayle said 
quayle also hinted that he may take a more active role in his 
official capacity as president of the senate presiding over the 
democraticcontrolled chamber more frequently 
its certainly an option there have been suggestions to me 
by many that i consider spending more time in the senate than my 
predecessors have i have not made a decision on that he said 
the presiding officer has substantial discretion as to which 
senator to recognize for the purpose of offering amendments bills 
and motions normally the chair is occupied by a member of the 
majority party a republican in charge could touch off partisan 
parliamentary warfare 
the vice president may take the presiding chair at any time and 
the presiding officers decision to recognize a senator is not 
subject to a point of order or appeal under senate rules 
bush has said he wants to work with congress and quayle said if 
he did decide to preside more often it would not be done in a 
contentious manner 
i would be fair and objective and do what the president of the 
senate should do to protect senators rights all senators 
rights he said 
during the interview quayle was relaxed and friendly but 
clearly weighing his words he has not generally spoken to the press 
in depth since the election he confessed to being far more 
careful of what i say today than six months ago 
i also try to discipline myself when i get into a situation 
instead of being verbose which is a tendency that i have to be 
concise because verbosity leads to unclear inarticulate things 
also on wednesday quayle met with retiring indiana gov robert 
d orr a republican who will appoint quayles replacement in the 
senate quayle will resign effective jan 2 so his replacement can 
have seniority over other incoming senators 
orr has not said whom he will appoint and quayle said he made no 
recommendation but he did not reject a reporters suggestion that 
he favors rep dan coats who was quayles district representative 
in fort wayne ind while quayle was in the house from 1976 to 
1980 coats now represents quayles old congressional district 
obviously i think a lot of dan coats he worked for me for four 
years hes been a very good congressman from my old congressional 
district he took my seat weve had a long and strong personal and 
professional relationship quayle said 
on another subject quayle said the vice presidential mansion in 
the district of columbia may need alterations before his family can 
move in after the inauguration he said the house is not configured 
for a family with three children it does have six bedrooms but 
some of them now serve as offices and servants quarters and some do 
not have closets 
the quayles will live at their home in mclean va until they 
can move into the official residence their three children tucker 
14 benjamin 12 and corinne 10 will continue attending public 
schools in virginia for the time being

the war on drugs is overwhelming a criminal 
justice system whose greatest problem is lack of resources not 
legal protections afforded criminal suspects a twoyear american 
bar association study concludes 
the entire system is starved police prosecution criminal 
defense courts and corrections says the report by an aba 
committee as currently funded the criminal justice system cannot 
provide the quality of justice that the public legitimately expects 
and that the people working within the system wish to deliver 
less than 3 percent of all government spending in the united 
states went to support civil and criminal justice activities in 
fiscal 1985 a previously released federal study has shown 
those already thin resources are being overwhelmed by a massive 
but largely unsuccessful battle against illegal drugs the aba 
panel concluded 
it said that while courts are increasingly clogged the drug 
problem is growing worse and law enforcement has been unable 
to control it 
the aba study noted political disputes about the miranda decision 
but found relatively few problems in the field related to it that 
decision issued in 1966 by the supreme court said police must warn 
suspects of their right to remain silent and to consult with a 
lawyer before any questioning takes place 
while the miranda decision has sparked heated controversy on a 
political level the restrictions itsaid 
eightyseven percent of prosecutors surveyed for the study said 
no more than 5 percent of their cases were dismissed because of 
problems involving the miranda requirements 
the exclusionary rule under which evidence obtained illegally 
by police may not be used in court also has caused few major 
problems the study concluded some police officials in fact told 
the panel that the demands of the exclusionary rule have promoted 
professionalism in the nations police departments 
most prosecutors put the number of cases dismissed because of the 
exclusionary rule at 5 percent or less while threequarters of the 
judges and defense lawyers polled said suppression motions succeed 
just 10 percent or less of the time 
the study was based on testimony from the legal community and a 
national telephone survey of police prosecutors defense attorneys 
and judges it was compiled by a panel chaired by samuel dash 
former chief counsel to the senate watergate committee and a 
georgetown university law professor 
the study said efforts to bring the nations drug problem under 
control are swamping the criminal justice system 
police prosecutors and judges told the committee that they 
have been unsuccessful in making a significant impact on the 
importation sale and use of illegal drugs despite devoting much of 
their resources to the arrest prosecution and trial of drug 
offenders the panel reported 
these extraordinary efforts have instead distorted and 
overwhelmed the criminal justice system crowding dockets and jails 
and diluting law enforcement and judicial efforts to deal with other 
major criminal cases 
the panel recommended that the aba set up a special commission to 
study and reevaluate national state and local strategies in 
dealing with the drug problem and to educate the public and 
lawmakers as well as government policymakers

texans in congress will have a tough time 
persuading their colleagues to spend the billions of dollars needed 
to build the super collider sen lloyd bentsen says 
ill be working very hard to get it funded bentsen said 
its going to be exceedingly difficult to get 
even when seven states were candidates for the potentially 
lucrative physics project congress was adamant about financing the 
super collider it voted earlier this year to give the project 100 
million less than onethird of president reagans request for 363 
million and decreed none of the money could be spent on 
construction 
its going to be uphill and tough and particularly now because 
its just one state bentsen chairman of the influential senate 
finance committee told a group of texas reporters in washington on 
wednesday we had seven states working on it before 
now that a site in ellis county has been chosen by the energy 
department for the super collider at least one member of congress 
from a state that lost its bid to host the project is questioning 
the feasibility of finding enough construction money the super 
collider is expected to cost 44 billion and to create thousands 
of construction and scientific jobs 
rep john dingell dmich said last week that the 
superconducting super collider was in trouble and would likely be 
doomed by budget constraints and opposition from others in the 
scientific community 
and quite honestly the way the program has been set up the 
consequences are that theres really very limited support outside of 
one particular state said dingell chairman of the house energy 
and commerce committee i havent said its going to go down the 
drain but its in serious difficulty 
he said it stood a chance of one or two in 10 of ever being built

the nations nuclear power plants have become 
safer and more efficient over the last four years according to the 
head of the nuclear regulatory commission 
the remarks by chairman lando w zech jr came at ceremonies 
wednesday to dedicate an 18story headquarters building for the nrc 
in suburban rockville md 
i am pleased to report that we are seeing evidence that overall 
performance is improving zech told the gathering 
spokesmen for antinuclear groups challenged zechs upbeat 
assessment with one contending that the situation with power 
reactors amounted to a mixed bag of improvements and problem 
areas 
from 1984 until now there has been a clear and definite 
improvement zech said noting that the nrc began an analysis in 
that year of safety indicators zech said there had been reductions 
in significant operating events at power reactors unplanned 
automatic shutdowns safety system activations precursor events 
signaling the possibility of a major accident as well as exposure of 
workers to radiation 
along with this improvement in critical safety performance 
indicators we have seen improvements in plant reliability and 
availability zech said recent data shows an increase in the 
average capacity factors for us reactors from about 59 percent in 
1986 to almost 67 percent in 1988 
the capacity factor is the actual output of a plant compared with 
what it would generate if it operated at full power all the time 
nrc spokesman john kopeck later provided the following specific 
figures for the performance indicators cited by zech 
significant operating events or major problems 24 per 
operating reactor in 1985 16 in 1986 and 08 in 1987 
unplanned automatic shutdowns 524 per reactor in 1984 504 in 
1985 396 in 1986 and 324 in 1987 
safety system activations 276 per reactor in 1984 26 in 
1985 204 in 1986 and 168 in 1987 
precursor events a nationwide total of 17 in 1984 10 in 1985 
and 6 in 1986 
radiation exposure 714 manrem in 1984 574 manrem in 1985 
431 in 1986 and 425 in 1987 
manrem is a measure of radiation exposure for large numbers of 
people for example when 100 people receive an average exposure of 
001 rem that would result in a figure of 1 manrem 
spokesmen for antinuclear groups said they had questions about 
zechs assessment of overall plant performance 
kenneth bossong of public citizen a washingtonbased public 
interest group founded by consumer advocate ralph nader said 
its a mixed bag there are some positives and there are some 
negatives its not fair or accurate for zech to say everything is 
looking better because its not 
for example bossong said on the radiation issue what he said 
is true as far as it went but its not complete the average dose 
per worker at nuclear power plants has decreased since 1984 but the 
number of workers exposed on the other hand has increased 
he said the number of workers exposed has increased from 93000 
in 1985 to slightly more than 100000 in 1986 and 104000 workers in 
1987 
michael mariotte director of the nuclear information and 
resource service another washingtonbased public interest group 
said there may be a slightly improving track record however 
theres no reason to be smug about it it seems like every time 
they think something has been solved they find a new problem 
the new 286000squarefoot nrc headquarters building purchased 
by the government for 475 million provides space for about 1400 
nrc employees it marks an effort to consolidate operations of the 
agency which previously were dispersed among 10 separate buildings 
a second structure is to be built at the same rockville site by 
1991 to accommodate the rest of the agencys washington area 
employees

winner of an unprecedented tv debate in which he dueled with his 
official counterpart and urged the government to legalize the banned 
labor movement 
this is a fantastic day beautiful which will be noted in the 
history of our country as a great victory for solidarity said 
film director andrzej wajda after wednesday nights showdown between 
the solidarity chairman and alfred miodowicz head of the 
governments official trade unions 
he was perfect just perfect a grinning adam michnik a 
senior solidarity adviser said of walesa 
it was the first time in five years that walesa had a chance to 
defend his federation on statecontrolled television and his longest 
appearance ever on polish tv 
the exchange was broadcast live and uncensored a clock was even 
placed in the background of the set to demonstrate that no deletions 
were made 
in the 43minute debate an animated walesa spoke rapidly 
challenging authorities to legalize solidarity he urged the 
official unions to join solidarity in creating freedom 
he also said miodowicz as a member of the ruling communist party 
politburo and as leader of the allpoland alliance of trade unions 
should press for the legalization of the outlawed labor movement 
if you can make a mans decision that there is a place for 
solidarity we will immediately roll up our sleeves and we will 
begin working hard for poland because time is running out walesa 
told the 59yearold former steelworker 
solidarity the east blocs first independent union federation 
was crushed under martial law in 1981 and banned in 1982 
miodowiczs group known by its polish initials opzz was created by 
the government in 1982 to replace it 
the official unions say they have 7 million members including 
45 million former solidarity members 
solidarity was founded during a turbulent series of strikes in 
1980 in its heyday it said it had 10 million members 
in the debate walesa said proposed talks between the opposition 
and government could begin when officials acknowledge solidaritys 
right to exist 
after the broadcast walesa told reporters he suffered from a 
severe case of flu that hampered his performance and made him too 
impulsive 
miodowicz interviewed as he left the debate set said only i 
have fulfilled my task i am pleased that mr walesa accepted my 
invitation 
the staterun pap news agency said that although the two debaters 
disagreed the very fact of the meeting is a good prognosis for 
overcoming barriers in reaching dialogue and national 
agreement 
the debate brought thousands of rapt poles to television sets in 
warsaws central station grzegorz streszynski missed his train to 
western poland to watch walesa made great remarks i waited seven 
years to hear them he said afterward 
walesa said during the debate that all socialist countries were 
in difficult straits and blamed their problems on a lack of 
pluralism independent groups and ideas in public life 
in a reference to changes under way in the soviet union he said 
conditions had never been better for reform but that poland 
nevertheless was merely toddling in place 
miodowicz said said each enterprise should have only one trade 
union to avoid dividing the workforce he said some solidarity 
backers have shouted antistate slogans like down with the 
commune which he called terrifying 
our society must have peace at least social peace at least 
security for society he said 
he urged solidarity supporters to enlist in his trade unions 
but walesa a 1983 nobel peace prize winner said you want me 
to come on my knees to your union i dont want to i want to be 
myself 
dressed in a gray suit and wearing a solidarity badge and an 
image of the madonna on his lapel walesa 45 looked relaxed as sat 
next to his debate opponent both in leather lounge chairs 
as the debate progressed walesa took the offensive gesturing 
broadly with his hands the solidarity leader did most of the 
talking overall 
miodowicz proposed the debate nov 14 during an interview with 
the official communist party daily newspaper trybuna ludu 
the last time walesa defended solidarity on polish television was 
in 1983 when he responded to a speech given by thendeputy prime 
minister mieczyslaw f rakowski who now serves as prime minister

even before george bush was elected president 
his personnel chief was closeted with president reagans going over 
hundreds of sheets of paper that will help shape the staffing of the 
new administration 
it was part of a project initiated by the office of presidential 
personnel designed in part to provide the incoming president with an 
unprecedented amount of information about the nature and 
requirements of the jobs he must fill 
bradley h patterson a white house staffer in three past 
republican administrations discussed the project in his new book 
ring of power saying such interpresidential foresightedness 
shows the modern white house at its best 
a catalogue of all the fulltime and parttime presidentially 
appointed jobs in the executive branch their titles terms pay 
levels and in brief their current duties is being saved for the 
recruiters who serving the next president will occupy the 
presidential personnel office chairs patterson said 
the catalogues may even be available to the candidates 
following the conventions he wrote 
it didnt turn out quite that way though although bushs people 
were poring over the documents before nov 8 aides to democratic 
nominee michael dukakis never even got a peek 
we never heard from the dukakis people robert h tuttle 
director of presidential personnel said in an interview they 
never called he conceded he didnt call them either but said 
they knew where i was they knew my number 
he said the information was shared with the bush staff in 
anticipation of bushs victory 
tuttle said he met with chase untermeyer bushs transition 
personnel director just about the time of the election i think 
we did some before and some after 
untermeyer briefing reporters wednesday said the people whom 
we are hiring right now to go to work on recommending the jobs 
to be filled on behalf of the presidentelect have as much material 
preparation as has ever been the case before 
one of the resources available to me that frankly wasnt 
available to my counterpart on the dukakis campaign was being able 
to spend 12 different sessions in the white house with bob tuttle 
and his people going over just what is the current presidential 
personnel system untermeyer said 
too often in the past said untermeyer the system used was one 
known by the acronym bogsat which he said stands for bunch of 
guys sitting around a table 
tuttle said there are 551 executive branch positions not 
counting 135 ambassadors filled by presidential appointment subject 
to senate confirmation 
we went through each one in detail with my associate director 
and so we probably spent 20 or 30 hours with chase untermeyer going 
through these he said 
tuttle also said that at the request of both reagan and bush his 
office called all presidential appointees and asked them do you 
want to continue in your present job and are there other jobs you 
are interested in 
he said he met with untermeyer last week and went over the 
responses in which a great percentage said they either wanted 
to keep their present job or take a new job in the administration 
untermeyer said he is following up on this by speaking to the 
incumbent cabinet secretaries and asking them for their very 
candid appraisal of each of those individuals who are the ones 
whose resignations we should accept and let return to the private 
sector who are those who are doing such a good job or have such 
unique skills that they should stay in their present job 
the latter he added will be as mr bush has said the 
exception rather than the rule

john tower the former senator and leading 
candidate to be secretary of defense in the next administration is 
registered as a lobbyist for five large defense companies according 
to a tower associate and congressional records 
tower former chairman of the senate armed services committee is 
the chief candidate to take over the top pentagon spot but 
presidentelect george bush hasnt yet made a final decision 
according to sources speaking wednesday on condition of anonymity 
some bush aides oppose tower because they fear he wouldnt push 
hard enough to reform the pentagons problemplagued system for 
buying weapons the sources said 
bush sidestepped the question wednesday asked by reporters about 
reports of staff dissension over tower bush said only stay 
tuned repeating his favorite refrain on administration 
nominations he said all is tranquil within his staff 
representatives of bush and tower are negotiating over who might 
be named to highlevel defense department jobs the sources said 
tower 63 retired from congress in 1985 after a 24year career 
in the senate capped by his chairmanship of the senate armed 
services committee during president reagans first term 
after he retired tower was named by reagan as a member of the 
us team negotiating with the soviets for deep cuts in the 
ussoviet arsenals of longrange weapons he quit after 14 months 
in that post and set up a consulting firm tower amp associates 
early this year the white house asked tower to help lobby his 
former senate colleagues to ratify the treaty ridding europe and the 
soviet union of mediumrange nuclear weapons said richard billmire 
a tower associate 
tower did not return telephone calls but billmire said the 
company registered feb 2 as a lobbyist because tower didnt want 
any conflictofinterest questions raised about his work on the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty as the agreement is known 
tower amp associates is registered as a lobbyist for 
martinmarietta textron ltv aerospace and defense co british 
aerospace and rockwell international 
tower is a consultant to the five firms billmire said and as 
such would not be required to register as a lobbyist unless he 
lobbied congress on their behalf 
we registered because the white house asked for our help on the 
inf treaty and we were working as consultants for these companies at 
the same time said billmire 
the companies make some components which go into systems that 
are used for weapons affected by the treaty he explained tower 
wanted to be absolutely clear and up front about his connections 
with the companies and he didnt want anybody saying that the reason 
tower was saying this or that about the treaty was because it would 
have helped one of his clients 
billmire declined to say what the firm was paid by the five 
companies but tower might be expected to have received more than 
50000 annually from each according to a defense contractor who 
spoke wednesday on condition he not be named 
tower is also a member of the board of directors of the us 
subsidiary of british aerospace that subsidiary is based in 
delaware

political eccentric lyndon larouches 
security fund was used to pay for items including a piano 
haircuts flowers shoes and cufflinks according to testimony in 
his tax fraud trial 
larouche financial officer kathy magraw acknowledged on wednesday 
that the movements security account paid for items which 
according to prosecutors should have been declared as taxable 
income 
larouches trial continues today in us district court where he 
is charged with conspiring to defraud the internal revenue service 
a grand jury accused larouche of failing to declare as income the 
personal and household expenses financed by his organizations and 
of refusing to file federal tax returns since 1979 
by calling ms magraw to the stand prosecutors continued using a 
strategy of compelling larouche aides to testify about the 
movements finances under grants of limited immunity from 
prosecution 
assistant us attorney kent robinson said ms magraws testimony 
would not only support the tax count but charges that larouche and 
six codefendants in the case conspired to defraud lenders by not 
repaying their loans to his organizations 
the personal expenditures cited by ms magraw were made while the 
larouche organization was contending that no discretionary money was 
available to repay some 25 million of the more than 30 million 
lent to the movement about 5 million was repaid according to 
earlier testimony 
trying to rebut the personal expense testimony defense lawyers 
attempted to show that the vast majority of money spent for larouche 
was for legitimate security and research purposes not for his 
personal benefit 
the defense effort was cut short however by us district judge 
albert v bryan jr he refused to allow any defense questioning of 
ms magraw on the movements need for consultants who were paid 
weekly monthly daily and flat payments defense lawyers described 
the consultants as national security experts 
the defense struck out too when it tried to question the 
witness about payments for security protection for two latin 
american members of larouches organization the defense contended 
they were threatened by drug dealers and were given refuge with 
their families in larouches leesburg va estate 
the government on the other hand was permitted to introduce a 
memo prepared by ms magraw in which she said listing consultant 
payments under legal investigations services rendered for 
personal research was not a particularly defensible position 
under irs scrutiny 
ms magraw testified that she really didnt know if the expenses 
were listed improperly under irs regulations 
robinson the prosecutor had ms magraw read for jurors some of 
the expenses from larouches security fund which was designed 
for the personal security of larouche his aides and his guests 
among the items was a 7000 piano and furniture for larouches 
leesburg estate cufflinks for larouche shoes for larouches wife 
helga film clothes for larouche flowers luggage costing 41596 
a hairdresser appointment for mrs larouche and a 10 haircut for 
larouche a 25 hairdresser appointment for an unidentified person 
and reimbursement for a wine purchase 
ms magraw said the furniture and piano were for a building where 
the larouche organization scheduled political and cultural events 
larouches political movement embraces a number of unorthodox 
positions and relies heavily on conspiracy theories involving such 
figures as former secretary of state henry kissinger and the queen 
of england 
another larouche finance officer richard welsh testified 
wednesday that he thought kissinger might be responsible for the 
movements financial problems 
welsh said he based his theory in part on a letter from 
kissinger to the fbi in 1982 which the larouche organization 
obtained under the freedom of information act 
kissinger wrote because these people have been getting 
increasingly obnoxious i have taken the liberty of asking my 
lawyer bill rogers to get in touch with you to ask your advice 
especially with respect to security 
welsh testified that he sent a memo to larouche about kissinger 
in october 1984 in the midst of larouches second of three 
presidential campaigns 
you stated in the memo that kissinger was behind the actions 
to hurt the larouche organization financially asked assistant us 
attorney kent robinson 
it was the primary but not the only suggestion i made welsh 
testified 
larouche was indicted in october on 13 counts of mail fraud 
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the irs 
the mail fraud counts stem from promissory notes and letters of 
credit sent through the mails by the larouche organization 
conviction on all counts could carry a maximum penalty of 65 years 
in prison and fines of 325 million for larouche 
the six associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the mail 
fraud and conspiracy charges which cover the years 1983 to 1987 
on trial with larouche are his chief fundraiser william wertz 
his legal adviser edward spannaus and four fundraisers michael 
billington dennis small paul greenberg and joyce rubinstein

in the newspaper guild commingled fund could be used for payments of 
pension benefits and expenses retroactive through 1988

security at the kennedy space center 
was increased to protect the shuttle atlantis and its military 
secrets from terrorists spies and even american journalists 
security is additive to department of defense flights gary 
wistrand deputy director for security services said wednesday 
we always have security for any shuttle flight as a national 
resource for a dod launch people cant access areas where they 
would see classified data 
information about the launch the third entirely military 
shuttle mission was sharply restricted with none of the usual 
preflight briefings and news conferences the precise liftoff time 
was to be kept secret until nine minutes before launch 
german shepherds trained to sniff out bombs checked the bags of 
some journalists and other workers arriving before the launch 
news media organizations setting up remote unmanned cameras to 
photograph the atlantis liftoff had to sign defense department 
releases wednesday giving up their film in case of an accident that 
could allow photographs of the payload believed to be a 500 
million spy satellite the associated press and the new york times 
refused to sign the release and werent allow to place their cameras 
we are trying to make it as hard as possible for potential 
adversaries to find out said air force lt ron rand we do what 
we do because it serves the best interests of the us 
the national aeronautics and space administration security force 
boosts the number of personnel on duty for a military launch by 
about 25 percent wistrand said with the department of defense 
paying for the extra guard he said more than 100 security 
personnel from gate guards to plainsclothes investigators were 
assigned to the atlantis launch 
the gate guards carry revolvers and special weapons and tactics 
teams have automatic weapons wistrand said he doesnt recall any 
major security problems during a shuttle mission although guards

i think that anytime you have a piece of hardware that is

we dont have any intelligence to that effect wistrand said 
i do think it presents a rather difficult target he said

thirdgrader victoria kennedy told her 
classmates in a hushed voice how her grandmother looked at wedding 
pictures and could not remember the names of her own family members 
matthew ouelette another westport elementary school pupil 
recalled how his neighbor an elderly woman forgot how to 
drive and forgot how to cook 
like practically everyone in their coastal town of 1850 
residents the pupils were talking about alzheimers disease as part 
of a daylong series of events wednesday put together by educators 
doctors and a drug company 
this is a test to see how much you can educate an entire town 
in one day said william connolly of new jerseybased sandoz 
pharmaceuticals corp 
the program used coloring books a mascot dog and movies to show 
how the debilitating ailment can be battled for a few hours the 
students put aside their reading writing and arithmetic to look at 
a disease that may not afflict them for 60 years if at all 
the children wanted to know how alzheimers disease gets started 
and as it happens that was one question that could not be answered 
definitively 
the purpose of the effort was not so much to understand how the 
disease works but to show how the loved ones of an alzheimers 
sufferer can with patience helpful advice and love minimize the 
worst of the diseases effects 
westport which is in the third year of a federal health and 
human services grant intended to promote community programs 
developed the alzheimers effort in meetings between school 
officials and connolly who spends summers here sandoz manufactures 
hydergine a drug that can ease some symptoms of alzheimers in 
milder cases 
for adults wednesdays program included discussions on 
positive approaches to aging a film titled there were times 
dear dramatizing a family coping with alzheimers and a lecture 
by dr william gershell a specialist in geriatrics at mount sinai 
medical center in new york city 
alzheimers afflicts an estimated 5 million mostly elderly 
americans efforts are expanding to help them cope until recently 
the focus was on patients not their families 
westport is changing that emphasis because of mounting evidence 
that children are often acutely aware of and confused by the decline 
of a loved one 
a coloring book titled helping grandma by westport high 
school art teacher betsey macdonald told the story of a grandmother 
who gradually begins to show signs of memory loss 
children are often kept in the dark about aging said 
macdonald they automatically think that old means sick but 
children are wonderfully resilient and surprisingly insightful when 
spoken to directly on the subject 
the point of the coloring book geared toward elementary school 
children is to teach them understanding and to teach them that 
what she needs is support 
connolly said a key problem with the disease is the failure to 
recognize that it is a problem 
the feeling is that to be old is to be sick and to be old is to 
be confused connolly said children ask what is wrong with an 
elderly relative and parents say well grandmas getting old 
thats not true 
one of the first things relatives can do for those showing signs 
of memory loss or other dementia is encourage them to go to a doctor 
also mature wellbehaved dogs from an animal shelter can 
provide some stability and love for an alzheimers sufferer 
connolly said jeff a black and white mongrel from a rhode island 
animal shelter has become the national poster dog for the socalled 
humananimal bonding campaign and he travels with connolly to 
events on the subject 
the alzheimers event in this southern massachusetts community 
was the second of its kind connolly macdonald and jeff tried out 
the program earlier this fall in bloomington ind

a fiveyearold girl who was kidnapped 
from her home for the second time in two years was found dead of 
strangulation and massive head injuries beside a road authorities 
say 
the body of lottie margaret rhodes a kindergarten student was 
found hours after she was kidnapped from her bedroom wednesday 
arlington police said she had been left beside an isolated road 
three miles away in neighboring grand prairie 
police said the girl had also been kidnapped from her home in 
1987 by an unknown assailant and released 
the girls mother toni rhodes 23 told police that someone 
broke into the apartment through the childs bedroom window sometime 
between 2 am wednesday when a livein babysitter checked on the 
girl and 8 am when ms rhodes discovered her daughter missing 
ms rhodes told authorities that the kidnapper had placed some 
stuffed animals under the covers on the girls bed in an apparent 
attempt to make it appear that the girl was still in the bed 
a babysitter joe martinez 18 had been caring for the girl and 
her threeyearold brother while the mother worked at an arlington 
diner 
neighbors told authorities they did not hear anything unusual 
during the night although one said his dog started barking at 2 
am but he said he did not see anything unusual when he checked the 
area by looking through a window 
the dallas county medical examiners office ruled the death a 
homicide saying that an autopsy determined that the girl died of 
asphyxia or lack of oxygen and crush force injuries to the 
head 
arlington police spokesman dee anderson said evidence also 
indicated the girl had been run over by a vehicle 
police said they had no leads and no suspects in the case and 
could not say whether the homicide was related to the 1987 incident 
in which the girl was found on june 22 wandering about five miles 
from her home 
then four the child told police that a thin blackhaired man 
about 19 years old driving a small brown car had kidnapped her 
about 930 am outside her apartment the man released her an hour 
later anderson said 
medical evidence indicated the girl may have been sexually 
assaulted in the earlier kidnapping he said police never 
apprehended the abductor anderson said 
police said they had no information on the girls father who 
neighbors said did not live with the family

people who wear hats and sunglasses to protect 
their eyes from strong sunshine could substantially reduce the risk 
of cataracts says the author of a study published today 
the research conducted on fishermen found that frequent 
exposure to intense sun tripled the risk of a common form of 
cataracts strengthening the widely held suspicion that too much sun 
is bad for the eyes just as it is for the skin 
if there is enough sunshine for you to get sunburned then you 
should be protecting your eyes said dr hugh r taylor of johns 
hopkins university 
he noted that many people have gotten used to smearing sunblock 
on their faces to prevent skin cancer but they leave their eyes 
exposed to damaging ultraviolet light the invisible portion of the 
sunbeam that burns the skin and slowly clouds the lens of the eyes 
taylor said the easiest way to protect the eyes is to put on a 
hat with a brim 
that will cut uv exposure to the eye by 50 percent and if you 
get sunglasses you can eliminate all ocular uv exposure or cut it 
down by 80 percent to 90 percent he said in an interview 
cataracts are a common health problem resulting in more than 1 
million operations in the united states each year 
taylor and colleagues estimated the annual ultraviolet exposures 
of 838 chesapeake bay watermen who work on boats these varied 
depending on how much they fished the time of year they were on the 
water and whether they wore hats and glasses among other factors 
doctors found no association between sunlight and cataracts of 
the nucleus of the lens however they found that it was strongly 
associated with cataracts of the surrounding cortex of the lens 
cortical and nuclear cataracts each account for about onethird 
of all cases that require surgery not enough fishermen in the study 
had a third variety of eye damage known as posterior subcapsular 
cataracts to determine whether they also are caused by sunlight 
the study published in the new england journal of medicine 
found that the higher the mens exposure to ultraviolet light the 
greater their risk of cortical cataracts 
the researchers divided the watermen into four groups depending 
on the intensity of their exposure the quarter with the highest 
annual exposure had three times the risk of those in the group with 
the lowest exposure 
the research showed that people who got cortical cataracts 
received on average 21 percent more ultraviolet light than those 
who did not doubling the annual ultraviolet exposure increased the 
cataract risk by 60 percent 
in an accompanying editorial dr sidney lerman of new york 
medical college wrote that prevention of light damage to the eye 
is the best and simplest approach to the problem 
taylor said that all glasses including ordinary reading glasses 
cut exposure significantly although they vary in effectiveness the 
best are plastic lenses specifically designed to block ultraviolet 
rays these can stop virtually all of these rays from reaching the 
eyes 
he said that ordinary untinted glass spectacles stop about 80 
percent of ultraviolet radiation while similar plastic lenses keep 
out 90 percent runofthemill cheap sunglasses block about 95 
percent

a student who was dismissed from the washington 
university dental school for treating patients after testing 
positive for exposure to the aids virus has sued the school for 3 
million in damages 
the student whose name is listed in the suit as john doe claims 
the school improperly barred him from its dental program last

washington university chancellor william danforth and david a 
bensinger dean of the dental school the suit does not seek to have 
the student reinstated but asks for 3 million in damages 
contending the use of rubber gloves and other protective devices 
makes the risk of transmitting the virus negligible 
school officials said the student treated 27 patients at the 
dental school for about a year after contracting the disease 
bensinger said the student tested positive for antibodies to the 
human immunodefiency syndrome hiv in late march or early april 
the student was dismissed from the school in august and was not 
allowed to enroll for the current school year 
students and instructional faculty members provide dental care at 
the schools clinic 
university officials refused to comment on the suit peter ruger 
the universitys general counsel said that the dental school was 
well within its rights in barring the student from treating patients 
and pursuing his education

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev says 
constitutional and electoral reforms are a kind of oxygen to 
revive the body politic but it is unlikely they alone can make his 
society any more democratic 
since the proposed reforms appeared on oct 2223 soviet society 
has been engaged in a remarkable debate over an overhaul of the 
electoral system and the structure of the government that gorbachev 
says is the first big step toward making soviet society into one 
governed by law rather than dictate 
the 1500 members of the supreme soviet parliament today 
overwhelmingly approved the package the amended version of which 
still has not been published in the official press 
gorbachevs promise is a weighty one in a society now reopening 
the emotional and physical scars of josef stalins purges and still 
suffering from a much more recent history of systematic jailing or 
exile of dissidents and overbearing bureaucracy 
but political reforms do not guarantee change 
political repression has been imposed in a soviet system that on 
paper guaranteed citizens rights the communist party has shown no 
interest in sharing power 
and operating in the current system critics have used 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater openness to force 
some changes in his proposals 
political reform is a kind of oxygen needed by the public 
organism gorbachev told the supreme soviet on tuesday the first 
day of a special session to consider the reform package 
if we do not carry out political reform to back up the 
processes that are now under way in the economy the social 
transformation of society and the recuperation in the cultural 
field and fail to radically update the activities of the governing 
councils and our personnel the drive for restructuring will 
inevitably begin to skid he said 
gorbachev said his solution is our own socialist system of 
checks and balances designed to protect society against any 
violations of socialist legality at the highest state level 
he called for the formation of a congress of peoples deputies a 
new 2250member legislative body formed not only in elections from 
geographic districts and ethnic territories but from organizations 
such as the communist party and trade unions 
draft legislation gave the presidency which gorbachev assumed 
oct 1 considerably more power and appeared as well to strengthen 
moscows hand with the 15 republics that make up the soviet union 
the proposals loosened an avalanche of more than 300000 
suggestions from across the soviet union and protests from at least 
a third of the republics that some of the reforms fostered the 
opposite of gorbachevs proclaimed intention to give local 
authorities more power 
in the spirit of glasnost soviet leaders got an earful of 
criticism that led them to amend about half of the almost 120 
articles before introducing them to the supreme soviet on monday in 
two days of rare debate deputies of the supreme soviet offered many 
more 
the discussion itself ill tell you frankly is 
unprecedented soviet vice president anatoly lukyanov told a news 
conference 
the tiny baltic republic of estonia where gorbachevs policy of 
greater openness already encouraged a grassroots political movement 
to demand greater autonomy has declared itself sovereign in 
internal affairs and proclaiming the right to pass judgment on new 
soviet laws 
similar organizations in the other baltic republics of latvia and 
lithuania were close behind but could not push the legislation 
through their parliaments 
the presidium of the national supreme soviet declared estonias 
action unconstitutional 
gorbachev also must rein in the communist party and government 
bureaucracies that are stubbornly resistant to change 
the president told the supreme soviet that many initiatives from 
working people are being lost in bureaucratic mazes or are even 
encountering resistance 
he won approval at the june party conference for a plan to get 
the party out of daytoday management of government and economic 
affairs concentrating instead on setting policy he has called for 
taking power from the moscow and giving it to local economic 
managers along with the responsibility of ensuring they make enough 
money to pay for their operations 
but the soviet leader regularly expresses frustration with both 
the party and government bureaucracys slow pace of change

a rotten holiday season awaits anyone who 
steals an evergreen tree planted at parks in hutchinson 
workers this week will begin spraying evergreens throughout the 
park system with a chemical retardant that puts off an odor similar 
to rotten eggs when exposed to temperatures above 50 degrees 
the nontoxic spray primarily designed to ward off hungry 
rabbits and deer has become an effective tool for the city in its 
battle to prevent evergreen tree thefts during the christmas 
holiday said city parks superintendent tom heintzman 
if the tree happens to be cut down and taken into a home at 
temperatures of 50 degrees it gives off a very noxious odor 
heintzman said 
hutchinson a town of about 40000 residents 50 miles northwest 
of wichita started the spraying program in 1986 after thieves cut 
down six evergreen trees in city parks heintzman said

25yearold cadets death 
the criminal justice training council voted overwhelmingly for 
the new measures in this boston suburb wednesday as a coroners 
inquest into the death of cadet timothy shepard continued in 
springfield 
the council reiterated its abolition of modified stress 
training which combined constant exercise with unexpected

academy after a day of rigorous training with few breaks for water 
he died six weeks later of complications from heat stroke a coroner 
has ruled 
fifteen other cadets were hospitalized the first week of training 
the measures approved wednesday are part of a 120day action 
plan which will go into effect with the start of new training 
classes in january according to peter w agnes jr the councils 
interim executive director 
the plan is intended to become part of a permanent comprehensive 
program for teaching police recruits 
we will have made a clean break with the past agnes told 
council members and a panel that included attorney general james 
shannon we will set the agenda for the future by laying the 
groundwork now 
among other rules adopted wednesday 
injuries to student officers must be documented and recorded 
physical or academic punishment to teach enforce or maintain 
discipline is prohibited 
establishment of a new discipline policy including a 
meritdemerit system 
preadmission drug screening and physicals by qualified 
physicians

creation of new qualifications and certification for all 
academy directors and instructors 
all academy directors and instructors must read the attorney 
generals report of what happened during training this year 
preadmission orientation on physical and academic aspects of 
police training 
the council also accepted the resignation of assistant director 
james canty and authorized the dismissals of judith crossen 
director of training martin michaelman prescreening coordinator 
and earl harrington former zone manager for western massachusetts 
brian daley director of standards will be reassigned to new

a bandit was remorseful crying and 
upset that he stole an impressionist painting worth more than 1 
million from a museum but not sorry enough to turn himself in 
police said 
suffolk county detective sgt gene gross said the tearful thief 
called police wednesday morning to tell them edouard manets 
bouquet of peonies taken sunday from the heckscher museum in 
huntington could be found at an apartment complex in the new york 
city borough of queens 
the thief told police the painting could be found in the basement 
laundry room but it was not there when police arrived shortly 
before noon according to suffolk county police commissioner daniel 
guido 
the buildings superintendent had found it guido said and put 
it in a storage room the superintendent had thought about hanging 
it in his apartment but decided against it because he didnt think 
it was attractive 
guido said the superintendent was quite shocked to learn the 
value of the painting 
heckscher museum registrar william titus said the recovered 
painting was authentic and undamaged 
the painting in its gold frame measures about 16 by 21 inches 
and could have been smuggled out of the long island museum under a 
coat said police spokesman lt william kiley 
police said the thief apparently took the painting from the wall 
walked out a basement door and escaped two uniformed guards were 
patrolling the fiveroom exhibition area at the time 
investigators are trying to uncover the identity of a blond man 
who witnesses said they saw putting a painting into the trunk of a 
silver car outside the museum guido said 
but he said police will not use laser equipment to try to 
retrieve fingerprints from the painting because it would be a 
cultural felony to risk damaging the work 
guido said it was clearly a miracle that we have recovered the 
painting it is amazing we got it back 
the 1880 manet is a still life of red and pink flowers in a glass 
vase it had been lent to the heckscher by its owner who has 
remained anonymous 
the full value of the painting was not made public but police 
and museum officials said it was more than 1 million

jesse jackson who once said george bush was 
morally unfit to be president said today he expects a qualitative 
change on civil rights when bush takes over from president reagan 
jackson said bush indicated to him during a white house meeting 
wednesday that he would strengthen the civil rights commission 
engage in a comprehensive antidrug battle and be more open to 
advice on social issues 
i suppose just having lines of communications open is a step 
towards being kinder and gentler the former democratic 
presidential candidate said referring to a pledge bush made when he 
accepted the republican nomination jackson said reagan has been 
unkind and harsh in some of his actions 
interviewed on abctvs good morning america jackson said 
reagan closed the door against the congressional black caucus and 
others concerned about civil rights and added i think there will 
be a qualitative change under bush 
he said bush was awfully mum during the reagan years but 
added i suppose theres a certain presidential loyalty that goes 
along with being vice president 
jackson said he had been encouraged by past meetings with bush 
over haitian refugees the extension of voters rights and the 
condition of blacks in south africa 
im concerned that presidentelect bush will now put forth the 
initiative to set a new moral tone for our country he said no 
one can set a moral tone better than the president can he 
described bush as quite positive and quite upbeat during their 
90minute discussion 
i am persuaded that his commitment to have a credible civil 
rights commission is going to make some difference in race relations 
in this country he said 
jackson said he was also encouraged by bushs willingness to meet 
with hardpressed farmers 
that kind of openness and access and willingness to expand and 
to hear other people certainly is the highest and most effective use 
of the pulpit called the white house he said 
jackson said bush did not indicate whom he would pick to lead the 
war on drugs but he said both men agreed it must be someone who has 
the complete confidence of the president and the secretary of state 
he said an antidrug war that focuses only on children an 
apparent reference to first lady nancy reagans just say no 
efforts was not enough with 150 billion being spent on drugs 
children are not buying that amount he said 
my impression is he bush really wants to fight a 
comprehensive drug war and im willing to help in any way i can

the aids virus disappeared from the bloodstreams of 
10 patients with aids or a related disease when they got monthly 
transfusions of blood plasma from otherwise healthy carriers of the 
virus researchers said today 
the researchers said the treatment apparently kills the virus 
without causing serious side effects 
it doesnt mean that they dont have any more virus in their 
bodies said dr abraham karpas of the laboratory of molecular 
biology affiliated with cambridge university but there is no 
more free virus in the blood to infect their cells 
the plasma treated to remove viruses contains high levels of 
antibodies that can kill the aids virus karpas said 
aids patients lack such antibodies in their blood said karpas 
who led the research team research details appear in decembers 
issue of the proceedings of the national academy of sciences a us 
scientific journal he said 
karpas called the results of his study very encouraging but 
other aids researchers urged caution in interpreting them 
dr bryan gazzard of st stephens hospital in london where the 
tests were conducted said the findings were interesting but that 
larger trials must be done before anyone could say the treatment 
offered any clinical benefit 
dr james chin an epidemiologist with the genevabased world 
health organizations global program on aids said if its for 
real it deserves to be further evaluated 
however i think that there may be a lot of work between some 
experimental results like that and what kind of applicability you 
would have in the real world he warned in an interview 
we dont know how effective it would be how long people would 
have to take such a product it could very well be for life so a 
lot of things have to be worked out before we can really offer 
people a real ray of hope he said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys immune 
system breaking down its resistance to infection no cure has been 
discovered not everyone infected with the aids virus goes on to 
develop symptoms 
in trials over the past nine months on six aids patients and four 
suffering from an early stage of aids known as aidsrelated complex 
the virus in the patients blood immediately disappeared 
following the transfusion of this hyperimmune plasma karpas said 
in an interview 
the researchers said nine of the 10 patients are still alive 
reasonably well and out of hospital nine months later those 
patients have remained virus negative now for nine months karpas 
said 
karpas said some of patients in the study with early symptoms of 
aids began producing their own antibodies when injected with the 
antibodyrich plasma 
the explanation could be that the neutralizing antibody stopped 
the virus infecting more tcells he said 
tcells which are destroyed by the aids virus are a type of 
blood cell essential to the bodys immune defenses 
karpas said he believes the method could reverse the course of 
aids in some patients or at least to keep it at bay 
he hopes to conduct further tests comparing the effectiveness of 
his treatment with the drug azidothymidine or azt which has been 
shown to prolong the lives of aids sufferers 
azts drawback is that it is toxic to bone marrowand causes 
anemia 
but the experimental method said karpas is not a drug it has 
no toxic effect whatsoever its human plasma its like a 
transfusion 
karpas said largerscale tests need to be done but he said he 
saw no reason why the treatment couldnt be made available 
immediately

cospeakers cochairmen cooperation thats 
the plan for the restructured indiana house its leaders say 
the house split 5050 between democrats and republicans elected 
cospeakers for the first time wednesday and adopted a special 
agreement that redistributes many of the speakers powers to the 
chambers members 
democrat michael k phillips and republican paul s mannweiler 
were named cospeakers by unanimous voice votes in the house which 
went from a 5248 gop majority to an even split after the democrats 
picked up two seats in the nov 8 election 
the two men who negotiated the powersharing agreement over 2 
days last week jointly clutched the house gavel and raised it aloft 
as the membership stood cheering and applauding 
this is a historic occasion one in which we all can take a 
great deal of pride said mannweiler who presided alone as house 
speaker the last two years 
the two men will preside over the chamber on alternate days 
phillips went first wielding the gavel after the speaker election 
mannweiler will get his turn when the house reconvenes jan 4 
the house minority leader for the last 12 years phillips quoted 
poet robert frost in a speech urging conciliation not 
confrontation during the 1989 session 
were taking the road less traveled by and that will make all 
the difference he said im convinced the system will work 
the cospeaker arrangement and a series of rules changes were 
negotiated after the house tried unsuccessfully last week to elect a 
speaker 
under the agreement each committee will have republican and 
democratic cochairmen and equal membership from each party 
the gop speaker will appoint committee members from his party and 
assign republicanauthored bills to committee the democratic 
speaker will do the same for his party 
if a cochairman does not want to hold a hearing on a bill his 
counterpart from the other party can draw on his allotment of wild 
cards to keep the bill moving 
a tie vote in a committee will send a bill to the floor without 
recommendation previously a bill died if it did not win a majority 
vote in committee 
once a bill reaches the house floor the author can control when 
it is called down for amendment and a final vote formerly the 
speaker controlled the house calendar of bills and exercised his 
greatest power by killing bills through refusing to call them for 
votes

foreign minister qian qichen of china arrived today 
for the first foreignministry level talks between the two communist 
powers on soviet soil in 31 years 
china and the soviet union as two great neighboring countries 
must live in peace and goodneighborly relations qian said in a 
statement distributed by the soviet news agency tass we are glad 
that in recent years chinesesoviet relations gradually are 
improving i sincerely hope this visit will end with the expecte 
results 
qian was greeted at moscows sheremetyevo 2 airport by foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze with whom he will conduct two days 
of talks that will include laying the groundwork for a 
chinesesoviet summit meeting next year 
the chinese foreign minister also said he expects to meet with 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
before leaving beijing qian said the focus of his talks will be 
the war in cambodia the major stumbling block to restoring normal 
chinesesoviet ties 
china the main backer of antivietnamese resistance forces in 
cambodia insists that moscow exert pressure on its ally vietnam to 
end its 10year military occupation of that southeast asian country 
the last chinese foreign minister to visit moscow was chou enlai 
in 1957 no soviet foreign minister has made an official visit to 
beijing since andrei gromyko accompanied then soviet leader nikita 
khrushchev in 1959 
in 1960 china and the soviet union split after mao tsetung 
accused khrushchev of revisionism and compromising with the 
capitalist west the soviet union responded by withdrawing soviet 
engineers and technology from hundreds of joint projects dealing a 
painful blow to chinas fragile industrial base 
relations reached a low in 1969 when the two sides fought a short 
war along their disputed border mao called on the nation to prepare 
for allout war and each side stationed at least 1 million troops 
along the border 
the countries began normalization talks in 1982 opening the way 
for a general easing of tensions and a gradual increase in trade 
scientific and cultural exchanges 
qian noted that the two sides held vice foreign ministerlevel 
talks in beijing last august on cambodia and that he had discussed 
the issue with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in a 
meeting at the united nations in september 
both sides qian said have indicated their willingness to make 
an effort to bring about an early settlement to the kampuchean 
cambodian question on a just and reasonable basis including the 
vietnam troop withdrawal 
qian also indicated that the first chinesesoviet summit since 
khrushchev met mao in beijing in 1959 was a certainty regardless of 
further progress on cambodia that summit is scheduled next year in 
beijing 
asked if the summit was linked to solving the cambodian question 
qian said now the conditions for the summit meeting in the view 
of both sides are getting ready and both sides are making 
preparations for his summit 
he said his visit and a return visit to beijing probably next 
month by shevardnadze will all be part of the preparations 
chinese leaders have said a summit could take place in the first 
half of 1989 gorbachev is expected to come to beijing because 
chinas senior leader deng xiaoping 84 rarely travels abroad 
china has continued to insist three obstacles remain headed 
by cambodia that must be solved before full normalization can be 
realized 
moscow has taken steps to remove the other two obstacles by 
pulling out of afghanistan and reducing tension along the border by 
withdrawing one army division facing china from soviet ally mongolia 
qian said he will discuss the estimated 50000 soviet troops 
still in mongolia which should be pulled out border disputes 
and the soviet military gathering along the chinesesoviet 
border

a woman who spoke out in favor of 
housing desegregation in yonkers has been charged with fabricating a 
death threat after being videotaped vandalizing her own home 
a complaint filed wednesday in federal court said a camera 
concealed by the fbi taped laurie recht 35 writing a racist 
antisemitic death threat on her house saturday 
the complaint also charges that ms recht reported receiving 
death threats by telephone aug 16 although a police tracing device 
failed to pick them up 
ms recht was the only speaker among 50 people at a yonkers city 
council meeting last january who supported a courtordered 
desegregation plan and she received extensive media attention 
she later claimed she had received hundreds of death threats and 
that swastikas and racist remarks had been written on the outside 
walls of her apartment after two incidents were reported the fbi 
installed a camera outside her apartment 
a former legal secretary and a law student at an undisclosed 
school ms recht was charged with a single count of filing a false 
statement a felony which carries up to five years in prison and a 
250000 fine upon conviction 
us magistrate joel tyler arraigned ms recht and released her 
on her own recognizance pending a dec 30 court appearance 
assistant us attorney lisa margaret smith said she had no 
objection to ms recht being released because ms recht had lived in 
the area all her life lived in the apartment for eight years and 
had no previous criminal record 
the yonkers desegregation case stemmed from a 1985 ruling by us 
district judge leonard sand in which the city was found liable for 
40 years of segregated housing and schools

the national assembly has asked 
washington to send two former officials to seoul to testify on 
charges the united states aided the bloody suppression of a 1980 
uprising officials said today 
the foreign ministery said the request was sent to the state 
department nov 24 to have former us ambassador william gleysteen 
and former us army gen john wickham appear before a national 
assembly committee investigating the kwangju uprising 
jack sears the us embassy spokesman said the united states 
intends to cooperate with the investigation but he could not 
comment further until the request was evaluated in washington 
about 200 people were killed in the southern city of kwangju when 
south korean soldiers put down an uprising by students and citizens 
the assembly is investigating the incident as part of a probe into 
abuses under the authoritarian rule of former president chun 
doohwan 
some opposition leaders claim us involvement in the kwangju 
uprising because most south korean forces are under the command of 
the local us military commander they contend the us command 
gave south korean generals permission to move units to suppress the 
uprising 
lawmakers say they want to determine if the united states played 
any role in kwangju or condoned the action by not trying to block 
deployment of south korean forces under us command 
american officials have said that south korean commanders moved 
troops independently and us commanders were not consulted the 
assembly wants to question wickham and gleysteen the top us 
representatives in south korea in 1980 
chun a former general who took power with military backing after 
the kwangju incident went into internal exile last week after 
apologizing to the nation for abuses under his rule special 
parliamentary committees are investigating the kwangju incident 
corruption and human rights abuses 
president roh taewoo and chun were senior generals in command of 
the south korean military during the 1980 uprising roh took office 
in february after winning december 1987 presidential elections 
wickham commanded us forces based in south korea under a mutual 
defense pact and also was chief of the combined forces command that 
oversees us and south korean forces 
the united states keeps 42000 troops in south korea under a 
mutual defense pact against communist north korea 
roh is planning a major shuffle of the government to remove 
officials linked to the chun government he has promised to release 
political prisoners as part of a plan to try and defuse the 
nationwide furor over chun 
opposition parties are demanding chun appear before the national 
assembly probe the former president has denied any personal 
wrongdoing but some relatives and aides have been convicted or 
charged with corruption 
the cabinet decided today to accept a plan to remove the powerful 
agency for national security planning from any domestic political 
role the agency once known as the korean central intelligence 
agency has been used to suppress domestic opposition in the past 
the cabinet said it would accept the recommendations of an 
advisory group studying ways to reform the agency except for a 
proposal to subject the agency to government auditing and 
parliamentary oversight 
opposition parties want the intelligence agencys budget made 
public and parliamentary power to inquire into its activities

christmas furloughs for a triple murderer and 
other inmates of a maximum security prison may be revoked because of 
public outcry while police sought an escapee from the same prison 
in the rape of a 40yearold woman 
while the patuxent institution review board ponders the furloughs 
and may decide the matter today a warrant has been issued for james 
m stavarakas the prime suspect in a rape of a 40yearold woman in 
the washington dc suburb of hyattsville the attack bears a 
startling resemblance to the crime that landed stavarakas in prison 
in 1979 authorities said he escaped monday from the prison in 
jessup about 20 miles southwest of baltimore where he was serving 
a 25year sentence 
the victims general description of the attacker matched that of 
stavarakas and she noted distinctive tattoos said maryland capital 
park police spokesman steve davis in addition the rape occurred 
near the same park as stavarakas 1978 assault 
meanwhile a howard county circuit court judge on wednesday 
issued a temporary injunction blocking patuxent officials from 
granting additional furloughs to triple murderer robert angell for 
at least 10 days 
the order was requested by the montgomery county police 
association which has filed suit to force angells transfer to 
another prison 
angell 31 was sentenced to three life terms for the murders of 
two montgomery county police officers and a teenager 
judge cornelius sybert said the injunction would expire at 
midnight dec 9 a police association attorney said he would apply 
then for a 10day extension of the order 
lt gary smith a spokesman for the police association said he 
was pleased with syberts ruling 
i dont think we can afford the luxury of gambling on angell 
he said he forfeited his right to freedom when he murdered three 
people 
the association filed the suit after reports that angell had been 
granted 11 furloughs to visit his family since april the 
corrections department put an end to the visits in the ensuing furor 
and canceled angells planned thanksgiving leave 
patuxent is the only institution in the country which has 
independent powers to grant paroles and supervised furloughs a 
power some state officials want to review because of the outcry 
caused by the angell case

president reagan pope john paul ii and one of the 
longest living aids victims sent messages to the world health 
organization today on the first world aids day 
the messages called for a steppedup fight against aids and for 
compassion for its victims 
the agency organized world aids day to encourage governments and 
communities to talk about the disease which affects an estimated 
300000 people worldwide it said 140 countries planned special 
television and radio programs and dances parades and song contests 
entertainer pearl bailey told officials at who headquarters that 
she knows a 29yearold man with aids and that she wants to dedicate 
her life to the fight against the disease 
also present was richard rector a 32yearold san francisco man 
who has had aids for six years rector said world aids day should be 
the opening paragraph in a new chapter of our worldwide effort to 
stop aids 
rector currently based in berlin said he has traveled to three 
continents to teach people about aids 
officially 142 countries have reported 129385 cases of aids to 
the world health organization but the agency estimates that the 
true number is more than twice that and that 5 to 10 million people 
may be infected with the virus that causes aids once a person is 
infected with the virus he or she has a 50 percent chance of 
developing aids within 10 years 
there is no known cure for aids which attacks the bodys immune 
system 
the agency has emphasized education as a primary means to fight 
the spread of the infection which can be transmitted through blood 
sexual intercourse and from an infected mother to her unborn or 
newborn child people at high risk of infection include those with 
numerous sex partners and intravenous drug users who share needles 
dr james mason director of the us centers for disease control 
in atlanta told the opening ceremony that the spread of infection 
in some high risk groups in the united states is clearly declining 
he said this was because some infected and noninfected 
individuals practicing risky behavior have adopted safe or less 
risky lifestyles 
mason noted that the first cases of aids were recognized in 1981 
in the united states and that 78985 americans have gotten aids and 
44334 have died from it but he also said aids has stimulated an 
unprecedented scientific and medical research effort that will have 
longterm benefit in combating aids and other diseases as well 
reagan called knowledge a critical weapon in fighting aids 
and said knowledge must also lead to individual responsibility 
it is the responsibility of each individual to learn about hiv 
and to treat those infected with hiv with respect and compassion 
and it is the responsibility of infected individuals not to infect 
others reagan said in a message read by miss bailey 
the popes statement urged respect for all individuals and 
said the degree of civilization of societies may be judged by how 
civilization responds to the suffering of man he said aids 
victims meet with my affection and are the subject of my prayers

basharat mirza an illegal alien from pakistan 
woke up well before dawn on the final day of an opportunity to keep 
his american dream alive 
mirza left new york city at 430 am wednesday and drove about 
100 miles to a us immigration and naturalization service office 
here 
the 30yearold mirza one of more than 1 million alien farm 
workers to apply for a work permit under a nationwide amnesty 
program that expired at midnight said he chose the lima office 
because new yorks ins office was crowded with other applicants 
too much rush there too much people there mirza said not 
so many peoples here 
the ins initially estimated that 600000 farm workers would pay 
the 185 fee to apply under the sweeping program mandated by the 
1986 immigration act but by the deadline 11 million to 12 
million applications were taken the agency said 
aaron bodin who heads the amnesty program for the ins said 
today that the agency did not turn away any applicants who were 
waiting in line at ins offices at midnight 
he said the agency believed many of those applying were not farm 
workers but other aliens who missed a may 4 deadline for nonfarm 
workers to apply for amnesty 
i think its because the standards of proof were so lenient 
that many aliens feeling increasingly desperate because of employer 
sanctions against hiring illegal aliens took advantage of that 
farm program to get legal status bodin said on this morning 
on cbs 
we really dont know how many people are truly eligible he 
said 
those aliens whose applications are rejected are back where 
they were and the service takes no action its expected however 
because of the employer sanctions provisions making it illegal for 
employers to hire illegal aliens these people will eventually be 
discouraged and return home of their own volition 
illegal aliens like mirza came from as far away as boston to the 
ins office in lima said jesse r peterson chief legalization 
officer in philadelphia 20 miles northeast of here 
in the weeks before the deadline some applicants traveled by 
taxi from new york city peterson said one arrived in a mercedes 
equipped with a car phone 
i didnt know there was so much money in farm work peterson 
joked 
under the first phase of the immigrant legalization program that 
ended may 4 temporary residency was granted to more than 17 
million illegal aliens who proved continuous residency in the united 
states since jan 1 1982 
under agricultural phase illegal aliens had to prove they 
harvested perishable crops for at least 90 days between may 1 1985 
and may 1 1986 those accepted will receive temporary residency 
status and eventually will be able to apply for permanent status 
effective today agricultural employers now face fines up to 
10000 per illegal alien for hiring undocumented workers 
many applicants provided false documentation that cost them up to 
3000 in a desperate attempt to gain legal status immigration 
officials across the country said 
ten applicants were arrested wednesday at the new orleans ins 
office when they produced fake documents and four others were 
arrested in connection with an organization that supplied illegal 
aliens with phony papers ins officials said in liberal kan five 
people were arrested late tuesday and early wednesday for selling 
fraudulent employment letters to illegal aliens 
more than half the applications under the program or about 
500000 have come from california followed by florida with about 
10 percent and texas with about 8 percent officials said 
significant numbers were filed in the northwest arizona and new 
york 
at the lima office applicants from around the globe sat for 
hours clutching paperwork and awaiting a chance to see an ins 
officer 
many spoke in their native tongues one man wore a turban others 
sported cowboy or baseball hats 
by 730 pm about 125 people had met with ins officers with 
100 more to go before midnight and beyond peterson said 
well take anyone in line at midnight he said 
mirza said he qualified for amnesty by picking grapes and 
cherries in california 
since i was a child i have dream to come to new york here 
good money he said mirza said he came to new york in 1984 via 
greece the caribbean island of bimini and an illegal boat landing 
in miami 
hardev singh a 45yearold man from india said through an 
interpreter that he paid 600 to hide in the back of a truck from 
mexico to los angeles to escape political strife and unemployment 
for jose villagomez a 36yearold mushroom worker in nearby 
kennett square winning residency status and thus keeping his job 
was a matter of life and death for his impoverished wife and four 
children back in mexico 
villagomez who speaks only spanish said he sends some of the 
money he makes to his family 
if i dont theyll die of hunger he said

presidentelect george bush maintains that 
all is tranquil among his campaign staff despite reports of 
warring opinions on whether to name former sen john tower of texas 
as secretary of defense 
were not going to do everything in a great rush were trying 
to be prudent and do the proper work required to back up 
appointments at all levels bush said today 
any time there seems to be stories that may be hurtful to 
somebody it concerns me no matter who it is senator towers a 
friend of mine but he knows that the process takes a while to go 
forward 
a day earlier bush had told reporters stay tuned when asked 
about tower who still is considered the likely choice for the top 
pentagon job 
asked then if there were indeed a raging battle in his staff over 
the prudence of naming tower former chairman of the senate armed 
services committee bush laughed 
no all is tranquil theres a thousand and one points of light 
out there he said in a play on an obtuse quotation he used often 
in his campaign to describe the many facets of society 
denying any delay in filling that job he said im going to 
stay on my schedule make these decisions in my own time thorough 
decisions 
sources close to the transition say part of the delay in the 
decision on tower results from an attempt to find a complementary 
person to fill the no 2 pentagon spot 
among others mentioned for defense secretary are paul oneill 
chairman of alcoa and norman augustine of martin marietta 
in other transition developments 
a coalition of some 30 environmental groups met with bush on

heard from bushs transition team other epa candidates include mike 
deland regional administrator in boston and francis blake former 
general counsel to the regulatory relief task force and also 
formerly epas general counsel 
transition sources said former transportation secretary 
elizabeth dole wife of senate republican leader bob dole is a 
contender for united nations ambassador 
to head the interior department former house minority leader 
john rhodes of arizona is being touted by supporters he is a 
longtime friend of bush and an intense lobbying effort on his behalf 
is being led by political consultant jay smith his former press 
secretary sen dan evans rwash is also mentioned as a serious 
contender for the top job at interior 
another contender is former tennessee gov lamar alexander who 
headed president reagans commission on americans outdoors 
for transportation secretary word is that samuel k skinner a 
longtime bush supporter in illinois and now the chairman of the 
regional transportation authority in the chicago area has emerged 
as the leading contender 
skinner met in washington on tuesday with members of bushs 
transition team a source said newlyelected sen connie mack 
rfla said wednesday that he has recommended floridas 
transportation secretary kaye henderson to head bushs 
transportation department 
another possible candidate rep lynn martin rill said she 
really wants to become chairman of the house republican conference 
house gop members will vote on that job dec 5

police today sought criminal charges against 
employees of boeing co japan air lines and the transport ministry 
after a threeyear investigation into the cause of the worlds worst 
singleplane crash 
police said the crash in which 520 people died was caused by 
the professional negligence of 20 people including four boeing 
employees 12 japan air lines workers and four employees of the 
ministry of transport 
the people accused of negligence were responsible for aircraft 
repairs maintenance and inspection 
it was the first time that criminal charges arising from a plane 
crash investigation have been sought against officials of the 
transport ministry which is responsible for aviation safety 
boeing the seattlebased aircraft manufacturer said in a 
statement it believed the accident did not involve a criminal act 
boeing does not believe that criminal acts were committed by 
anyone and hopes that the district prosecutors office also will 
conclude that there was no criminal conduct the company said 
gunma prefectural police handed results of the probe to the 
maebashi district prosecutors office which will decide whether to 
press charges for negligence which is an offense under japanese 
criminal law 
the police said they were unable to question the four boeing 
employees 
but they said documents confiscated from japan air lines provided 
enough evidence to substantiate their involvement the four 
reportedly supervised a repair of the aircraft in 1978 that was 
performed improperly 
boeing sources said that police already have names of people who 
performed the repairs but boeing employees have rejected repeated 
police requests for questioning 
the boeing 747 with 524 people aboard crashed into a mountain 
during a flight from tokyo to osaka on aug 12 1985 killing all 
but four on board 
the police action highlights the different legal customs 
regarding air accidents and corporate criminal liability in japan 
and the united states 
japan is one of a few countries where criminal charges are sought 
against individuals responsible for airplane accidents said hiroshi 
itakura criminal law professor at nihon university in tokyo 
in the united states individuals involved in an airplane 
accident are usually granted criminal immunity in exchange for 
cooperating in investigations into the cause of an accident itakura 
said 
the most important thing in an accident like this is to 
pinpoint the cause of the accident rather than to prosecute 
individuals he said but unlike the united states under 
japanese criminal law corporations cannot be charged for wrongdoing 
in order to disclose causes of accidents police have to seek 
criminal charges against individuals he said 
susumu yamachi president of japan air lines said his company 
would take the matter seriously and continue its efforts to prevent 
the recurrence of such an tragic accident 
boeing rejected japanese allegations that the company had 
hindered the investigation saying that it had cooperated with 
japanese authorities 
boeing sources said the company planned to respond to the police 
inquiry but was unlikely to allow japanese police to question 
individual employees 
the airplane maker has disclosed that repairs it performed on the 
rear bulkhead the metal partition that protects the pressurized 
cabin of the aircraft after a minor accident in 1978 were faulty 
the aircraft skidded on its tail during a rough landing in 1978 
at osaka international airport damaging its tail section and 
underwent major repairs according to jal 
a government report issued in 1987 concluded that improper 
repairs had accelerated metal fatigue which caused the bulkhead to 
burst blowing off part of the planes tail fin and sending the 
jumbo jet out of control 
the report accused the boeing jal and transport ministry 
personnel of faulty repairs and inadequate inspection 
police said the accident could have been avoided if boeing had 
performed the repairs properly if japan air lines had checked the 
repairs adequately and if the transport ministry had inspected the 
aircraft properly 
a group of relatives of passengers who died in the crash have 
presented signatures of 34120 people to the trasnport ministry 
requesting a criminal prosecution against jal and boeing 
jal said about 70 percent of compensation negotiations have been 
settled the company and boeing have agreed to share the cost of 
compensation to the victims families and the four survivors of the 
crash according to jal

the deaths of four women whose bodies 
were discovered near highways are related and more bodies may be 
found as a search of the area continues today a district attorney 
said 
the bodies were discovered during the last five months with the 
latest found tuesday 
i feel pretty confident they are connected somehow there may 
be more than just the four women bristol county district attorney 
ronald a pina said wednesday 
he said the body found tuesday may be no 5 not no 4 there 
may be another person out there is my concern if not more 
three of the bodies were discovered along interstate 195 in this 
southeastern massachusetts town the fourth was found along a state 
road in nearby freetown two of the bodies were discovered in july 
the other two in november all four women were believed to have been 
nude when killed investigators said 
pina said it was possible that the four deaths were connected 
with the deaths of two women from providence ri whose bodies 
were found last spring off highways in southeastern massachusetts 
none of the four more recently found bodies has been identified 
pina said one person may have killed the three women whose bodies 
were found here and that the person was familiar with the area 
the fact that theyre all in the same area would lead you to 
believe that a person has done more than one killing he said 
theres no doubt that those people were all murdered and left 
there 
state trooper william delaney said the bodies were left in 
similar locations within 15 feet of the tree lines off the highways 
but he said there also were dissimilarities in the cases 
four women have been listed as missing from nearby new bedford in 
the last several months but no definite link between them and the 
bodies has been made

a man trapped in the never summer mountains 
for five days walked to safety three days after his snowmobiling 
companion died of an apparent heart attack 
jim edson 38 stumbled onto a logging road wednesday morning 
where he was picked up by a truck driver he and ray owens 65 had 
traveled to the snowwhipped mountains 50 miles northwest of denver 
last friday on an afternoon snowmobile outing 
owens died sunday and edson waited two more days in vain to be 
rescued before walking out on his own 
in recounting the ordeal from a hospital bed in granby edson 
said the mens snowmobiles became mired the day they left in a 
highcountry gulch 16 miles northwest of grand lake 
when it became obvious the weather was not going to clear up 
and they werent coming after us i decided to go out the way we 
came edson said 
heavy winds had drifted snow over their tracks and it took edson 
nearly five hours to walk about two miles through snow up to 2 feet 
deep before he came to the logging road 
edsons face and hands were black from sitting by a campfire in 
subzero weather on his way out edson found snowmobile tracks 
indicating searchers had not been more than two miles from his 
campfire 
tony winter the logging truck driver later led searchers to the 
spot where he found edson and the searchers followed edsons tracks 
back to his camp and recovered owens body 
freezing winds sent windchill factors to minus 30 degrees 
fahrenheit in the area and blinding whiteouts plagued wouldbe 
rescuers during the search 
they had called off their ground search tuesday night after 
three days of searching 
edson said when they tried to free their machines friday 
afternoon that was when ray had his first heart attack he was 
feeling pretty poorly so we rested 
although they had brought along trail mix cheese crackers and 
fruit for their afternoon outing neither man had any matches 
edson said they soaked a piece of cardboard in gasoline from a 
snowmobile and cranked an engine using a sparkplug to light the 
cardboard

benazir bhuttos selection as prime 
minister triumphantly ended an 11year effort to restore her family 
name and pakistani democracy 
at 35 she also becomes one of the worlds youngest heads of 
government and the first woman prime minister to lead a moslem 
nation in modern times 
ms bhutto who was educated at harvard and oxford inherits the 
political mantle of her father the late prime minister zulfikar ali 
bhutto who was ousted by gen mohammed zia ulhaq in a 1977 coup 
and hanged two years later 
zias death in an aug 17 plane crash made ms bhutto who had 
pledged to restore democracy the nations only nationally 
recognized political leader 
although a daughter of affluence ms bhuttos appeal lies mainly 
among the poor masses of this countrys 107 million people they are 
the strength of her leftleaning pakistan peoples party which 
captured the most seats in the nov 16 national assembly elections 
ms bhutto drew massive adoring crowds during her campaign for 
the countrys first free elections since her fathers death 
mindful of moslem and local custom she always is clad in 
traditional clothes with a scarf draped over her head 
the poised and articulate leader who speaks english fluently 
shocked her western friendsby consenting to an arranged marriage 
last december with karachi businessman asif ali zardari 
ms bhutto who has kept her maiden name was groomed for 
politics by her doting father as the eldest of his four children he 
sent her to study government and politics at harvard in the united 
states then at oxford 
it was at the british university that she tasted her first 
political success when she was elected president of the prestigious 
oxford union debating society in 1976 
the prime ministers post is ms bhutto first paying job her 
only previous employment began in early 1977 as a nonpaid trainee 
in the foreign ministry 
it was shortlived however as zia toppled her fathers 
government a few months later on the pretext that elections that 
year were rigged 
bhutto was hanged in 1979 after his conviction for helping plot 
the murder of a political foe a charge his family has denied 
despite years of detention and foreign exile during zias 
authoritarian rule ms bhutto and her mother nusrat kept the 
party alive as zias disenfranchised opposition 
ms bhuttos party critics claim she has inherited her fathers 
domineering ego but has renounced his socialist ideals 
her supporters say that with zia gone she is pakistans only 
nationally recognized political leader and a unifying force in the 
countrys volatile ethnic mosaic 
her party commands 105 votes in the 237seat national assembly 
and ms bhutto says she has enough support from independents and 
minor parties to command a majority 
ms bhutto espouses prosperity for the poor but has appeased the 
business community with promises of a marketoriented economy and 
the military by pledging to continue zias staunch backing with the 
united states of moslem anticommunist rebels in neighboring 
afghanistan 
she started her election campaign in late october following the 
sept 21 birth of her first child a son named bilawal 
ms bhutto rarely has appeared with her husband in public and has 
not yet allowed public photographs of their baby

ammonium nitrate that exploded during an 
arson fire and killed six firemen had been mixed with other 
compounds that made it far more explosive than usual police say 
a reward for information on the arsonists has reached 35000 
with an anonymous donors offer of 25000 and donations are 
pouring in for the victims families city officials said 
firefighters from across the nation and canada are expected at a 
memorial service 
officials initially thought that only ammonium nitrate 
considered one of the milder and more stable explosives had been 
stored in two trailers that blew up early tuesday at a highway 
construction site 
but the ammonium nitrate had been mixed with diesel fuel pink 
dye and powdered aluminum to form maynes mix a blasting agent 
usually detonated by a small amount of dynamite police said 
the mixture explains why the blasts were powerful enough to kill 
the firefighters demolish two firetrucks and create a shock wave 
that broke windows up to 10 miles away and was heard up to 40 miles 
away 
all it requires is a heat source to detonate said police 
sgt gregory mills 
mills said there were no significant developments wednesday in 
the arson investigation 
officials announced a 35000 reward for information on suspects 
in the fire sandy berkley wife of mayor richard berkley who is on 
a trade mission in the far east said a donor who wishes to remain 
anonymous had given 25000 toward the reward fund an additional 
5000 came from the heavy equipment construction workers and 5000 
from the arson hotline 
donations also have been pouring into union bank in kansas city 
where a fund has been established to help the victims families 
bank spokesman carl eichenberger said 
everyone has been so extremely helpful in trying to donate all 
theyre concerned about is the families eichenberger said he 
said the total amount of money donated was not available wednesday 
a public memorial service for the six firefighters is scheduled 
saturday at arrowhead stadium and firefighters from almost every 
state including new york california texas and washington have 
called to ask about the ceremony even a fire department in canada 
said firefighters plan to attend said harold m knabe a fire 
department spokesman 
the six firefighters had been warned by a dispatcher there could 
be explosives at the scene of a fire that police believe was started 
by an arsonist according to transcripts of conversations with 
dispatchers but fire officials said the six apparently saw no signs 
at the site indicating that explosives were stored in the trailers 
the city council on wednesday discussed drafting tougher laws 
regarding the regulation of explosives 
the president of the international association of fire fighters 
alfred k whitehead called for a congressional investigation into 
the construction site explosion and what he called a tragic 
addition to the growing list of hazardous material accidents

the supreme soviet voted overwhelmingly today to 
adopt mikhail s gorbachevs overhaul of the political structure 
but a handful of no votes and abstentions showed the reforms 
remain controversial 
five deputies in the supreme soviet or parliament voted against 
the package of constitutional amendments which give more power to 
president gorbachev and provide for indirect election of the 
president and lawmakers 
gorbachev who is also general secretary of the communist party 
told the deputies that a storm of controversy over the reforms 
including 250000 letters to the kremlin could have been reduced 
and he took the blame 
we did not care about explaining the essence the meaning of 
the changes gorbachev said the center was just following the old 
practice thinking well they would get used to it 
all of us are now learning our lessons all of us are in a 
school of democracy and we should be good pupils in that school 
gorbachev said 
in the soviet of nationalities half of the bicameral supreme 
soviet parliament the vote was 657 in favor 3 against and 26 
abstentions on amending the constitution to incorporate gorbachevs 
proposals 
the soviet of unions voted 687 in favor 2 against with one 
abstention to approve the same measures a companion package 
providing for multiplecandidate elections was adopted unanimously 
by both houses 
at least three of the negative votes came from estonians whose 
tiny baltic republic has declared its sovereignty from moscow 
the reforms create a strong presidency in place of the largely 
ceremonial role now accorded the head of state they also establish 
a new congress of peoples deputies to elect the president and a new 
supreme soviet which will meet for eight months a year 
elections for the new congress were set for march 26 and 
gorbachev said todays session was the last meeting of the current 
supreme soviet he said no emergency sessions would be called before 
the elections 
the package was being changed almost up until the final vote to 
incorporate objections from lawmakers and the public 
many of those who objected to various drafts said it gave too 
much power to one person the most vociferous and widespread 
complaints came from independentminded republics including 
estonia which claimed the reforms would prevent them from governing 
their own affairs 
the supreme soviet rejected estonias lastditch request to be 
allowed to keep a single parliament in the republic without 
creating a new congress 
the reform provides for the same doubleparliament structure in 
each of the republics as at the national level 
the body also voted down an amendment that would effectively have 
given the republics veto power in the parliament the revision was 
offered by jemma sculme a delegate from latvia another baltic 
republic 
the final version of the package was not immediately published in 
the official media so it wasnt known how many concessions were 
made before the vote 
gorbachev has acknowledged the original version was flawed after 
the vote he gave a short speech praising the debate during the 
threeday special parliamentary session and the work of the deputies 
who helped make alterations 
until recently the national legislature merely approved actions 
already taken by the leadership without debate or dissent 
this time the supreme soviet heard 37 of its members criticize 
and propose changes in the plan submitted by gorbachev 
the 1500member body recommended dozens of changes over two days 
of debate on wednesday it asked the presidium the nations 
highest executive body and two committees to decide which 
suggestions to include in the final version 
the official tass news agency said the committees met wednesday 
night but it did not report details 
gorbachevs plan includes more than 100 pieces of legislation 
several deputies opposed the national congress idea because of 
two main elements indirect election of the supreme soviet and the 
proposal that onethird of the congress members be chosen by social 
and political organizations such as the communist party and trade 
unions 
one of the main critics of the plan was the president of estonia 
arnold ruutel estonian leaders declared nov 16 their republic is 
sovereign in all but defense and foreign affairs and has the right 
to veto soviet laws 
ruutel told deputies wednesday that no political system suits all 
parts of this vast nation so we have developed our own 
estonia came under repeated attack by delegates for its actions 
last month the presidium which gorbachev heads nullified 
estonias declaration of sovereignty on saturday

the liftoff of space shuttle atlantis 
and five military astronauts on a secret spy satellite mission was 
postponed today for 24 hours by fierce winds eight miles above the 
launch site 
we were watching the weather all the way and finally scrubbed 
due to winds aloft said launch director bob sieck 
weather officials reported the wind velocity 41000 feet up was 
104 mph a condition that could seriously damage the wings of a 
shuttle passing through and cause the vehicle to break up 
sieck said launch officials had decided to try again on friday 
morning but that a final decision on whether to proceed would be 
made about 930 pm tonight before the shuttle is fueled 
were going to take a hard look at the weather again he 
said if it is clearly a nogo tomorrow we dont want to exercise 
the launch team the crew and the systems 
the time for a launch friday would be sometime between 632 and 
932 am est the same as for today the exact moment remained a 
secret because the mission is classified but sources said the 
target was about 7 am 
col john madura an air force meteorologist said the storm 
front that brought winds rain and clouds to the area today would be 
offshore in the atlantic on friday but in its wake he said there 
could be strong ground winds that could affect a launch 
madura said that at 855 am when the scrub announcement was 
made the lowlevel clouds rain and winds had moved away but the 
high altitude winds remained above limits 
madura said that if fridays weather was unacceptable the 
outlook for saturday was not too good with continued strong ground 
winds sunday appears to be the best of the three days he said 
the countdown blacked out publicly for security reasons stood 
at nine minutes when the scrub was called sources reported it had 
been held there for more than an hour while officials waited in vain 
for a significant break in the weather 
the astronauts who had boarded the spacecraft shortly after 4 
am in their bulky escape suits returned to crew quarters seven 
miles from the launch pad 
they took it in stride sieck said of their reaction to the 
scrub we had talked about this threat ever since we picked up the 
count so it came as no surprise 
the postponement was nothing new for the crew commander navy 
cmdr robert l gibson as commander of columbia on the 24th 
mission he had experienced a recordd seven postponements and had to 
board the ship six times before finally taking off 
technicians promptly began emptying the huge external fuel tank 
of the halfmillion gallons of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen 
that had been pumped aboard overnight the fuel will be reused for 
the next attempt at launching 
the forecast for this morning had been ominous for days and nasa 
knew it was gambling when it decided to load the fuel tank the 
space agency has estimated the costs of a lastminute scrub at about 
250000 
the fickle weather at the florida launch site has been a 
persistent problem forcing numerous delays and postponements of 
previous shuttle launches weather criteria for launch have been 
tightened since the challenger explosion of january 1986 
there also was a report of unacceptable weather at the runway 
across the atlantic where the shuttle might have to land if one or 
two engines failed early into the flight 
favorable weather is especially critical in case atlantis 
develops trouble immediately after liftoff and has to make an 
emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad safety 
considerations call for clouds no lower than 8000 feet above the 
runway seven miles visibility and surface winds less than 14 mph 
rain on liftoff or landing could damage the ships thermal 
protection tiles and high winds aloft could damage the craft 
structurally especially its wings 
the goahead for fueling came after nasa reported that repairmen 
using glue had succeeded in fastening a loose panel back onto 
atlantis nose 
atlantis flight is the second by a shuttle since missions 
resumed after the 1986 challenger accident it is the third mission 
for atlantis the newest ship in the shuttle fleet there have been 
two previous secret air force flights both in 1985 
though neither nasa nor the air force will discuss the cargo 
sources said the shuttle was to launch a 500 million spy satellite 
called lacrosse the sources said the satellite carries a powerful 
new radar that is able to penetrate clouds and gather images of 
military targets in eastern europe and the soviet union lacrosse is 
expected to act as the radar eye in the sky for the new b2 
stealth bomber 
the quickfix repair job wednesday was in response to a problem 
with bolts on a cover of a service panel in the orbiters nose the 
panel is used to fill the fuel tanks of the shuttles forward 
steering rockets 
when the launch pad crew attempted to replace the cover to the 
panel two of 10 bolts failed the workers then used glue heated by 
lamps to secure the edges of the 1by2foot panel cover 
as with the previous military flights pentagon officials said 
the prelaunch secrecy was necessary to foil surveillance efforts by 
soviet satellites and by spy ships off the florida coast 
once atlantis is in orbit all spacetoground communication will 
be encoded and there will be only the barest of public 
announcements in contrast with the launchtoliftoff eavesdropping 
that is usual on shuttle missions 
gibsons crew members are air force lt col guy s gardner the 
pilot and mission specialists col richard m mullane and lt col 
jerry l ross of the air force and navy cmdr william m shepherd 
gardner and shepherd have never flown in space before 
the flight is expected to last three or four days with a landing 
at edwards air force base calif

strong winds and cloudy skies hampered 
helicopter search and rescue operations today in battered coastal 
regions and tiny sand bars where more than 500 people were reported 
dead after a cyclone 
the cyclone lashed the bay of bengal coast tuesday night 
churning up 15foothigh waves that submerged lowlying islands and 
pounding the mainland with winds up to 102 mph 
dhaka newspapers said at least 500 people died and more than 
1000 were missing in bangladesh in neighboring india police 
sources said about 80 people were killed in west bengal state 
cyclones and floods traditionally have ravaged the lowlying 
region in 1970 300000 people died in a cyclone in 1985 the 
death toll reached 10000 when another cyclone pelted the region 
official figures in india and pakistan on the latest storm were 
much lower reflecting bureaucratic delays and the nearly impossible 
task of obtaining information from areas where communications are 
poor even in good weather 
the human toll and the difficulty in accurately assessing it were 
augmented by the settlement of thousands of peasants and fishermen 
on newly emerging islands off the bangladesh coast 
hundreds of these islands most of them narrow sand bars that are 
partially submerged each day even by normal tides have been created 
by silt and sediment dumped into the bay of bengal from the rivers 
that originate in the himalayas of india and nepal

districts of coastal khulna and inland jessore with most of the 
other deaths reported in a swath of districts along the coast

strip of land in the bay off the sunderban forest ittefaq said the 
bengalilanguage newspaper said about 275 more fishermen were 
missing off the island of kutubdia 
in the indian area adjacent to the sunderban forest the storm 
razed hundreds of mud huts used by fishermen 
our home kept rattling and shaking said ashim kumar dey in 
indias diamond harbor area dey said three of his cows died when 
his house collapsed 
the cyclone also took a heavy toll of the flimsy mud and 
palmthatch dwellings used by bangladeshi fishermen and rice 
farmers some official sources estimated that tens of thousands and 
perhaps hundreds of thousands of people were left homeless in 
bangladesh

chelsea school officials are close to accepting 
boston universitys proposal to manage their beleaguered public 
schools but opponents vow to continue their legal challenges 
i think it presents a new hope for the community john 
zimini president of the chelsea board of aldermen said wednesday 
the day after school committee officials tentatively backed the plan 
by a 52 vote 
officials said they expect to have a contract within the next few 
weeks 
the unprecedented offer has been under negotiation for three 
years chelseas 3400student district has the highest dropout rate 
in the state and has not built a school since 1923 
but union lawyers say public officials are willing to cede too 
much power to the university and they will continue their legal 
challenge to the plan despite failing to get an injunction to stop 
tuesdays vote 
its not over yet said paul devlin president of the 
massachusetts federation of teachers 
the unions are challenging the plan on the grounds it is against 
state law to put a taxfunded institution under private management 
university officials maintain they will not be taking the public 
schools private but will simply be managers who have to answer to 
the school committee 
i think that it takes an awful lot of courage on the part of 
the city to say hey look weve tried our best the moneys just 
not there zimini said unfortunately in our society any kind 
of change is always a fear factor 
the workingclass town on boston harbor with its influx of 
hispanic and southeast asian immigrants has been strained 
financially by a small tax base elderly population and a 1980 state 
taxlimiting law 
zimini said he cannot predict how aldermen will vote but believes 
the contract will be approved the pact also requires enabling 
legislation by state lawmakers 
the university proposes to revamp the curricula build new 
schools provide mothers and pregnant teenagers with counseling on 
nutrition and childrearing tailor learning plans to individual 
students and set up afterschool programs

the leftofcenter labor party and the 
rightwing likud bloc deadlocked today in rival efforts to form a 
coalition government after one of four key religious parties 
defected from likud to labor 
the move by the fivemember ultraorthodox agudat israel party 
gave labor the support of 60 lawmakers in the 120member knesset 
not enough to form a government but enough to block likud which has 
the backing of 58 legislators 
the balance of power now is in the hands of the undecided torah 
flag party which has two seats party leader rabbi avraham ravitz 
said he preferred a broadbased government but didnt rule out the 
possibility that labor will form the government 
it is the latest turnaround in complicated negotiations since 
nov 1 elections in which prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud won 
40 seats while labor led by foreign minister shimon peres won 39 
at the citys wailing wall today ultraorthodox jews shouted 
angrily as 100 feminists carried a torah and held a 30minute 
allwoman prayer session they defied orthodox rules forbidding 
women from carrying or reading the book of jewish literature 
men pounded on the fence traditionally dividing them from the 
women some of whom wore prayer shawls and skullcaps traditionally 
worn by males 
i protest in the name of god i protest shouted a 
greybearded jews as the women prayed and sang the prayer session 
marked the end of the first international jewish feminist conference 
in jerusalem attended by women from more than 20 countries they 
should realize that prayer isnt only for men said blu greenberg 
of new york 
the feminists represented reform or conservative branches of 
judaism which do not adhere to some orthodox rules excluding women 
from jewish rituals 
on israel radio today shamir said he still is optimistic of 
meeting president chaim herzogs request that he form a government 
earlier this week shamir appeared to have firm support of 65 
legislators 
but religious parties started bolting when he asked labor to join 
the government fearing likud would break promises to them to 
accommodate labor 
political alignments were shaken again when labors executive 
bureau in an apparent rebellion against its party leadership voted 
wednesday not to join a likudled government 
the labor leader said he would try to form a narrow government 
its difficult when five members can topple the government 
whenever they want peres said in an israel television interview 
his chances improved after agudat israel agreed to join a labor 
government 
agudat israel leader rabbi menachem porusch said his party was 
angered by likuds advances toward labor 
likud was supposed to reach an agreement with us porusch 
said on israel radio but instead the likud wanted to reach 
an agreement with labor 
he reiterated that his party would join only a coalition 
promising to pass legislation giving orthodox rabbis sole authority 
over conversions to judaism 
porusch acknowledged labor leaders promised only to take the 
matter before the partys central committee 
the socalled who is a jew legislation has enraged american 
jews most of whom belong to conservative and reform branches of 
judaism that would be excluded from getting automatic israeli 
citizenship

a man has been acquitted of a charge of 
manufacturing and distributing a socalled designer drug known as 
ecstasy because the drugs lengthy scientific name was 
misspelled in state law 
david burling 19 of kenesaw was charged with making and 
selling methylenedioxymethamphetamine more commonly known as mdma 
or ecstasy 
designer drugs are formulated to have the effect of an illegal 
drug without being specifically outlawed 
adams county district judge bernard sprague ruled tuesday that 
burling did not violate the law since he did not possess the drug 
named in the state statute 
adams county attorney james hatheway argued that the discrepency 
was a typographical error and that the intent of the law was to make 
mdma illegal 
burlings attorney jim smith of hastings said the misspelling 
was significant but other factors contributed to burlings 
acquittal he said hatheway failed to prove the drug burling 
possessed was illegal 
hatheway said he was disappointed in the verdict but does not 
plan to appeal he said he discovered the spelling error in june and 
notified the state legislature

federal officials have cut off funds to two harvard 
universityaffiliated scientists involved in controversial research 
at the massachusetts eye and ear infirmary 
national institutes of health officials told the boston globe the 
decision to cut off the funds did not indicate wrongdoing by the 
scientists but they said investigators were in boston on wednesday 
inspecting hospital records to see if patients were hurt or grant 
money was misused 
officials of the nih terminated the last two years of funds for a 
fiveyear 850000 grant to sheffer cg tseng a former harvard 
scientist now at the university of miami 
the two scientists have been the focus of growing attention since 
october when tseng was reported to have tested an experimental eye 
drug on hundreds of massachusetts eye and ear patients between 1984 
and 1986 while helping to organize and profiting from a company 
that made the drug which has proven largely ineffective 
nih officials also suspended consideration of a 191000 grant 
application submitted by tsengs harvard supervisor associate 
professor kenneth r kenyon and demanded kenyon be replaced as 
director of an nihfunded fellowship program at the eye research 
institute a private organization associated with the eye and ear

a top buyout firm won the tumultuous war for rjr 
nabisco with the biggest takeover on record a 2453 billion offer 
that derailed a rival bid by nabisco executives who triggered the 
bidding frenzy 
rjr nabisco inc directors approved the 109ashare offer by 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co inc late wednesday capping a day of 
frantic confusing maneuvering in the auction of the 
cigaretteandfood giant 
a member of the competing investment group led by rjr chief 
executive officer f ross johnson said their lastminute offer 
2542 billion or 112 per share had been higher but suggested 
the group had been cheated by an unfair bidding process 
the value of kohlbergs offer for americas 19th largest 
industrial company was nearly double the old takeover record 134 
billion for gulf corp in 1984 
although the johnson groups offer appeared to be higher rjr 
said its board of directors concluded kohlbergs offer was 
substantially equal kohlbergs offer per share broke down to 81 in 
cash 18 in stock and additional securities worth 10 rjr said 
the board of directors of rjr nabisco by unanimous vote of all 
directors present adopted the kkr offer as being in the best 
interest of the company and its shareholders the company said 
rjr did not say exactly why kohlbergs offer prevailed 
the breakdown of the johnson groups bid was not disclosed but 
shearson lehman hutton the wall street firm that was one of its key 
financial partners said from what we know our bid was the 
best 
we are mystified about the process and the standards that the 
board used to reach its decision it said in a statement we are 
going to continue to keep our options open we believe the rjr 
shareholders will have a lot of questions as well 
kohlberg the undisputed leader in buying companies with borrowed 
money in deals known as leveraged buyouts said it was happy with 
the outcome 
we are also pleased that this process has come to an end so 
that the employees of rjr its consumers and suppliers and the 
communities it serves can be assured that business will now return 
to normal and stability will be restored kohlbergs two 
principals henry r kravis and george roberts said in a statement 
however the deal raised the prospect that some businesses in one 
of americas biggest consumer product companies might be sold to 
help kohlberg pay for its prize 
kohlberg gave no indication which of rjrs worldwide operations 
might be discarded there was speculation that candidates could 
include some or all of rjrs food businesses rjrs tobacco business 
roots still account for about 40 percent of its sales 
atlantabased rjr is one of the largest consumer products 
companies with more than 120000 employees worldwide its brands 
include such wellknown products as camel cigarettes shredded wheat 
and life savers 
the deals size and complexity have raised major questions about 
whether the frenzied level of leveraged buyouts and debtfinanced 
restructurings has gone too far in transforming much of corporate 
america 
the deal also signaled a spectacular defeat for johnson whose 
group began the struggle to take the company private with a 
75ashare offer on oct 20 that was raised five times 
i am proud that we put the best bid on the table the first time 
and this time johnson said in a statement following kohlbergs 
victory 
it was not clear whether the scrappy daring executive would try 
to reopen the war his tenure as head of rjr was even less certain 
the atlanta constitution reported today that kohlberg would 
install rjrs former chairman and chief executive officer j paul 
sticht in the top post for a few months to smooth the transition 
the newspaper said kohlberg would move the companys corporate 
headquarters back to winstonsalem nc 
earlier wednesday johnsons group tried to raise its bid after a 
companydecreed deadline for all offers expired the move 
temporarily upended a 106ashare 238 billion kohlberg kravis 
offer the rjr board was about to approve 
in heavy new york stock exchange trading wednesday rjr stock 
shot up 225 to 93 a share on the possibility the auction would be 
prolonged in early trading today rjr was off 75 cents to 9225 a 
share 
sources familiar with the bidding who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the offer of a third contender first boston corp 
was rejected as too tentative although the bidder valued it as high 
as 115 a share or 2587 billion 
when the battle began in october rjr stock was trading at less 
than 56 a share for rjr shareholders who held on for the last five 
wild weeks their pretax gain totals nearly 95 percent

the los angeles city council ignored its own 
policy when it voted to display a decorated tree and an unlit 
menorah in the city hall lobby during the holidays 
council members interpreted the christian and jewish symbols as 
secular rather than religious when they approved the display 
wednesday 
according to council policy only displays sponsored by city 
offices and which relate to the official function of those offices 
are allowed 
councilman hal bernson warned that allowing the tree and menorah 
would open the door to any group seeking to put a display at city 
hall 
bernie evans a spokesman for city councilwoman joan milke 
flores said city policy prohibits such displays in the rotunda but 
not in the main street lobby where the tree and menorah are to be 
set up friday 
its the holiday season and its just pretty ridiculous not to 
have anything representing the holiday spirit at city hall he

staffers for lyndon h larouche jr often 
performed household chores at the political mavericks virginia 
estate where they cooked put on musical concerts and cleaned the 
house larouches conspiracy trial was told today 
pam cowdery who left the larouche organization in 1986 gave 
jurors a glimpse of life at larouches home in virginias horse 
country 
ms cowdery said she personally cooked for larouche and his wife 
helga and for their dogs who were fed very special meals 
boned chicken breast mixed with dog food 
the witness said she also performed in musical concerts as a 
singer and violinist adding that some performances were for guests 
while others were just for lyndon and helga larouche 
prosecutors questioned ms cowdery about the lifestyle larouche 
was leading at a time when people who loaned more than 30 million 
to larouches movement were not getting repaid a federal grand jury 
has charged larouche and six codefendants with conspiring to 
defraud those who loaned them money 
ms cowdery said that music and other cultural events virtually 
stopped for most larouche staffers in 1984 when william wertz a 
defendant took over as larouches fundraising chief 
ms cowdery said that when staffers complained that the musical 
programs were being harmed because performers spent most of their 
time on fundraising larouche replied you have to understand 
that everything will wertz does is under my directions i make the 
policy and will just carries it out 
in earlier testimony the trial was told that larouches 
security fund was used to pay for items including a piano 
haircuts flowers shoes and cufflinks according to testimony in 
his tax fraud trial 
larouche financial officer kathy magraw acknowledged on wednesday 
that the movements security account paid for items which 
according to prosecutors should have been declared as taxable 
income 
larouche is charged with conspiring to defraud the internal 
revenue service a grand jury accused him of failing to declare as 
income the personal and household expenses financed by his 
organizations and of refusing to file federal tax returns since 
1979 
by calling ms magraw to the stand prosecutors continued using a 
strategy of compelling larouche aides to testify about the 
movements finances under grants of limited immunity from 
prosecution 
assistant us attorney kent robinson said ms magraws testimony 
would not only support the tax count but charges that larouche and 
six codefendants in the case conspired to defraud lenders by not 
repaying their loans to his organizations 
the personal expenditures cited by ms magraw were made while the 
larouche organization was contending that no discretionary money was 
available to repay some 25 million of the more than 30 million 
lent to the movement about 5 million was repaid according to 
earlier testimony 
trying to rebut the personal expense testimony defense lawyers 
attempted to show that the vast majority of money spent for larouche 
was for legitimate security and research purposes not for his 
personal benefit 
the defense effort was cut short however by us district judge 
albert v bryan jr he refused to allow any defense questioning of 
ms magraw on the movements need for consultants who were paid 
weekly monthly daily and flat payments defense lawyers described 
the consultants as national security experts 
the defense struck out too when it tried to question the 
witness about payments for security protection for two latin 
american members of larouches organization the defense contended 
they were threatened by drug dealers and were given refuge with 
their families in larouches leesburg va estate 
the government on the other hand was permitted to introduce a 
memo prepared by ms magraw in which she said listing consultant 
payments under legal investigations services rendered for 
personal research was not a particularly defensible position 
under irs scrutiny 
ms magraw testified that she really didnt know if the expenses 
were listed improperly under irs regulations 
robinson the prosecutor had ms magraw read for jurors some of 
the expenses from larouches security fund which was designed 
for the personal security of larouche his aides and his guests 
among the items was a 7000 piano and furniture for larouches 
leesburg estate cufflinks for larouche shoes for larouches wife 
helga film clothes for larouche flowers luggage costing 41596 
a hairdresser appointment for mrs larouche and a 10 haircut for 
larouche a 25 hairdresser appointment for an unidentified person

the switch for a takeoff warning system 
aboard delta flight 1141 was corroded a veteran boeing engineer 
today told a national transportation safety board panel 
investigating the crash of the boeing 727 
but engineer donald r ryder told the ntsb board that the f197 
throttle switch taken from the plane after it crashed aug 31 at 
dallasfort worth international airport killing 14 of the 108 
people aboard subsequently passed engineering and circuitry tests 
the system would have warned the pilots if the jets wing flaps 
were improperly set for takeoff the flaps provide extra lift during 
the slow speeds of takeoff and landing 
some of the flaps were found in the incorrect position after the 
crash but it is not known whether they were set that way or whether 
they were moved out of position by the impact or by mechanical 
failure in the flap controls 
an exhibit by the ntsb indicated the switch exhibited 
bluegreen corrosiontype substance around the normally open 
terminals on the exterior of the housing the exhibit also said 
the plunger hole on the switch was enlarged 
the air line pilots association said before the public hearing 
began tuesday that its experts believed the planes takeoff warning 
system was inoperative and that the pilots had no idea that the 
planes flaps were improperly set some up some down 
ryder said the switch worked perfectly in tests of circuitry 
designed to resemble that of the plane 
but upon questioning ryder said the same switch had not worked 
in other tests by an ntsb investigator 
during his test ryder said the button and the plunger of the 
switch slipped by each other meaning they didnt make contact he 
blamed the failure on mismanipulation saying the installation 
was different from wha one would find on a 727 
ryder said any problems with inoperative switches should be found 
during routine maintenance and that the switches are virtually 
selfcleaning brushing the contacts clean with each use 
witness robert e north of pratt amp whitney said his companys 
three engines mounted on delta flight 1141 showed no sign of damage 
that might have occurred before the crash the third engine showed 
major interior damage but north said he believed the evidence 
indicated the damage must have occurred after the crash 
on wednesday a boeing aerodynamics supervisor testified that the 
plane was traveling fast enough to fly even if its flaps had been 
retracted 
investigators have been puzzled by the fact the planes flap 
handle was found up the retracted position although some of the 
planes flaps and slats were extended 
ntsb officials say the hearing is only for factgathering and 
that no conclusions will be released until a report is made public 
in six months 
all three crew members agreed before the board that to the best 
of their recollection they made all necessary preflight 
preparations including setting the flaps although they may have 
bent several delta regulations one of their admitted technical 
violations was allowing a flight attendant into the cockpit during a 
long delay before takeoff

miguel de la madrid left the presidency 
thursday after leading mexico through six difficult years in which 
the measure of his success was avoiding bankruptcy and social 
upheaval 
as he put it in a newspaper interview this week i took a 
country with great problems and leave it with problems 
tradition dictates that de la madrid at age 53 retire to a 
quiet life away from politics or go to the mexican embassy of his 
choice if he has a taste for diplomacy 
he leaves office with a much better image than his predecessor 
jose lopez portillo whose populist ideology and financial 
mismanagement combined with the collapse of world oil prices 
almost led to bankruptcy 
so deep was the crisis in 1982 that even de la madrids critics 
say avoiding disaster was a major accomplishment 
de la madrid takes more personal pride in reforms that opened 
mexicos political system to the opposition at the expense of his 
institutional revolutionary party known by its spanish initials pri 
carlos salinas de gortari who succeeded him thursday won a much 
narrower victory than customary for candidates of the pri which has 
controlled mexicos government since it was founded in 1929 
party faithful were shocked this week when de la madrid said in 
an interview he foresees a time as mexican society matures when 
the opposition will share in the government 
during his sixyear term de la madrid also attacked some sacred 
political and economic cows by reducing protectionism and state 
control of the economy among other things he pushed his country 
into the general agreement on trade and tariffs 
a close associate said he had the courage to take unpopular 
measures there was a price for the president and his party the 
opposition took 237 of 500 congressional seats in the july 6 
elections and still claims salinas won the presidency by fraud 
when de la madrid took office the treasury was almost empty and 
economic disaster was at hand 
his term was one of crisis management negotiations under 
pressure with political labor and business groups at home and with 
international banks pressing for payments on a foreign debt reached 
104 billion at one point 
he resisted urgings to suspend debt payments choosing instead to 
bargain with banks and other creditors for better terms by the 
middle of this year foreign exchange reserves had reached 16 
billion and mexico was making debt payments of up to 14 billion a 
year 
among the disasters he could not control were the collapse of oil 
prices from 32 a barrel to under 15 an earthquake in 1985 that 
killed an estimated 9000 in mexico city and hurricane gilbert in 
september 
asked whether he considered himself a badluck president de la 
madrid smiled and said no just a difficulttimes president 
mexico had no economic growth and workers lost nearly half their 
real wages because pay was kept low while prices climbed 
political opponents claimed his economic policies favored private 
business de la madrid replied that sacrifices were needed to 
maintain a productive source of employment 
last year he enlisted labor and business in the economic 
solidarity pact to fight inflation the annual rate was 140 
percent in 1987 but is expected to be down to 40 percent this year 
private business leaders critics of the government in the past 
praised de la madrids sale of stateowned companies his austerity 
measures and his programs to boost exports 
if this continues the countrys economy will grow quickly 
said agustin legorreta president of the business coordinating 
council

australia said today it will close the 
yugoslav consulate and expel its staff if authorities there dont 
turn over a security guard who shot a teenage demonstrator 
yugoslavia rejected the demand 
the moves were the latest in a diplomatic wrangle over the 
wounding of the youth on sunday and yugoslavias refusal to 
apologize formally for the shooting at its consulate in sydney 
in a statement carried by the official tanjug news agency in 
belgrade the yugoslav government said australian officials failed 
to undertake measures to protect our consulate from attackers 
the security guard had no choice but shooting into the air to 
warn australian organsthat lives and security of workers in the 
consulate and their families were directly imperiled the 
statement said 
the statement was in response to one issued earlier by foreign 
minister gareth evans saying the australian government had 
sufficient evidence to prosecute the security guard who fired the 
gun 
evans demanded that the guard identified as matijas zoran be 
handed over to police by 6 pm friday or the australian 
government will immediately close the consulategeneral 
about 1500 people protested at the consulate on sunday yugoslav 
national day police said a security guard fired on hundreds of 
demonstrators when several croatian youths began climbing the walls 
jospeh tokic 16 was shot in the throat and was in stable 
condition at a sydney hospital croatians are among several ethnic 
groups in yugoslavia 
about 200000 yugoslavs live in australia 
tanjug said the yugoslav government referred to the demonstrators 
as ustashas croatian fascists who allied with nazi germany against 
yugoslav resistance forces during world war ii 
yugoslav ambassador boris cizelj allowed police to question the 
guard after consulting with his government in belgrade but he 
insisted the interview be conducted inside the consulate and in the 
presence of the consulgeneral 
he said zoran would not leave the country until police complete 
their investigation 
the belgrade government lodged an official protest over what it 
called a lack of police protection during the demonstration

singh which means lion 
the petition challenges president ramaswamy venkataramans 
refusal to grant clemency to his father without reviewing the merits 
of the case united news of india and press trust of india reported 
venkataraman last week said he could not go into the merits of a 
case already decided by the supreme court the petition filed by 
rajinder singh however contends the constitution gives the 
president such powers the news agencies said

appealed against another high court decision dismissing his appeals 
earlier in the day 
two sikh bodyguards satwant singh and beant singh shot mrs 
gandhi in the garden of her residence on oct 31 1984

have died this year alone in northern punjab state where sikhs are

he said the arrests were under way in nine unspecified italian 
cities and in baltimore buffalo new york miami newark new

arrest warrants were members of the satola gambino and inzerillo 
crime families in italy and the united states the staterun raitv 
said several top mafia figures were among those arrested 
italian news agencies said the drug raids resulted from an 
investigation that stemmed from the pizza connection

through pizzerias in the united states 
a us court convicted 18 people in connection with that ring and 
italian prosecutors indicted 28 people for their alleged involvement

nato defense ministers thursday urged 
us allies to boost defense spending upgrade military equipment 
and play a greater role in maintaining a strong western alliance 
the recommendations came in a burdensharing report that 
responds to criticism from us congressman who argue the united 
states is picking up too much of the defense tab 
ministers adopted the report at the start of a twoday meeting 
the report acknowledged significant differences between 
individual national contributions 
but it contended countries such as west germany bear high social 
costs because of 400000 foreign troops stationed there 
west german defense minister rupert scholz said the review on his 
country was rather positive i didnt expect it any other way 
us critics have suggested the united states withdraw some of 
its 326000 troops stationed in europe if the europeans do not pay 
more 
as the alliance approaches its 40th anniversary its strength 
and cohesion remain as firm as ever with continuing major 
contributions being made by both the european and north american 
pillars the report said 
but it noted both rich and poor countries have earmarked for 
defense less and less as a percentage of total economic activity or 
gross domestic product 
italy luxembourg norway and spain were singled out for 
maintaining or increasing slightly their levels of defense spending 
allocating money for defense was crucial but making available 
people and space accepting limitations in personal freedom or the 
quality of life braving internal or external tensions and 
different degrees of exposure or vulnerability are by no means less 
important elements of the overall burden the report said 
it estimated the united states tagged an average 598 percent of 
its economic output to defense from 1983 to 1987 well ahead was 
greece which spent 652 percent 
britain devoted 501 percent of its gdp to defense turkey 
averaged 4 percent and germany 32 percent 
others were belgium 326 percent canada 217 percent 
denmark 22 percent italy 216 percent luxembourg 118 percent 
netherlands 332 percent norway 293 percent portugal 322 
percent and spain 237 percent iceland was not included in the 
table 
all natos 16 nations except france and spain are members of the 
defense planning committee which approved the report 
the report praised the reagan administration for an exceptional 
and sustained effort to modernize and upgrade all aspects of its 
armed forces 
but it said the defense spending surge seems to have come to an 
end and is likely to be followed by a period of stabilization 
european countries it said provide 90 percent of the manpower 
80 percent of combat aircraft 70 percent of tanks and 80 percent of 
artillery in the alliance 
but it urged many european members and canada to make bigger 
contributions

us and italian authorities announced today 
they have charged more than 200 people including major figures in 
the sicilian mafia in a joint undercover operation targeting 
international cocaine and heroin drugtrafficking rings in both 
countries 
arrests were under way in baltimore buffalo ny miami 
newark nj new york philadelphia san francisco and rockford 
ill in italy arrests were being made in palermo bologna and 
florence 
among the 75 people charged in the united states and 133 in italy 
were some of the top leaders of organized crime fbi director 
william sessions said 
an fbi spokesman william carter said that by midday 52 people 
had been arrested in the united states and 22 in italy 
sessions said the arrests culminated a longterm undercover 
operation that he said builds strong cases against top leaders 
of organized crime 
the fbi said it used courtauthorized wiretaps physical 
surveillance and heroin and cocaine buys to develop evidence leading 
to the arrests here and in italy 
the italian news agency agi said the twoyear investigation that 
led to the raids stemmed from the pizza connection international 
drug ring that sold 16 billion of heroin mostly through pizzerias 
in the united states 
a us court convicted 18 people in connection with that ring 
and italian prosecutors indicted 28 people for their alleged 
involvement at fbi headquarters in washington carter declined to 
comment about any tiein between the pizza connection and the 
current probe 
in a statement the fbi said the operation developed from what 
originally were independent criminal probes in buffalo new york and 
philadelphia 
they grew into a coordinated probe when agents found links 
between many of the targets of the separate investigations 
the buffalo case was initially designed to concentrate on 
drugtrafficking rings in the western new york area and was code 
named busico which stands for buffalo sicilian connection 
it ultimately became tied to a probe in philadelphia called the 
iron tower case eventually requiring the cooperation of six fbi 
field offices three italian police agencies other us government 
agencies and overseas support of the drug enforcement administration 
undercover fbi agents traveled to italy to discuss major drug 
buys italian police inspectors worked with fbi agents on the 
investigation in new york and philadelphia 
in italy the news agency ansa said police were seeking at least 
37 people there who were named in arrest warrants issued by 
antimafia magistrate giovanne falcone it said all the people named 
in the warrants were members of the spatola gambino and inzerillo 
crime families in italy and the united states 
the staterun raitv said italian authorities with the help of 
us investigators arrested several top mafia figures it said 300 
policemen helped by helicopters and dogs were reportedly employed 
in the sweep 
as one part of the investigation the fbi said it developed 
information that cocaine was being sent from south america to a 
laboratory 300 miles north of madrid spain there the cocaine was 
processed and sent to italy and exchanged for heroin that was 
shipped to the united states the fbi told spanish and italian 
authorities about the exchange and arrests were subsequently made in 
spain 
agi and ansa said the probe that led to the raids began after the 
arrest of women drug couriers at airports in palermo and new york 
two years ago it said the women were paid 7800 for every two 
pounds of heroin they smuggled from italy to the united states 
inside money belts

an accountant who was jailed four years for 
criticizing the ruling communist party has appealed to the un 
human rights commission to intercede on behalf of fellow dissidents 
still in prison 
ren wanding also renewed his call first made a decade ago that 
the party allow the chinese people to decide in free elections who 
should rule them 
i say what everything thinks ren said in an interview 
thursday marked by a frankness rarely seen in chinas tightly 
controlled political atmosphere 
the people are not satisfied when the time is ready they will 
stand up he said i have no plans to organize an uprising its 
a historical necessity 
ren 44 helped lead the 197879 democracy wall movement a brief 
thaw during which authorities tolerated unprecedented calls for 
multiparty democracy he and dozens of other dissidents were 
imprisoned in 1979 as counterrevolutionaries 
ren who said he was never given a trial was released in 1983 
after four years of education by labor including two years in 
solitary confinement 
he said he was speaking out after nearly a decade of silence in 
order to mark the movements anniversary and draw attention to 
colleagues still in jail 
if the un human rights commission and international society 
do not expose the human rights violations of their members this 
will promote evil and do damage to justice and the lofty purpose of 
the united nations ren wrote to the united nations 
he urged the world community to investigate the conditions of 
chinas jailed dissidents human rights groups he wrote should 
ask are they dressed warmly in prison and are they bothered by 
flies in summer 
what is their nutrition and medical treatment like are these 
people still beaten in prison are they required to donate blood 
even though they suffer from poor nutrition are they still given 
meat and canned food that has gone bad are they still allowed 
out just once every month or two months and given only a minute or 
two for a trip to the toilet 
having been in prison i am familiar with the suffering ren 
said in the interview he said he was held in solitary confinement 
for two years and was allowed books only after the first year 
ren also issued a statement this week to the foreign media urging 
foreign businesses to demand china improve its human rights policy 
before investing 
the democracy wall movement began with a few prodemocracy 
posters plastered on a brick wall in beijing encouraged by 
reformist statements by top leader deng xiaoping students and 
workers put hundreds more posters on the wall and similar walls in 
other cities homeprinted magazines circulated openly demanding 
rule by law multiparty elections and an end to party privileges 
ren along with more than a dozen friends edited a journal 
called chinese human rights mimeographing hundreds of copies in 
their homes 
by 1979 however deng had consolidated his hold over leftists in 
the party and cracked down on the democracy movement 
more than a dozen of its leaders remain jailed ren said the 
best known is wei jingsheng who wrote an impassioned plea for 
democracy as a fifth modernization to go along with the official 
program of modernizing agriculture industry science and the 
military 
last year amnesty international said it had unconfirmed reports 
wei had died in prison but china denied it ren said he had no 
direct information on wei but believed him to be at a labor camp in 
western chinas qinghai province 
other activists in the democracy wall movement have remained 
silent since thousands of students in beijing and other cities 
joined in prodemocracy marches in the winter of 198687 but no 
nationally renowned leaders emerged and the demonstrations subsided 
under a government crackdown 
since then the only dissident who has openly criticized marxism 
and oneparty rule is fang lizhi an astrophysicist who says his 
fame gives him some protection from government retribution he was 
expelled from the communist party in 1987 for allegedly having 
helped incite the student protests 
ren said he also has no plans to form an opposition but will 
continue to speak out 
how can i not speak ren said i cant be afraid of arrest 
if i am i cant do anything if they arrest me they arrest me

the trees are bare and the slanting sunlight 
of late autumn does little to ease the chill in brookdale cemetery 
but anthony scaccias young friends still congregate at his grave 
more than a year after anthony was killed at the age of 13 by a 
drunken hitandrun driver his friends still spend hours at his 
burial plot talking sharing funny stories and gossip keeping him 
company 
they leave flowers loose change pumpkins at halloween dolls 
chewing gum wreaths anything they think anthony would like 
etched with anthonys name on his headstone are a dirt bike and a 
fishing pole emblems of his greatest passions 
it has become a place where the pain of death can be confronted 
and sometimes eased 
before anthony died if id come home late and told my mother i 
was at the cemetery shed have been wary said 14yearold billy 
fox but now if i say it she understands why were there its a 
place to talk and think about things its a peaceful place to talk 
to anthony 
you dont want anybody to walk by and say oh its a typical 
grave said fox who brings his friend toy soldiers and flags 
we want people to say wow that kid must have been real 
they all sit around in front of his headstone and talk to 
anthony about whats going on in their lives they ask how hes 
doing up there and what its like said anthonys mother dianne 
scaccia billy fox said sometimes in the summer he lays out and 
stretches his arms across the grass and feels anthonys hand 
the outpouring of love and allegiance to her son does not 
surprise mrs scaccia who has four other children 
anthony was a kind of special kid he had a great many 
friends she said wednesday he was adventurous and the kids got 
into the habit of following him around and depending on him to plan 
out what to do it wasnt unusual for us to wake up at 8 am on 
summer mornings and have 16 or 17 kids waiting outside for him 
public works commissioner dominic divirgilio who tends the 
cemetery has watched from a distance as small groups of anthonys 
friends have gathered 
i have never stopped or interfered mainly because i know what 
they are going through divirgilio said theyve been going down 
to more or less deal with losing someone as young as that to deal 
with death and reality ive never seen it as anything other than 
respectful and healthy 
anthony was struck by a car on oct 3 1987 when he and several 
friends were crossing a highway 
thirty of his friends showed up at the hospital that night to 
await word school officials had to call in extra guidance 
counselors from neighboring schools to help students deal with their 
grief 
the man driving the car turned himself in four days later he was 
convicted of motor vehicle homicide while under the influence of 
alcohol and was sentenced to five to eight years in prison 
mark defilippo 14 said he and his friends find it easier to 
wrestle with anthonys death at graveside 
i think its a way of keeping him alive he told the dedham 
daily transcript recently we go there to keep him with us but we 
also go to talk talking helps me and everyone 
teenagers said they leave sentimental gifts for anthony things 
that might give him a chuckle or keep him from feeling out of step 
with the latest fad 
everybody knows hes up there by going down to visit were 
keeping him from feeling left behind or lonely said donna galvin 
a middle school student whose grandmothers grave is next to 
anthonys this way everyone knows hes still there 
i talk to him and say whats going on how ya doin whats 
going on up there we all miss you fox said we start laughing 
about something and say hey remember that anthony 
and i myself i think he hears us and i think he laughs but 
we cant hear him ya know

prime minister margaret thatcher on thursday 
submitted legislation to sell the electricity monopoly a sale three 
times larger than previous steps in her campaign to dispose of 
nationalized industries 
financial analysts have said the sale of the power generating and 
distribution system in england and wales to be completed by 
mid1991 may be worth anywhere from 30 billion to 50 billion two 
separate companies will be set up in scotland while northern 
ireland is not affected 
the largest previous sale of shares in british gas in 1986 
earned the government 142 billion the electricity sale is apt to 
equal the proceeds of all previous sales including british 
petroleum rolls royce jaguar and british airways 
electricity and the privatization of the english and welsh water 
supply are the two main flotations set to go through parliament in 
the coming year 
the proposals in this bill are radical but they are 
evolutionary energy minister cecil parkinson said at a news 
conference introducing the legislation 
they preserve all that is best in the present system 
maintaining security of supply and they offer the prospect of real 
competition the best guarantee of customers interests in an 
industry where there has been no competition for 30 years 
competition would be fostered by splitting the central 
electricity generating board into two companies powergen which 
will own 30 percent of cegbs nonnuclear capacity and national 
power which will take over the nuclear plant and remaining 
nonnuclear capacity 
in advance of the bills introduction the opposition labor party 
had charged that privatization would lead to increases of up to 25 
percent in electric rates 
vague waffle about longterm downward pressure on costs is no 
consolation for consumers facing immediate and harsh pressure on 
their living standards labors energy spokesman tony blair said 
wednesday 
there are no new costs created by privatization there is no 
new levy created by privatization parkinson asserted thursday 
he added the idea that public ownership and the monopoly are 
some sort of insurance against price increases is a sick joke 
blair complained the bill introduced thursday lacked important 
details the meat will be in the various licenses regulations and 
contracts to follow he said 
parkinson said he hoped that eventually as many as 20 companies 
would be competing to generate and sell electricity 
power will be sold to a dozen private supply companies created 
from existing regional boards which would serve homes and industry 
the transmission facilities owned by cegb would be transferred to 
a new company the national grid co jointly owned by the 12 supply 
companies 
parkinson declined to say how much the government might gain from 
a sale it is far too early to say parkinson said we havent 
gotten anywhere near putting a value on the assets 
cegb has assets worth 50 billion and employs 47000 people the 
regional boards have 81500 employees 
shares will be sold to foreigners as well as british citizens 
parkinson said the limit on share ownership has not been decided 
but he said limiting any one stockholder to 15 percent of shares had 
worked well in other privatization plans 
since the conservatives came to power in 1979 the government has 
raised 305 billion by selling stateowned companies 
the latest to go on sale is british steel whose deadline for 
share applications expires on friday

carlos salinas de gortari was inaugurated as 
president of mexico today despite opposition protests that his 
government is illegitimate and wont make promised economic and 
political reforms 
about 150 of the 564 lawmakers walked out just before salinas was 
inaugurated while members of the national action front held up 
signs saying fraud 
in his inaugural address the harvardeducated economist said he 
was taking power at a time of conflict and change and promised 
nationalist democratic and popular reforms 
i will be prudent in never risking the destiny of country 
but firm in maintaining order and the constitution salinas said 
i will govern for all mexicans 
a legislator for the opposition democratic front marcela 
lombardo was applauded when she told the congress that the fronts 
candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas had been cheated of victory in the 
election by the governing institutional revolutionary party 
this is an illfated day because the right of the people to 
select their rulers is being violated said ms lombardo who 
spoke before salinas inauguration 
salinas took power from president miguel de la madrid at a 
special session of congress after the opposition speeches the 
opposition had threatened to disrupt the ceremony if that was not 
permitted 
according to official figures salinas won barely more than 50 
percent of the presidential vote while cardenas won 31 percent and 
the conservative national action party candidate manuel clouthier 
had 17 percent 
i want to be the voice of those who believing in better times 
were once again victims of contempt for their rights said 
national action delegate said abel vicencio tovar 
the people of mexico voted for another program radically 
different from the one applied during the administration that is 
ending said ms lombardo a delegate from mexico city 
salinas is a disciple and exponent of the free market while 
leftist cardenas called for a bigger government role in the economy 
and suspension of payments on the nations debt 
on wednesday night president fidel castro of cuba president 
daniel ortega of nicaragua and other heads of state attended a 
private dinner for salinas despite protests from salinas opponents 
cardenas has said the mexican government invited heads of state 
to an inaugural for the first time in an effort to make up for their 
lack of support inside mexico he said those who came would be 
supporting an illegitimate government 
the salinas transition team says the invitations are a courtesy 
because the mexican president has been invited to other 
inaugurations 
with cabinet appointments announced wednesday salinas served 
notice that he intends to push ahead with the economic policies he 
designed while serving as his predecessors budget director 
encouraging competition and reducing state involvement in the 
economy in an effort to promote growth 
several key appointees are young worked with salinas under de la 
madrid and like salinas have degrees in economics from topranked 
us schools 
salinas has said his biggest concern is to get mexico to grow 
again and to do that the country needs both new investment and 
the use of resources that now go abroad as payments on mexicos 102 
billion foreign debt 
in charge of renegotiating that debt will be treasury secretary 
pedro aspe 38 who earned a doctorate from the massachusetts 
institute of technology 
salinas inherits a country with a lot of problems the debt an 
economy that has been stagnant for six years an inflation rate of 
40 percent and an electoral system that has lost credibility 
the new president will need a quick success to demonstrate his 
command of the job and he expects help from presidentelect george 
bushs incoming administration to win a reduction in debt payments 
aside from castro and ortega others in mexico for the 
inauguration were presidents virgilio barco of colombia raul 
alfonsin of argentina jose napoleon duarte of el salvador jose 
azcona hoyo of honduras vinicio cerezo arevalo of guatemala and 
prime minister manuel esquivel of belize 
the us delegation was headed by secretary of state george p 
shultz and included bushs son john and his mexicanamerican wife

former astronaut sally ride a stanford 
university physicist since 1987 says she might quit the institution 
over a dispute involving the schools center for international 
security and arms control 
ride who works on arms control and space policy said tuesday 
through a colleague that she was seriously looking around for 
other things because of the resignation last week of noted arms 
control expert and physicist sidney drell and concerns about 
university hiring procedure 
drell a government adviser on arms control since the 1960s 
accused the university of dragging its feet over attempts to create 
a more permanent center staff for the study of technical political 
and economic aspects of arms control since the center is not a 
formal department it has no power to offer faculty status and the 
hiring is done by the university 
theodore postel a stanford nuclear engineer and physicist 
passed along rides jobhunting statement and said he too was 
looking for another job 
its serious for the center stanford president donald 
kennedy said of drells resignation we are going to have to work 
hard to try to find other people and other resources to make up for 
what is a big loss 
the stanford center is considered among the top such projects in 
the world last year the center organized a global conference on 
arms issues for leaders in the field

former philippines president ferdinand 
marcos charged with conspiring to steal more than 100 million from 
his homeland writes in a journal to be published this month that he 
is being unfairly judged 
marcos whose lawyers claim hes too ill to stand trial or even 
to travel from his exile home in hawaii writes his defense in the 
winter issue of orbis to be distributed dec 28 by the foreign 
policy research institute a philadelphia think tank 
an advance copy of the article was made available to the 
associated press 
marcos insists in the sixpage 2500word essay that he didnt 
raid the treasury of more than 5 billion during the 21 years he led 
the philippines until his ouster in 1986 and he didnt allow 
friends to siphon off huge sums 
the fact is that none of these charges which are criminal in 
character has been made subject to judicial scrutiny marcos 
wrote 
many of the socalled marcos cronies are in the philippines 
today they are within the reach of the present administration in 
manila although presumably possessed of all the evidence necessary 
to establish their guilt the aquino administration has not 
prosecuted any of these putative malefactors 
private property has been seized moral declamations have been 
broadcast but not one single case has been brought before a court 
of law with criminals in such abundance whose guilt is so evident 
one might have expected that at least one of them would have had to 
face prosecution by this time 
marcos wrote that he has asked the government in manila to allow 
him to return and afford me the opportunity to face my accusers 
but it has steadfastly refused my demand for a day in court 
marcos article was in response to one written in the last issue 
of orbis distributed in september by theodore friend former 
president of swarthmore college and currently head of eisenhower 
exchange fellowships 
friend accused marcos of wrecking the philippines politically and 
economically through corruption and murder 
marcos said the omnibus charges repeated by friend that i am 
personally responsible for the murder of political opponents and 
the massive derogation of human rights in the philippines merit 
little further comment because his request to return and be 
subject to his countrys courts had been rejected 
to date the authorities in manila have refused my request 
have failed to indict and display a singular unwillingness to 
prosecute marcos wrote 
friend in an answer to marcos in the same orbis called him an 
astute lawyer who shielded himself with legalisms many of them 
contrived he also said 39 civil suits against him in the 
philippines seek a total of 9617 billion and that criminal suits 
also are pending there 
marcos used his regime as a means to preserve and enhance his 
own political power as a means to engorge his friends and as a 
means to enrich his family and himself not by peculations but by 
systematic parasitic robbery friend wrote 
marcos who rejected every suggestion he was guilty of anything 
said us intervention into philippine affairs that led to his 
ouster and the election of corazon aquino as president backfired 
the strangest feature of all this is that not only have us 
interests now been placed in serious jeopardy but all the charges 
that made my administration a pariah among policy makers in 
washington have recently resurfaced as charges against the present 
regime marcos wrote 
marcos and his wife imelda were indicted oct 21 in new york on 
federal criminal racketeering charges accusing them of plundering 
the philippines treasury and stashing much of the money in the 
united states 
mrs marcos pleaded innocent to the charges oct 31 in new york 
and was released on 5 million bail 
defense lawyers contend marcos is too frail to make the 10hour 
flight to new york for arraignment or trial a courtappointed 
physician decided in late november that marcos is healthy enough to 
face charges in new york

fence of the house shell move into next month 
it was the eighth consecutive year the wife of the vice president 
has performed that task and one she apparently doesnt want to give 
up when husband georges title is shortened its the only thing 
ive done more than anyone else she told a guest in a reception 
line afterwards i love it 
to a separate guest she said i would be offended if someone 
else did it 
president reagan is to light the live national tree for his last 
time dec 15 after which a pageant featuring 57 trees each 
decorated with ornaments from a different state or territory will

pressure to reduce deficits can be expected to 
be a major factor as the bush administration searches for new farm 
program formulas agriculture secretary richard e lyng said 
thursday 
you cannot avoid having the problems of trade deficit and 
fiscal deficit intrude heavily on agricultural policy in the new 
administration the outgoing cabinet member told a meeting at the 
agriculture department 
as much as 3 billion may have to be cut from farm programs by 
lawmakers in 1989 to meet targets under the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law said lyng and two economists on a panel with him at 
usdas annual agricultural outlook conference 
lawmakers might be able to negotiate a lesser cut they said but 
they added that the full 3 billion could be needed if congress goes 
ahead with the acrosstheboard reductions envisioned by the 
grammrudman law 
farm subsidy programs operated by the governments commodity 
credit corp are running at about 13 billion a year down from 26 
billion in fiscal 1986 
the three panelists at the closing session of the outlook 
conference suggested congress might decide to pass a stopgap farm 
bill and hold off until at least 1991 on any major revision of the 
array of fiveyear programs expiring in 1990 
the crystal ballgazing session was attended largely by 
government officials agribusiness executives and the news media 
and lyng reiterated that he will not be at the helm of the 
department in the new administration numerous possible successors 
have been mentioned but thus far no word has come from 
presidentelect george bush or his transition team 
lyng said current farm programs approved in 1985 when 
agriculture was reeling from plunging crop prices and land values 
have proven highly popular and i dont think we would have any 
changes in farm programs if it werent for budget pressures 
youve got 3 billion to save in some shape or form and its 
going to drive changes i think in 1989 the secretary said 
all the same there is no certainty that the bush administration 
will propose extensive changes in the year ahead said lynn daft an 
agricultural economist and former usda official 
you dont have to come forward with legislation right away 
he said he noted that farmers are not clamoring for any change 
if i were a new administration coming in id say why rush 
he said 
with farmers largely satisfied congress could well decide to 
extend the 1985 law for a year or so and tackle any major overhaul 
later 
particularly when youve got eight members of the senate 
agriculture committee up for reelection in 1990 said william 
lesher a consultant and former lyng business partner also appearing 
on the panel 
my guess as the secretary says is that its at least a 50 
percent chance that stopgap legislation will be approved lesher 
said 
as for reducing farm program spending by 3 billion lesher told 
the session there are only three ways to do the job 
he said one would be to lower target prices congressionally set 
price levels used in calculating incomesupport payments another 
would be to reduce the acreage base used in calculating payments 
and a third would be to cut the amount of acreage planted

radio free europe and radio liberty were 
broadcasting loud and clear today as the soviet union and its 
allies kept thousands of jamming transmitters off the air for a 
second day 
the only feedback is that were being heard loud and clear in 
the soviet union said stanley leinwoll us engineering director 
for the governmentsponsored radio services which are based in 
munich west germany 
leinwoll said jamming continued today of radio free europe 
broadcasts beamed into czechoslovakia and bulgaria and against voice 
of america and west german broadcasts into afghanistan although 
other services into those countries were now unhindered 
engineers had anticipated that that jamming might also end 
leinwoll called the shutdown a momentous event but cautioned 
that the soviets still have jamming devices in place and said the 
united states would maintain its antijamming equipment 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the united 
states had pressed the soviet union at recent summit meetings to end 
the jamming we are pleased to see that these efforts have borne 
fruit he said 
word that the more than 2000 jamming transmitters in the soviet 
union and its eastern european allies had ceased spread through 
europe on wednesday as shortwave radio operators discovered that the 
annoying raspy hum of soviet interference was no longer heard over 
us west german israeli or other broadcasts 
the hum is gone announced malcolm s forbes jr chairman of 
the board for overseas broadcasting which directs the 200 
millionayear us broadcasting effort based in europe we think 
this is a very significant move by the soviet union forbes said 
at a news conference 
future programming aimed at the services estimated 55 million 
listeners could now include more music fewer repeated programs and 
such new features as callin talk shows officials said 
forbes said radio engineers who had developed sophisticated 
techniques for overriding the jamming were surprised by the 
development although there had been some subtle signs of change 
during a recent visit by us broadcast executives to moscow in 
september 
he said the action could bring significant savings to the 
economically hardpressed soviets who officials estimate spend up 
to 125 billion a year on jamming 
the soviet government has made no announcement acknowledging that 
it had sharply trimmed back its jamming activities 
radio liberty and radio free europe are run separately from the 
voice of america and broadcast solely to the soviet bloc soviet 
jamming of voa transmissions stopped in 1987 and voa now has a 
bureau in moscow 
voa covers much broader world news and more us affairs than 
radio free europe or radio liberty which have been steadily jammed 
since they were started in the early 1950s 
radio liberty radio free europe and the 3yearold radio 
afghanistan are funded by congress radio liberty is a former cia 
operation but forbes said all three stations provide accurate and 
objective coverage their nativelanguage broadcasts have more 
listeners than any other stations in areas where jamming stopped 
earlier such as hungary and poland he said 
officials said the continued jamming in some countries could 
either have been an oversight or another example of the reluctance 
of europes toughest communist regimes to embrace soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachevs policies of glasnost or openness 
charles z wick director of the us information agency which 
runs voa said the lifting of jamming apparently was timed to 
coincide with the meeting next week of gorbachev and president 
reagan 
its another marker in the soviet march toward trying to be an 
acceptable citizen of the world community as against the pariah that 
they have been wick said in a telephone interview 
the soviet action came so quickly that radio engineers were only 
becoming aware of it as secretary of state george shultz said in a 
broadcast to europe wednesday morning that radio jamming was one 
area where progress was still needed with the soviets 
the cessation of jamming represents a significant step on the 
part of the soviet government toward the free flow of information 
said gene pell president of radio liberty which is based in 
munich west germany 
reports from the soviet union and the baltic republics confirm 
that radio liberty and radio free europe broadcasts are being heard 
loud and clear said pell 
officials said broadcasts now might include more music which is 
so badly mangled by jamming that it is rarely played on the stations 
ken thompson a broadcast board official in washington said he 
first got word the jamming had stopped in a message left by pell 
from munich on his telephone answering machine tuesday evening 
in europe jubilant engineers were up late into the night 
checking the newly cleared broadcasts verifying that all 
transmissions in 12 soviet bloc languages were getting through for 
the first time in history thompson said 
he said a us embassy official in moscow told radio liberty he 
was astonished to turn on the radio and get its first 
unobstructed broadcast wednesday morning

rescuers searched the ruins of 
mudandstraw huts thursday for survivors of a cyclone that shrieked 
ashore like thousands of demons killing at least 596 people and 
leaving half a million homeless 
unofficial counts put the number of dead at well over 1000 
more than 1000 people still were officially reported missing 
thursday nearly 48 hours after the storm raged in from the bay of 
bengal to devastate southern bangladesh and eastern india 
officials said strong winds and cloudy skies hampered helicopter 
searchandrescue operations 
it looked like the end of the world as if thousands of demons 
were out to kill us said kazi mansoor a government official in 
khulna 55 miles north of the coast 
osman ghani a messenger at the khulna newspaper janabarta said 
i thought the entire town would be blown away the storm 
felled trees and power supply lines in hundreds and thousands 
the cyclone struck tuesday night whipping up 15foot tidal waves 
that submerged lowlying coastal islands lashing the flat mainland 
with wind gusts of more than 100 mph 
it struck while bangladesh still was recovering from summer 
floods that took about 1500 lives and left nearly onefifth of the 
110 million people homeless in this impoverished land most of which 
is a vast river delta 
military officials who accompanied president hussain ershad on an 
inspection tour thursday said at least 496 people drowned were 
electrocuted or died when their homes collapsed police sources in 
neighboring india said at least 100 people were killed in west 
bengal state 
official tallies in both countries usually are much lower than 
independent estimates reflecting bureaucratic delays and difficulty 
in obtaining accurate information from areas where communications 
are poor even in normal times 
dhaka newspapers said at least 1000 people were killed in 
bangladesh and indian news agencies put the count in west bengal at 
200 
ershad flew to the region and toured it by car rather than 
helicopter because of the rough weather flattened houses and trees 
snapped power poles and devastated croplands were everywhere 
in taltala a village of 500 people 40 miles west of khulna that 
lost 13 of its 21 huts he said let us brave the cyclone as we 
did the recent flooding 
tuesdays storm covered the greatest area of any recent cyclone 
in bangladesh but the death toll does not approach that from a 1970 
storm that killed at least 300000 a cyclone in 1985 took 10000 
lives 
the 1970 storm spent most of its energy along the coast but this 
one covered the entire southern half of the country 
mansoor a member of the khulna municipal government said 
400000 people were homeless in the city of 15 million 
there is an acute shortage of food drinking water and medicine 
for the injured he said when reached by telephone from dhaka the 
capital pressed rice and molasses were the only food stuff we 
could so far distribute among the homeless and affected people 
the storm took a heavy toll of the flimsy mud and palmthatch 
huts used by fishermen and rice farmers there is no kutcha mud 
and straw house standing mansoor said but he did not have an 
estimate of how many had been flattened 
about 30 of the countrys 64 administrative districts were 
affected by the cyclone the worst known damage was along the coast 
and in the southwest corner next to india 
many of the dead and homeless were farmers and fishermen who 
settled on hundreds of new coastal islands created by silt and 
sediment dumped into the bay of bengal by rivers originating in the 
himalayas of india and nepal most are narrow sandbars that are 
partially submerged even by normal tides 
hundreds of such islands usually less than half a mile long 
have been formed since 1985 by the 2 billion tons of silt a year 
that courses through the river deltas into the bay according to the 
governments water resources board

fifty years ago german scientists otto hahn and 
fritz strassmann discovered nuclear fission a breakthrough that led 
to the atom bomb and nuclear energy 
on thursday berlin held the first of several events marking the 
fateful work 
the discovery by hahn and strassmann also was intertwined with 
the nazi era albert speer a former top aide to adolf hitler 
strongly implied that hahn was one of a group of german scientists 
seeking ways to build an atomic bomb before the americans beat them 
to it 
hahn a physicist and chemist who won the 1944 nobel prize in 
chemistry for his discovery worked closely with a jewish colleague 
forced into exile by the nazis 
the december 1938 work at the kaiser wilhelm institute for 
chemistry in berlin also represented one of the many feats of the 
proud german scientific tradition 
on thursday scientists and officials of the technical university 
of west berlin outlined the impact of strassmanns and hahns 
discovery at an exhibition of models photographs and scientific 
equipment documenting the work 
the development of nuclear physics and its technology has found 
interest among the public like no other discovery said ulrich 
steinmueller vice president of the technical university 
the technology carries implicitly in its use both in war and 
peace a threat for mankind steinmueller said the 
wellfounded worries and fears of people give scientists a challenge 
to be aware of their responsibilities to society 
west germans have been sensitive to some of the end results of 
hahn and strassmanns discovery the stationing of nuclear rockets 
on their soil and the fallout from the chernobyl nuclear accident in 
1986 in the soviet union 
that day 50 years ago in dahlem the berlin district where the 
discovery took place must also be remembered along with the day of 
hiroshima and nagasaki and the day of chernobyl steinmueller told 
the news conference at the technical university 
steinmueller added that the peaceful use of nuclear energy 
leaves open more problems than it solves 
hahn and strassmann found that bombarding the uranium atom with 
neutrons leads to its splitting at first they were unsure of what 
they had discovered 
from her exile in sweden jewish colleague lise meitner and her 
partner otto robert frisch furnished the theoretical basis showing 
such a splitting could release huge amounts of energy through chain 
reactions 
the experiments took place in the middle of december with the 
key test starting dec 16 1938 
in the years before his discovery hahn had worked closely with 
meitner who had been forced to emigrate in 1938 as the nazis 
stepped up their attacks on the jews 
it was unusual at that time to have a man and woman working 
together when they werent married said jost lemmerich chief 
organizer of the exhibition 
when hahn won the prize no mention was made of the work by 
meitner or strassmann hahn died in 1968 in west germany 
during thursdays news conference lemmerich was asked why the 
exhibition stops in 1939 without covering the nazis scientific 
research in world war ii 
we stopped there because the history is incomplete he 
responded we didnt have access to the documents 
but he hinted another exhibition is possible to show the darker 
sides of hahns discovery 
couldnt we say in five years have another exhibition about 
hiroshima he asked rhetorically 
west berlins tagespiegel newspaper on nov 27 said hahn wrote in 
his diary of the hiroshima attack that he had a clear conscience 
that neither during the discovery nor later did i want to work for 
the use of uranium fission as a war weapon 
at the time hahn and other top german atomic scientists were 
being detained in a british camp according to the newspaper 
speer hitlers armaments minister and the third reichs top 
architect said that in 1942 he had heard of a group of scientists 
who were on the track of a weapon which could annihilate whole 
cities perhaps throw the island of england out of the fight 
he continued that two months later he visited with scientists in 
berlin to be briefed on atomic research as the nazi reich 
struggled to find a way to win world war ii 
along with scientists whose names i no longer recall the 
subsequent nobel prize winners otto hahn and werner heisenberg were 
present speer wrote in his memoirs inside the third reich 
heisenberg told speer that building such a bomb was possible but 
it would take at least two years

the leftofcenter labor party on thursday 
secured the backing of half the israeli parliament enough to 
prevent a rightwing likud government from coming to power but not 
enough to seat a government of its own 
with the 120member knesset split between the left and right 
blocs it remained unclear a full month after the elections who will 
govern for the next four years 
in the nov 1 ballotting likud had an small edge over labor 
with 40 seats to labors 39 each must woo smaller parties to form a 
majority and likuds prime minister yitzhak shamir planned to do so 
with the backing of rightwing and orthodox religious parties 
but the defection of an ultraorthodox likud ally to labors 
ranks has thrown a wrench into the works now labor leader shimon 
peres has the backing of 60 members limiting the likud bloc to 58 
the twoman torah flag party is undecided possibly holding the 
key to forming the next government in its hands if torah flag 
throws its support behind labor the bloc would have a majority for 
a government albeit a narrow one 
labor signed an agreement of mutual support with the orthodox 
agudat israel party thursday pulling five new seats into its camp 
if president chaim herzog asks shimon peres to form the 
government all the cards will change everything will be dealt 
anew said uzi baram general secretary of the labor party 
shamir initially asked by herzog to form a government has a 
monday deadline 
the deadlock could force rival labor and likud into compromising 
on another joint government such as the one that has ruled israel 
for four years the uneasy coalition was deeply divided on matters 
of war and peace and incapable of taking bold steps to revive the 
peace process 
labor on wednesday turned down an offer from shamir to join a 
coalition under his leadership but labor could go along if likud 
offered equal control of the government and a rotation in prime 
ministers as was the case during the last government 
the latest developments reflect in part the enormous influence 
of the international jewish community jewish leaders from america 
canada and europe have lobbied shamir not to go through with a 
coalition agreement with ultraorthodox parties if it involves 
controversial concessions on religious matters 
shamir had three of four orthodox parties on his side until 
recently but their support was contingent on a promise that he back 
passage of a law narrowing the definition of a jew 
the proposed who is a jew amendment to the law of return 
would deny automatic immigration to israel to jews not converted by 
orthodox rabbis the majority of jews in the united states are 
reform and conservative and they see the proposed change as a 
threat to their legitimacy 
labor did not make any clearcut concessions to agudat israel in 
the agreement signed thursday but peres said the proposal to amend 
the conversion law would be presented to the partys central 
committee 
the religious bloc controls 18 seats in the parliament with 
small leftist rightwing and arab parties controlling the others

a new survey of high school students has found 
that many teenagers are misinformed about aids and more than a few 
are at risk themselves for the deadly disease a federal agency said 
thursday 
according to the survey many high school students mistakenly 
believe aids can be transmitted by mosquito bites toilets and 
giving blood 
the national centers for disease control and local school 
officials surveyed students in ninth through 12th grades last spring 
about their knowledge of aids and their own personal risks the 
surveys were conducted in eight states as well as in seven bigcity 
school systems 
some of the findings were surprising said dr laura kann a 
researcher with the atlantabased cdc 
they clearly know the primary sources of hiv aids virus 
transmission but when it does come to things like blood donations 
mosquitoes and public toilets there are a whole lot of 
misconceptions she said 
findings did not differ greatly between locations and 
misinformation was widespread for example more than 70 percent of 
the students responding in chicago los angeles new orleans and new 
york believed wrongly that someone can be infected with aids by 
giving blood 
while some people have been infected through receiving blood 
tranfusions particularly before the advent of testing blood for 
exposure to the aids virus contracting aids while routinely giving 
blood is impossible since other peoples blood does not come in 
contact with a blood donor 
in another example more than half the students responding in los 
angeles and new orleans believed wrongly that aids can be 
contracted by using a public toilet and more than 70 percent of 
those responding in los angeles mistakenly believed that aids is 
transmitted through insect bites 
health officials say toilets and insects are not vehicles of aids 
transmission 
on the other hand at least 84 percent of all the students 
responding knew that sharing drug needles can spread aids and at 
least 88 percent knew they could get aids through sexual intercourse 
students in san francisco washington dc and the states of 
michigan and california were asked about their personal experiences 
with injectable drugs and sexual intercourse 
drug use was relatively low ranging from 3 percent of the 
michigan students to 6 percent of those in washington 
sexual intercourse was much more common with the percentage of 
students who had ever had sex ranging from 29 percent in san 
francisco to 76 percent in washington for male washington students 
91 percent reported theyd had sex 
the cdc urged education officials to implement programs to 
correct misperceptions about hiv transmission to reduce behaviors 
resulting in hiv infection 
the student surveys were not an attempt at a national poll but 
were spot surveys in selected cities and states with high incidence 
of aids 
the surveys were conducted in chicago los angeles new orleans 
new york city san francisco seattle washington dc and the 
states of california kentucky michigan new jersey new york 
ohio pennsylvania and washington 
the cdc cautioned that response rates differed between locations 
so direct comparison of the findings from site to site or attempts 
to add them into a general total could be misleading 
but in general the cdc noted aidsrelated beliefs knowledge 
and behaviors among the adolescents surveyed are generally 
similar

four sailors have pleaded guilty to hiding an 
irish stowaway aboard a destroyer in a transatlantic voyage that 
prompted the navy to tighten security aboard ships 
an investigation showed suzanne twomey of cork ireland could 
not have hidden aboard the uss conyngham during a 10day trip to 
virginia without inside help said lt cmdr john lloyd a spokesman 
for the atlantic fleet surface force 
the only thing that resulted from the incident was heightened 
security awareness for ships that are taking visitors aboard 
overseas he said 
crewmen have been told to keep an eye on visitors to make sure 
they leave lloyd said 
ms twomey 17 was discovered in a small storage compartment a 
day before the ship reached port she was flown back to ireland 
after the ship docked 
seaman apprentice david g peters who authorities said invited 
ms twomey aboard ship and falsified a log to show she had left 
pleaded guilty at a courtmartial monday to hiding an illegal alien 
and aiding her entry into the united states lloyd said 
peters was sentenced to the 70 days he had served in the brig he 
also received a badconduct discharge which was suspended 
contingent on his good behavior for 12 months 
seaman apprentice paul d davidson was sentenced on similar 
charges to 30 days in the brig and ordered to forfeit twothirds of 
his pay for a month he served four days before trial and has 
returned to the brig to serve his remaining time lloyd said 
charges against gunners mate 3rd class donald l nichols and 
seaman anthony m drady were reduced to offenses that were heard 
before a captains mast a form of nonjudicial punishment the 
federal privacy act bars disclosure of the punishment lloyd said 
four other sailors implicated in the incident were given 
undisclosed punishment at a captains mast last summer 
all of the men remain assigned to the ship lloyd said

pope john paul ii on thursday met with a us 
archbishop who had been punished by the vatican for permitting 
homosexual gatherings and for other liberal practices objectionable 
to the holy see 
seattle archbishop raymond hunthausen came to rome to fulfill the 
requirement that bishops consult with the pope every five years and 
report on their dioceses 
the vaticans official bulletin listed the meeting without 
comment hunthausen could be not be reached for comment about his 
meeting with the pope 
in 1985 the vatican removed hunthausens authority in several 
major areas after accusing him of being loose in granting marriage 
annulments and general absolution for sins as well as of allowing 
homosexuals to gather in church facilities 
his authority was restored in 1987 and a coadjutor archbishop 
thomas murphy was named while the disciplinary action was in 
force an auxiliary bishop donald wuerl was assigned to wield the 
authority in those areas 
while under discipline hunthausen denounced the splitauthority 
arrangement as unworkable and humiliating us bishops often at 
odds with the vatican on such issues as sexuality expressed dismay 
over the case 
after hunthausens authority was restored a threemember 
commission was appointed to work out remaining problems in the 
archdiocese

the commerce department on thursday said the 
index of leading indicators the governments main gauge of future 
economic activity edged up a slight 01 percent in october after 
falling the previous month signaling some sluggishness in growth by 
the end of next year 
but analysts said the moderation which would be welcomed by 
financial markets worried about inflation isnt evident yet and 
they cautioned against drawing any firm conclusions until the index 
establishes a consistent pattern 
the index now has declined in five of the past 12 months it 
dropped a revised 03 percent in september a bit more sharply than 
the previous estimate of minus 01 percent it also fell in july and 
may but rose in june and august 
michael penzer senior economist with bank of america in san 
francisco said the index since early 1987 has been underestimating 
future growth nevertheless he said the economy probably will slow 
by next spring 
growth as measured by the gross national product averaged a 3 
percent annual rate through the first nine months of this year even 
though the federal reserve board from late march to early august 
pushed up interest rates hoping to curb gnp expansion to a 
noninflationary 2 percent to 25 percent 
the fed has been tightening in order to slow the rate of growth 
down penzer said many times in the past they have overshot and 
pushed the country into a recession but this time theyll probably 
luck out 
that would put the economy well into the middle of its seventh 
year of expansion a peacetime record 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the latest 
economic figures continue to suggest slower but continued economic 
growth in the months ahead it looks very good 
however at least for october the latest month available 
economic statistics portray stronger growth than desired by the fed 
unemployment is at a 14year low use of factory capacity is at an 
8year high and personal income posted the biggest gain in a year 
in a separate report on thursday the commerce department said 
construction activity climbed 09 percent in october to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 4092 billion the fourth consecutive 
monthly increase 
economists and the markets are now awaiting the release friday of 
the labor departments employment survey for an indication about 
whether octobers vigor continued into november 
in october four of nine available leading indicators were 
pointing to faster growth while five were pointing to slower growth 
the factors pushing the index up in order of magnitude were an 
increase in building permits a rise in stock prices a jump in new 
orders to manufacturers for consumer goods and a drop in initial 
claims for state unemployment insurance 
the negative factors ordered from largest to smallest were 
faster deliveries to companies a sign of slackening demand a drop 
in the price of industrial materials a decline in the 
inflationadjusted money supply a shortening in the length of the 
average workweek and a fall in orders for business equipment 
the various changes left the index at 1930 percent of its 1967 
base of 100 up only 05 percent from october 1987 compared with a 
6 percent gain during the previous 12month period 
maury n harris chief economist of painewebber inc said the 
two strongest positive factors building permits and stock prices 
likely will turn negative when the government calculates the 
november index 
theres nothing there that signals recession but theres a lot 
that signals slower growth he said 
economists caution against drawing immediate conclusions from the 
index even though since its creation in 1948 it has correctly 
predicted all eight recessions by dropping three times in a row it 
also has falsely predicted a recession four times 
preliminary estimates of the index often are revised 
substantially in later months for instance declines were reported 
initially for five consecutive months from september 1987 through 
january but later revisions wiped out all but two of the drops 
in an attempt to improve the accuracy of the index the 
department said thursday it was dropping two of the indicators 
changes in business and consumer credit and changes in 
manufacturing and trade inventories 
effective with the report for january it will add a survey of 
consumer expectations and changes in unfilled orders to durable 
goods manufacturers

president reagan today ruled out a pretrial 
pardon for irancontra defendant oliver l north saying such a 
pardon would leave his former white house aide under a shadow of 
guilt 
at the same time reagan said his decision to suppress certain 
evidence in the case was vital to protect national security 
secrets 
the white house said earlier today that documents sought by north 
contain intelligence secrets that cannot be divulged it said it is 
up to the judge to decide whether to dismiss the charges against 
the marine lieutenant colonel if the classified material is relevant 
to his defense 
during a picturetaking session in the oval office with 
presidentelect george bush and special trade representative clayton 
yeutter at his side reagan was asked to say why he was blocking the 
use of certain evidence in norths trial 
the things were blocking are things that duty requires we 
block reagan replied these are things that are national 
security secrets 
asked whether this amounted to an attempt to in effect sabotage 
norths trial he said no this is something that from the very 
beginning we knew we would have to do 
asked if he would be upset if the white house move had the effect 
of preventing norths prosecution reagan said the law must take 
its course 
reagan who told reporters last may that he thought both north 
and rear adm john m poindexter eventually would be found innocent 
was asked if he still believes that 
well at this stage i dont think i should comment on guilt or 
innocence or anything of this kind he said i think the law has 
got to take its course 
reagan then was asked whether he was considering a pardon for 
north 
from the very beginning i have said that to consider a pardon 
even if i did that would leave them under a shadow of guilt 
for the rest of their lives he said i think we have to let the 
judicial process proceed 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the heads of us 
intelligence agencies acting under authority of a law giving them 
power to restrict classified material notified independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh in july that the material could not be disclosed 
he said secretary of state george p shultz secretary of defense 
frank c carlucci cia director william webster national security 
adviser colin l powell and the head of the national security 
agency lt gen william odom made the unanimous determination 
fitzwater said walsh did not object to the determination and 
apparently believes his case can go forward with declassified 
information that has been provided him he said walsh had been 
briefed on the information and had access to it in classified form 
however he said these secrets which cannot be disclosed have 
been identified as material to the defense and it is up to the 
judge to determine whether it is relevant 
if it is it is up to him to decide what happens to the various 
counts of the indictment 
fitzwater said the white house acting through the independent 
counsel has offered to brief us district judge gerhard gesell 
but has not received a response 
he said the information involves secrets of the highest order 
involving intelligence activities and programs 
we are talking about much more than the identities of 
countries the identities of foreign leaders although that 
information is also classified in many cases he said 
fitzwater said that a week and a half ago when gesell made 
statements from the bench cautioning the white house that he would 
have little control over the flow of information once the trial 
began possibly in late january white house officials concluded 
that the judge was not aware of the actions they had taken in july 
he said white house counsel ab culvahouse wrote a letter to 
walsh during the last week and walsh filed a pleading with the court 
outlining the administrations position 
while gesell has the power to say whether or not the trial may 
proceed on each of the counts against north and the other 
defendants the decision of what material may be used as evidence is 
up to the white house 
the white house position was made known as closed hearings began 
on some of the classified documents in the case 
gesell conducted the hearing to consider the former presidential 
aides objections to deleting sensitive references from 350 
classified documents that walsh wants to use as evidence 
north objects to virtually all of the proposed deletions arguing 
the references to countries foreign officials and us intelligence 
agents are necessary to defend charges that he conspired to divert 
more than 14 million in usiran armssale profits to the contra 
rebels in nicaragua 
walsh who attended wednesdays hearing with several associate 
prosecutors contends that the former national security council aide 
is trying to force authorities to scuttle the case rather than 
disclose some of the nations bestkept intelligence secrets 
walsh earlier had received permission from the reagan 
administration to use the 350 documents that contain 1000 to 2000 
pages of classified material provided the sensitive references are 
deleted 
north also wants permission to disclose 40000 pages of 
classified material during the trial 
even if reagan refuses to allow disclosure of secrets gesell 
determines are needed by the defense north could still be 
prosecuted on charges he made false statemnts to congress and 
conspired to illegally use a taxexempt foundation to raise money 
for the contras 
those charges are less dependent on classified evidence which 
north wants to use to show he was acting with presidential authority 
when he covertly helped the contras raise money and diverted 
proceeds from the armsforhostage deals in the middle east to the 
rebels 
decisions on classified documents would have a direct impact 
however on walshs ability to prosecute norths codefendants 
former national security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers 
albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard v secord 
they are to be tried separately after north

the wrong man spent 11 years in prison for the 
murder of a police officer his former accuser said as he recanted 
his testimony in a dramatic reallife epilogue to the documentary 
movie the thin blue line 
i feel like its my responsibility to step forward to be a 
man and admit my part in it said david ray harris who at age 
16 testified in 1977 that randall dale adams killed dallas police 
officer robert wood 
harris now a death row inmate in an unrelated killing was the 
first witness to testify wednesday in a state district court hearing 
in which adams is seeking a new trial 
adams was convicted of the nov 28 1976 shooting death of wood 
and sentenced to death the sentence was later commuted to life in 
prison he has maintained his innocence and the thin blue line 
a public broadcasting service production released to selected 
theaters this summer questioned his conviction 
in testimony today a woman who told the trial judge that it was 
adams she saw at the scene of the killing said she didnt understand 
the judges question emily blocker was questioned by adams lawyer 
about the discrepancy between her testimony and her statement in the 
movie when she said she failed to pick adams out of a lineup 
did you lie to the judge asked defense attorney randy 
schaffer 
ms blocker replied i guess i didnt understand the judges 
question 
but she also testified that filmmaker errol morris coached her in 
the movie 
this man came into my house and told me he was going to make a 
movie about a police shooting in dallas i said i dont exactly 
remember how everything went down he said what the heck its 
just a movie anything you dont remember ill remember for you 
ms blocker said 
morris who was in the courtroom told reporters that ms blocker 
was not coached and that she has no credibility whatsoever 
in his testimony wednesday harris said that he was alone in the 
car when the officer was killed contradicting his original story 
that he and adams were in a car stopped by wood and officer teresa 
turko 
although he stopped short of saying he committed the murder 
harris said his finger was on the trigger of the 22caliber gun 
that killed wood 
judge larry baraka said based on the testimony he would 
determine that harris had admitted to committing the crime 
as far as the court is concerned he is telling me that he 
did baraka said 
baraka could make a recommendation to the texas court of criminal 
appeals for a new trial after the hearing which was expected to 
last several days 
schaffer quickly got to the heart of the case however asking 
harris did randall adams kill robert wood 
harris replied no he did not randall adams knew nothing 
about this offense and was not in the car at the time 
dressed in an orange jail suit and wearing handcuffs and 
shackles harris also denied assertions that he recanted to avoid a 
reputation among other inmates as a snitch 
someone might come up and stab me in the back tomorrow so be 
it harris said 
dallas county prosecutor leslie mcfarlane asked harris why he 
started making stronger statements to reporters in the past two or 
three months about adams innocence compared to what he said in a 
similar hearing for adams in federal court in 1986 
i felt like i needed to do something to push things forward 
because evidently what i told them wasnt enough harris said 
harris testified he was biased in favor of the prosecution when 
he implicated adams at the trial he said thenprosecutor doug 
mulder had promised to take care of other criminal charges 
pending against him in return for his testimony 
after he testified against adams harris said he was not 
prosecuted in those pending cases and did not have to continue 
reporting to his probation officer 
in initial reports turko the policewoman whose partner was 
slain did not give a description of the gunman but testified 
wednesday that she later described him as having bushy hair she 
acknowledged that she did not know where that description came from 
and she may have gotten it from mulder 
schaffer asked if others in the police department were pushing to 
solve woods murder 
i wanted to see the man accused of killing my partner 
convicted turko said 
among spectators in the packed courtroom wednesday was woods 
younger sister patricia willis who said she wants to see the 
matter put to rest ms willis said she believes harris has recanted 
for attention and to bide time for himself 
morris said im concerned because i want randall adams to get 
out of jail i care deeply about him and his family

the government on thursday sued 
westinghouse electric corp to cancel a contract for a nuclear plant 
it says is unsafe and built after bribes were paid to an associate 
of expresident ferdinand marcos 
officials of the us company said the philippine government is 
antinuclear and filed the suit for political reasons 
justice secretary sedfrey ordonez announced the 75page suit was 
filed in the us district court in newark nj against 
westinghouse its subsidiary westinghouse international projects 
inc and the contractors burns and roe enterprises inc 
westinghouse said thursday that it petitioned the international 
chamber of commerce in paris to arbitrate the dispute as provided by 
the 1976 contract 
the 23 billion power plant on the bataan peninsula about 60 
miles west of the capital across manila bay was completed three 
years ago in the final months of marcos 20year rule 
closing the bataan plant was one of president corazon aquinos 
campaign pledges during the 1986 presidential election against 
marcos she charged the plant was unsafe and built on an earthquake 
fault 
mrs aquino who ousted marcos in a civilianbacked military 
uprising in february 1986 ordered the 620megawatt plant closed 
before it went into operation 
in a statement released thursday mrs aquino said the government 
decided to file suit because the contractors were not willing to 
agree to a fair commercial settlement 
ordonez said mrs aquino has not decided whether to suspend 
interest payments on construction loans pending completion of 
litigation the loans cost the debtstrapped government about 
355000 a day 
a copy of the suit received by the associated press stated 
westinghouse paid some 173 million in kickbacks or commissions 
to two companies owned by herminio disini who is married to a 
cousin of marcos wife imelda 
it also alleged that subcontracts for the building of the plant 
went to companies owned by disini officials say they suspect some 
of the money went to marcos 
the suit is aimed at voiding the contract and forcing the giant 
american company to return at least part of the money the 
philippines paid for the plant 
the principal objective is to declare that there was bribery in 
contracting this project ordonez said of the lawsuit it is not 
a politically motivated move it is one that is calculated to obtain 
release for the philippines which has been victimized by an illegal 
transaction 
the pittsburgbased westinghouse has denied impropriety in 
payments to disini saying the compensation complied with philippine 
regulations 
nathaniel d woodson general manager of the westinghouse nuclear 
fuels unit and louis j briskman westinghouse deputy general 
counsel said philippine officials have acknowledged during private 
talks that no matter how safe the plant is they dont intend to 
allow nuclear power production in the country 
it has nothing to do with safety woodson said what were 
finding here are the results of a political policy that came to life 
when they were running for office woodson said they now feel 
they have a political albatross around their neck and theyre trying 
to blame us 
westinghouse will not be a scapegoat he added 
sen rene saguisag who was involved in efforts to seek an 
outofcourt settlement said marcos was not named in the suit to 
avoid complicating cases pending in the philippines and the united 
states against the former president 
marcos and his wife who live in hawaii were indicted by a 
federal grand jury in october on racketeering charges marcos has 
been named in 35 civil suits in the philippines

the results of the november television rating 
sweeps period indicates that among the three networks cbs took the 
worst hit from the summer writers strike 
the strike really hurt cbs said david poltrack cbs vice 
president for marketing we didnt have any big events to fill 
in such as abcs 18hour miniseries war and remembrance 
he said cbs also had fewer established halfhour sitcoms than the 
competition those shows got back into production quicker than hour 
dramas 
abc was the only one of the three networks to show a rise in 
ratings this november compared to last november when it came in 
third in the sweeps its roseanne was the highestrated new 
series in november 
cbs and abc tied for second in terms of regular series 
programming according to cbs analysis of the ac nielsen co 
numbers but abc had a threepoint lead on cbs when it came to 
miniseries and movies 
nbc with five of the top 10 series and the five toprated 
movies handily won the sweeps one of four months a year when 
network affiliates ratings are measured for purposes of negotiating 
local advertising rates 
nbc had an average primetime rating of 154 abc had an average 
rating of 140 and cbs 120 each rating point represents 904000 
households with televisions 
the cosby show was the highestrated network show with a 
rating of 263 down from the 323 the show got in november 1987 in 
fact all the toprated series suffered ratings declines 
because of strikecaused production delays on its regular series 
abc rushed to the air with the first part of its more than 30hour 
war and remembrance a sequel to the winds of war except 
for two twopart movies war and remembrance was the only 
miniseries of the november sweeps it ended with a disappointing 
186 rating and 29 share but was good enough to save abc from third 
place in the sweeps abc will run the remainder of the miniseries 
next may said spokeswoman janice gretemeyer 
sweeps programming brought more viewers to their sets more 
households used television but 3 percent fewer sets were tuned to 
networks that was an improvement though on the seasontodate 6 
percent decline in network viewing and some of the november decline 
was attributable to low network viewing on election night 
one of the most significant numbers was the increase in viewing 
of independent stations which have become more aggressive during 
sweeps periods 
fox broadcasting co whose affiliates are counted as independent 
stations experienced a dramatic rise in ratings an average 55 
compared to 37 a year ago part of that increase was because fox 
was running new episodes of its most popular programs americas 
most wanted and married with children during the summer 
when the networks were in repeats those shows apparently developed 
a following that stuck with them in the fall when the networks were 
struggling to get delayed shows on the air 
but independent stations also did well by taking over what was 
previously a network source of programming theatrical release 
movies the networks have all but abandoned theatrical movies as a 
source of ratings poltrack said meanwhile independent stations 
are able to garner competitive ratings by running such films as 48 
hours and the godfather 
pay cable also experienced an increase in viewership during the 
sweeps hbo was up to an average rating of 83 compared to 69 a 
year ago that was the first increase for hbo in the five years 
since the networks began analyzing pay cable performance during 
sweeps 
poltrack predicted that january will be critical for the 
networks because it will be their first chance in the 
strikedelayed season to recoup regular series viewers 
we look to the future not to the past he said

the defense department severed the electronic 
links between two of its computer networks early this week after an 
unknown hacker illegally gained entry to a contractors 
computer the pentagon said thursday 
neither of the computer networks involved handled classified data 
or information but the links between the two were temporarily 
severed in order to provide a barrier to protect users the 
department said in a statement 
the connections between the arpanet network which links academic 
and corporate computer centers and which was attacked by a virus 
last month and the socalled milnet system which links thousands 
of military computers were severed monday 
the pentagon said the connection was broken after an 
unidentified hacker penetrated a vax computer belonging to a defense 
contractor on the night of nov 2728 1988 
the hacker used a weakness in the end users computer software 
the fix for this problem has been developed by the vendor and is 
available electronically to users of the software the pentagon 
said 
amateur computer users who try to make unauthorized entry into 
computer systems or networks are known as hackers 
the pentagon did not identify the contractor but a spokeswoman 
for the mitre corp in bedford mass marcia cohen said one of the 
companys computers had been entered 
the connections between arpanet and milnet were expected to be 
restored thursday the two networks are connected at seven 
electronic gateways around the country 
the contractors programmers have taken corrective measures to 
prevent any recurrence the pentagon added 
arpanet is the same unclassified computer network that was 
crippled last month when someone slipped a virus into the system 
an incident that is being investigated by a federal grand jury in 
syracuse 
the virus a selfcopying program which can cripple computer 
operations by soaking up capacity or destroying data jammed an 
estimated 6000 computers nationwide the virus attack caused at 
least 97 million in damage because of interrupted work and the need 
to cleanse the computers according to the computer virus industry 
association 
authorities believe the virus program was created by cornell 
university graduate student robert morris jr 23 of arnold md 
fbi agents in massachusetts last week subpoenaed three people at 
harvard university where morris was a computer science 
undergraduate until june two harvard computer experts graduate 
student paul graham and computer programmer andrew h suddeth 
appeared before the grand jury wednesday 
suddeth has said morris called him in a panic for help in getting 
out a message to other computer operators after morris realized what 
the virus was doing 
the third person subpoenaed mark friedell an associate 
professor of computer science was excused from testifying he said 
he told prosecutors he knew nothing of the allegations of morris 
involvement with the virus 
morris has not been subpoenaed to appear before the panel his 
lawyer thomas guidoboni of washington told the syracuse 
heraldjournal 
guidoboni so far has advised morris not to talk with anyone about 
the virus including fbi agents but the lawyer said an agreement 
may soon be reached in which an interview with agents would be 
arranged

nevada officials have listed former las 
vegas casino executive frank lefty rosenthal in the states 
black book of people barred from casinos 
rosenthal said he wasnt surprised by the unanimous nevada gaming 
commission decision but said he will fight it 
commission chairman john oreilly ended an eighthour hearing 
wednesday by saying his main concern was rosenthals notorious and 
unsavory reputation over the years 
during the hearing rosenthal 59 said politics rather than his 
reputation created problems for him in nevada during the 1970s i 
know people in the gaming industry today who make me look like a 
choir boy frankly he said 
rosenthal said another reason for his trouble with authorities 
over the years was his reputation as an expert bookmaker something 
that was viewed as less than desirable 
rosenthal was an executive for argent corp which ran four las 
vegas casinos in the 1970s before he left las vegas after an 
attempt on his life in october 1982 he since has lived in 
california and florida 
the state gaming commission ruled in 1976 that he was unsuitable 
to work as a key employee with argent because of alleged organized 
crime ties rosenthal challenged the ruling all the way to the us 
supreme court but the high court let the nevada decision stand 
the fbi has linked rosenthal to organized crime figures but he 
never was charged with any crime 
rosenthal a onetime chicago hot dog stand owner has denied 
having ties to organized crime

despite an apparent end to the jamming of most 
western radio broadcasts the soviet union still is not entitled to 
have a human rights conference in moscow the state department said 
thursday 
we will be looking for further soviet movement on other 
issues department spokesowman phyllis oakley said 
the jamming of americanfinanced radio liberty and two other 
foreign radio stations ceased wednesday this is a positive 
development which if it becomes permament will further contribute 
to the improvement in eastwest relations the state department 
official said 
but she said czechoslovakia and bulgaria were continuing to jam 
radio free europe which broadcasts to eastern europe we urge 
those two nations to end this practice which conflicts with their 
international obligations mrs oakley said 
the soviets long have been eager to hold an international human 
rights conference in moscow one of the us conditions was an end 
to jamming russianlanguage broadcasts 
mrs oakley said the end to jamming enhances the prospects for 
a moscow meeting but the soviets must make other improvements in 
human rights and also provide credible guarantees that the 
meeting would be open to all soviet citizens the us official said 
the reagan administration also is demanding that curbs on 
emigration be eased further 
on a related subject mrs oakley said the state department was 
concerned with developments in the troubled caucasus region where 
the soviets on wednesday reported 11 new deaths and there was a 
rising flood of refugees from ethnic violence 
we deeply regret the loss of life there she said we hope 
and expect that soviet authorities will continue making every effort 
to protect the lives and welfare of people in the region while 
seeking a just and peaceful resolution

construction spending rose 09 percent in 
october the fourth consecutive monthly increase with half of the 
gain coming in singlefamily homes the government said thursday 
the commerce department said building activity rose 37 billion 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4092 billion strength was 
widespread in most categories but 19 billion of the gain came in 
singlefamily homes which jumped 16 percent to 1185 billion 
construction spending which rose 07 percent in september and 
02 percent in august recently has bucked what has been a generally 
lackluster building trend over the past year 
even with the latest string of increases building activity 
advanced only 21 percent in the past 12 months taking a 17 
percent rise in construction costs into account activity advanced a 
mere 04 percent over the period 
for october residential construction was up 10 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1989 billion the gain in 
singlefamily home building more than made up for a 14 percent 
decrease in construction of multifamily units which has been 
sluggish since federal tax laws were changed effective at the start 
of last year 
a large portion of the singlefamily activity is in california 
and florida said john savacool an economist with the wefa group 
a bala cynwyd pa forecasting firm its easy to see why when 
you look where people are moving to californias population is 
growing at an annual rate of 400000 and 300000 people a year are 
moving to florida 
michael moran chief economist of daiwa securities america inc 
said he expects housing activity to taper off because interest rates 
are rising and because much of the pentup demand from the early 
1980s when interest rates soared has been filled 
nonresidential construction rose 04 percent in october 
climbing to an annual rate of 913 billion while construction of 
shopping centers and other commercial projects was off by 80 
percent construction of industrial projects jumped 79 percent 
hotels and motels 69 percent and office buildings 30 percent 
construction of factories despite a booming manufacturing 
sector has held relatively steady over the past year manufacturers 
have preferred to invest in updated equipment moran said 
there is some reluctance to build new factories because of 
skepticism about how long the boom will last he said 
government construction climbed 24 percent to an annual rate of 
809 billion reflecting increased spending for schools sewers and 
roads highway construction the largest government category was up 
79 percent in october to 259 billion 
were looking at a public highway system put together 25 to 30 
years ago spending is going to have to stay strong because the darn 
things are falling apart savacool said

president mikhail s gorbachev won nearly unanimous 
approval thursday of a more dynamic political structure from a 
parliament that voted its traditionally docile form out of existence 
in a speech to the 1500member supreme soviet gorbachev also 
accepted blame for the lack of explanations that led to a remarkable 
public debate over the reform he considers crucial to his 
restructuring effort 
despite criticism from some of the 15 soviet republics that the 
reforms make moscow too powerful only five deputies voted against 
it still the negative votes were a rarity in the parliament that 
for years has unanimously approved kremlin directives the first 
no votes came just more than a month ago 
gorbachev told deputies that except for an emergency this 
lineup of the ussr supreme soviet is having its final session 
elections will be held march 26 for a new 2250member congress 
of peoples deputies that will choose from among its members a 
smaller more active supreme soviet 
we are creating a new very authoritative representative body 
of power that will reflect all national territorial and social 
interests of society gorbachev said 
the reform also creates a strong presidency in place of the 
largely ceremonial post gorbachev assumed oct 1 
earlier in the week he said that without the political reform 
the drive for perestroika inevitably will begin to skid 
he said in a speech thursday concluding an extraordinary 
threeday session on his proposals to restructure the government 
that the revised constitution was temporary and further changes 
would respond to demands for expanded power for republic and local 
governments 
but he emphasized the rest of his reforms will be considered by 
the new lawmakers 
gorbachev also told the deputies that a storm of controversy over 
the reform package including 250000 letters to the kremlin 
could have been reduced and he took the blame 
we did not care about explaining the essence the meaning of 
the changes gorbachev said the center was just following the old 
practice thinking well they would get used to it 
that is why i reiterate all of us are now learning our lessons 
all of us are in a school of democracy and we should be good pupils 
in that school gorbachev said 
newspapers first published the draft language of the complex 
revisions in 117 articles of the constitution and election law only 
five weeks ago the changes were not explained at the time nor was 
it clear who wrote them 
many elements were not understood right away gorbachev 
acknowledged 
the vote on the constitutional changes was 657 in favor 3 
against and 26 abstentions in the soviet of nationalities and 687 
in favor 2 against and 1 abstention in the soviet of unions 
a companion package providing for multiplecandidate elections 
was adopted unanimously by both houses 
at least three of the negative votes on the constitutional 
package came from estonians who complain that it shifts power from 
the republics to moscow 
the baltic republic had been an object of controversy during the 
threeday supreme soviet session following its declaration of 
sovereignty in internal affairs two weeks ago that action was 
rejected by the kremlin as unconstitutional 
it also establishes the congress of peoples deputies with 
twothirds of the representatives elected by the public and 
onethird by organizations including the communist party and trade 
unions 
that provision provoked complaints that citizens who are members 
of certain organizations will be able to vote more than once and 
perhaps hold more than one seat in the congress 
the congress will elect the president and the supreme soviet 
which changes from a parttime body summoned twice a year to ratify 
the actions of its presidium into a working legislature meeting 
eight months a year it will write laws and may veto the decisions 
of its presidium and the president 
a lone attempt at a revision on the floor thursday was rejected 
by a vote of 1353 to 23 that was an amendment offered by a latvian 
delegate jemma sculme which effectively would have given the 
republics veto power in the parliament 
the leadership altered the reform package overnight wednesday to 
incorporate some suggestions from lawmakers but alternate politburo 
member georgy razumovsky offered only sketchy information on the 
changes before the vote was called it was not clear if lawmakers 
had copies of the final set of constitutional amendments before they 
adopted them

groups pushing for greater efforts against aids 
urged presidentelect george bush on thursday to help lead the fight 
and to champion federal antidiscrimination laws to protect victims 
of the deadly disease 
the national organization responding to aids a coalition of 
groups criticized president reagan who accepted only some of the 
recommendations of his presidential commission on aids refusing in 
particular to embrace its call for antidiscrimination legislation 
the silence from the white house and from the executive branch 
has been overwhelming and i think all of us are looking to a 
dramatic change in that regard jeffrey levi head of the national 
gay and lesbian task force told a news conference held on world 
aids day his group is part of the coalition 
during the presidential campaign bush expressed his support for 
legislation that would make it a crime to discriminate against 
aids patients and those infected with the virus he also said aids 
test results must be kept appropriately confidential 
the coalition issued recommendations for his incoming 
administration including a call for greater funding of aids 
research and for reforms in the health care financing system as 
well as antidiscrimination legislation and stronger leadership 
the discussion about aids must be coming out of the mouth 
of the president and out of the voice of the executive office 
said jean mcguire chairman of the coalition 
members of the coalition met with the presidentelects 
transition team on wednesday to discuss their report a call for 
executive action and spoke briefly with bush who was visiting 
his transition offices 
bush expressed his support for the coalitions efforts ms 
mcguire said 
according to the coalition the health and human services 
department had proposed 19 billion for aids research for fiscal 
1990 but the reagan administration has cut the request to 16 
billion 
officials at hhs referred questions about their budget request to 
the office of management and budget where spokeswoman barbara clay 
said the agency could not confirm any budget figures in the midst of 
appeals 
the coalition called on the bush administration to amend the 
budget levi said 
they the transition team made clear that this was not their 
budget but they also did not make any commitments as to whether or 
not they would be putting forward an amendment or making any 
changes levi said 
the coalition also urged the presidentelect to support passage 
of the americans with disabilities act a bill that would extend 
specific civil rights protections to all people with disabilities 
including those with aids and those infected with hiv the virus 
believed to cause aids 
the coalition is comprised of more than 90 groups including the 
american medical association the national aids network the 
american bar association the national association of counties and 
the presbyterian church usa 
it was formed in 1987 to develop comprehensive humane and 
effective federal aids policy 
as of nov 28 aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome had 
been diagnosed in 79389 americans of whom more than half or 
44590 had died since june 1 1981 according to the centers for

radio liberty officials on thursday 
rejoiced over an end to 35 years of kremlinordered broadcast 
jamming as they examined how to take advantage of the newly cleared 
air waves to the soviet union 
this is a great challenge for us said s enders wimbush 
director of the usowned network based in munich its caused 
tremendous excitement around here because they radio employees 
see an opportunity theyve long waited for 
robert redlich spokesman for radio liberty and its sister 
station radio free europe which beams its signal to eastern 
european countries said news that the jamming stopped was broadcast 
to listeners in the soviet union 
this was very much in our news we gave it good play redlich 
told the associated press in a telephone interview from his munich 
office 
the end of soviet jamming against radio liberty appears to be 
part of the glasnost or openness policy of president mikhail 
s gorbachev the soviets ceased jamming of the usoperated voice 
of america service more than a year ago and some east european 
countries dropped efforts to block radio free europe broadcasts 
czechoslovakia and bulgaria continue to interrupt rfe service 
in washington the state department welcomed the end to jamming 
of radio liberty 
this is a positive development which if it becomes permanent 
will further contribute to the improvement in eastwest relations 
said phyllis oakley deputy spokeswoman 
she urged czechoslovakia and bulgaria to end their jamming 
the helsinki commission a us government panel set up in 1976 
to monitor soviet human rights lauded the end to the jamming of 
german and israeli radio as well as radio liberty whose signal was 
distorted since it went on the air in 1953 
this demonstrates a new seriousness on the part of the soviet 
regime in addressing its citizens right to the freedom of 
information said the group formally known as the commission on 
security and cooperation in europe 
western broadcasts have kept soviets and east europeans informed 
on such important historical events as the failed 1956 hungarian 
revolt the 1968 soviet invasion of czechoslovakia and the 1986 
chernobyl disaster 
wimbush said a listener from the soviet union called the radio 
liberty offices in munich on thursday and expressed astonishment the 
programming was coming through without the usual interference 
he had just turned the radio on and could hear us he said 
wimbush plans to add more human interest stories to the broadcast 
were going to be reaching out for a younger audience and 
report on topical matters that would interest young people such as 
aids drug problems relations between men and women the kind of 
fare that you would likely find on western radio he said 
radio liberty plans to set up a callin system to talk with its 
soviet listeners and incorporate more music in its broadcasts 
the polish government this summer said that with new press 
freedom in parts of the east bloc radio free europe and radio 
liberty had no real purpose anymore 
but network officials flatly reject those kinds of suggestions 
and contend their efforts helped pave the way for glasnost 
the soviet media have made great strides wimbush said but 
they arent always saying everything and there are a lot of issues 
they dont treat at all 
wimbush also said that only a small minority of urban soviets see 
publications like moscow news and ogonyok which have carried some 
of the most surprising and controversial articles in the age of 
glasnost 
there is an enormous black hole in the countryside wimbush 
said noting that radio liberty can now reach rural residents 
the soviet union began using radio waves to try to block radio 
libertys signals the same day the station opened for business in 
march 1953 said redlich 
despite efforts by officials to jam the broadcasts some soviet 
citizens were able to pick up the service on short wave radios 
jamming used to be concentrated on major cities where most soviet 
intellectuals and dissents live 
the soviets this week stopped jamming russianlanguage broadcasts 
by deutsche welle a west german broadcasting network 
kohls spokesman friedhelm ost commented thursday that the bonn 
leadership hopes the soviet end to jamming expresses a beginning 
of unhindered communication between east and west

a 32yearold man who had drug and 
weapons charges against him dropped when a prosecutor heard he had 
drowned is not dead and charges against him will be reinstated 
officials said 
the 9th circuit solicitors office had received word that william 
wilson iii drowned in september in a james island creek 
assistant solicitor mark c moore said charges of possession of 
marijuana for distribution and possession of a firearm by a 
convicted felon were dismissed nov 3 because of the belief that 
wilson had died 
the confusion arose when a 31yearold william wilson of james 
island drowned while shrimping in september 
solicitor charles condon said the mistake occurred because an 
employee in his office said she knew the man and that his name was 
listed on court dockets 
moore said he asked the employee to confirm that by checking 
court files but the description of both wilsons was similar in year 
of birth race and size and both men had been charged with weapons 
offenses 
moore said the staff believed that william wilson iii was the man 
who drowned and the charges were dismissed 
they learned their mistake when wilson was stopped by police nov 
25 and they found three bags of marijuana in his car 
i never had anything like this happen condon said im 
grateful it was caught 
condon said he will begin asking defense lawyers to supply death 
certificates when their clients die before coming to trial moore 
said he will attempt to indict wilson on the april charges

syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring there is no known cure 
officially 142 countries have reported 129385 cases of aids to

percent chance of developing aids within 10 years

another country to stand trial for alleged war crimes

by the us circuit court in boston last july and a second

blacks announced a consumer 
boycott and a sitin thursday to protest reimposed apartheid 
measures in the industrial town of boksburg while major businesses 
and sports bodies threatened sanctions 
boksburg east of johannesburg was the first to resegregate 
parks and other amenities since the conservative party won control 
of dozens of municipalities in elections oct 26 several other 
towns now want to bar blacks from facilities opened to all races in 
recent years 
blacks who outnumber boksburg whites by nearly 21 plan a 
sitin friday at boksburg lake a 37acre park the city council last 
week reserved for whites 
it will be a white christmas without the snow buchanan 
jantjes head of the management committee in boksburgs mixedrace 
reiger park township said when he announced a black boycott of 
whiteowned businesses 
conservative party spokesman clive derbylewis said the party 
is simply applying the laws which exist the whites generate 
this countrys economy and the socalled black spending power is 
nothing more than the byproduct of the white economy 
about 300 boksburg whites and a few blacks packed into a church 
hall thursday night to plan a campaign against the council business 
and civic leaders distributed petitions denouncing resegregation and 
seeking a referendum 
several businessmen have signs in their windows that say all 
races welcome the boksburg council said blacks are welcome to 
shop they just cannot own businesses there 
major department stores announced they will not build where 
renewed segregation threatens business and 27 businesses signed a 
petition urging the council to retract 
the giant clothing chain edgars stores said it has withdrawn from 
negotiations to build a new store in boksburg because of the citys 
questionable economic future 
the fact that the questionable future in this instance is 
directly a consequence of a bad policy decision needs to be 
communicated very stronglysaid fred haupt edgars group general 
manager 
boksburg mayor beyers de klerk retaliated im here to fight to 
survive and i expect all the thunderbolts in hell to rain down on 
me 
cricket golf hockey and cycling federations said they will 
cancel tours prohibit tournaments and withdraw subsidies and 
coaching from towns that resegregate 
it is illegal under south africas 29month state of emergency to 
call for boycotts or economic sanctions but the government has made 
no attempt to stop such measures being used against boksburg 
the national party which has governed for 40 years introduced 
the major apartheid legislation and segregates some facilities in 
cities it controls 
yet government officials have joined the chorus of condemnation 
they say reimposing stricter apartheid will trigger a black backlash 
and give the country a bad name at a time when peace negotiations 
and reprieves for condemned black prisoners have boosted the 
governments international image 
constitutional development minister chris heunis defended 
apartheid laws thursday but said the government would stop the 
conservatives it will not be tolerated that we move backwards 
he said 
president p w botha reaffirmed his governments commitment to 
the maintenance of own communities for every population group

gunma prefectural police handed results of the probe to the 
maebashi district prosecutors office which will decide whether to 
press charges for negligence a criminal offense in japan 
police said they were unable to question the four boeing 
employees 
but they said documents confiscated from japan air lines provided 
enough evidence to substantiate their involvement the four 
reportedly supervised a faulty repair of the aircraft in 1978 but 
have refused repeated police requests for interviews 
the boeing 747 plowed into a mountain during a flight from tokyo 
to osaka on aug 12 1985 killing all but four people aboard 
japan is one of a few countries in which criminal charges are 
sought against people responsible for airplane accidents said 
hiroshi itakura criminal law professor at tokyos nihon university 
the most important thing in an accident like this is to 
pinpoint the cause of the accident rather than to prosecute 
individuals said itakura but unlike the united states under 
japanese criminal law corporations cannot be charged for 
wrongdoing 
japan air lines president susumu yamachi said his company is 
taking the police report seriously 
boeing however rejected it 
boeing does not believe that criminal acts were committed by 
anyone and hopes that the district prosecutors office also will 
conclude that there was no criminal conduct the company said in a 
statement 
company sources said it planned to respond to the police inquiry 
but was unlikely to allow japanese police to question individual 
employees 
boeing has disclosed that it performed faulty repairs on the 
aircraft after a minor accident in 1978 damaged the rear bulkhead 
the metal partition that protects the pressurized cabin 
the aircraft skidded on its tail during a rough landing in 1978 
at osaka international airport and underwent major repairs 
according to jal 
a government report in 1987 concluded that improper repairs 
accelerated metal fatigue which caused the bulkhead to burst 
blowing off part of the planes tail fin and sending the jumbo jet 
out of control 
police said the accident could have been avoided if boeing had 
performed the repairs properly if japan air lines had checked 
repairs adequately and if the transport ministry had inspected the 
aircraft properly 
jal said about 70 percent of compensation claims have been 
settled the company and boeing agreed to share compensation for 
victims families and the four survivors

the us embassy has changed its policy 
and now sends staff members to monitor conditions in cambodian 
refugee camps run by the communist khmer rouge a spokesman for the 
mission said thursday 
us officials had feared previously that an embassy presence in 
the camps where human rights violations are widespread would be 
used for political propaganda sources reported the embassy said 
camp visits began in september 
american policy still is to avoid substantive contact with the 
khmer rouge which ruled cambodia in 197578 and killed hundreds of 
thousands of people it now is the largest guerrilla army fighting 
vietnamese occupation forces 
the khmer rouge controls four unaided camps in thailand near 
the cambodian border housing tens of thousands of refugees 
documented abuses include forced military portering relocation to 
dangerous areas denial of access to medical treatment and at least 
two executions this year 
we began these visits solely because of our humanitarian 
concern for the populations of these camps embassy spokesman ross 
petzing said we have made these visits only when representatives 
of international organizations are present our visits are solely to 
monitor conditions in the camps and are conducted by officers of the 
embassys refugee section 
petzing said embassy representatives had made about five visits 
shepard lowman director of the state departments vietnam 
cambodia and laos desk until last december said the us government 
didnt make much of an effort before to find out about the camps 
you didnt think about a return to power of the khmer rouge 
because you were dealing with a stalemate he said in an interview 
thursday as people became more convinced a settlement is possible 
the khmer rouge question is very critical 
it is thailand and thai sovereignty involved its a thai 
decision we should encourage the thais though to increasingly 
press for greater access to those camps to ensure the people are 
treated in a humanitarian way 
i think it is in the thai national interest to avoid a return 
to power of the khmer rouge 
lowman is president of a refugees international a voluntary 
agency based in washington 
on nov 25 the state department condemned forced relocations of 
civilians from the ta luan camp 
international relief officials said about 7000 refugees were 
moved from ta luan to khao phlu a heavily mined malarial jungle 
along the frontier and thousands of others were moved out of otrao 
relief officials said the guerrillas apparently planned to use 
them to populate areas in cambodia from which vietnamese troops have 
withdrawn 
the new sites have been shelled this month from inside cambodia 
forcing 30005000 people back to ta luan a relief official who 
visited the camp recently said many returned on foot carrying their 
belongings in backpacks 
they were all digging shelters at ta luan he said they 
were afraid ta luan also would come under attack 
on tuesday the khmer rouge radio denied relocating anyone by 
force and said it had not forced refugees to work as porters it 
broadcast an open letter from a group of refugees in khmer rouge 
camps saying they were performing a voluntary patriotic duty to hlp 
liberate cambodia 
people who escaped say all except elderly people and pregnant 
women were forced to fight or walk through mined forests carrying 
rice weapons ammunition and other supplies to the front lines 
inside cambodia 
those who refused were jailed in harsh conditions sometimes in 
underground prisons with little food and their ankles shackled to 
posts they said in recent interviews with visiting reporters

mansion 
state police are responsible for guarding the mansion a mission 
that for a time on monday was not performed constantine said 
mrs cuomo didnt see the intruder but two or three mansion 
employees did before he slipped away constantine said 
it would be an understatement to say that im extremely upset 
about it constantine said its the type of thing that 
shouldnt happen its not in keeping with the tradition of the 
state police being very professional 
the incident came a week after cuomo revealed that he was on the 
hit list of prominent people targeted by the medellin drug cartel 
for assassination constantine said theres no connection between 
the intruder and the colombian drug dealers 
security had been beefed up at the executive mansion after an 
october 1984 breakin when silverware a video recorder and other

lawyers for gd searle amp co asked a 
judge thursday for a new trial after a jury awarded 815 million to 
a woman who said the copper7 intrauterine device caused an 
infection that left her infertile 
a new trial should be granted because jurors were prejudiced by 
information taken into the jury room by the jury foreman and other 
members of the jury said paul strain attorney for the 
chicagobased pharmaceutical company 
according to affidavits filed by three jurors the jury foreman 
smuggled a newspaper story about the trial into the jury room and 
read it aloud defying a court order jurors also talked about 
definitions from a medical dictionary which also had been forbidden 
by judge robert renner 
never has there been such evidence of extraneous prejudicial 
influence in any case strain said 
the jury said searles negligence in testing and its intentional 
misrepresentations in marketing the copper7 led to the plaintiffs 
sterility but jurors also determined that searle was not negligent 
in its design or manufacture of the copper7 
during the trial attorneys for the plaintiff esther kociemba 
sought to establish that searle knew of potential health risks with 
the copper7 but did not adequately disclose those risks to doctors 
or the public 
after hearing arguments the judge took the case under advisement 
it was the first time a jury awarded punitive damages against 
searle for a copper7related illness and it was the largest award 
about 500 lawsuits have been filed over the copper7 the most 
widely used iud in the united states before it was withdrawn from 
the us market in january 1986 searle won 14 of the previous 17 
cases to be decided 
strain also argued that the jury was coerced into reaching a 
complete verdict after returning sept 9 with an incomplete jury 
form 
jurors who had deliberated almost 10 days answered only seven 
of the 17 questions and us magistrate jan symchych sitting in for 
renner instructed them to return to the jury room to complete the 
form the jurors completed the form and returned with the verdict a 
short time later 
strain said symchych did not have the legal authority to give 
jury instructions and said she coerced the jury into giving a 
verdict because she did not offer them the alternative of coming 
back as a hung jury 
roger brosnahan an attorney for the plaintiff said the jury had 
already decided the case but inadvertently neglected to fill in 10 
of the 17 answer blanks he said symchcychs instructions fell 
within the administerial powers of her role as a replacement for 
renner 
the alleged jury misconduct came to light after jurors were 
questioned by searle attorneys following the verdict three of the 
jurors wrote a letter to renner saying they were ashamed to be 
associated with a verdict that did not represent their true feelings 
searle lawyers also disputed arguments that searle be required to 
pay the attorney fees of mrs kociemba 30 of elk river minn they 
said the fees of about 3 million were wildly outreaching 
michael ciresi attorney for mrs kociemba said searle should be 
required to pay the fees under the minnesota consumers protection 
act he said his minneapolis law firm took the case partly as a 
public service

the commerce department on thursday sent to 
president reagan a secret recommendation on whether oil imports 
should be restricted 
some domestic energy producers organized as the national energy 
security committee filed a petition with the department a year ago 
requesting an investigation of whether imported oil threatens 
national security 
the report to the president is the outcome of the investigation 
president reagan has 90 days to decide what to do which means he 
could leave the whole question to presidentelect george bush 
the report is secret until the president makes a decision 
said department spokeswoman desiree tucker 
under provisions of a 1962 law the president may limit imports 
of items found to threaten national security 
the crude oil price collapse of 1986 devastated us producers 
who had gone allout to find new oil following the price increases 
of the 1970s 
from 48 percent of us consumption in 1977 imported crude and 
refined products fell to 32 percent of consumption in 1985 but rose 
to 40 percent for all of last year 
for the first 10 months of 1988 imports were 41 percent of 
consumption compared with 39 percent in the same 1987 period 
octobers imports were 43 percent vs 41 percent in october 1987 
several government reports have warned that imports could reach 
50 percent in the 1990s at this rate we could hit 50 percent by 
1990 said william c mccord chairman of enserch corp and 
spokesman for the national energy security committee

the commander of the marine corps parris 
island sc recruit depot rejecting the advice of his legal 
adviser granted clemency to a female corporal convicted of 
homosexual conduct the corps said thursday 
maj gen jarvis d lynch in an order signed wednesday but not 
released until late thursday ordered the oneyear prison term 
handed cpl barbara j baum reduced to 226 days said maj robert 
mclean a spokesman 
he also ordered her dishonorable discharge upgraded to a bad 
conduct discharge the spokesman said but left untouched the 
portions of the sentence that reduced her in rank to private and 
required forfeiture of all pay and allowances 
combined with routine credit for good behavior this 
effectively means she will be released from the brig on december 
15 mclean added 
im obviously extremely happy that major general lynch saw fit 
to reduce her time so that shell be out for christmas said l 
barrett boss one of baums defense attorneys 
but this does not change the fact that barbara baum has had to 
spend more than five months in prison as punishment for her sexual 
preferences boss added 
lynch had been urged by his staff judge advocate at parris island 
to deny a defense bid for clemency even though baum claimed to have 
been promised leniency by a prosecutor in exchange for her 
cooperation with investigators 
the marine corps denied the prosecuting attorney in the case had 
ever made a binding promise to the enlisted woman in soliciting her 
cooperation with investigators but promised lynch would review all 
the arguments in the case 
baum 24 of mishawaka ind was convicted at court martial last 
june and sentenced to a year in prison as part of a wideranging 
investigation of alleged lesbian conduct among parris island 
instructors 
she is serving her sentence in a brig at the quantico va 
marine base 
last month in a memorandum dated nov 8 the top staff lawyer at 
parris island recommended lynch deny baum any clemency 
col gerald w jones the staff judge advocate noted briefly in 
his memo that the prosecutor in baums case maj david beck had 
recommended a reduction in sentence because of her posttrial 
cooperation and because of corroboration of claims that she 
had been sexually abused as a child 
nonetheless jones recommended the general approve the sentence 
as adjudged 
the only explanation jones offered was a single sentence stating 
no corrective action based upon trial error or the review 
procedure is appropriate 
mclean said thursday he could not elaborate on lynchs reasons 
for granting clemency despite that recommendation 
the general took this action after reviewing all the facts and 
concluding that this sentence modification was in the best interest 
of good order and discipline in the corps and of corporal baum 
mclean said 
according to boss baum agreed to cooperate with investigators 
after her conviction and spent 14 hours in interrogation while no 
written agreement was ever signed she had a clear understanding 
that in exchange for her cooperation she would get clemency boss 
said 
boss also argued that over and beyond baums decision to 
cooperate with investigators the marine should be released early 
from prison in order to seek psychological treatment 
baum has testified she was sexually abused by several men while a 
child and now wants to obtain therapy the defense attorney said 
we do not intend to lay the matter to rest after she gets out 
of prison boss said thursday we will continue to appeal the 
conviction on a variety of grounds

rockwell international corp and the pentagon 
should investigate allegations from ohio workers who say inferior 
parts may have been used in building the b1 bomber rep john 
kasich and sen john glenn said thursday 
kasich rohio and glenn dohio asked for the probe in letters 
to rockwell and air force secretary edward aldridge 
four b1b bombers have crashed in the four years the plane has

columbus ohio plant told columbus station wbnstv that substandard 
parts that were set aside later disappeared the workers said they 
feared the parts were used to build the bombers and keep production 
on schedule 
as members of the house and senate armed services committees 
we are particularly concerned about the potential impact of these 
allegations on the morale and safety of b1 aircrews and the combat 
readiness of the b1 fleet kasich and glenn wrote 
we consider these allegations to be extremely serious and 
deserving of a thorough and prompt investigation to determine their 
validity 
mike mathews a spokesman for the rockwell unit that operates the 
columbus plant said earlier that rockwell had investigated similar 
claims by two of the workers identified in the television report and 
found no bad parts had been used

the us supreme court on thursday 
refused to block the deportation of five cubans held in alabama 
clearing the way for the first repatriation of mariel boat people 
since a 1987 agreement with cuba 
the detainees are scheduled to leave for cuba from the birmingham 
airport friday morning announcement of the repatriation agreement 
sparked uprisings last year at two federal prisons where the cubans 
were held 
two of the five detainees did not oppose deportation and the 
other three lost their legal fight when supreme court justice 
anthony m kennedy without comment denied their emergency 
application for a stay of repatriation 
the three previously were turned down by a federal judge in 
birmingham and by the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta 
the government had planned to fly the five to cuba on thursday 
but postponed the flight after cuba asked for more time to prepare 
for their arrival 
the five left cuba in the 1980 boatlift from mariel cuba but 
were placed in custody in america pending deportation because of 
their criminal records in this country they have been imprisoned at

soviet officials informed 45 jewish refuseniks who 
have been denied visas on the grounds of state secrecy that barriers 
to their leaving the country are being dropped a refusenik 
spokesman said thursday 
the notification made in telephone calls from the ovir visa 
agency wednesday and thursday did not amount to permission to 
emigrate but was a signal that officials probably will let many of 
them leave in the near future 
they told several people to expect permission in a month 
said vladimir kislik a spokesman for jews denied permission to 
leave the soviet union 
kislik a physicist who first applied to emigrate in 1973 and 
yuli kosharovsky who has been awaiting permission for 17 years 
were among those who received telephone calls kosharovsky had been 
denied a visa for classified work he performed as an electronics 
engineer until 1968 
no reason was given but in the past soviet officials sometimes 
let promiment refuseniks go before a major international meeting 
president mikhail s gorbachev leaves next week on a trip that will 
take him to the united states cuba and britain 
thursdays move followed the apparent ending of soviet jamming of 
americanfinanced russian language broadcasts together the two 
steps were seen as representing a major improvement in human rights 
by gorbachev before his meeting next week with president reagan and 
presidentelect george bush 
under gorbachevs more liberal policies most prominent 
refuseniks were allowed to emigrate in late 1987 and early 1988 the 
union of councils for soviet jews said 13039 jews were allowed to 
emigrate between jan 1 and oct 31 1988 
many lesserknown refuseniks remain behind and they complain 
that the soviet union arbitrarily has used access to state secrets 
as a pretext for keeping them here 
kislik said in some cases refuseniks were told only a month or 
two ago that their cases could not be reconsidered before the mid or 
late 1990s and now they called and said the term had been 
removed he said 
in washington a congressional commission set up to oversee 
implementation of the helsinki agreement on security and cooperation 
in europe welcomed the news from moscow 
this development signals what we hope will be a trend 
toward sustained human rights improvement in the soviet union 
said commission chairman rep steny hoyer dmd and sen dennis 
deconcini dariz in a statement 
jerry strober spokesman for the national conference on soviet 
jewry said in washington that kosharovsky was a strong human rights 
activist 
he was told his secrecy ban had been lifted and to submit 
papers to leave the country strober said he expects to hear in 
a month 
strober said ovir told refusenik circles in moscow that 120 
people in all would have their secrecy restrictions lifted 
including leningrad electrical engineer roald zelichonok who has 
been trying to leave since 1978 
the peak of soviet jewish emigration was 1979 when 51330 people 
were allowed to leave the number fell to about 1000 in the 
mid1980s when ussoviet relations deteriorated because of the 
soviet military intervention in afghanistan 
it began to climb again in 1986 and 1987 
the united states has 11000 soviets on a waiting list for 
interviews at the us embassy to see if they are eligible to enter 
the united states a senior diplomat said in moscow those on the 
list already have been granted permission to leave the soviet union 
the embassy has been inundated by applicants most of them 
armenians 
the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 66 
percent of the 2400 applications received in october were from 
armenians and 26 percent from soviet jews 
the intergovernmental committee for migration an agency in 
geneva helping in resettlement of soviet jews said thursday that 
2284 jews were allowed to emigrate to the west in november it said 
this years exodus total of 16572 is already more than double last 
years 8011 and that the 1988 outflow is certain to be the highest 
since 1980 
only 1314 of this years arrivals at an icm transit center in 
vienna have gone to israel agency spokeswoman regina boucault said 
in geneva

the most recent surprise inspections of the 
nations nursing homes showed that 43 percent failed to meet food 
sanitation standards and nearly 30 percent didnt properly 
administer drugs or ensure good personal hygiene the government 
reported thursday 
in a 75volume guide for consumers federal officials released 
grades for each of the 15000 nursing homes on 32 of the 
approximately 500 standards by which they are measured at least once 
a year in onsite inspections 
overall the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in 10 categories 
but about 2400 nursing homes received passing marks in all 32 
categories 
the massive report a compilation of material previously 
available only on a piecemeal basis through state regulatory 
agencies amounts to the first federally sanctioned catalog for 
people looking for a nursing home 
i think this is a landmark achievement not because it an end 
to itself but because it will help people pose thoughtful further 
questions in seeking out a nursing home said dr william l 
roper head of the health care financing administration that 
oversees medicare and medicaid 
but neither the nursinghome industry nor its severest critics 
greeted the report with enthusiasm elma holder director of the 
national citizens coalition for nursing home reform said roper 
should be embarrassed and ashamed to present these documents so 
proudly at best they provide a teaser to the consumers to try to 
obtain a copy of the full survey report of the facility 
dr paul willging executive vice president of the 9000memember 
american health care association the major nursing home trade 
group called the report unreliable and in fact the guide could 
be harmful to consumers who use it as a shortcut to selecting a 
nursing home 
but the american association of retired persons praised the 
report as a good start toward full disclosure of information 
about nursing home quality 
we are pleased that the federal government has taken valuable 
information about the quality of nursing home care out of its 
computers and made it available to the individuals and families who 
need it most said aarp executive director horace deets 
roper acknowledged it should not be viewed as a onestop guide 
and conceded that a major shortcoming was that the 32 performance 
indicators were listed only as having been met or unmet 
rather than showing the severity of failures 
for example a nursing home that needed 30 nurses on staff to 
meet patientnurse ratios and had only 26 would receive the same 
unmet citation as if it only had 10 nurses 
by law the most recent and full report has to be available for 
inspection at each nursing home giving more detail for what led to 
unmet citations 
this document is not the ultimate report on nursing homes 
across the country but we present national statistics in order to be 
helpful in interpreting how a given nursing home compares to other 
nursing homes across the country roper said at a news conference 
in addition to showing that 428 percent of the nursing homes 
received an unmet grade when measured against minimum federal 
standards for food storage preparation and distribution the report 
found these other unmet percentages 
daily personal hygiene standard for patients 298 percent 
proper and timely administration of prescribed drugs 29 percent 
isolation techniques to prevent spread of infection 247 
percent 
rehabilitative care to promote maximum physicial functioning to 
prevent loss of ability to walk and otherwise move freely 216 
percent 
none of the other 27 categories registered an unmet 
percentage above 20 percent 
at the aplus end of the scale the report shows that 997 
percent meet requirements for discharging or transferring patients 
996 percent allow residents to communicate freely with others 995 
percent provide emergency medical services as necessary 
willging speaking for the industry noted the report is based on 
the judgments of more than 3000 inspectors and that the most 
recent inspections included in the document occurred last summer 
some are 18 months old 
consumers must not consider the hcfa report a substitute for 
visiting nursing homes during the slection process said willging 
visting and asking the right questions are essential 
sheldon l goldbert president of the american association of 
homes for the aging another trade group said the report renders 
highquality care and substandard care nearly indistinguishable by 
its failure to separate serious ongoing problems from minor 
onetime infractions 
but ms holder of the nonprofit reform coalition said we 
think the national statistics are misleading conditions are worse

sixtyone senators and eight senatorselect 
including vice presidentelect dan quayle on thursday endorsed the 
decision by secretary of state george p shultz to deny a visa to 
palestinian leader yasser arafat 
the 35 republicans and 34 democrats told shultz in a letter that 
arafat was associated with terrorism and has no place in the 
united states barring arafat was entirely justified because 
arafat is chairman of the palestine liberation organization which 
they said engages in terrorism 
the us government has convincing evidence that plo elements 
have engaged in terrorism against americans the lawmakers told 
shultz as you rightfully and lawfully concluded such an 
individual has no place in the united states 
the letterwriting effort was organized by sens dennis 
deconcini dariz and charles grassley riowa 
we must continue our policy of denying admission to our country 
those including arafat who profess terrorism as a tool of foreign 
policy deconcini said 
grassley said the plo under arafat remains committed to terrorism 
and added shultzs action makes it clear that the us will not 
tolerate such activity 
arafat sought a visa to visit the united states in order to 
address the united nations general assembly 
shultzs decision prompted an international uproar and the 
general assembly on wednesday approved a resolution deploring the 
move and declaring it a violation of us responsibilities as the 
host nation for the un

president reagan said thursday he is against a 
pardon for former aide oliver l north but duty requires his 
administration to block release of secret documents that may be 
needed for norths trial on irancontra charges 
reagan commented in response to reporters questions after his 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said disclosure of documents sought by 
norths lawyers for use in his defense would reveal state secrets 
of the highest order 
we have indicated there are categories of information included 
in these documents which cannot be declassified at any point 
fitzwater told reporters 
reagan questioned at the beginning of a meeting on trade issues 
in the oval office said the things we are blocking are the 
things that duty requires we block 
these are things that are national security secrets he said 
this is something that from the very beginning we knew we would 
have to do 
he denied that the move was an attempt to sabotage norths trial 
and said the law must take its course 
asked whether he still believed as he stated earlier this year 
that north and former national security adviser john m poindexter 
will ultimately be found innocent the president said 
at this stage i dont think i should comment on guilt or 
innocence or anything of this kind 
when asked whether this meant he would not grant pardons for 
north and poindexter he replied from the very beginning i said 
that to consider a pardon would leave them under a shadow of guilt 
for the rest of their lives i think we have to let the judicial 
process proceed 
last june 27 reagan responded to a question on the subject by 
saying i believe in the innocence of the two men and i would like 
to see that established once and for all 
fitzwater said the white house has offered a briefing to us 
district judge gerhard gesell who is scheduled to preside over 
norths trial but had not received a response 
he said it was up to the judge to decide whether the 
classified material is relevant to norths defense and if it is 
whether the indictments against him should be dismissed or he should 
be tried 
this information involves sensitive methods and sources and 
exceedingly sensitive programs which are state secrets of the 
highest order fitzwater said 
he said gesell was advised of the administration position last 
week when white house counsel ab culvahouse wrote to independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh who is prosecuting the case and walsh 
filed a pleading with the court 
the secret materials bear most heavily on two charges relating to 
the diversion conspiracy and theft of government property 
however north also could be tried on other charges including 
allegations he made false statements to congress and conspired to 
illegally use a taxexempt foundation to raise money for the contras 
fitzwater said the decision not to release the documents was made 
in july by secretary of state george p shultz defense secretary 
frank c carlucci cia director william webster national security 
adviser colin l powell and lt gen william odom director of the 
national security agency 
the spokesman said the decision was unanimous it was passed on 
to walsh who fitzwater said did not object to it and indicated he 
could pursue his case against north on the basis of unclassified 
material 
later norths attorneys said they wanted to use some of this 
material in his defense 
gesell recently cautioned the white house that he would not be 
able to control the flow of information once norths trial started 
possibly in late january and pointed out that the president has 
legal and constitutional means by which to do so 
fitzwater said he assumed the reference to constitutional means 
referred to the possibility of a pardon for north which he said has 
not been considered 
but he said the administration acted by legal means when the 
administration officials following the classified procedures act 
made their decision in july 
he said culvahouse wrote to walsh after officials concluded from 
what gesell said that the judge did not know of the july decision 
fitzwater said the decision was not reviewed by reagan 
these judgments were made by the security agencies involved and 
not by the white house and are not political in any fashion 
he said 
these state secrets are essential to the national security of 
the united states and cannot be disclosed in any form 
fitzwater said he was referring both to sensitive information 
deleted from 350 documents walsh plans to use as evidence and to the 
40000 pages of material that north contends are needed for his 
defense walsh earlier received administration approval to use the 
350 documents as long as sensitive portions were blacked out or 
deleted 
north is trying to persuade gesell that the uncensored versions 
of the documents should be used in any trial 
there is information in those documents that we know we cannot 
declassify he said 
however he said these secrets which cannot be discosed have 
been identified as material to the defense and it is up to the 
judge to determine whether it is relevant if it is it is up to him 
to decide what happens to the various counts of the indictment 
meantime thursday gesell presided for a second day at 
closeddoor hearings on norths objections to deleting sensitive 
references from classified documents that walsh wants to use as 
evidence 
north argues that the references to countries foreign officials 
and us intelligence agents are necessary to defend charges that he 
conspired to divert more than 14 million in usiran armssale 
profits to the contra rebels in nicaragua

a man who said he recorded conversations of 
advisers to tawana brawley who said she was a victim of a racist 
sex attack but refused to cooperate with police but then produced 
only blank tapes has been indicted 
samuel mcclease 26 a selfdescribed surveillance expert from 
newark nj was indicted by a federal grand jury wednesday on 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice the indictment 
closely paralleled a criminal complaint filed against him last 
summer 
the action comes a month after a state grand jury concluded that 
ms brawley a black teenager from upstate new york had concocted 
her story of abduction and sexual assault by whites 
mcclease who has been free on 100000 bond will be arraigned 
dec 8 said deborah corley a spokeswoman for us attorney rudolph 
giuliani he faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a 
250000 fine on each count if convicted 
there was no telephone listing for mcclease in newark his 
lawyer leonard joy of the legal aid society was not in his 
manhattan office when called for comment 
ms brawley formerly of wappingers falls touched off a 
nationwide controversy after claiming she had been abducted and 
sexually assaulted for several days by up to six white men 
including one who flashed a police badge 
ms brawley and her family however refused to cooperate with 
state investigators on the advice of lawyers c vernon mason and 
alton h maddox jr and the rev al sharpton 
in june mcclease told federal investigators and television 
reporters that he had bugged the conversations of ms brawleys 
advisers and could produce tapes that undermined her story 
mcclease claimed sharpton hired him to bug his home as well as 
masons home and office 
sharpton has vigorously denied mccleases claims 
according to the indictment mcclease claimed he had 10 audio 
tapes of conversations among mason maddox and sharpton 
but mcclease could produce only blank tapes in reply to a grand 
jury subpoena he signed an affidavit saying he could not produce 
the tapes

president mikhail s gorbachev told officials in 
armenia and azerbaijan on thursday to restore order in their 
neighboring southern republics where 28 people have been killed in 
recent ethnic violence 
gorbachev called the communist party leaders of the republics 
and deputies to the supreme soviet to a meeting after the national 
parliament issued an appeal for calm in the caucasus at the end of a 
threeday session 
pravda the communist party newspaper said the death toll in the 
past two weeks had reached 28 which brings to more than 60 the 
number of people killed since trouble began between armenia and 
azerbaijan in february over control of the nagornokarabakh region 
nagornokarabakhs population is predominantly ethnic armenian 
but the territory does not have a common border with armenia it was 
assigned to azerbaijan in 1923 
armenia and armenians in the territory want it annexed to 
armenia but azerbaijan and the kremlin have refused 
in a report on thursdays meeting the official news agency tass 
said it was emphasized that interethnic conflicts strikes on 
this basis and antisocial phenomena cause serious damage to the 
economy and are objectively directed against the democratic 
processes of renewal 
under gorbachevs leadership the meeting called for the 
resolute rejection of the attempts to sow discord and enmity on 
national soil and for the immediate establishment of close working 
contacts on settling the situation in the region 
in a speech to the supreme soviet the kremlin representative in 
the troubled region said the two republics literally boil and 
officials are finding it difficult to control the situation 
recent developments have shown most forcefuly that many levers 
are still in the hands of all kinds of clans in azerbaijan and 
armenia arkady volsky said and the official press in both 
republics pour oil on the fire 
tass quoted alexander katusev deputy procuratorgeneral as 
saying prosecutors investigators and other officials were being 
sent to azerbaijan from all parts of the soviet union 
an interior ministry spokesman identified as b mikhailov gave 
pravda the new death toll and said without explanation that it 
included victims of circumstances not directly related to the 
situation he said the deaths were caused by provocative 
incidents and even shooting 
authorities have confiscated homemade pistols sawedoff rifles 
and explosives from young people in both armenia and azerbaijan he 
said 
ethnic rioting began in the azerbaijani city of sumgait at the 
end of february at least 32 people were killed 26 armenians and 
six azerbaijanis

a man who spent five days stranded in the 
never summer mountains and watched his friend die in his arms said 
thursday he never really panicked but just concentrated on 
staying alive 
wondering what was going to happen next was the biggest 
thing said jim edson 38 speaking from his hospital bed at st 
anthonys medical clinic in granby where he was listed in good 
condition 
edson and ray owens 66 last friday embarked on what they 
expected would be a relaxing afternoon snowmobiling in the woods 
they took a wrong turn and their snowmobiles got bogged down in a 
snowchoked gulch 16 miles northwest of grand lake edson said 
the exertion of trying to climb out of the gulch caused owens to 
have a heart attack edson said he died sunday 
edson waded out of the heavily wooded snowwhipped mountains 
some 50 miles northwest of denver on wednesday exhausted and with 
his face blackened by campfire smoke but otherwise in surprisingly 
good condition 
once ray died i knew that i was on my own he said its 
hard when your best friend dies in your arms there was nothing i 
could do but let him lay where he died 
authorities recovered owens body late wednesday afternoon and 
grand county coroner dave schoenfeld said thursday his preliminary 
examination of owens body indicates exactly what his partner said 
happened to him he said an autopsy would be completed late friday 
edson said owens suffered his first chest pains friday and that 
he took him down to the gulch and built a fire and makeshift 
shelter edson said he used gasoline and a sparkplug from the mired 
snowmobiles to light fires since he had no matches 
we couldnt get back up the way we came down edson said 
we went down a little further hoping wed come out on a trail 
but we didnt 
on saturday the men slept a lot and ate the trail mix salami 
cheese crackers and fruit they had brought with them edson said 
on sunday they heard searchers snowmobiles and an airplane and 
began burning green boughs in an effort to attract rescuers 
but blinding snow and whiteout conditions made the smoke signal 
useless and edson said he felt frustration that we didnt get 
their attention but elation knowing they were looking for us 
edson said the men then decided to strike out on their own but 
the exertion proved too much for owens 
he said lets go real slow but we didnt get more than 15 
feet from the camp and he decided he wasnt going edson said 
hes gone but i have hopes of seeing him again said edson 
who was an elder with owens at a jehovahs witnesses church in 
federal heights 
during edsons five days in the woods temperatures were below 
zero and freezing winds sent windchill factors to minus 30 degrees 
the search was called off tuesday night 
edson stayed with his friends body until wednesday hoping 
rescuers would find him he said owens was the one familiar with the 
area and he was lost once owens died 
edson said he spent his time praying and thinking about the 
weather the rescue effort and whether his contact lenses would hold 
out 
edson said he began walking about 7 am wednesday he ran across 
snowmobile tracks indicating searchers had been less than two miles 
from his campfire at about 2 pm he ran into logger tony winter 
it felt just grand edson said 
edson said winter must have thought i was a ghost i couldnt 
hardly talk i hadnt talked in two or three days i was trying to 
squeak out the words and he just said cmon around and get in the

the exgirlfriend of a lawyer accused of fatally 
beating his illegally adopted daughter testified thursday that she 
did not seek emergency help for the 6yearold because she thought 
her lover had healing powers 
hedda nussbaum fighting back sobs got her first sight of joel 
steinberg since the two were arrested in the november 1987 death of 
6yearold lisa steinberg steinberg 47 is charged with 
seconddegree murder charges against nussbaum have been dropped 
lisas death gained national attention when it became known that 
teachers and friends of the family had noticed symptoms of abuse but 
failed to notify anybody the state of new york has since passed the 
socalled lisa steinberg laws that make it a crime not to report 
such abuse 
nussbaum testified that she was in the bathroom when steinberg 
handed her the girls limp body on the night of nov 1 1987 after 
steinberg allegedly beat her 
you knew lisa was not asleep didnt you asked assistant 
district attorney peter casolaro 
yes nussbaum replied closing her eyes her mouth quivered 
and she struggled to maintain her composure 
nussbaum 46 had answered early questions in a steady husky 
voice but increasingly fought back sobs 
while on the stand she twice looked at steinberg once for a 
long moment when she identified a photograph of lisa and again 
when she spoke of her agreement to testify against him 
after steinberg left their greenwich village apartment to go to 
dinner nussbaum said i looked at the phone and i started 
thinking should i call 911 or the childs doctor 
casolaro asked her why she didnt 
joel said he would take care of her hed get her up when he 
got back nussbaum replied i didnt want to show disloyalty or 
distrust for him so i didnt call 
casolaro asked what she expected steinberg to do 
i expected him to get lisa up because i thought he was a 
healer nussbaum testified the child died three days later 
steinberg a disbarred lawyer is accused of seconddegree murder 
in the death of lisa he has not been charged with beating nussbaum 
his livein companion who was bruised and had a broken nose when 
the couple was arrested 
in earlier testimony about the night of nov 1 nussbaum said 
that steinberg had asked her and the girl whether they had drunk 
enough water that day nussbaum said she hadnt and steinberg 
apparently annoyed took them into the kitchen 
we went into the kitchen he took a very hot pepper and cut a 
small piece for lisa and cut off a larger piece and gave it to me 
she said 
asked why he did that nussbaum said it made us want to drink 
water it made our mouths hot she said she drank four or five 
glasses as did lisa 
a short time later nussbaum said lisa said to me that her 
stomach hurt from drinking so much water 
the girl then asked if she could go to dinner with steinberg and 
nussbaum told her to go into the bedroom and ask steinberg she 
testified 
the next thing its all hazy he came into the bathroom 
she said he was carrying the limp body of lisa 
nussbaum appearing on the brink of weeping said she asked 
what happened 
according to nussbaum steinberg replied whats the difference 
what happened this is your child hasnt this gone far enough 
she said she tried various methods to resuscitate the child 
moving her arms and pushing on her chest steinberg did nothing to 
help except to say relax go with her stay in harmony with 
her 
steinberg then left and went to dinner with a friend 
steinbergs attorney ira london said after nussbaums 
testimony i think she was interesting and parts of her testimony 
were moving but i dont think it was damaging 
london added shes not filled in the gaps the district 
attorney needs filled in to make a case 
earlier thursday state supreme court justice harold rothwax said 
that nussbaum would be allowed to testify about alleged brutality at 
the hands of steinberg but not before she testifies about events 
the night lisa steinberg was fatally injured 
rothwax said a mistrial would result if nussbaum were to testify 
about alleged beatings and socalled uncharged crimes and then 
failed to testify about the events of nov 1 and nov 2 1987 
the prosecution compiled a list of 32 incidents of alleged 
physical abuse by steinberg in the past 10 years the judge said he 
would allow the prosecution to ask nussbaum about five of them 
the alleged incidents included two eye injuries a 
lifethreatening injury in 1981 that required the removal of her 
spleen and one attack in which he threw her on the ground the most 
recent occurred within weeks of lisas death when he allegedly beat 
her with an exercise bar

an israeli who was linked to the us 
irancontra affair and who briefed vice president george bush on 
arms deals with iran apparently died in a plane crash while 
traveling under an assumed name officials said thursday 
the man was tentatively identified by a passport found on his 
body as amiram nir nisker a former adviser on counterterrorism to 
two israeli prime ministers said a statement from the michoacan 
state attorney generals office 
nirs former newspaper colleagues in israel said thursday his 
name was nisker before he changed it to nir they gave his age as 38 
the pilot of the cessna t210 also was killed in the crash 
wednesday in western michoacan state and two people were badly hurt 
the mexican statement said it said engine failure may have been the 
cause 
officials and sources in israel speaking on condition of 
anonymity said nir was in mexico on a business trip but would not 
disclose its nature 
nir was an important liaison in secret arms deals involving sale 
of us weapons to iran according to testimony heard by us 
congressional investigators nirs activities included trips to 
tehran the capital of iran and western europe 
former white house aide oliver north who was deeply involved in 
the transactions suggested during congressional testimony that the 
contra link diverting funds from us arms sales to iran to 
nicaraguan rebels was nirs idea israel denied it 
nir was sought for questioning by special us prosecutor 
lawrence e walsh israel insisted nir be granted immunity from 
prosecution 
the state attorney generals statement said nirs passport was 
issued in tel aviv and contained a mexican visa issued by the 
mexican embassy in london on nov 25 
it said the passenger carrying the passport had registered as pat 
weber for the flight prompting authorities to pursue their 
investigations for a positive identification 
the plane belonging to the aerotaxis of uruapan line took off 
from uruapan wednesday afternoon and crashed on a ranch near rio del 
salto near ciudad hidalgo 30 minutes later the statement said 
ciudad hidalgo lies 110 miles west of mexico city 
according to preliminary reports the plane crashed because 
of an engine failure obliging the pilot to try an emergency 
landing the statement said 
it identified the dead pilot as pedro espinoza hurtado 34 and 
the injured as guillermo joaonde amezqua 35 and ester areaga 23 
cmdr arturo martinez an airport official in uruapan said the 
flight plan showed the cessna was bound for mexico city 
sources in israel said israeli embassy officials were traveling 
from mexico city to the crash site for positive identification of 
nir 
nir was a close associate of shimon peres now foreign minister 
of israel he rose to prominence after peres became prime minister 
and named him adviser on counterterrorism in 1985 
nir remained on after shamir succeeded peres as prime minister in 
october 1986 and the irancontra affair exploded that november 
israeli reports however said shamir deprived him of any tasks 
according to news reports shamir resisted pressure to fire nir 
last year fearing such a move would be interpreted as an admission 
of wrongdoing in the iran weapons affair 
nir resigned this year 
israeli leaders admitted selling weapons to iran but insisted 
they acted only in cooperation with the united states israel also 
denied any knowledge of the contra connection 
the irancontra case rocked the reagan administration 
one major issue was that officials in the reagan administration 
were secretly selling arms to the revolutionary government of 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in iran while washington was criticizing 
other countries for selling arms to iran 
another issue was the disclosure that funds from the arms sales 
were diverted to the contras despite congressional measures that 
barred military aid to the contras 
peres who was prime minister from 198486 assigned nir in 
december 1985 to serve as liaison with north 
in that capacity nir met with north in israel europe and the 
united states discussing us arms sales to iran through israel and 
the diversion of profits to the contras 
nir also traveled to tehran in may 1986 with north and former 
national security adviser robert mcfarlane to discuss the release of 
american hostages held by proiranian extremists in lebanon in 
return for the supply of antiaircraft hawk missiles 
nir briefed bush on the program involving selling us weapons to 
iran at a meeting the two men had in jerusalem on july 27 1986 
bush has said he does not remember much about the briefing but his 
aide craig fuller also attended the meeting and took notes fuller 
now codirector of the bush transition office was then the chief of 
staff for the vice president 
nir who lost an eye in a car crash in his youth was a 
journalist and military commentator before turning to politics and 
joining peres 1984 campaign he was married and had two children 
nir intervened in the irancontra affair in late 1985 squeezing 
out israeli arms dealers yakov nimrodi and al schwimmer in january 
1986 he met in washington with north and adm john poindexter a 
national security adviser and proposed to renew arms shipments to 
iran 
according to testimony taken by congressional investigators nir 
became an important liaison in the arms deals to iran and passed 
himself off on his trips abroad as an american named miller 
until october 1986 nir controlled most of the us access to the 
iranians through iranianborn middleman manucher ghorbanifar north 
then tried to push nir to a supporting role according to 
norths testimony nir constantly insisted on overcharging the 
iranians for usmade tow antitank missiles

an accurate program

police dogs found a fifth body 
thursday apparently that of a woman in a search along two highways 
in southeastern massachusetts that was prompted by the discovery of 
four womens bodies 
the clothed and decomposed remains were found around 330 pm 
near freetown off of route 140 less than three miles from the site 
where the first body was discovered in july said thomas gibney of 
the bristol county district attorneys office 
gibney said authorities would continue the search he said the 
officer who found the body told him that it was appeared to be a 
woman no other details were available 
district attorney ronald a pina has expressed fears that the 
deaths are related and linked to the disappearance of several women 
from the weld square area known by police as a center for local 
drug trading and prostitution 
there are things that are not coincidence that are in 
common pina said after the fifth body was found 
authorities said the bodies of three women were found near the 
same interstate 195 exit in dartmouth and a fourth body was 
discovered near freetown about 10 miles away 
state trooper jose gonsalves said one of the victims was 
strangled and the cause of death in the other four cases is not 
known he and several other authorities discouraged early reports of 
a possible serial killer 
but there were strong similarities in the cases the county 
prosecutor said 
i feel pretty confident they are connected somehow pina said 
two bodies were discovered in july one in dartmouth and the 
other in freetown last month a third body was discovered near the 
dartmouth interstate exit 
a search for more bodies began monday when connecticut state 
police provided two dogs trained to search for bodies on tuesday 
the dogs found the skeletal remains of a fourth woman along the 
interstate in dartmouth none of the women has been positively 
identified 
on wednesday a dog from massachusetts state police joined the 
search 
authorities are checking dental records of five women reported 
missing in recent months to see if they match any of the bodies 
three of the missing women were last seen or lived near or 
frequented the weld square area 
jimmy giammalvo whose family has run a grocery store on weld 
square since 1922 said he hadnt seen much change since the first 
body was found they prostitutes come in and out of here all the 
time its business as usual he said 
after three days searching the dartmouth area the searchers 
moved to along route 140 in freetown and lakeville near where the 
body was found in july 
pina said he believes one person may have killed the three women 
whose bodies were found in dartmouth and that the person was 
familiar with the area 
i personally dont believe it could have been someone traveling 
through he said it looks like it was someone who was more 
local someone who knew the area someone who felt confident enough 
that they could go there and drop a body off by the road and leave

yugoslavia rejected on thursday an 
australian ultimatum to turn over a consulate guard accused of 
shooting and wounding a demonstrator in sydney an official report 
said 
the diplomatic wrangle arose after a 16yearold was shot in the 
throat sunday during a demonstration by about 1500 croatians 
outside the yugoslav consulate 
consulate officials refused to surrender the guard accused of 
shooting the boy 
australia said thursday the consulate will be closed down and its 
staff expelled if he was not turned over by friday evening 
foreign minister budimir loncar summoned australian charge 
daffaires peter shannon on thursday and asked australia to 
reexamine its ultimatum the yugoslav state news agency tanjug said 
if not yugoslavia will react with adequate measures loncar 
was quoted as saying tanjug did not say what these would be 
yugoslavia defended the guards action saying he had no choice 
but shooting into the air to warn australian authorities 
lives and security of workers in the consulate and their families 
were directly imperiled 
yugoslav officials said australia failed to protect the consulate 
from the protesters whom they called fascist proutasha emigres 
the ustashas were croatian fascists who teamed with nazi germany 
in opposing yugoslav resistance forces during world war ii 
croatian extremists have been accused of killing at least two 
yugoslav diplomats abroad and wounding others in attacks over the 
past 20 years 
a group of 19 ustashas said to have been trained in australia 
infiltrated yugoslavia in 1972 most were killed by yugoslav 
security forces but 13 troops also died 
tanjug said yugoslavia expects australian officials to identify 
and punish terrorist attackers 
however australian foreign minister gareth evans says his 
government has enough evidence to prosecute the guard

a woman who testified against an accused police 
killer at his 1977 trial told a judge thursday that a filmmaker 
coached her to make inaccurate statements in a documentary which 
questions the mans conviction 
the filmmaker said the woman has no credibility 
emily blocker testified thursday in a hearing at which randall 
dale adams is asking a judge to recommend a retrial of his murder 
case after hearing evidence state district judge larry baraka will 
tell the texas court of criminal appeals whether he believes adams 
deserves a new trial 
much of the material being presented in the retrial request was 
in the documentary the thin blue line 
this man came into my house and told me he was going to make a 
movie about a police shooting in dallas ms blocker said of 
filmmaker errol morris 
i said i dont exactly remember how everything went down he 
said what the heck its just a movie anything you dont remember 
ill remember for you ms blocker said 
in the trial following the 1976 murder of policeman robert wood 
ms blocker told the judge she identified adams in a lineup the 
documentary though quoting investigators and interviewing ms 
blocker notes that she chose someone else in the lineup 
did you lie to the judge during the murder trial defense 
attorney randy schaffer asked her thursday 
i guess i didnt understand the judges question ms 
blocker said 
morris during a recess in thursdays testimony told reporters 
that ms blockers inability to identify adams in the police lineup 
would throw into doubt her identification of adams at his trial and 
her testimony 
morris said ms blocker has no credibility whatsoever and 
said unedited filmed interviews show she was interviewed without 
coaching and without influence to say anything whatsoever 
ms blocker also said she believed a lack of evidence not any 
agreement with attorney doug mulder who prosecuted adams in the 
murder trial led to dismissal of a robbery charge against her 
daughter 
the charge was dropped five days after adams was sentenced for 
the police shooting schaffer said 
ms blocker said her daughters case has nothing to do with 
this case i dont ask for favors 
john danish who represented ms blockers daughter in the 
robbery case acknowledged under questioning from schaffer that in 
his opinion there was enough evidence for the robbery case to go to 
the jury and that he has seen people sentenced to prison with less 
evidence 
i dont believe emily ever came out and told me she had a 
quidproquo arrangement with doug mulder i can say she gave the 
impression this case i was working on was nothing to worry about 
danish said 
on wednesday the first day of the hearing prisoner david ray 
harris recanted his 1977 testimony that adams killed wood harris 
was the only known witness to the slaying 
although he stopped short of saying he committed the murder 
harris said his finger was on the trigger of the 22caliber gun 
that killed wood 
harris a death row inmate in connection with an unrelated 
killing said adams knew nothing about this offense and was not in 
the car at the time wood was shot

the state senate ended a special session 
thursday ignoring a midnight deadline to enact legislation on an 
agreement for the state to buy and dismantle the shoreham nuclear 
power plant 
gov mario cuomo has maintained that the long island lighting co 
plant should not be allowed to open because long island couldnt be 
safely evacuated in the event of a serious nuclear accident 
long island residents were concerned that their electrical rates 
might soar under the state plan 
state assembly members headed home before the senates 
adjournment apparently convinced that the upper chamber would 
refuse to deal with the shoreham agreement 
the leader of the democraticcontrolled assembly speaker mel 
miller said his members wouldnt approve any shoreham bill that the 
senate hadnt agreed to 
the senate wouldnt back a shoreham measure because nine senators 
from long island all republicans felt the agreement as written 
would be too generous to lilco and raise rates for the utilitys 
customers 
the takeover of the completed power plant was approved by 
stockholders of long island lighting better known as lilco and the 
utilitys board set a deadline for state approval in the middle of 
november when that date passed it was extended to dec 1 
lilco spokesman james lois said the utilitys board of directors 
had called a meeting for friday in hicksville to discuss our 
future course regarding the settlement he would not speculate 
what options lilco might consider 
cuomo had said that if the deal died shoreham could get an 
operating license from the federal nuclear regulatory commission as 
early as dec 12 
the deal worked out by lilco and cuomos aides in june called 
for the state to buy the 53 billion power plant for 1 and 
dismantle it in return the utility would get guaranteed rate hikes 
over the next decade totaling more than 60 percent 
cuomo said lilco customers would find their rates going up by 100 
percent over the next decade if the agreement wasnt approved and 
the shoreham plant went into operation 
the state through the new york power authority would build 
nonnuclear power plants to provide lilco with the electricity it 
would lose without shoreham the deal stipulated

thousands of palestinian 
children streamed to west bank elementary schools thursday after the 
army lifted an order that shut down classes for most of 10 months 
there were no reports of violence at the 612 private state and 
unrun schools attended by about 230000 firstthroughsixth 
graders 
but elsewhere thursday a palestinian teenager was killed and 15 
arabs were wounded when troops opened fire at rockthrowing 
demonstrators in the occupied west bank and gaza strip hospital 
officials said 
near the west bank jewish settlement of pisgat zeev an israeli 
driver was attacked with stones lost control of his car and crashed 
into an electricity pole israel radio said he was reported to 
suffer only slight injuries 
the 17yearold palestinian was killed in the west bank village 
of kifin north of jenin when soldiers searching for protesters 
opened fire after they were attacked with stones and a fire bomb an 
army statement said 
the latest death raised to at least 317 the number of 
palestinians killed since they launched their uprising against 
israeli rule in the west bank and gaza strip on dec 8 1987 eleven 
israelis also have died 
among the wounded was a 10yearold boy from deir balah refugee 
camp south of gaza city said the hospital officials who demanded 
anonymity they said the boy identified as hamad hassan abu dan 
was in critical condition with a bullet wound in his chest and was 
transferred to barzilai hospital in israel for further treatment 
the army confirmed that four palestinians were wounded in clashes 
in the central market of the west bank city of nablus and said it 
was checking the other reports of wounded 
the start of elementary school classes was the first step in the 
armys threestage opening of 1194 west bank schools closed for 
all but a few weeks since feb 3 junior high schools will open dec 
11 and high schools dec 18 
brig gen shaike erez head of the west bank military 
administration said there was no guarantee the schools would remain 
open 
we have made the opening conditional on the schools being used 
for learning and not to create demonstrations erez said on army 
radio we have no guarantees that everything will go smoothly 
the army closed the schools in february after charging they were 
a breeding ground for antiisraeli demonstrations 
west bank universities and colleges are to remain closed 
indefinitely 
the 365 schools attended by 175000 students in the gaza strip 
have been open although there have been sporadic closures 
in the west bank city of ramallah nine miles north of jerusalem 
children greeted one another happily in the schoolyard of the 
quakerrun friends boys school as it opened at 730 am 
they were excited perhaps more about meeting each other than 
about being back in class principal khalil mahshi said 
most fourth graders in an english class at the friends school 
said they were glad to be back in school 
i missed school because i didnt see my friends i studied at 
home but it wasnt the same said 9yearold eric kapenga 
ahmed boshnah also 9 said he had no difficulty getting up for 
school thursday even though classes started half an hour earlier to 
compensate for school ending at noon instead of 1 pm in 
compliance with ploissued strike orders 
at home i played a lot and watched tv but i dont miss it it 
got boring boshnah said 
sam awwad 11 disagreed glancing disparagingly at his 
sixthgrade science text 
id rather be throwing rocks at the jews said awwad 
principal mahshi said school attendance thursday was about 150 
students down considerably from last years 200 elementary pupils 
in the upper grades the loss will be even greater added 
mahshi he said this years class of graduating seniors would number 
just seven compared to 33 before the school closure 
the sharp drop in enrollment was due to arabamerican students 
leaving for schools in the united states and hundreds of west bank 
students enrolling in schools in jerusalem during the prolonged 
closure mahshi said 
tourism ministry officials meanwhile announced that religious 
christmas celebrations would take place in the west bank town of 
bethlehem as scheduled 
the statement came after palestinian municipal officials said 
earlier this week they were canceling cityrun christmas activities 
in solidarity with the palestinian uprising 
the palestinian decision means there wont be an annual reception 
for arab and israeli dignitaries a christmas eve boy scout parade 
or decorations in city streets 
the tourism ministry plans to stage its annual international 
choir festival and other events

delta air lines imposed tighter guidelines 
for cockpit conduct thursday and a federal panel probing the crash 
of flight 1141 learned of occasional lapses in communication and 
procedure on delta flight decks 
delta officials said they had planned to issue the new guidelines 
before the national transportation safety board began its public 
hearing this week into the aug 31 crash of the flight upon takeoff 
from dallasfort worth international airport fourteen of the 108 
people on the plane died 
marion dittman who led a team that conducted a special safety 
audit of the atlantabased carrier in 1987 told the panel thursday 
that deltas policy a year ago was to give pilots maximum 
discretion in control of the cockpit 
we were surprised at some of the things we found ms dittman 
said 
there is no evidence deltas crew are on the whole either 
unprofessional or purposely negligent the report said rather 
it was observed that crew members are frequently acting as 
individuals rather than as members of smoothly running teams 
the report cited some delta captains passive leadership under 
which fellow flight officers often proceeded on the assumption 
that they knew what the captain wanted and led to 
misunderstandings oversights and errors 
ms dittman also told the board that a followup survey in 
november showed delta was making great strides in tightening its 
regulations 
the revised regulations will require crew members to call out 
items that have been cleared on a checklist 
earlier this week at the ntsb hearing flight 1141 capt larry 
davis testified he had used hand gestures to signal his progress 
through the checklist 
ken adams a flight instructor told the panel thursday that one 
major change on crew members flight checklists will be to look at 
the wing flaps twice 
we started deploying them the flaps as soon as we go so the 
public can see them and say theyre down he said 
the wing flaps have been the focus of much of the panels 
investigation 
investigators have been puzzled that the planes flap handle was 
found up the retracted position although some of the planes flaps 
and slats were extended 
a switch for a system that would have warned the pilots of delta 
air lines flight 1141 that the jets wing flaps were improperly set 
for takeoff had corroded a veteran engineer told federal 
investigators thursday 
ntsb officials say the hearing is only for factgathering and 
that no conclusions will be released until a report is made public 
in six months 
all three crew members agreed before the board that to the best 
of their recollection they made all necessary preflight 
preparations including setting the flaps although they may have 
bent several delta regulations 
one of their admitted technical violations was allowing a flight 
attendant into the cockpit during a long delay before takeoff

fmc corp a defense manufacturer knowingly 
shipped defective bradley fighting vehicles to the us army which 
accepted them even though it was warned about the problems abc news 
reported thursday 
the abc world news tonight report came the day after fmc 
filed suit in chicago against abc news to regain what the company 
said were stolen documents used for an earlier story on alleged 
parts overcharges for the bradley 
fmc has brought suit against abc charging that we are 
wrongfully in possession of fmc documents anchorman peter 
jennings said thursday at the beginning of the bradley segment at 
abc news we say thats not true 
in thursdays report the network said it had obtained a 
government memo in which a defense department quality assurance 
inspector cited the chicagobased builder for a faulty mechanism 
that was supposed to help the bradley float 
according to the memo the problem was not fixed by fmc and the 
vehicle which resembles a tank was shipped to the army abc 
reported 
critics of the bradley which has been deployed mostly in europe 
content the vehicle doesnt work and is unsafe by last december 
fmc had delivered about 3100 bradleys at a cost of 10 billion abc 
says the cost of the bradley program has reached 113 billion 
there was never a vehicle that left here that didnt have 
multiple defects on it jesse ringstaff one of the government 
inspectors who worked on the bradley at the fmc plant in santa 
clara calif told abc 
ringstaff asked by abc if the defects could have been dangerous 
to soldiers riding in the vehicle said of course it could 
after fmc shipped the bradleys to the army a few were supposed 
to be tested but the army and fmc were not enthusiastic about 
performing the tests air force col james burton the pentagons 
key bradley tester at the time told abc 
i had a threestar general tell me that we dont want to test 
because we know it may blow up and then that will just cause a stink 
and so we really dont want that to happen he said 
according to an unidentified fmc engineer workers installed 
flawed metal armor on certain bradleys and in some cases the layered 
metal delaminated the network reported that is an extremely 
dangerous condition he said 
in another memo obtained by abc news government inspectors found 
fmc had removed parts from bradleys after they had passed inspection 
and then placed those parts on other bradleys still to be inspected 
abc news said fmc declined to discuss the bradley on camera 
although fmc and the army allegedly were unenthusiastic about 
testing the vehicle eventually it was tested and flaws were 
uncovered last december pentagon officials told congress they 
planned to thicken the armor on the vehicle to make it 50 percent 
more survivable in battle 
but abc reports that many flawed vehicles still remain in the 
field 
it also reported that former members of the armys senior staff 
now work for fmc it said gen edward c meyer the army chief of 
staff at the time the first bradleys came off the assembly line 
took a position on fmcs board of directors three months after he 
retired from the army in june 1983 
in 1986 meyer was paid about 128000 by fmc abc reported he 
declined to talk to the network 
col david doyle who oversaw production of the bradley at the 
fmc plant retired from the army in 1981 and a few days later he 
went to work for the company abc reported he also declined to talk 
to the network 
on oct 20 abc aired the story that quoted unidentified former 
fmc employees who accused the company of overcharging the government 
for spare parts on the vehicle 
we dont know how they got the documents said pat brozowski 
spokeswomen for fmc an inhouse investigation of the television 
story turned up the fact that the documents were missing from our 
files she said 
fmc also said it has told the governments general accounting 
office it will cooperate with any investigation of prices charged on 
the bradley parts according to the statement

kemp on thursday night as an indispensable conservative ally who 
fired solid gold bullets in congress on behalf of reagans 
taxcut programs 
in remarks at a testimonial dinner for the new york congressman 
who is leaving office in january reagan called kemp one of the 
deputies who helped him institute supplyside economics when he 
came to power in 1981 
he called kemp an unstinting fighter for conservative values and 
said presidentelect george bush will need only to sound the 
trumpet when he needs support and the great army of idealists 
and activists we have counted on will be ready to charge 
reagan noted that kemp was a principal sponsor of the socalled 
kemproth bill to cut marginal tax rates by 30 percent which was 
introduced in congress in 1977 he also said that our ideas were 
relegated to the fringe in washington until the landmark 
legislation cutting tax rates was passed in 1981 
when you talk about jack one word comes to mind the cause 
reagan said wherever he is he will fight for that cause he will 
work for that cause and what unites every single person in this 
room is our shared commitment to that cause 
jack is fond of saying that this administration gave america 
back to its future the president said if i can return the 
compliment jack i would just like to say that your ideas helped 
fuel us to go further into the future than we ever dreamed 
possible 
he helped to settle a tough frontier the congress loading 
his sixgun with solid gold bullets reagan said 
james baker iii the former treasury secretary who is now 
secretary of statedesignate for the bush administration told the 
dinner what some of us thought might be voodoo economics really 
turned out to be cando economics baker was george bushs 
campaign manager in 1980 when bush charged that the tax cuts favored 
by reagan and kemp amounted to voodoo economics 
kemp will head a newly created institute for free enterprise 
development after he leaves office

chinese foreign minister qian qichen arrived 
thursday as his nations first highlevel envoy to the soviet 
capital in 31 years 
he will be meeting soviet officials to seek agreement on the 
conflict in cambodia and prepare for a 1989 summit 
the summit would be the first since 1959 when nikita s 
khrushchev met chinese leader mao tsetung in beijing qians visit 
is the first by a chinese foreign minister since the visit of chou 
enlai in 1957 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze greeted him at 
moscows sheremetyevo 2 airport they are to conduct two days of 
talks and the chinese official said he also expected to meet with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
china and the soviet union as two great neighboring countries 
must live in peace and neighborly relations qian said in an 
arrival statement distributed by the soviet news agency tass 
we are glad that in recent years chinesesoviet relations 
gradually are improving he was quoted as saying 
relations between the two communist powers soured in the early 
1960s in a struggle over the direction of world communism they 
reached a low point in 1969 when each side sent at least 1 million 
soldiers to the border and fought a short frontier war 
however gorbachev has made several recent overtures to china 
ordering a pullout of soviet troops from afghanistan reducing 
soviet troops on the chinese border and agreeing to direct talks on 
the vietnamese presence in cambodia 
in late october officials announced that negotiators had reached 
agreement settling most sovietchinese differences over the eastern 
part of their common boundary 
china wants the soviet union to use its influence to force 
vietnamese soldiers out of cambodia where they have been fighting 
chinesebacked rebels for the past decade 
the dispute has been the main stumbling block to a sovietchinese 
summit 
tass said shevardnadze and qian spent much of their time in their 
first meeting thursday dicussing that dispute 
qian indicated the summit was a virtual certainty regardless of 
progress on the cambodian issue gorbachev is expected to go to 
beijing for the summit because chinas senior leader deng xiaoping 
is 84 years old and rarely travels abroad 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev told reporters 
earlier that shevardnadze would make a return visit to china

attorneys for three polygamist clan 
members charged with killing a state law officer say their case will 
center on psychological stress from police floodlights and 
loudspeakers 
an eightmember jury and two alternates were empaneled thursday 
and opening arguments were to begin friday in the trial of clan 
leader addam swapp 27 his brother jonathan swapp 21 and 
brotherinlaw john timothy singer 22 
all are charged with seconddegree murder in the jan 28 death of 
corrections lt fred house 
house was killed during a brief shootout that ended a standoff 
between the clan and 100 officers fearful of storming the rural 
compound because of the clans nine children the impasse had begun 
13 days before when addam swapp bombed a nearby mormon chapel 
prosecutors contend it was the wheelchairbound singer who fired 
the fatal shot but he told officers later that he was aiming at 
dogs and never intended to harm anyone 
addam swapps attorney john bucher said the defense would place 
more of an emphasis on the psychological state of the 
defendants during much of the standoff authorities aimed 
floodlights and recordings of highpitched sirens at the 15 clan 
members inside the compound 
prosecutors are expected to duplicate much of the evidence 
presented during a federal trial last spring in which the swapp 
brothers singer and his mother vickie singer were convicted of 
bombing and related charges 
swapp an excommunicated mormon admitted planting 87 sticks of 
dynamite at the kamas stake center he said he was divinely inspired 
to bomb the chapel to signal the impending collapse of church and 
state and to trigger the return of vickie singers late husband 
john singer 
before jury selection began district judge michael murphy issued 
a 25page 276question survey asking the 250 potential jurors 
whether they were active members of the mormon church if they 
attended services at the marion chapel and whether they associated 
with any organized polygamous group 
on wednesday murphy agreed to allow attorneys to question 
prospective jurors about whether they believed in divine revelation 
the judge said he would not reject members of the church of 
jesuschrist of latterday saints who believe their faiths 
president ezra taft benson is a prophet who receives divine 
revelations 
the trial is expected to last up to three weeks

rep jack kemp whose name is on the tax cut 
that was the heart of reaganomics says hes hoping presidentelect 
george bush will give him a platform to keep spreading the word 
in an interview thursday kemp said he would welcome an 
appointment to the national economic commission the bipartisan 
panel charged with making recommendations for reducing the federal 
budget deficit 
the 53yearold republican from new york is leaving the house 
after 18 years having given up his seat when he bid unsuccessfully 
for the gop presidential nomination 
kemp says hes looking forward to spending a couple of years 
working for a washington research organization and making 15000 
speeches bt with an eye toward perhaps a future run for the white 
house he also wants to stay active in public policy 
im interested in being a trouble shooter for george bush 
kemp said id like to make his administration a success 
i would be interested in helping george bush prove his case for 
a flexible freeze and economic growth to reduce the deficit as an 
alternative to tax increases he said 
kemp was being honored thursday night at a dinner hosted by two 
conservative think tanks the heritage foundation and the 
institute for free enterprise development 
president reagan praised kemp as a conservative torchbearer 
wherever he is he will fight for that cause he will work for 
that cause and what unites every single person in this room is our 
shared commitment to that cause said reagan 
but bush so far isnt saying if he wants kemp as part of his 
team asked about an economic commission appointment on thursday 
bush brushed the question aside 
kemp was an author of the kemproth income tax cut of 1981 and 
his appointment to the commission would underline bushs read my 
lips pledge of no new taxes 
but when were busy reading lips these days well do well to 
remember that jack his lips move first and they move fastest and 
if i know him theyre going to keep on moving said bush of kemp 
during thursday nights tribute 
however kemps appointment to the commission might deepen doubts 
in the financial community about bushs commitment to take strong 
action to cut the deficit kemproth was based on the theory that 
growth would propel the government out of its red ink but the 
budget deficit has risen to record levels since the tax cut was 
passed 
kemp is seeking appointment to the commission even though he said 
earlier this year that the effort should be routinely passed into 
the dustbin of history 
i told john sununu about a week ago that id be willing to do 
anything they wanted me to do to help in the area of trade and 
economics he said a cabinet appointment was not necessary and he 
wouldnt take a federal appointment just so hed still have a title 
once his term in congress ends in january kemp said 
im not going to be frantic to try to keep some artificial 
visibility he said if i were worried id be doing other 
things 
kemp said he wouldnt mind being considered for jobs such as 
secretary of the treasury secretary of defense or secretary of 
state but he concedes such positions two of which are already 
filled were not likely im not frankly anxious to go into the 
cabinet he said when asked about speculation he was being 
considered for secretary of housing and urban development 
in congress kemp has been out front among reagan republicans in 
pushing innercity revitalization and that makes some consider him 
an attractive candidate for the hud job 
but others say hes an activist and an advocate not a bureaucrat 
hes not a detail man at all hes interested in the big 
picture said michael evans a washington economist 
kemp friend richard rahn chief economist for the us chamber of 
commerce said the key thing from my standpoint is making sure 
jack has an important role as a spokesman and policymaker 
rep vin weber rminn a conservative ally said that if kemp 
does not get a cabinet position the party needs to find another 
role for him to play so that he continues to provide us leadership 
hes clearly the leading intellectual house republican of my 
lifetime said rep newt gingrich rga its like losing 
theodore roosevelt he has inspired a whole generation of 
younger members 
as for an administration appointment gingrich said jack kemp 
is a quarterback he has to have the ball and run with the ball if 
theyre not going to offer him a job thats large enough for his 
energy or his drive or his intellect i think hes better off being 
at heritage 
kemp is joining other reaganites such as former attorney general 
edwin meese iii as a distinguished fellow at the heritage 
foundation and he has signed on with a washington speakers bureau 
to book him engagements 
im going to continue to speak out travel and lecture 
whether or not an official appointment comes around he said 
kemps first career before entering politics was as a 
professional football quarterback but he plays down talk that hed 
like to head his career back in that direction and succeed pete 
rozelle as commissioner of the national football league 
rozelle will probably be around another three or four years kemp 
says and besides in 1992 there might be other things doing 
if i got the opportuity to run again id certainly jump at the 
opportunity he said

500 people most of them when demonstrators tried to march from 
surrounding neighborhoods into downtown lima

it was the fourth general work stoppage this year and the fifth 
against the 3yearold government of president alan garcia the 
strike comes during growing unrest caused by perus most serious 
economic recession this century 
prime minister armando villanueva charged the strike was being 
manipulated by the maoist guerrilla movement shining path to 
destabilize and eventually topple the elected government labor

at one point a column of 50 hooded shining path guerrillas 
marched rapidly across a downtown plaza filled with strikers and 
then dispersed in the crowds police exploded tear gas canisters and 
fired their guns into the air to scatter the protesters 
pacho said 80 percent of unionized workers had joined the strike 
but the labor ministry claimed 90 percent of limas offices 
factories and other businesses were functioning

and growing shortages of basic foods 
the country has also been hit with a paralyzing mining strike

presidentelect george bush told the new 
democratic leader of the senate thursday that he will take the lead 
in proposing ways to pare the huge federal budge deficit 
faced with calls from senate majority leader george j mitchell 
and other top democrats to make the first move on deficit reduction 
bush said that is exactly what i intend to do once he becomes 
president 
i am confident that we can work together bush said as he and 
mitchell faced reporters on the white house driveway after breakfast 
together the latest in a series of culinary goodwill gestures 
toward congressional leaders 
im not naive about it nor is he and there will be different 
approaches on some of these major problems facing this country 
said the vice president he said he will take the lead on the 
deficit and then there will be im sure active discussion 
negotiation with whoever he designates to try to solve these 
problems 
bush also said he wont be rushed into making cabinet 
appointments despite persistent news media speculation that may be 
troubling to prospects such as john tower the former texas senator 
keeping a long vigil for the pentagon opening 
were trying to be prudent and do the proper work required to 
back up appointments at all levels bush said 
asked about reports of internal strife within his camp over 
whether to give the pentagon post to tower a former senate armed 
services committee chairman now a paid consultant to several major 
defense contractors bush said any time there seems to be stories 
that may be hurtful to somebody it concerns me no matter who it is 
senator towers a friend of mine but he knows that the process takes 
a while to go forward 
mitchell said he and bush did not discuss taxes or any 
budgetcutting specifics but he called the vice president keenly 
aware of the seriousness of the deficit situation 
the senator called the discussion cordial and productive 
he understands that it is his responsibility to proceed first and he 
will do so he said bush deserves time to get his economic team in 
place and settle upon a deficitreduction stratgy 
the vice president had lunch with president reagan and joined him 
at a meeting with trade representative clayton yeutter to discuss 
next weeks general agreement on tariffs and trade talks in montreal

the defense ministry said a failed 
uprising at an army garrison and looting of a coast guard arsenal 
thursday reflected military discontent over prosecution of officers 
for human rights abuses 
apparently by their simultaneity they were linked defense 
spokesman faustino altamirano said in a telephone interview it 
was not over low pay it was a question of ideology 
fiftythree members of an elite coast guard unit tied up three 
guards at their base in olivos nine miles north of the capital and 
drove off in three trucks they took with them four machine guns 
200 rifles 30 handguns and 100000 rounds of ammunition officials 
said 
buenos aires police helicopters searched the main roads but by 
11 pm the whereabouts of the raiders still were unknown 
at the 3rd infantry regiment in la tablada west of buenos aires 
capt jorge videla son of imprisoned former president jorge videla 
tried to rally soldiers to take over the garrison altamirano said 
the attempt was quelled and videla arrested 
a similar incident occurred at an army communications facility in 
citybell 25 miles south of the capital and that too was put 
down he said 
president raul alfonsin commented earlier thursday that all is 
under control in argentina and this is a bunch of rubbish just 
a little problem that took place and is not that important 
alfonsin spoke to the associated press in mexico city he was 
there for the inauguration of president carlos salinas de gortari 
altamirano rejected speculation that the motive was low pay 
in recent months soldiers have been grumbling that their pay 
doesnt keep up with 331 percent annual inflation 
the coast guard unit shouted viva rico as they left their 
base in the early hours thursday altamirano said 
cashiered lt col aldo rico led shortlived garrison uprisings 
against the army command in april 1987 and january 1988 over the 
prosecution of military men in civilian courts for human rights 
abuses during the 197683 military dictatorship 
it doesnt mean he organized it but it shows they identified 
with him altamirano said 
at least 9000 argentines disappeared and were presumed 
killed during the militarys crackdown on suspected leftist 
subversives a commission appointed by alfonsin reported in 1985 
rico is in military prison in magdalena 43 miles south of the 
capital as is videla the former commanderinchief of the armed 
forces 
in december 1985 a civilian court convicted videla former 
president gen roberto viola and three other former junta members 
for crimes including kidnapping torture and murder 
human rights trials against other officers are resuming after a 
lapse of about a year

the department of energy has agreed to a 1 
billion cleanup of a uranium processing plant that has dumped 
thousands of pounds of radioactive waste into the environment state 
and federal officials said thursday 
sen john glenn dohio state attorney general anthony 
celebrezze jr and environmental protection agency director richard 
shank declined to release details of the agreement on the feed 
materials production center in fernald 
formal announcement of the deal was scheduled friday the 
officials said 
gov richard celeste said wednesday he would not accept any 
agreement in which the federal government would not pay the complete 
cost of the fernald cleanup estimated at 1 billion 
steve wyatt a doe spokesman in oak ridge tenn said it was 
reasonable to assume that the federal government will pay for all of 
the cleanup 
joe la grone manager of oak ridge tenn operations said the 
agreement would be a consent decree subject to federal court 
approval 
la grone said the government will have already spent 355 million 
by the end of fiscal 1989 on cleanup and workplace safety efforts 
already under way 
the 37yearold plant processes and molds uranium for use in the 
energy departments production of nuclear weapons which are made at 
other locations 
production was halted by a strike oct 7 
state and doe officials had been working toward a cleanup 
agreement prior to lawsuits the state filed against the doe in 1986 
and 1987 the talks continued after the lawsuits were filed ohio 
wants a settlement that would give the state authority to oversee 
the cleanup 
the state blames the doe for alleged contamination of air and 
water at the 1050acre plant 18 miles northwest of cincinnati 
the plant sits above the great miami river aquifer a water 
source for 2 million people the energy department has admitted the 
plant has emitted at least 300000 pounds of radioactive uranium 
dust into the atmosphere during three decades of operation 
shank said the state is concerned that contaminated wastes from 
the plant could eventually pollute the aquifer and create a major 
health hazard water sampling has not revealed evidence of notable 
contamination in regional public water supplies but monitoring will 
continue shank told reporters 
neighbors have sued the department and its former operator 
national lead co of ohio accusing the plant of polluting the 
environment with radioactive materials creating a health hazard and 
ruining property values the lawsuit also is pending in us

a federal appeals court on thursday ruled 
that the philippine government can sue former president ferdinand 
marcos and his wife imelda for allegedly stealing huge sums from 
the country before fleeing 
the court also maintained a freeze on the couples suspected 
multibilliondollar worldwide holdings 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled marcos position as a 
former foreign leader did not protect him from lawsuits in us 
courts 
the act of state doctrine which prohibits us judicial 
review of sovereign acts by another nation is not a promise to 
the ruler of any foreign country that his conduct if challenged by 
his own country after his fall may not become the subject of 
scrutiny in our courts said the opinion by judge john noonan 
the doctrine is meant to facilitate the foreign relations of 
the united states not to furnish the equivalent of sovereign 
immunity to a deposed leader 
noonan said the lawsuit filed by the new philippine government of 
corazon aquino has a fair chance of succeeding 
marcos 71 fled hawaii in february 1986 after a 
militarycivilian revolt ended his 20year rule the couple has been 
living in hawaii since then 
they were indicted oct 21 on criminal racketeering charges 
accusing them of plundering the philippines treasury and stashing 
much of the money in the united states 
mrs marcos pleaded innocent to the charges oct 31 in new york 
and was released on 5 million bail marcos who is reportedly in 
poor health has not appeared in court 
ronald olson a lawyer for the aquino government called the 
decision to continue a freeze on the marcoses holdings a 
critically important affirmation of the courageous ruling which 
hopefully has held in place the monies that marcos has secreted 
away 
the lawsuit on behalf of the philippine people contends the 
couple used the proceeds of marcos alleged looting to invest in 
us property both before and after he was deposed 
in addition the lawsuit claims the couple hid other stolen 
assets in swiss banks and elsewhere at least 15 billion and 
perhaps as much as 20 billion according to a lawyer for the aquino 
government 
claiming violations of us racketeering laws as well as bribes 
theft extortion conspiracy and other violations in the 
philippines the lawsuit seeks return of the property plus 50 
billion in punitive damages 
lawyers for the marcoses have contended the civil lawsuit belongs 
in philippine courts they also argue that the lawsuit raises 
essentially political questions requiring a us court to decide the 
legality of marcos rule issues beyond the competence of judges 
noonan said the lawsuit alleges criminal conduct that a court can 
evaluate 
bribetaking theft embezzlement extortion fraud and 
conspiracy to do these things are all acts susceptible of concrete 
proofs that need not involve political questions he said 
us courts are capable of interpreting philippine law and have 
had no difficulty in distinguishing the legal acts of a deposed 
ruler from his acts for personal profit that lack a basis in law 
the judge said

a doctor charged with killing his 
terminally ill wife with a drug overdose after she unsuccessfully 
tried to commit suicide was cleared of all charges thursday in a 
case sparked by a tv interview 
dr peter rosier who said he wanted to end his wifes suffering 
from cancer was found innocent of firstdegree murder attempted 
murder and conspiracy 
the state charged that rosier obtained seconal sedatives for his 
wife to commit suicide administered morphine when the seconal only 
left her comatose and eventually manipulated her stepfather and 
brothers into finishing the job by smothering her 
rosier a fort myers pathologist who faced up to life in prison 
jumped to his feet and wept when the verdict was read then he 
hugged his children 
later he said all he felt was relief the pain of this trial 
was over the love of my life was vindicated 
rosier later said if anything good has come out of this it is 
perhaps that people in the us will start to look at the terminally 
ill and the rights of the terminally ill because of the terrible 
tragedy that befell patricia rosier and the rest of our family 
the charges were brought after rosier appeared on a television 
interview and described administering the drug overdoses to his 
wife patricia who was 43 when she died jan 15 1986 prosecutors 
contended he hoped to profit from her death with a book about it 
the pinellas county circuit court jury deliberated slightly more 
than three hours after hearing four weeks of testimony 
an alternate juror who was excused when deliberations began said 
that while he was opposed to mercy killing he didnt think the 
state proved premeditated murder 
i couldnt specifically find him guilty of firstdegree murder 
myself maybe attempted maybe conspiracy said glenn ford 29 a 
savings and loan security guard from the evidence i just dont 
think he met the key elements in ending the life i think thats 
what the almighty god is supposed to do 
the prosecution charged that rosier 47 pained by his wifes 
fastspreading cancer obtained 20 seconals for her to take and 
administered morphine injections and suppositories when she didnt 
die from the sedatives 
after she lingered for 12 hours in a comatose state her 
stepfather vincent delman testified he decided enoughs 
enough went into her bedroom and smothered her while his two sons 
watched 
delman and his sons russell and farrell received immunity from 
prosecution in return for their testimony before prosecutors knew of 
their role in her death prosecutors said they had no choice but to 
give them immunity because the body was cremated and there were no 
other witnesses 
prosecutors maintained that rosier used his medical expertise to 
engineer his wifes death in conspiracy with the delmans and 
manipulated them into committing the final act 
but the defense portrayed rosier as a loving husband of 22 years 
who wanted to help his wife fulfill her wish of avoiding a painful 
end neither side disputed that mrs rosier wanted to commit suicide 
when she learned cancer had spread from her lungs to her brain and 
adrenal glands 
he was a skilled and conscientious pathologist this man 
theyre trying to paint as killer doc defense attorney stanley 
rosenblatt said in closing arguments wednesday its not killer 
doc its a good decent man who made serious mistakes in his life 
who made selfdestructive mistakes 
the state of florida bought a pig in a poke three times 
said rosenblatt who did not call any witnesses the three delmans 
who ended patricias life they walk and a loving husband of 22 
years is put on trial for murder

afghanistans official radio said 
thursday a moslem guerrilla group hijacked a un grain convoy and 
detained three employees of the un high commissioner for refugees 
milton merino spokesman for the office of the un coordinator 
for afghanistan in geneva said two relief trucks were stopped about 
100 miles north of kabul and it seems that some of the contents 
were taken 
a spokesman for the un refugee agency in geneva said the three 
employees two afghans and a canadian named louis barbeau were 
detained by an unknown group and released monday he said they were 
in a 17truck convoy delivering grain to areas outside kabul the 
afghan capital 
merino said the convoy was the first to try delivering food to 
outlying areas under the unsponsored program 
kabul radio said members of gulbaddin hekmatyars hezbeislami 
guerrilla group blocked a road in parwan province central 
afghanistan and looted 10 un trucks 
the radio consistently blames hekmatyars group for events inside 
afghanistan shah mahmood a spokesman for the hezbeislami in 
islamabad denied involvement in the hijacking 
mohammad shoaib of the jamiateislami insurgents who have a 
strong force in parwan province said we dont know who would 
have stopped the convoy 
late last year there were reports of medicine supplies destined 
for jamiat commander ahmad shah masood being hijacked by hekmatyars 
guerrillas in northeastern afghanistan 
moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and soviet military forces entered the country in december 
1979 soviet troops now are withdrawing under a unmediated 
agreement 
un spokeswoman nadia younes said thursday at the organizations 
headquarters in new york the convoys problems had been greatly 
exaggerated by the press 
she said sadruddin aga khan the un official in charge of 
afghan relief feels it has been blown out of proportion by the 
media 
it was a misunderstanding about the route of the convoy and he 
pointed out there are many checkpoints along the way and the signals 
were not functioning properly she said adding the un staff 
who were abducted or whatever was in constant touch by radio with 
headquarters 
more than 1 billion in aid is being sought by the united nations 
to assist more than 5 million refugees when they return to 
afghanistan from pakistan and iran

a holocaust survivor splashed acid in the face 
of a lawyer for convicted nazi war criminal john demjanjuk at a 
funeral thursday for another demjanjuk attorney who committed 
suicide 
the injured lawyer yoram sheftel was reported in satisfactory 
condition at jerusalems hadassah hospitals eye unit where he was 
transferred for treatment after the incident 
the attorney complained of blurred vision and pain in his left 
eye and will be kept under observation for several days said ruth 
mekel a hadassah spokeswoman 
a woman standing near sheftel suffered a minor eye injury from 
the acid 
police identified the assailant as 70yearold yisrael 
yehezkieli who was detained after the attack at jerusalems 
sanhedria cemetery he was seen being led away with his hands cupped 
over his face 
the national itim news agency quoted the assailant as telling 
police interrogators that all his family were killed by the nazis 
and that these killers are not worthy of defense 
israel television which reported the attack announced it was 
canceling the scheduled broadcast of a documentary film on the 
demjanjuk trial 
police officials who insisted on anonymity said yehezkieli lived 
in a home for the elderly in the workingclass katamon quarter of 
jerusalem he was employed as a guard at the education ministry 
they said divorced and the father of three children yehezkieli was 
believed to be from poland they said 
reporters who covered the 14month demjanjuk trial said 
yehezkieli was a frequent spectator 
the police officials said yehezkieli apparently was upset about 
the suicide of demjanjuk lawyer dov eitan who was buried thursday 
they quoted him as telling neighbors i wanted to speak to eitan 
and now i have nobody to talk to 
eitan a 53yearold former district judge died tuesday after

death was a suicide

shouted eitan died because of you before hurling the acid 
the injured woman identified as edna shabtai a writer from tel 
aviv was released after treatment hospital officials said 
ms shabtai said on israel radio that she heard yehezkieli shout 
everything is because of you then felt the acid strike her face 
eitans death has delayed demjanjuks supreme court appeal of a 
death sentence until may 4 the appeal had been scheduled to begin 
monday 
demjanjuk a 68yearold retired autoworker from suburban 
cleveland was sentenced to death in april for committing crimes 
against humanity and the jewish people as an operator of gas 
chambers at treblinka death camp in poland where 850000 jews 
perished during world war ii 
he has consistently denied he was ivan the terrible of the 
treblinka camp 
demjanjuks soninlaw ed nishnic said in a telephone interview 
from cleveland that the family was saddened by the acidthrowing 
incident 
it shows there is very much emotion surrounding this trial 
he said 
nishnic said the attack on sheftel could hamper the familys 
efforts to find an israeli lawyer to replace eitan in the case 
this is going to make it even more difficult to find another 
attorney he said

a school board thursday postponed a 
decision whether to fire a math teacher who refuses to change the 
way he dresses after a state official said such action would be 
taking a cannon to shoot down a mosquito 
board members said they will decide dec 19 whether to fire 
teacher bill webb 
the board went into executive session at 845 pm for about 50 
minutes before postponing the decision to review testimony and 
examine evidence 
webb had said the special mason county school board meeting 
probably would end his 20year association with point pleasant high 
where his daughter is the student body president i expect to be 
fired he said 
about 80 people crammed into the meeting room before the board 
went into executive session 
the controversy began in august when the board said male 
instructors would have to wear ties a change from contracts 
teachers signed last spring three teachers followed normal 
grievance procedures and lost 
webb a gallipolis ohio farmer who teaches highlevel math at 
point pleasant high ignored the order and was suspended three times 
the board changed its policy again nov 21 and allowed male 
employees to go tieless but still prohibits jeans and denim webb 
is opposed to any change in his contract 
west virginia secretary of state ken hechler told the board 
thursday night that a decision to fire webb would have repercussions 
it will certainly be reversed by the courts and that will 
embarrass the school board youre taking a cannon to shoot down a 
mosquito hechler said 
school superintendent charles chambers said nonverbal behavior 
is much more believable than verbal behavior he said webbs fight 
was disruptive in the classroom and set a bad example for his 122 
students 
teachers are adult role models for their students the habits 
and behavior patterns of students are influenced by what they 
observe in their teachers chambers said 
webbs lawyer lawrence kopleman said the 15 charges that 
chambers cited in his opening address were moot because the board 
has changed its policy 
kopleman said webbs refusal was not insubordination but simply 
civil disobedience 
webb originally was suspended for four days with pay in early 
october then for 11 days without pay later in the month on 
halloween chambers suspended webb for up to 30 days without pay 
webb has an appeal of the 11day suspension pending with a state 
hearing examiner who must reach a decision by dec 15 
before thursdays hearing chambers offered webb a final chance 
to give up wearing jeans to class and to drop his state appeal 
which includes an attempt to recover 41 days of pay webb rejected 
the offer

president carlos salinas de gortari took 
office thursday and promised to push for political and economic 
modernization as opponents protested his inauguration in congress 
and in the streets 
salinas a 40yearold economist succeeds president miguel de la 
madrid for a sixyear term he inherits an economy threatened by 
both recession and inflation growth squeezed by a 102 billion 
foreign debt and a population impatient after six years of 
austerity that reduced earnings about 50 percent 
i take office in a complex hour it is a singular moment in 
our history heavy with risks but rich in opportunity salinas 
said in his inaugural address he said he would govern for all 
mexicans and promised nationalist democratic and popular 
reforms 
he said efforts to reduce mexicos foreign debt would begin 
immediately 
about 140 delegates from the leftist national democratic front 
walked out of the legislative palace just before salinas was 
inaugurated and members of the conservative national action party 
held up signs declaring fraud 
we are walking out because we dont want to endorse with our 
presence the legitimacy of the salinas de gortari government said 
delegate jaime hernandez the opposition maintains that salinas 
institutional revolutionary party cheated to win the july 6 
presidential election and that democratic front nominee cuauhtemoc 
cardenas was the real victor 
outside thousands of democratic front supporters threw rocks at 
police many in the crowd carried sticks several police and 
demonstrators were injured 
police used tear gas to disperse about 1500 demonstrators in the 
zocalo the central square in front of the national palace where a 
postinauguration parade was held one woman held up two dead rats 
and said they symbolized salinas 
red cross paramedic carlos daniel ramirez said about 150 people 
were injured including police and soldiers and treated at the 
scene a police spokeswoman said many arrests were made 
scattered demonstrations persisted through the day 
salinas invited the opposition to a political dialogue that would 
include perfecting the electoral process but said political 
change is not enough 
unless the economic crisis is overcome he said stagnation 
will wilt democracy political competition will turn into social 
conflict and frustrate aims for social justice 
salinas said negotiations will begin at once on mexicos debt 
aimed at cutting debt payments to a level that will leave the 
country with enough money to invest in development and growth 
we will look for new equilibriums with the united states an 
area of opportunities and delicate differences salinas said 
us secretary of state george shultz had an afternoon meeting 
with salinas and praised his inaugural address he told reporters 
salinas felt good chemistry existed between himself and 
presidentelect george bush 
in an unusual arrangement opposition leaders were permitted to 
make televised speeches questioning salinas election before the 
inauguration in return they agreed not to disrupt the actual 
ceremony 
although the speeches were televised walkouts and protest signs 
were not shown cameras also avoided showing the brief violence in 
the zocalo 
the new president outlined a vision of modern mexico in keeping 
with his free market ideas in which a paternalistic state would 
give way to a partnership of political parties business labor 
citizens groups and the church 
democratic front delegate marcela lombardo said in her speech 
that mexicans had actually voted for a radically different 
program 
in his campaign cardenas called for increased government control 
of the economy and a moratorium on debt payments 
according to official figures salinas won barely more than 50 
percent of the vote cardenas won 31 percent and national action 
candidate manuel clouthier 17 percent 
during his speech salinas introduced heads of government 
attending the biggest rounds of applause went to presidents fidel 
castro of cuba and daniel ortega of nicaragua 
also there were presidents virgilio barco of colombia raul 
alfonsin of argentina jose napoleon duarte of el salvador jose 
azcona hoyo of honduras and vinicio cerezo arevalo of guatemala and

the united states refused a request by the 
general assembly to issue a visa to yasser arafat so the plo 
chairman can speak to the world body on the palestine issue a un 
spokesman said thursday 
arab diplomats said they would introduce a resolution friday 
morning to move the general assembly from un headquarters in new 
york to geneva to hear arafat 
a ranking un official said a vote to move to geneva could be 
taken monday and approval was certain 
the secretarygeneral has received from the united states a 
reply to the resolution adopted by the general assembly asking the 
united states to review and rescind its decision not to issue a visa 
to mr arafat said un spokesman francois giuliani 
this reply from the united states is negative and will be 
contained in a report by the secretarygeneral to come out tomorrow 
morning he added 
the letter of refusal was extremely negative said a 
diplomatic source who saw the note 
arafat wanted to speak thursday the original opening day of the 
assembly debate on palestinian issues but the state department 
denied the visa last saturday on grounds the head of the palestine 
liberation organization was an accessory to terrorism 
earlier thursday a rally outside un headquarters intended to 
welcome arafat became a protest by about 400 people at which 
palestinians and a few dozen antizionist orthodox jews denounced 
the refusal of a visa 
demostrators waved palestinian flags and pictures of arafat 
chanting long live the plo most of the palestinians wore 
checked head scarves arafats trademark 
standing among them holding antizionist banners were 
ultraorthodox jews in long black coats and wide brimmed hats who 
belong to the orthodox jews against zionism neturei karta group 
and oppose the concept of a jewish state 
on wednesday the general assembly denounced the united states 
for refusing to let arafat address it giving washington until 
midnight thursday to provide a visa only the united states and 
israel voted against the resolution and britain abstained 
arafat wants to address the general assembly about the 
declaration of an independent palestinian state nov 15 and a 
political statement that implicitly recognizes israel by accepting 
un resolutions on the middle east 
undersecretarygeneral joseph v reed said the secretariat was 
making plans to move the general assembly to geneva where the 
session is expected to reconvene in middecember 
the united states says it does not oppose a move to geneva and 
would participate in the debate there 
if the meeting goes to geneva it would be the first time the 
general assembly has transferred a meeting out of the united states 
in protest 
the resolution authorizing the move must be heard by a 16member 
budgetary advisory committee friday because of the expense involved 
then would go to the general assemblys finance committee before 
reaching a vote in the assembly itself 
the plo has had a un mission since 1975 and holds nonvoting 
observer status the un considers it the sole legitimate 
representative of the palestinian people and invites it to speak in 
debates concerning palestinians and the middle east

word that the more than 2000 jamming transmitters in russia 
other soviet states and afghanistan had shut down spread through 
europe on wednesday as shortwave radio operators discovered the 
annoying raspy hum of soviet interference was no longer heard over 
us west german israeli or other broadcasts 
the hum is gone announced malcolm s forbes jr chairman of 
the board for overseas broadcasting which directs the 200 
millionayear us broadcasting effort based in europe we think 
this is a very significant move by the soviet union forbes said 
at a news conference 
future programming aimed at the services estimated 55 million 
listeners could now include more music fewer repeated programs and 
such new features as callin talk shows officials said

the wrong man spent 11 years in prison for the 
murder of a police officer his former accuser said as he recanted 
his testimony in a dramatic reallife epilogue to the documentary 
movie the thin blue line 
i feel like its my responsibility to step forward to be a 
man and admit my part in it said david ray harris who at age 
16 testified in 1977 that randall dale adams killed dallas police 
officer robert wood 
harris now a death row inmate in an unrelated killing was the 
first witness to testify wednesday in a state district court hearing 
in which adams is seeking a new trial 
adams was convicted of the nov 28 1976 shooting death of wood 
and sentenced to death the sentence was later commuted to life in 
prison he has maintained his innocence and the thin blue line 
a public broadcasting service production released to selected 
theaters this summer questioned his conviction

the most recent surprise inspections of the 
nations nursing homes showed that 43 percent failed to meet food 
sanitation standards and nearly 30 percent didnt properly 
administer drugs or ensure good personal hygiene the government 
reported thursday 
in a 75volume guide for consumers federal officials released 
grades for each of the 15000 nursing homes on 32 of the 
approximately 500 standards by which they are measured at least once 
a year in onsite inspections 
overall the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in 10 categories 
but about 2400 nursing homes received passing marks in all 32 
categories 
the massive report a compilation of material previously 
available only on a piecemeal basis through state regulatory 
agencies amounts to the first federally sanctioned catalog for 
people looking for a nursing home

in the central highlands of this 
island nation health officials are using dtt banned in other parts 
of the world to combat a disease that once was under control 
malaria 
specially trained teams are spraying the inner walls of thousands 
of homes with the powerful insecticide because it is deemed the most 
effective and practical way for madagascar a nation struggling with 
economic problems 
a resurgence of malaria in the central highlands has already 
claimed thousands of lives in the last two years and a government 
report said malaria could claim 100000 to 250000 lives in the next 
six months if emergency measures were not taken 
malaria had largely disappeared from the central highlands a 
strip up to 170 miles wide running nearly 850 miles north to south 
after french colonial authorities used ddt in antimalarial campaigns 
and drugs to treat those who got the disease 
but the spraying stopped after independence in 1960 and in the 
economic decline that followed a socialist revolution in 1975 
antimalarial drugs which had to be imported were not available at 
the same time the highlanders lost the moderate immunity people of 
hyperendemic malarious areas usually develop 
when it started coming back people didnt know what it was 
said dr daniel rakotojoelinadrasana who directs two lutheran 
church clinics they thought it was a new disease and they named 
it bemangovitra which means the big chills 
even if people had recognized it as the old tazomoka mosquito 
fever there were virtually no drugs available to combat it the 
country had no foreign exchange to import drugs and people wouldnt 
have been able to afford to buy them in a country where income has 
been falling for 20 years and wages average the equivalent of a 
dollar a day or less 
the nutritional status had fallen so much it made it much more 
severe than in a healthy population said edmond de gaiffier of 
the world bank 
no reliable figures are available on how many people have died of 
malaria in recent years as any fever is usually diagnosed as 
malaria few facilities are available for blood tests and many 
people have no access to any health care 
health minister jeanjacques seraphin and the world health 
organization representative dr cyprian hakizimana said published 
reports of 100000 deaths were exaggerated 
world bank specialists said the toll was probably more in the 
range of 30000 and dr pierre coulanges director of the pasteur 
institute here said the toll could be as high as 50000 and in some 
villages 20 percent of the residents had died 
the plan to combat the malaria threat includes two controversial 
elements 
the first is the use of ddt banned in developed countries after 
it was found to be entering the food chain 
hakizimana said the world health organization had approved ddt as 
a onetime measure because of the grave threat madagascar faced and 
it will only be used inside houses not on crops 
de gaiffier said ddt has acquired such a bad name that it wasnt 
easy to find the 50 to 80 tons needed in madagascar it is preferred 
because it remains effective for six months or more through the 
rainy season on the 226658squaremile island of 11 million people 
spraying on the walls will be effective because the malarial 
mosquitoes rest on walls after biting their victims said 
rakotojoelinadrasana 
the second controversy involves the world health organizations 
policy of providing drugs for treatment after people are infected 
rather than distributing them for prophylaxsis or prevention 
health minister seraphin said the government will make drugs 
available for prophylaxsis only for children up to age 6 and 
pregnant women 
the world health organization recommends against use of drugs for 
prophylaxsis in hyperendemic areas because of the cost fears that 
it will facilitate the spread of resistance and concerns about the 
side effects 
the who recommendation is logical on theoretical grounds 
rakotojoelinadrasana said but the problem is that people who get 
malaria may die from it as medical doctors we are hesitating to 
advise people to get malaria and then come to us 
de gaiffier said scientists are very worried about the increasing 
prevalance of malaria in higher elevations 
it is following economic development up the mountain where 
there are new population reservoirs with no immunity he added 
farmers are using every piece of land they can find including 
steep hillsides to grow rice and other crops rice is heavily 
consumed in madagascar and rice fields are perfect breeding grounds 
for malaria mosquitoes

reports of a spate of witchcraft rituals 
troubled one ohio community so much they became a priority to the 
police and investigators soon turned to a rarely tapped source the 
library 
in a louisiana parish the police chief wanted the names of those 
who had checked out library materials on the occult not because 
there was a problem but just in case there might be one in the 
future 
increasingly librarians resist requests for records of what 
books films or other materials their patrons check out they say 
the borrowings could be misinterpreted placing innocent people 
under false suspicion 
further said ohio library association executive director bonnie 
beth mitchell if people really understood what they could get 
about other people by tapping their library records wed be out 
of the library business 
in this state where an open records law does not exempt library 
records from public scrutiny librarians have proposed legislation 
to make the records confidential thirtyeight states and the 
district of columbia already have such a statute requiring a court 
order to release the records 
were not obstructionists said judith krug director of the 
american library associations office of intellectual freedom in 
chicago we just want to be sure the police or anybody else just 
cant walk in halfcocked for no good reason 
ms krug said the organization has fought since 1970 against 
releasing records 
she cited the louisiana case calling the police chiefs request 
absolutely ridiculous and she recalled a librarian at bucknell 
university in lewisburg pa who spent 15 days in jail in the early 
1970s for refusing federal investigators demand for the records of 
vietnam war protesters daniel and philip berrigan 
the case was one of the factors that led to pennsylvanias 
decision to pass a confidentiality law she said 
besides ohio the states that do not have library confidentiality 
laws are arkansas hawaii idaho mississippi new hampshire new 
mexico utah vermont west virginia kentucky and texas although 
attorneys general in the latter two states have issued opinions 
favoring confidentiality 
in the ohio battle over the open records law law enforcement 
lobbyists say library records are a valuable if rarely used 
investigative tool they will not relinquish 
the ohio library association however calls public access to the 
records a loophole in the law and an assault on the first amendment 
the difference of opinion has forced many of ohios 250 public 
libraries to adopt policies that contradict the law in 1983 one 
librarian nearly landed in jail for his defiance 
the ohio library association and the ohio library trustees 
association with 4100 members between them drafted legislation 
that would make patron records confidential permitting their 
release to police only under a court order 
the measure cleared the state senate but has been stalled by 
opposition in a house committee and now ms mitchell said 
amendments have changed the bill so much the library groups no 
longer support it 
the amendments backed by the ohio association of chiefs of 
police and the ohio prosecuting attorneys association would among 
other things eliminate the courtorder requirement 
the ola plans to reintroduce its bill next year 
a survey conducted by the association earlier this year found 
that six of 40 libraries questioned had received requests from local 
and state police for information about patrons and what they had 
borrowed eighteen reported that patrons had inquired about fellow 
patrons 
in all of the instances including the case of the alleged 
witchcraft rituals in defiance county the requests were rejected 
under library policies that forbid release of such information 
without a court order 
the fbi also is interested in the reading habits of library 
patrons and has tried to recruit library personnel around the 
country to watch their patrons according to recently released 
federal records 
an fbi agent visited the university of cincinnati library in 1985 
and again in 1986 to check the reading lists of two soviet citizens 
said the american library association both times the agents 
request was rejected by head librarian dorothy byers 
librarians would prefer that none of the patronrelated 
information they guard be made public but realize a need to help 
the authorities in legitimate cases ms mitchell said 
were not refusing to help in fact we want to she said 
but we will not allow fishing expeditions and we will not allow 
innocent people to be put under suspicion simply because they use a 
library 
were trying to protect peoples rights here she said 
librarians also fear they will be held liable if information they 
release results in harm to the patron although an amendment 
proposed by law enforcement groups would relieve a librarian of 
criminal or civil liability 
john gilchrist a lobbyist for the ohio association of chiefs of 
police said another amendment was crucial the ola wants the 
police to testify about what theyre looking for at a hearing before 
they get a court order that hearing which would probably be 
public defeats the whole purpose of an investigation you dont 
want the person youre looking for to know youre looking for them 
that could put innocent people in a bad light 
the ohio chapter of the american civil liberties union thinks 
even requiring a court order would be insufficient protection 
none of this should be made public said aclu executive 
director ann zeller opening these records to the police or the 
courts would suddenly and improperly make someone a suspect merely 
because they like to read 
steven hawk executive librarian of the akronsummit county 
public library was threatened with jail for refusing to comply with 
a subpoena seeking a list of reading material requested by a jail 
inmate who was suspected in attacks on several women the attacker 
had quoted french writer francois villon 
hawk said the subpoena seeking a list of everything the man 
checked out was too broad but after prosecutors agreed to rewrite 
it to specify release only of information related to villons works 
the library complied the inmate who had indeed checked out villon 
was convicted he had also been identified in a lineup 
librarians say their policies protect the confidentiality of more 
than patron reading lists 
several libraries reported they have refused solitications from 
companies asking to buy a list of patrons names addresses and 
telephone numbers and from collection agencies looking for 
delinquent consumers 
the american library association this year launched an effort to 
pass federal confidentiality legislation that would have covered 
library records and other services including video rentals the fbi 
had sought access to library information without a court order in 
cases involving national security the bill died when congress 
adjourned 
said ms krug were going to try again and probably again

the most irritating thing about sundays hallmark 
hall of fame presentation on cbs the tenth man is how 
selfconsciously important it is 
based on graham greenes intriguing story of a french lawyer 
imprisoned by the nazis anthony hopkins who trades his wealth for 
his life the tenth man is tedious and overwrought as 
exemplified by the cloyingly romantic music overwhelming almost 
every scene its composed by lee holdridge who wrote the theme for 
beauty and the beast 
hopkins can be effecting in the right role but here he is merely 
irritating employing varying degrees of one emotion dumbfounded 
there is some hope when the flamboyant derek jacobi bursts on the 
scene late in the drama to add the final plot twist but by then 
its snoozing time 
the movie was shot on location in france why most of the scenes 
are interiors 
hopkins plays jean louis chavel a successful attorney with an 
estate outside paris who is accidentally picked up in a nazi sweep 
of innocent citizenry in prison he is selected as one of a random 
few every 10th prisoner to be executed in retribution against 
the resistance 
chavel tries to buy his life offering everything he has to any 
man who will take his place in front of the firing squad michel 
mangeot timothy watkins a young man with a bad cough takes him 
up on the deal so he can leave chavels wealth to his mother and 
sister 
three years later france is liberated and chavel returns to his 
mansion now in disrepair where michels mother and sister are 
living he conceals his identity and michels attractive sister 
therese kristin scott thomas hires him as a handyman she spends 
most of her spare time imagining how she will kill the hated chavel 
the plot begins to thicken when jacobi arrives claiming to be 
chavel but hes mostly lost in the headlong rush to the 
inexplicable conclusion

hal dabney coleman and julia jane curtin have a fabulous 
life they live in a beach house eat exotic foods drive 
hisandhers sports cars and vacation in romantic outoftheway 
places 
hal is 57 and has two grown children from a previous marriage he 
is perfectly satisfied to dote parttime on his two grandchildren 
julia is 39 a career woman who displays little more than mild 
anxiety when little ones are around until her best friend has a 
baby 
maybe baby previously titled sooner or later is a cute 
sophisticated story of a spoiled woman who thinks having a baby will 
be as easy as having an alfa romeo it airs monday on nbc 
once julia convinces herself she needs a baby she has to 
convince hal who doesnt want one of those noisy messy little 
things or to be the only 70yearold on the sidelines at the 
little league games but he goes along after his secretary florence 
stanley convinces him a 39yearold woman whos spent 20 years on 
birth control pills is unlikely to get pregnant 
how does she know about the pills put any two women in the 
same room and theyll talk about birth control she says its 
like men and sports only infinitely more interesting 
except for a silly scene when julia finds hal dining with another 
woman maybe baby is funny and plausible coleman and curtin 
make a nice team and the supporting roles are nicely played julia 
duffy newhart plays hals daughter 
janet kovalcik who wrote the screenplay has the confidence to 
put this line in florence stanleys mouth this is why i dont 
watch soap operas because the plots are stupid and boring and the 
people act like jerks 
but of course thats exactly why we watch soap operas and movies 
like maybe baby

this is a tale of two people who opened a pizza 
parlor and learned to their chagrin that a mandated benefit is 
really a tax 
it is a story related by professor william o dunkelberg who is 
also dean of temple universitys school of business and management 
in an effort to make clear that taxes and mandated benefits carry 
similar burdens 
the term mandated benefits is one of those euphemisms used to 
avoid the stigma of the terrible t word and that suggests it 
could get a workout during an administration pledged to no tax 
increases 
the partners scrape together 20000 and enough other financing 
to get into operation they employ 20 people the first year and 
manage to take home 15000 each enough to stay in business rather 
than working for someone else 
since there are a large number of pizza places it soon becomes 
clear they cannot make much more than 15000 each because of the 
competition so each year they settle for 15000 each 
then suddenly they are required to provide health insurance for 
the 20 workers most of whom are young and already covered by family 
insurance this costs 500 a year for each employee or a total of 
10000 a year 
at the end of the year therefore the two partners have earned 
only 10000 each to support their families something must be done 
a conference is held 
they consider closing shop and working for someone else but that 
would mean firing 20 employees they could be content with 10000 
each though they could make 15000 elsewhere they could cut 
wages they could raise prices 
they decide to raise prices so do their competitors who are 
faced with the same situation however it becomes clear that at 
higher prices people buy less pizza they are forced to fire an 
employee their competitors do likewise 
as a result at the end of the year they are nearly able to 
restore their 15000 salaries in effect their customers and the 
employees who lost their jobs paid for the mandated benefits 
somebody had to 
ultimately it might have worked out differently as an 
alternative the market might have reduced the cash pay of all pizza 
workers so that the cash plus the new health benefits would have 
equaled the old wages 
if that were the eventuality those receiving the benefits would 
have paid directly but they might have rebelled especially since 
most did not want the coverage even worse those that did might 
have gotten them cheaper elsewhere 
now says dunkelberg substitute profit tax or minimum 
wage or mandatory child care or any other mandated government 
program you would get the same results as were obtained from the 
mandated medical insurance 
now the professor suggests consider this many people receive 
socalled benefits they do not want many who receive benefits are 
not members of the target groups that government is trying to help 
in such ways says dunkelberg we lay waste our tax money and 
the waste is worsened by the medium of distribution which is the 
small company small companies he observes are not efficient 
administrators of social programs 
what small companies do well and 90 percent of all us 
employers have 20 or fewer employees is produce goods and 
services when we divert them from what they do well says 
dunkelberg the entire economy suffers 
he says these programs can mean higher prices for poor and rich 
alike maybe lower wages inefficient distribution of services 
layoffs and perhaps fewer businesses 
many people will be forced to pay for and receive services they 
do not want even worse most of the benefits will be received by 
consumers who do not belong to the target groups that congress 
desires to help 
mandated benefits its a terrible idea and it is time we 
recognized it as such dunkelberg said

authorities have ordered an 8 
pm6 am curfew from spring to fall for cows in the pastures of 
this small dutch farming community 
the new measure requires farmers to put their cattle in barns at 
night and keep their droppings outdoors from polluting the areas 
drinking water 
the curfew which takes effect jan 1 1990 has farmers irate 
for as long as anyone can remember they have left their cattle in 
the pastures at night during the warm months saving the expense and 
time of moving them in and out of barns every day 
but environmentalists claim the cows nights out are causing a 
serious pollution threat to the water supplies of tens of thousands 
of people in the southeastern netherlands 
the measure is part of a package to curb the contamination of 
our drinking water supplies with nitrates said henk van loon a 
spokesman for noordbrabant the southern province that includes 
this town of 7800 people 70 miles southeast from amsterdam 
earlier this year the provincial environmental agency 
established that in the vierlingsbeek reservoirs which supplies 
drinking water to 25000 households in the area the levels of 
nitrates which are components of animal excrement were three times 
as high as the 200 milligrams per gallon allowed under dutch law 
the human body converts nitrates into nitrites which can damage 
the adrenal glands especially in infants 
it was time to do something drastic van loon said 
twothirds of dutch households get their drinking water from 
deposits such as those in vierlingsbeek 
vierlingsbeeks farmers plan a campaign to protest the measure 
which their spokesman wil kuenen claims will cost them 
fortunes 
he explained that herding the cattle to and from pastures every 
day instead of letting them out and keeping them out from april to 
november will mean higher labor costs for farmers 
it will take hours to get the animals into the pastures and 
back kuenen said 
were being singled out while there are many more sources of 
nitrate pollution 
dutch agriculture ministry figures indicate that the main source 
of ground water pollution is the 90000 tons of manure produced 
annually by 5 million cows 14 million pigs and 92 million chickens 
pigs and chickens are put indoors at night yearround but their 
droppings are often disposed of outdoors 
the only way out was to ban animals from the land for part of 
the day said provincial spokesman van loon 
under the provincial bylaw creating the curfew cattle breeders 
face stiff fines if they let their cattle graze at night 
the curfew covers 1771 acres of grazing land covering water 
holdings in vierlingsbeek and neighboring boxmeer van loon said 
the measure also strictly limits the nitrate content of 
fertilizers used by the areas corn growers he said 
farmers contend they arent the only culprits 
the rhine and the meuse rivers which together provide some 30 
percent of the drinking water needs of the netherlands 11 million 
people are heavily contaminated with pesticides and herbicides 
dumped by west german and swiss chemical companies according to jur 
lieffering a spokesman for the association of dutch water supply 
companies 
he noted that dutch produce growers also were contributing to the 
crisis via herbicide and insecticide use

a case of chicken pox made mick jones cancel this 
falls big audio dynamite tour but jones vows to come back 
tighten up vol 88 is the bands latest album and just play 
music the first single is receiving radio play in the united 
states 
with the group planning to resume touring after the new year 
jones is anxious to regain its previous momentum 
i think its a growing thing a matter of getting people to 
listen changing the way they think i just want to communicate and 
play music said the 33yearold guitarist and songwriter who 
recovered sufficiently to give a recent interview in midtown 
manhattan 
i was getting into the mood where the group was unstoppable 
he said before canceling the tour 
we were ravaged by the critics but the music wasnt for them 
it was for more it was music with a reason with something to say 
you can put us on page 13 of your paper but you cant ignore us 
because the other stuff is going to whither and die 
that touch of drama should be no surprise coming from jones who 
help lead the british punk movement with the clash a decade ago 
jones was born in london in 1955 a fan of such groups as the 
animals and the kinks he considered rock n roll the most 
exciting thing around but in the 1970s he and many other fans 
grew disillusioned with the direction of rock punk groups began to 
appear as a response to the complacency and indifference of 
mainstream rock and society in general 
like the sex pistols the clash were crude loud angry and 
threatening in short everything they thought rock n roll should 
be it needed to happen said jones we needed it at that 
time 
punk wasnt simply a kind of music it was an attitude jones 
like many who grew up in england in the 60s and 70s felt that the 
more established rock bands had turned their backs on the fans 
the musics just as much about the fans he said theyre 
very important they dont want go to the show and just have their 
wallet emptied theyve got tshirts but theyre not anywhere you 
need to take it to the next place 
jones and bassist paul simonon were in the punk group london ss 
before forming the clash in 1976 with singerguitarist joe strummer 
previously a member of the 101ers 
at the time i was just expressing myself the only way i 
could jones said we looked at it as if we had a foot in the 
door and we were going to go in that door there has never been 
anything like it since 
their selftitled debut album came out in 1977 and contained some 
of the most ferocious music ever recorded as one reviewer noted it 
was music that never stops snarling its always threatening to 
blow up in your face 
jones who ironically once worked as an inspector of suspected 
letter bombs readily agreed with that assessment 
it was quite a rush he said it sounded beautiful to us 
music should explode it shouldnt be contained and well behaved and 
do what its told 
although the clash went on to record classic albums such as 
give em enough rope and london calling the members of the 
band started feuding and by 1984 the group had broken up 
in the end we ended up writing our own things and sort of 
handing them over it wasnt as much fun 
so jones decided to start fresh he wasnt interested in forming 
a mick jones project he wanted prospective bandmates to think 
of themselves as equals 
ideas was the main word i wanted to have people with good 
ideas and fresh ideas he said i was a good enough musician by 
that time i looked for people who had personality i didnt want it 
to just be me 
but jones couldnt deny who would emerge as the bands leader 
its a dictatorship he said smiling but a benevolent 
dictatorahip i wanted to make it a more democratic thing i try and 
listen to the others 
jones pieced together a new group starting with his friend and 
exclash video director don letts credited with fx and vocals 
he added bassist leo ezee kill williams drummer greg roberts 
was hired through a newspaper ad and jones then brought in 
keyboardist dan donovan who originally came to photograph the band 
the group was named big audio dynamite bad and drew on a 
variety of musical styles notably reggae the first record this 
is big audio dynamite was released in 1985 and eventually went 
gold in britain 
strummer briefly reunited with jones to cowrite and coproduce 
bads next record no 10 upping street with its hit single

drawn by the bright and dazzling 
lights of casinos and the bleak squalor of the urban area beyond the 
boardwalk atlantic city has become a popular setting for filmmakers 
and novelists crafting tales of organized crime drugs 
prostitution gambling and murder 
an ugly mixture of glitter and sleaze is how novelist ovid 
demaris sees the city in his upcoming work ricochet in under 
the boardwalk author bill kents characters are portrayed in a 
universe of dazzle and slime 
tv viewers got glimpses of atlantic city recently with a movie 
based on elmore leonards 1985 novel glitz starring markie 
post and jimmy smits in his book leonard talks about the glittery 
casinos thriving on bus tours that dropped the suckers off for six 
hours to lose their paychecks 
he also describes the citys inlet neighborhood as an area that 
looked as though it had been fought over in a war house to house 
and half the people had packed up and left 
all the attention gets mixed reviews from city fathers who take 
pride in the allure of their town but worry that its being typecast 
we do look like a perfect stage set said john fox a 
spokesman for the atlantic city convention amp visitors bureau we 
have a beautiful stage set along the beachfront with the giant 
casinos but the rundown neighborhoods also seem to be an easy 
target 
mayor james usry accuses some writers of yellow journalism 
when it concerns atlantic city but thats what sells papers and 
books he said 
i dont know of any mafia in atlantic city you know these 
authors could say it took place in mayville ill but what would 
that mean to people atlantic city is one of the most designated 
city names in the country 
louis malles critically acclaimed movie atlantic city 
starring burt lancaster and susan sarandon marked the start of 
atlantic citys revival as a setting for moviedom and novels that 
was nine years ago barely a year after legalized gambling began 
now barely a month passes without atlantic city featured in some 
tv show movie or book 
diane keaton has shot scenes in one casino for a story about 
three nightclub entertainers the comedymagic team of penn amp teller 
was in the resort last spring to film penn amp teller get killed 
atlantic city weekend a romantic adventure was released 
this fall characters in the book by helen mourtos include an 
entrepreneur on the outside of society a casino dealer and a 
mysterious nightclub dancer 
previews described the novel as offering insiders a view of 
life in the world of atlantic citys casinos about the 
temptations beneath the casinos bright lights 
fox doesnt think the visions of a sleazy atlantic city have 
driven away business or visitors 
i cant throw rocks at the movie writers and novelists because 
they happen to choose us as their setting he said i dont 
think anybody except a travel writer goes out of their way to write 
something positive about any particular city 
fox worries more about how trade publications portray the city 
they prefer to look at the business side of things he said 
they are more important to us the marketers 
demaris said it was the lure of gambling the big hotels and 
atlantic citys history as a resort that enticed him to choose it as 
the setting for ricochet a novel that promises to take 
readers straight to the heart of a world of greed political 
corruption organized crime and murder 
could his novel have worked in another city 
no said demaris because casino gambling is a part of it 
i needed that atmosphere and i needed a kind of mafia 
family like you have down there in new york the mafia has gotten 
sort of small it has kind of quieted down 
kent doesnt think that kind of allure is bad for atlantic city 
what makes atlantic city interesting to writers is the 
incredible clash of extremes you can actually see the fortunes of 
people going up and down he said the city is far more than 
multimilliondollar casinos and rundown neighborhoods its 
complicated politically economically and mostly historically

the best news for fans of animated movies came 
with last weeks boxoffice report which showed big grosses for 
the land before time and oliver and company 
revival of animation the most tedious and expensive kind of 
filmmaking has been predicted every few years until recently 
though economics made animation features risky but in their first 
weekend the land before time topped all releases with 75 
million in 1395 theaters 5395 average and oliver and 
company in a smaller release of 952 theaters scored no 4 with 4 
million 4226 average 
those are big numbers and theyre likely to grow through the 
holiday season thats encouraging for the animation trade which 
has been hampered not only by the heavy expense of production but 
the nature of the audience 
a large number of tickets we sell go for a lower admission 
price said don bluth who produced the land before time 
if we make a boffo with a picture its because we sold more 
tickets bluth who formerly worked for the disney co cautiously 
predicts a renaissance of animation 
walt disney pictures which produced oliver and company has 
pumped up its animation department and is starting up an additional 
facility at the disneymgm studio tour in florida roy e disney 
nephew of walt is largely responsible for the revival four years 
ago when roy helped create a new management at disney the outlook 
was dismal 
animation was dying around here he said in an interview at 
his studio office there had been 10 years of a kind of lack of 
faith in it and a lack of direction to it there were an awful lot 
of discouraged artists working here 
we were finishing up the black cauldron which had been an 
enormous sevenyear effort with the kind of strange idea of doing 
an epic or making a masterpiece and not having any strong sense of 
what the story was there were a lot of people who thought we just 
werent going forward with the animation department there was even 
talk of getting out of the movie business entirely 
disney was faced with the task of educating new company heads 
who were trained in liveaction films to the uniqueness of the 
animation process 
first of all its a matter of time oliver for example 
took four years to complete he said his campaign was aided by 
having the great mouse detective in good story form when the 
movie proved a hit all doubts were erased 
oliver and company resulted from a gong show session in 
which 20 film executives appeared with at least three story ideas 
most were shot down but an updated oliver twist survived 
members of fagins gang became dogs as was the newcomer oliver 
but during story development oliver became a kitten 
the young animators worked at a fast clip inspired by the 
casting of the voices including bette midler billy joel dom 
deluise and robert loggia many of the new artists have come from 
the disneyendowed california institute of the arts but disney 
observed that more schools are teaching animation as an art 
the studio wont reveal the cost of oliver and company but 
disney said it was in the middle range for an animated feature 
estimate 18 million computers will increasingly relieve some of 
the tedium of inking and painting he said helping to bring down 
expenses 
but the animation of a character handdrawn in pencil i think 
will never change he said 
bluth who produced the land before time for 12 million 
found a way to reduce animation expense he moved his entire studio 
to ireland because of the labor cost of animation the irish 
government offered a 10year commitment for tax breaks grants for 
irish artists who would be trained and access to bank loans he said 
it was like moses leading the children of israel out of 
egypt said bluth the artists had to pull up all their stakes 
many of them sold their homes 
many of them have bought homes there they all have irish 
accents some have joined the catholic church its a conversion to 
another way of life i dont think many plan to stay there forever 
but they have embraced the irish society 
bluth led an earlier exodus of disney animators during the 
studios low period and produced the secret of nimh a failure 
then he combined with steven spielberg on an american tail a 
rousing success the land before time also resulted from a 
spielberg idea 
i cant understand why no one has made a film about 
dinosaurs bluth recalled spielberg telling him its a 
natural there is a great interest in dinosaurs george lucas and 
myself have wanted to do such a movie for some times but we didnt 
want to do it with puppets we tried that and it didnt work 
with spielberg and lucas as executive producers bluth could 
hardly miss he admitted his ignorance of dinosaurs but he said 
spielberg told him you can learn 
bluth and his artists soon recognized the difficulty of animating 
dinosaurs for instance the brontosaurus with the long neck it 
has a little head like a ball on a stick it doesnt have the 
shoulders and the hands to give you gestures it all has to be done 
with facial expressions 
but how to make the beasts move bluth and company reasoned that 
the prehistoric creatures were reptiles and birds evolved from 
reptilian forms so the artists copied moves from films of chickens 
and turkeys 
after the opening of the land before time bluth returned to 
the dublin studio where production is under way on the next feature 
all dogs go to heaven which takes place in the hereafter

at first dans secret was small and shameful 
then it festered and grew and took on a life of its own tormenting 
its keeper until it controlled his every waking hour 
one day dans secret became so ugly and overwhelming he could no 
longer contain it it came out at last how dan had been sexually 
molested by an older brother who climbed into bed with him at age 9 
and kept coming back for 10 years 
but as terrible as it was dans secret was only one piece of a 
truth far more horrifying it was like a pebble tossed in the deep 
silent pool that was his family causing everwidening ripples and 
revelations 
about 50 of my relatives have been abused at least those are 
the ones i know about said dan 23 who asked that his full name 
not be used it gets passed from generation to generation and 
nobody talks about it and it so it never stops 
dans oldest brother who had molested dan had himself been 
molested by a favorite uncle a female cousin had been molested by 
her father dans mother had been molested by a male relative other 
cousins had been molested by their siblings or other relatives 
dan was not alone as a male survivor of incest in his own family 
and he is not alone in the united states a 1985 los angeles times 
survey found that one of every 15 adult males reported having been 
sexually abused before the age of 18 
an estimate of 15 million abused men is conservative said 
therapist mike lew who works with male survivors of incest at his 
next step counseling and training center in newton mass outside 
boston 
that doesnt include men who dont remember the abuse that 
doesnt include men who at this point arent able to talk about it 
yet who are feeling too ashamed or too frightened said lew 
author of victims no longer a book about recovery for male 
incest survivors its just beginning to be safe enough to talk 
about it 
women were the first to talk about incestuous abuse partly 
because it is easier for society to accept the idea of women as 
victims lew said 
men arent supposed to be victims he said men are 
supposed to be able to handle everything to be strong to be 
dominant we dont know what to do with a man or boy whos been 
victimized we either define him as something other than a man or 
something less than a man or we deny the reality of the problem 
hank estradas personal denial lasted 25 years until the day he 
discovered that the same uncle who had abused him for 12 years also 
had tried to molest one of hanks nephews 
i got this nephew to tell me what had happened said estrada 
32 to do that i had to share my own experience which was very 
difficult but i didnt want him to go through what i did 
his sister the boys mother reported the uncle to the 
authorities but because the abuse had merely been attempted and 
because it was the boys word against the uncles no charges were 
filed 
estrada told his own story of abuse which began at age 4 and 
lasted until he was 16 but the statute of limitations had run out 
it was a blatant denial by the system to let this man go 
estrada said theyre just waiting for him to do it again 
when estrada went looking for support services for himself to 
show i was not the evil one for bringing all this out he found 
none the only services available were for perpetrators two years 
ago he started plea for prevention leadership education and 
assistance a los angelesbased group that offers support and 
information to adult male survivors of abuse who are not abusers 
themselves 
a common misconception is that men who are sexually abused as 
children always become perpetrators themselves lew said in fact 
many male incest survivors become protectors of other people dan 
for example works with the retarded 
many of the men who come for therapy come when theyve become 
parents or when their children reach the age they were at when they 
were abused lew said they come in determined that this is not 
going to happen to their children theyve heard the mythology that 
men who have been abused automatically become child abusers and 
they want to make sure they wont abuse children 
for many abused men the idea of victimizing someone else is 
horrifying they know firsthand the terror guilt and pain of being 
a victim they know how an abuser who is often someone a little boy 
mosts trusts and loves father mother brother or uncle can turn 
those emotions against the victim filling him with guilt and 
selfloathing 
dan tried to commit suicide twice he used food as an escape in 
his sophomore year of high school he weighed 310 pounds 
the biggest reason i ate so much was hoping i could become ugly 
to turn my brother off so he wouldnt touch me dan said it 
didnt work it just added to my problems 
at 19 the abuse had become too much i couldnt stand the 
feeling of guilt of shame of hating myself for what was going on 
i knew it had to stop and i was the only one to stop it dan 
said i got a gun illegally and kept it in my nightstand and i 
swore if he touched me i would kill him 
dan has since told his parents about what happened and has 
confronted his brother who denies having a problem estradas 
uncle now in his 60s still lives with his relatives and has access 
to dozens of children 
that makes it imperative for male incest survivors to tell their 
stories estrada believes unless society knows that boys too can 
be incest victims it always will be difficult for future victims to 
summon the courage to tell anyone about what is happening to them 
break the silence break the cycle of abuse 
most of the men who call and write me say i always thought i 
was alone theyre in so much pain themselves they never thought 
about their abuser doing it again to someone else estrada said 
it may have happened to you and its in the past but it doesnt 
stop there

the parent of southern california edison co 
entered the crown jewel of service territories when san diego 
gas amp electric co accepted its 25 billion buyout bid utility 
officials said 
the stockswap deal approved wednesday by sdgampe directors creates 
the nations biggest public utility and will result in lower 
electricity rates for customers and higher dividends for 
shareholders edison chairman and chief executive howard allen said 
we have concluded that there will be savings passed on to 
customers and that this combined institution will be stronger and 
better able to serve customer needs said allen also chief 
executive of edisons unregulated parent scecorp which serves most 
of southern california 
we wouldnt be going into this if we didnt think we could 
produce better consumer value than each utility could on its own 
customers of the surviving utility also will benefit from its 
increased financial strength through greater market competitiveness 
and more efficient energy transmission sdgampe chairman and chief 
executive tom page said 
scecorp also has pledged to file a request for a 10 percent rate 
reduction for san diego customers with the state public utilities 
commission within six months of the deals completion 
the deal is expected to be consummated in late 1989 or early 1990 
pending stockholder ratification and approval by federal and state 
regulators principally the california public utilities commission 
scecorp will trade 13 shares of its common stock for each of the 
558 million shares of sdgampe common stock that works out to about 
24 billion when calculated on scecorps closing price wednesday of 
33 a share in composite trading 
additionally swaps of several classes of preferred stock would 
add about 155 million to the deal according to rosemeadbased 
scecorps reckoning 
what were banking on is that our stock will go up in value 
and the dilution of edison shareholders ownership in the merged 
company will be made back by a higher market priceearnings ratio 
over time allen said during a news conference at sdgampes main 
building in downtown san diego 
the deal would boost edison past san franciscos pacific gas amp 
electric co as the nations biggest public utility it would have 
48 million customers a service area of 54000 square miles 
stretching from san luis obispo to the mexican border and with 
177 billion in assets 
page will be named vice president of a new san diego division of 
scecorp and he and three others from the san diego utility will 
join the board of scecorp 
analysts called the offer a good one for stockholders and 
customers of the san diego company as scecorp promises the deal 
will boost stock dividends by 24 percent and earnings per share by 
29 percent 
ed tirello who tracks the utility business for shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york estimated the merged company would save 
100 million a year in operating and maintenance costs by cutting 
duplication 
additionally because the combined company would use edisons 
excess capacity sdgampe would not have to undertake some 350 million 
in construction to meet growing demand he said 
dan rudakas a utility analyst with duff amp phelps inc in 
chicago cautioned that the benefit to scecorp stockholders was 
uncertain until state regulators decide how to apportion any cost 
savings due to operating efficiency but san diego consumers would 
be almost certain winners he said 
scecorp made its first unsolicited bid for the san diego utility 
july 26 the price raised twice since then was 115 shares of 
scecorp common stock for each share of sdgampe 
the san diego company initially refused to negotiate with its 
huge suitor preferring to pursue a previously announced merger with 
tucson ariz electric power co sdgampe later abandoned that merger 
plan however

the national economic commissions 
recommendations may come to naught but it has become the best 
sounding board around for people fed up with the sevenyear deadlock 
over the federal budget deficit 
a variety of officials representing corporate america labor 
unions and various special interest groups have paraded before the 
commission to raise alarms about the deficit and insist that the new 
administration and congress do something 
government officials past and present also have lent their 
voices to the clamor with many pointing to skittish financial 
markets as the best reason for quick action next year 
on wednesday former federal reserve chairman paul volcker echoed 
concerns raised two weeks earlier by his successor at the central 
bank alan greenspan 
volcker said a failure to act could trigger a loss of confidence 
by foreigners in us investments which could topple the country 
into a severe recession 
we are entirely unnecessarily in my view undercutting the 
economic foundation of united states world leadership volcker 
said 
two weeks ago greenspan told the commission that the need to 
deal with the deficit is becoming ever more urgent because the huge 
tide of red ink has begun to eat away at the foundations of our 
economic strength 
another government official charles bowsher head of the general 
accounting office told the advisory panel wednesday that just 
holding the growth of spending to the level of inflation as has 
been suggested by presidentelect george bush would not be enough 
to get the deficit under control 
he said consideration will have to be given to raising taxes 
something bush has vowed he will not do to go along with further 
cuts in government spending 
there are no painless ways to cut spending or increase 
revenues bowsher said when the longterm health of our 
nations economy is at stake everything must be negotiable 
including defense spending entitlements and taxes 
volcker told the panel that he favors boosting the gasoline tax 
saying that even if the tax were raised 50 cents per gallon over the 
next several years americans would still be paying far less for 
fuel than residents of most other countries 
a boost in the gasoline tax was also proposed wednesday by the 
council on competitiveness composed of 157 chief executives from 
business organized labor and higher education 
the group said a combination of tax increases and spending cuts 
should be used to slash the deficit by 120 billion by 1993 the 
deficit in the justcompleted fiscal year was 1551 billion 
the budget deficit is the nations no 1 economic problem 
said john young chairman of the council and head of hewlettpackard 
co we are concerned that the stability of global financial 
markets will continue to be shaken by a belief that the deficit is a 
politically intractable problem 
the 12member economic commission is still awaiting word on the 
names of the two persons bush will appoint to the panel officials 
say those appointments will indicate whether the presidentelect 
intends to use the advisory group in a serious effort to reduce the 
budget deficit 
bush has said he will make the appointments some time in december 
but he has sidestepped questions about how seriously he will take 
any report the panel adopts 
while the group by law is scheduled to develop a deficit 
reduction plan by march 1 bush has the power to postpone the report 
until sept 1 
house speaker jim wright told the panel wednesday that he hoped 
it would be allowed to complete its work by march 1 so that it would 
have a major impact on the congressional budget deliberations he 
also urged bush to submit his own budget plan by midfebruary 
incorporating any changes he considers necessary to the document 
reagan will send congress on jan 9 
we do not have the luxury of a leisurely schedule wright 
said the problems wont wait indefinitely while people try to 
read our lips or read our minds

we have enjoyed are still enjoying an unprecedented period 
of economic expansion in peacetime at the same time there can be 
no dodging the facts of anemic savings extraordinarily high current 
consumption rapidly growing indebtedness internally and externally 
slack growth in productivity a depreciating currency and renewed 
inflation 
taken together those factors undermine prospects for longterm 
growth and aggravate more immediate economic risks but they also 
undercut public and congressional support for sustaining our 
military strength maintaining open markets and free flows of 
international investment and for efforts to encourage development 
of much poorer nations

another example of failing to reflect costs is the defense 
budget the most recent five year defense plan includes programs 
that will cost at least 200 billion more than the funds that are 
likely to be available on top of that are the cost overruns that we 
see looming on the horizon the simple fact is that our defense 
plans do not yet reflect the limits on what is affordable 
closely related to this is the problem of our aging nuclear 
weapons complex we estimate that it will cost 100 billion to 130 
billion over a number of years to clean up and modernize these 
environmentally hazardous plants

if a formula for substantial deficitreduction on the spending 
side alone remains as elusive to the administration congress and 
the national economic commission as it has to us then we expect all 
parties will consider revenue increases 
as a group concerned about capital formation and private sector 
investment we agree that it is important to pay for federal 
spending through revenues rather than borrowing simply stated tax 
finance is preferable to deficit finance

the government should spend 30 billion next 
year to close the nations 100 worst savings institutions and stop 
more than 1 billion a month in losses a top bank regulator says 
we need to close the worst first federal deposit insurance 
corp chairman l william seidman said in a speech wednesday at the 
national press club 
once these 100 or so worst institutions are liquidated the 
other problem institutions can be dealt with over a somewhat longer 
period he said outlining the conclusions of an fdic study that 
will be published within two weeks 
seidman joins former presidents gerald ford and jimmy carter and 
congress general accounting office in arguing that it will be 
cheaper in the long run to spend heavily now to close failing 
savings and loan institutions 
his recommendation is an implicit criticism of the approach taken 
so far by the federal savings and loan insurance corp which is 
technically insolvent and lacks the cash to pay off depositors or 
make good on all sampl losses 
so far this year fslic has resolved the cases of 147 sampls 
most through rescues put together with guarantees and promissory 
notes committing money it does not have now but expects to receive 
over the next 30 years 
seidman whose agency insures deposits in commercial banks not 
sampls said he does not oppose allowing an institution to remain open 
if it is economically viable but that the losses should be cleaned 
up immediately and not allowed to continue 
hes saying that they should have had more money and they 
should have closed more institutions said mark j riedy 
president of the national council of savings institutions a trade 
group 
karl hoyle a spokesman for m danny wall chairman of the 
federal home loan bank board which regulates the nations 3000 
sampls said all we can do is play with the hand weve been dealt 
and that hand provides us with certain resources this congress 
and this administration have to determine where we go from here 
seidman did not directly call for a taxpayer bailout but said 
government resources must be used because even the first 30 
billion of what is estimated to be a 50 billion to 100 billion 
problem is beyond the capacity of the sampl industry to pay 
however he said several methods could be used to keep most of 
the fslic rescue off budget providing a large sum quickly but 
spreading the fiscal drain over several years one method involves 
selling bonds and having the treasury pay the interest 
but james christian chief economist of the us league of 
savings institutions the largest industry lobby group said even if 
the bank board received 30 billion next year it would be difficult 
to spend it efficiently 
i have a question as to whether they can move that quickly 
he said it would be wonderful if they could but im not 
convinced 
the fdic also examined the broader issue of deposit insurance 
both the fdic and the fslic guarantee deposits up to 100000 
seidman said deposit insurance is needed because it prevents bank 
runs that could bring down the entire financial system 
suggestions from academics that deposit insurance be scrapped or 
reduced are impractical seidman said but he offered several ideas 
to keep the governments liabilities from mounting 
taking deposit insurance agencies out of the federal budget so 
they are less subject to political pressure 
giving the insurance funds the power to raise the fee charged to 
member institutions after bad years and eventually perhaps the 
power to charge individual institutions different fees based on 
their records 
speeding up the process for revoking an institutions insurance 
from two years to six months 
making solvent banks owned by holding companies responsible for 
the losses of other banks held by the same parent 
establishing regional committees of regulators and bankers to 
evaluate whether institutions are overly exposed to risk in one 
region or one sector of the economy such as oil drilling

local telephone rates are going up today and 
atampts longdistance prices are going down soon to be followed by 
those of rivals us sprint communications co and mci communications 
corp 
this script has been replayed several times in recent years as 
part of an effort by federal regulators to shift the costs of the 
local phone network to local customers 
for about half of all customers longdistance price cuts of 38 
percent since 1984 have more than offset the rise in local rates 
according to the federal communications commission those in the 
other half however dont call longdistance enough to benefit 
instead their overall bill is higher 
beginning today customers will see another 60 cents added to 
their monthly local phone bill and american telephone amp telegraph 
co will drop its basic interstate longdistance rates an average of 
38 percent 
us sprint said it will drop its rates jan 1 an average 385 
percent about the same for business as for residential customers 
mci expects to announce details of a price cut next month 
atampt is able to make its 697 million annual reduction and us 
sprint and mci theirs because costs of connecting to the local 
network are being reduced by the corresponding increase in 
customers monthly bills 
with todays 60cent increase the subscriber line charge has 
risen to 320 the federal charge imposed in 1985 is designed to 
reduce the subsidy longdistance companies pay to maintain the local 
network 
a customer who makes about 520 per month in directdialed 
longdistance calls saves enough to offset the effects of the line 
charge according to james l lande in the fccs industry analysis 
division 
about half the people are at least breaking even he said 
atampt will cut its basic longdistance rates for calls traveling 
more than 124 miles by 38 percent it will make smaller cuts in 
rates for interstate calls of shorter distances which account for 
about onequarter of atampt interstate calls 
the largest among the price cuts will go to large volume users 
both residential and business 
rates for reach out america atampts longdistance calling plan 
for residential customers will be cut 49 percent 
atampt wats rates will drop 4 percent and the company will 
restructure the service to bill calls individually based on time and 
distance rather than by the current hourly pricing method this 
price reduction is to take effect jan 1 a month later than the 
others 
rates for atampts three pro wats calling plans for business 
customers will be cut 38 percent overall megacom wats rates will 
drop 47 percent and megacom 800 rates will go down 45 percent 
basic atampt 800 service prices will go down 36 percent and 
software defined network service rates will see an overall reduction 
of 62 percent

an illinois auto dealer who turned back the 
mileage of used cars he sold was the victim of the jurys 
hostility toward odometer tampering his lawyer told the us 
supreme court in arguing that the dealers mail fraud conviction was 
excessive 
the only fraud here was odometer tampering attorney peter l 
steinberg told the court wednesday saying that dealer wayne t 
schmuck of harvard ill should have been convicted of misdemeanor 
rather than felony counts 
schmuck who did business as big foot auto sales of harvard 
ill was accused in wisconsin of altering the mileage readings of 
the cars to increase their value the charges stemmed from cars sold 
wholesale to wisconsin auto dealers 
courts have held that mail fraud charges can be brought in cases 
where the mail is necessary to the success of odometer tampering 
schemes 
steinberg who practices in madison wis also said a federal 
district judge in madison erred by refusing to advise jurors they 
could have considered finding schmuck guilty of a lesser offense 
steinberg said his client should have been found guilty of 
odometer tampering a misdemeanor punishable by a 50000 fine and a 
year in prison instead he was convicted in december 1983 of 12 
counts of mail fraud a federal felony carrying a maximum penalty of 
a 1000 fine five years imprisonment or both and later was 
sentenced to 90 days in jail and four years probation 
we were the victims of the jurys hostility toward odometer 
tampering he said the feeling was hes certainly guilty we 
have to convict him of something 
we would have been happy to take 12 counts of odometer 
tampering steinberg said its a misdemeanor the fine is 
50000 thats 50 times worse than mail fraud but its only a year 
in prison 
steinberg said his client did not use the mails and instead 
handdelivered paperwork making false mileage statements on the cars 
he sold to unsuspecting auto dealers 
retail customers who bought the cars from the dealerships then 
would mail title and registration papers to the wisconsin department 
of motor vehicles and the lawyer said it was sending those 
documents which constituted fraudulent use of the mails 
is every person who tampers with an odometer going to be guilty 
of mail fraud when someone on down the line mails in a 
registration he asked 
you have to be able to point out how the mailing contributed to 
the success of the scheme steinberg said otherwise you open 
the flood gate for prosecutions 
attorney brian j martin an assistant to the us solicitor 
general argued that schmuck could not operate a fraudulent business 
successfully for two years without using the mails since his 
customers would not buy cars unless they could be registered 
the sale cannot be made without the title being sent to the 
state department of transportation martin said the sale was 
made the dealers came back for more 
the supreme court is expected to rule on the case sometime next 
year

a federal official says he approved plans to 
build two major pipelines to deliver canadian natural gas throughout 
the northeast because of an urgent and necessary requirement for 
the additional energy supplies 
curtis l wagner jr chief administrative law judge at the 
federal energy regulatory commission also said wednesday that 
timing was critical because the canadian gas would be lost to other 
markets if the projects were delayed 
the plan calls for the construction of a 3694mile pipeline from 
the uscanadian border near iroquois ontario through new york 
and connecticut across the long island sound and ending at south 
commack long island where it will be connected with existing 
pipeline from the long island lighting co 
another section of the iroquois project would be a 532mile 
pipeline loop in new york and massachusetts and a third section near 
carthage new york 
the second project the champlain pipeline would be a 3393mile 
stretch from the canadian border near philipsburg quebec through 
vermont new hampshire and massachusetts ending near west medway 
mass outside boston 
the settlement is clearly in the public interest he 
wrote there is an urgent and necessary requirement for additional 
supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of individuals and the 
economy in the new england new york and new jersey areas at the 
earliest possible date 
wagner recommended the full commission approve the plan which 
involves eight companies spokeswoman tamara youngallen said the 
earliest vote would be jan 11 
eight companies are involved in the projects they are iroquois 
gas transmission system champlain pipeline co cng transmission 
corp transcanada pipelines ltd algonquin gas transmission co 
tennessee gas pipeline co anr pipeline co and texas eastern 
transmission corp 
a connecticut environmental group the housatonic valley 
association opposed the plan as did the new england fuel institute 
and empoire state petroleum association 
wagner also approved a third project a 905 mile stretch of new 
pipeline from existing lines near muncie ind and lebanon ohio

the massachusetts institute of technology has won 
an early heat in a race to commercialize new superconductors that 
many scientists believe will eventually be used to probe the brain 
detect submarines and help find oil 
but researchers at other university and corporate laboratories 
said wednesday the race which could bring huge financial gains to 
the winner is far from over 
mit received a notice of allowability from the us patent 
office last week for the first major us patent in the field of 
hightemperature superconductors materials that conduct electricity 
with virtually no resistance 
mit officials said the notice is a strong signal that the 
institute will receive a patent within a few months for a process 
developed by two professors gregory j yurek and john b vander 
sande to make ceramic superconductors more flexible by mixing them 
with metals like gold or silver 
researchers around the world have been competing to develop and 
apply ceramic superconductors since they were discovered in january 
1986 by two scientists at an international business machines inc 
laboratory in switzerland 
the ibm scientists georg bednorz and alexander mueller won the 
1987 nobel prize in physics for their discovery that certain 
ceramics become superconductive when cooled with liquid nitrogen to 
about 300 degrees below zero fahrenheit 
previous superconductors had operated only at minus 418 degrees 
or below requiring cooling in liquid helium which is more costly 
and difficult to maintain than liquid nitrogen 
one problem with the ceramics is that they are brittle mit says 
its process greatly increases flexibility allowing the materials to 
be made into wire and wound into coils for small motors 
several other applications for patents related to ceramic 
superconductors are pending but none have been granted said oscar 
maston a spokesman for the patent office in arlington va 
bell labs and other companies and universities are working on 
processes similar to mits said paul a fleury director of 
physical research at bell labs in murray hill nj 
the mit technique is significant in that its one of the 
earliest fleury said but its still too early to tell which 
if any of these processes is going to result in a commercial 
application 
william j gallagher manager of exploratory cryogenics at ibms 
research center in yorktown heights ny said researchers can 
easily foresee using the new superconductors in devices to measure 
brainwaves locate submarines deep under the sea detect oil 
reserves and process radar signals 
but those uses are probably at least five years away gallagher 
said and many problems with superconductors will have to be solved 
first among them he said are limits to the amount of current the 
new materials can carry 
mit said it has licensed exclusive rights to its patent to a 
company founded last year by four of the institutes faculty 
members mit officials refused to disclose the terms of the 
licensing agreement with the company american superconductor corp 
of cambridge

china will delay for a year the opening of the 
socialist worlds first futures market an official daily said 
thursday 
the china daily said a futures market will be launched on a trial 
basis in central chinas henan province by the end of next year 
in may plans were announced to open a market in the southern 
city of canton by the end of 1988 but the daily said an 
investigative group under the state council chinas cabinet 
decided to put off the starting date 
chang qing senior researcher in the group said china wanted 
more time to learn from experts in hong kong and become better 
prepared 
a futures market formerly regarded in china as a form of 
capitalist speculation allows traders and producers of raw 
materials to negotiate a set price for what they think a commodity 
will be worth at a future date 
the producer is guaranteed that price regardless of subsequent 
fluctuations in the market 
the need for futures markets has arisen with the decontrol of 
prices for many commodities that has resulted in sharp price 
fluctuations produce markets in particular have been plagued by 
gluts and shortages caused by farmers inability to forecast the 
market 
the daily said the market in henan a major agriculture center 
will deal in wheat and other grains about 150 people mostly from 
henan recently gathered in beijing for a 10day training course in 
futures markets it said 
the henan market will only open prices to trading twice a week 
because of chinas backward telecommunications system it said 
if it is a success markets will be opened in jilin in the 
northeast for corn sichuan in the west for pigs and guangdong and 
hebei in the south and north for raw materials 
it said the investigative group is studying whether foreign 
businessmen will be allowed to participate in chinas futures 
markets initially only chinese will be able to take part it said

the government said today its chief forecasting 
gauge of future economic activity edged up a sluggish 01 percent in 
october after falling a month earlier 
the commerce departments index of leading indicators had 
previously been estimated as falling only 01 percent in september 
but todays report revised that downturn to minus 03 percent 
economists said the movement of the index appears to be pointing 
to slower growth but they have been hardpressed to find much sign 
of it yet 
other statistics for october the latest available all look very 
strong unemployment is at a 14year low factories are using more 
of their capacity than at any time in 8 years and personal income 
posted its steepest increase in a year 
the message is clear that the fourth quarter is starting out 
very well there are no particular imbalances and that 
suggests the economy should keep on expanding nicely for another six 
to nine months said allen sinai an economist for the boston co 
however the leading index is clearly signaling a slowdown in 
the second half of next year he said in advance of todays report 
over the last 12 months its risen only 05 percent compared with 
a gain of 60 percent for the previous 12month period it was the 
smallest octobertooctober increase since 197980 beore the last 
recession 
in october four of nine available indicators were pointing to 
faster growth while five were pointing to slower growth 
the factors pushing the index up in order of magnitude were an 
increase in building permits a rise in stock prices a jump in new 
orders to manufacturers for consumer goods and a drop in initial 
claims for state unemployment insurance 
the negative factors ordered from largest to smallest were 
faster deliveries to companies a sign of slackening demand a drop 
in the price of industrial materials a decline in the 
inflationadjusted money supply a shortening in the length of the 
average workweek and a fall in orders for business equipment 
the various changes left the index at 1930 percent of its 1967 
base of 100 
samuel d kahan an economist with kleinwort benson government 
securities inc in chicago said the indexs prediction of slower 
growth is not necessarily false 
some sort of moderation given the current bouyancy is not 
unlikely in the last half of 1989 he said however i would not 
leap to the conclusion that a recession is coming he said 
given current economic conditions a significant slowdown or 
recession wont occur until the federal reserve board pushes 
interest rates sharply higher he said 
the fed fearing that toostrong demand will push prices higher 
has been trying to slow expansion of the gross national product the 
broadest measure of the economys health to a noninflationary 2 
percent to 25 percent 
the gnp grew at a moderate 26 percent annual pace in the third 
quarter down from a 32 percent pace in the first half of 1988 
however most analysts were expecting it to pick up again in the 
first three months of next year when the negative effects from the 
summer drought are no longer acting as a drag that would put the 
economy well into the middle of its seventh year of expansion a 
peacetime record 
the leading index before falling in september rose 05 percent 
in august and fell 08 percent in july it rose 16 percent in june 
and dropped 07 percent in may 
economists caution against drawing immediate conclusions from the 
index even though since its creation in 1948 it has correctly 
predicted all eight recessions by dropping three times in a row 
however it has also falsely predicted a recession four times 
preliminary estimates of the index are often revised 
substantially in later months for instance declines were initially 
reported for five consecutive months from september 1987 through 
january but later revisions wiped out all but two of the drops

westinghouse electric corp says safety 
concerns raised by the aquino government over a nuclear reactor in 
the philippines amount to a smokescreen to disguise political 
opposition to the project begun by former president ferdinand marcos 
westinghouse officials said wednesday they expected the lawsuit 
over the 23 billion plant for which the company has been paid 
680 million as prime contractor westinghouse claims it is due 
another 20 million to 30 million 
the government of president corazon aquino announced early today 
that it had sued westinghouse in us district court in newark 
nj to cancel the contract for the 620megawatt plant which was 
finished three years ago but was never started 
westinghouse said today it petitioned the international chamber 
of commerce in paris to arbitrate the dispute as provided by the 
1976 contract 
nathaniel d woodson general manager of the westinghouse nuclear 
fuels unit and westinghouse deputy general counsel louis j 
briskman said philippine officials have acknowledged during private 
talks that no matter how safe the plant is they dont intend to 
allow nuclear power production in the country 
it has nothing to do with safety woodson said 
the government says the plant 60 miles northwest of manila in 
bataan province is unsafe partly because of its design and its 
location on an earthquake fault and near a volcano 
the reactors opponents also allege bribes were paid over the 
awarding of the prime contract for the plant 
what were finding here are the results of a political policy 
that came to life when they were running for office woodson said 
they now feel they have a political albatross around their neck 
and theyre trying to blame us 
president aquinos legal adviser adolfo azcuna said in late 
october that the suit was ready and likely would be filed within a 
month in the united states in addition a standstill agreement 
barring either the government or the company from taking legal 
action expired today 
westinghouse officials said the 10yearold controversy is an 
unfounded attack on the companys international standing as a 
designer and builder of nuclear power plants 
all over the world we have built plants and we havent had 
this problem if they dont want to operate this plant thats their 
decision but dont make westinghouse a scapegoat he said 
westinghouse will not be a scapegoat 
the company cites investigations by the us justice department 
and the securities and exchange commission which produced no 
evidence to warrant charges 
a safety study commissioned by the aquino government a draft of 
which was published by a trade journal concluded the plant is 
safe westinghouse said but the government says the final report 
concludes otherwise although philippine officials have refused to 
release the document 
communist rebels have bombed the transmission towers leading from 
the plant and people have cut and sold the copper lines as scrap 
woodson said the plants corps of operators has largely disbanded 
and westinghouse has only a handful of employees still in the 
philippines he said 
furthermore the cost of the plant continues rising westinghouse 
said interest on the loans the philippine government took to build 
the plant cost an estimated 300000 per day

churchs stock until 10 working days after it reveals information on 
which its buyout offer is made he also ordered popeyes on tuesday 
to stop using at least for now any confidential churchs 
information it may have 
churchs claims its former chief financial officer took 
confidential files with him when he went to work for copeland 
churchs announced tuesday that it was starting preliminary 
negotiations with third parties that it did not identify 
we do not understand how you can adequately explore 
alternatives available to churchs without allowing us to 
participate in such discussions on equal footing with all other 
interested parties copeland wrote the board late wednesday 
the letter said that so far churchs has said it will talk to 
copeland and let him see the documents he wants only if he signs a 
standstill agreement such agreements bind the potential buyer to a 
promise not to pursue the takeover attempt for a specific period 
usually years 
such an agreement is unnecessary copelands letter said because 
he is willing to sign a confidentiality agreement requiring that any 
further purchases of stock be made pursuant to the tender offer 
the letter also said copeland plans to go forward with his offer 
after complying with schwartz order 
and he repeated that he is willing to raise his 290 million 
8pershare bid if the nonpublic information he wants justifies a 
higher price

the rjr nabisco inc takeover war ended in 
stunning triumph for buyout specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co whose record 2453 billion agreement derailed a fatter rival 
bid by the management group that triggered the corporate 
freeforall more than a month ago 
the 109ashare offer approved by rjr directors late wednesday 
capped a day of frantic maneuvering that at times left the 
unprecedented auction for the nations 19th largest industrial 
company in utter confusion 
rjr said kohlbergs offer of 81 in cash 18 in stock and 
additional securities worth 10 beat out a lastminute offer valued 
at 112 a share or 252 billion by chief executive f ross 
johnsons management group 
although the face value of the management offer looked higher 
rjr stated that its board of directors concluded the kohlberg offer 
was worth substantially the same 
the board of directors of rjr nabisco by unanimous vote of all 
directors present adopted the kkr offer as being in the best 
interest of the company and its shareholders rjr said 
kohlberg the undisputed leader in buying companies with borrowed 
money in deals known as leveraged buyouts said it was pleased with 
the decision that ended the biggest takeover brawl in history 
the value of kohlbergs offer was nearly double that of the 
previous record a 134 billion takeover of gulf corp by chevron 
corp in march 1984 
we are also pleased that this process has come to an end so 
that the employees of rjr its consumers and suppliers and the 
communities it serves can be assured that business will now return 
to normal and stability will be restored kohlbergs two 
principals henry r kravis and george roberts said in a statement 
kohlbergs triumph raised the prospect that at least some 
businesses in one of the biggest consumer product companies might be 
sold to help the investment firm pay for the acquisition 
it gave no indication what if any of rjrs worldwide operations 
might be for sale but there was speculation that possible 
candidates included some or even all of rjrs food segments which 
would return the company to the tobacco business roots that still 
account for about 40 percent of its sales 
atlantabased rjr is one of the largest consumer products 
companies with more than 120000 employees worldwide it makes 
wellknown brands that range from camel cigarettes to shredded wheat 
cereal to life savers candy 
the size and complexity of the rjr deal has raised major 
questions about the frenzied level of leveraged buyouts and other 
debtfinanced restructurings that are transforming much of corporate 
america and whether it has gone too far 
philip morris cos inc recently agreed to acquire kraft inc for 
126 billion still pending are multibilliondollar battles over 
pillsbury co holly farms corp the nations thirdlargest poultry 
processor and textile maker west pointpepperell inc 
the rjr deal also signaled a spectacular defeat by its chief 
executive f ross johnson whose management group began the takeover 
struggle oct 20 with a 75 a share offer that was later raised five 
times 
his tenure at the company remained uncertain however the 
atlanta constitution reported today that kohlberg would install 
rjrs former chairman and chief executive officer j paul sticht 
in the top post for a few months to smooth the transition the 
newspaper said kohlberg would move the companys corporate 
headquarters back to winstonsalem nc 
it also wasnt clear as of late wednesday whether johnson a 
scrappy daring adversary would try to reopen what already has 
proven to be an extremely unpredictable battle the new york times 
quoted him in todays editions as saying i am proud of the fact 
that we put the best bid on the table the first time and this time 
shearson lehman hutton inc one of johnsons key financial 
partners said in a statemet today from what we know our bid was 
the best we are mystified about the process and the standards that 
the board used to reach its decision we are going to continue to 
keep our options open 
earlier in the day wednesday johnsons group made an effort to 
raise its bid after a companydecreed deadline for all offers had 
expired the move temporarily upended a 106ashare 238 billion 
kohlberg kravis offer that the rjr board was about to approve 
that development made the already unwieldy auction even more 
chaotic and raised questions about whether all bidders were getting 
equal treatment it also sent rjrs stock 225 higher wednesday in 
frenzied new york stock exchange trading to 93 a share on the 
possibility the auction would be prolonged in early trading today 
rjr was off 75 cents to 9225 a share 
sources familiar with the bidding said the offer of a third 
contender first boston corp was rejected as too tentative 
although the bidder valued it as high as 115 a share or 2587 
billion 
a crucial element of each proposal was the portion of cash eang homes 
said the report is misleading it is going to confuse the 
public by making it appear conditions are worse than they are he 
said that something like a cracked egg in a refrigerator could lead 
to a nursing home failing to meet a care standard 
but elma holder executive director of the national citizens 
coalition on nursing home reform said we think the national 
statistics are misleading conditions are worse

construction spending rose 09 percent its heftiest increase in 
three months with widespread gains reported in housing government 
and commercial building the government reported today 
in a separate report the commerce department said its chief 
forecasting gauge of future economic activity rose a tiny 01 
percent in october after falling a month earlier 
building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
4092 billion in october following a 07 percent increase in 
september and a 02 percent rise in august it was the best showing 
since a 15 percent jump in july 
but despite the recent increases construction activity has been 
modest this year advancing 21 percent in the past 12 months 
taking a 17 percent rise in construction costs into account 
activity increased only 04 percent over the past 12 months 
the commerce departments index of leading indicators had 
previously been estimated as falling only 01 percent in september 
but todays report revised that downturn to minus 03 percent 
the leading index before edging down in september rose 05 
percent in august and fell 07 percent in july after dropping in may 
economists said the movement of the index appears to be pointing 
to slower growth but they have been hardpressed to find much sign 
of it lately other statistics for october the latest available 
have been strong including one showing unemployment at a 14year 
low 
on wednesday the commerce department reported that personal 
income increased 18 percent the biggest rise since october 1987 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 418 trillion last month 
the gain followed modest increases of 05 percent in september 
and 04 percent in august 
the numbers raised some concerns about inflation but a separate 
report to the federal reserve board indicated the economy was 
slowing down 
in a review of the economy based on assessments from the 12 
regional federal reserve banks the fed reported an apparently 
slower pace of growth moderate wage increases and slightly eased 
price pressures in several manufacturing industries 
financial markets rallied interpreting the report as a signal 
that fed members were less worried about inflation than previously 
thought and therefore less likely to boost interest rates 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 1298 to 
211451 giving the wellknown barometer a gain of nearly 40 points 
over the past three sessions 
the government attributed about half of last months increase in 
income to farm subsidy payments and bonuses to auto workers 
however excluding those factors income still would have risen a 
hefty 09 percent 
this throws cold water on the view the economy slowed down 
much said john hagens an economist with the wefa group a bala 
cynwyd pa forecasting firm it may have taken a bit of a pause 
in august and september but it came roaring back in october 
the concern in financial markets has been that growth is too 
strong high levels of employment will lead to higher wages and 
strong consumer demand will lead to higher prices they fear 
personal consumption spending which includes everything except 
interest payments on debt was up a robust 08 percent to an annual 
rate of 330 trillion following a weak 01 percent rise in 
september 
the biggest spending increase last month was for services up 14 
percent followed by a 06 percent increase for nondurable goods 
spending on durable goods big ticket items expected to last 
three or more years fell 06 percent 
with income rising faster than spending americans saved more 
than in any month since october 1987 the personal savings rate 
savings as a percentage of aftertax income was 52 percent up 
from 42 percent in september 
disposable or aftertax income was up 19 percent last month 
also the largest increase in a year after rising 06 percent a 
month earlier

chicagobased farley inc today extended 
for a second time its 14 billion tender offer for georgiabased 
west pointpepperell inc 
the offer was to expire at midnight wednesday but a farley 
statement said it was being extended by one week to midnight est 
dec 7 
the company also announced that a preliminary count showed about 
114 million shares of pepperells common stock had been tendered by 
stockholders as of the close of business wednesday with the shares 
farley already owns that would give the company about 49 percent of 
pepperells stock it said 
farley officials have declined to say how much of the georgia 
companys stock they hope to acquire 
we are pleased with the results of the tender offer to date 
and believe they reflect the shareholders increasing interest and 
confidence in our proposal to acquire west pointpepperell said 
william farley chairman of the chicagobased company we are 
confident our offer will succeed despite the efforts by pepperell 
management to impede it 
pepperells stock was up 112 a share to 40 on the new york 
stock exchange wednesday 
farley the chicagobased maker of fruit of the loom underwear 
originally set nov 21 as the deadline for its 48pershare offer 
for the textile company based in west point the deadline was 
extended to midnight wednesday as farley attempted to overcome some 
of the antitakeover obstacles set up by pepperell 
pepperell and farley have done battle in court over pepperells 
poison pill shareholder rights plan designed to thwart hostile 
takeovers 
last week the 11th us circuit court of appeals denied 
pepperells motion to reinstate certain key provisions of the plan 
which were thrown out earlier by a us district court judge 
the appeals court scheduled a hearing the week of jan 9 to 
determine the final fate of the poison pill plan farleys offer 
is contingent on getting the plan overturned 
also being argued in the courts is the constitutionality of 
georgias antitakeover statute which farley is seeking to 
overturn that issue is now in the hands of us district judge g 
ernest tidwell of atlanta who has not set a hearing date if the 
law is upheld farleys bid cannot go through

the miracle on 34th street is more than just 
a movie to postal workers who have borrowed the slogan to describe 
how thousands of people are helped each year when they write to 
santa 
over the past years weve had a number of startling 
successes said postmaster john m nolan noting that families 
have been reunited through the letters and one person received an 
eye operation every year we kind of have a miracle on 34th 
street here new yorks main post office is a massive 
neoclassical building on eighth avenue with its north side on 34th 
street 
the post office kicked off this years campaign wednesday 
although 4000 of an expected 18000 letters to santa from the less 
fortunate around the world have already been received 
last year more than 16000 letters to santa from about 10 
countries many addressed to the north pole and bearing a new york 
zip code ended up at the main post offices dead letter unit good 
samaritans answered about 14000 of them nolan said 
new york postal employees with the publics help have been 
granting christmas wishes for 60 years 
i dont believe in you but my teacher says i have to write you 
a letter anyway confessed mark who lives in a manhattan welfare 
hotel for christmas could you please bring my mother a coat 
my teacher gave her one but it didnt fit 
my husband is a junkie and he left us with nothing wrote a 
mother of three in brooklyn so i left him and moved in with my 
mom and dad its embarrassing enough that i cant afford to get my 
kids anything 
i budget for one meal a day said a bronx woman who is 
raising three children and a grandchild on a salary of 235 an 
hour it drives me crazy sometimes and i feel like the world wants 
to come down 
we dont vouch for the exact accuracy or need said nolan 
but he feels most of the letters are legitimate 
about 25 gradeschool children many of them welfare hotel 
residents chatted with santa during a news conference to launch the 
volunteer drive 
ellen hernandez 9 said she wanted a baby girl for 
christmas santa doesnt give baby girls we can give you a baby

said he couldnt make such a promise 
volunteers can get letters to answer by calling writing or going 
to the main post office

futures prices of grain and soybeans opened 
modestly lower today on the chicago board of trade with most of the 
selling due to technical factors analysts said 
the market seems to be pretty fickle right now said steve 
freed a grain market analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago 
but some observers also linked the decline to recurring rumors 
that the agriculture department may delay offering subsidized us 
wheat to the soviet union 
the soviets have agreed to purchase 9 million metric tons of us 
grain including 4 million tons of wheat this year and next year 
under an agreement signed monday 
the soviets have purchased no wheat for delivery in the current 
marketing year and the usda has not offered them wheat since the 
signing of the grain deal as the agency had been expected to do 
in early trading wheat was 2 cents to 5 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 420 a bushel corn was 1 cent 
lower to cent higher with december at 260 a bushel oats were 
1 cents to 2 cents lower with december at 194 a bushel soybeans 
were 1 cent to 5 cents lower with january at 760 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on 
the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 10 cent lower to 20 cent higher with december 
at 7232 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 28 cent 
higher with january at 8270 cents a pound live hogs were 02 cent 
lower to 35 cent higher with december at 4002 cents a pound

the stock market drifted mostly lower today as 
investors awaited the november employment statistics due to be 
released friday for an indication of the strength of the economy 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks up 1298 points on 
wednesday and nearly 40 points over the past three sessions was 
down 427 at 211024 at noon on wall street 
declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of 7 to 5 among 
issues listed on the new york stock exchange with 528 up 752 down 
and 504 unchanged 
big board volume amounted to 5989 million shares at noontime 
compared with 6078 million shares at the same point in wednesdays 
session 
the market rallied in the previous session on indications that 
the economy may be growing at a more moderate pace 
that presumably would mean that the federal reserve policymakers 
who meet in middecember may not feel compelled to encourage higher 
interest rates to restrain growth and inflation 
but the market was looking toward fridays report on november 
employment for confirmation of economic growth trends 
charles jensen an analyst for mki securities corp said todays 
decline in prices reflected some precautionary selling on the part 
of traders who dont want to be caught long if the employment 
figures are negative 
he said the consensus estimate calls for payroll growth of about 
250000 and said that a number above 275000 would be 
disappointing because it would increase pressure on the central 
bank to encourage higher interest rates 
rising interest rates hurt stock prices because they make yields 
on fixedincome investments such as treasury bills relatively more 
attractive compared with the riskier returns on stocks 
in a new report today the government said its chief forecasting 
gauge of future economic activity edged up a sluggish 01 percent in 
october after falling by a revised 03 percent in september 
rjr nabisco was off 1 at 91 and was the most active stock this 
morning on the nyse the company said late wednesday it had accepted 
an offer of 109 a share in cash and securities from buyout 
specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co spurning a competing offer 
from a management group 
american telephone amp telegraph co was also active it was down 
at 29 after saying it will take a 67 billion charge against its 
fourthquarter earnings to cover expenses related to getting rid of 
outdated telephone equipment 
general cinema was up 1 at 23 it announced it had tentatively 
agreed to sell its softdrink bottling business to pepsico inc for 
15 billion pepsico was down 1 at 39

more than 40 percent of nursing homes failed to 
meet sanitary standards for food and nearly 30 percent failed to 
meet standards for maintaining residents personal cleanliness 
according to the federal governments first consumer guide to 
nursing homes released today 
the survey also found that more than onefourth of the nursing 
homes do not administer drugs properly 
however dr william l roper chief of the health care financing 
administration that compiled and released the statistics cautioned 
against reading more into the figures than is warranted 
this is not the ultimate report card for nursing homes around 
the country roper told reporters 
he said the metunmet criteria for each of the 32 categories 
included in the statebystate reports contains no measure of 
severity and represented a onetime snapshot of conditions at 
the nursing homes most recent unannounced inspection to some 
degree he said it relied on the subjective judgment of the 
inspector 
at the same time roper defended release of the report against 
industry criticism that it would mislead consumers 
one complaint was for example that a nursing home might be 
given an unmet mark on proper administration of medication if 
one patient was five minutes late getting his or her medicine 
if one person was five minutes late im sure they would not 
have been dinged in the survey roper said what were looking 
at what the surveyors look at is the pattern of care over time 
we are not in the business of making arbitrary bureaucratic 
judgments we are trying to evaluate what is really happening to 
people in that nursing home 
he added 
what we are looking for is not nursing home providers that 
barely scrape by were looking for people who are good providers 
consistently over time 365 days a year and i have to believe that 
if thats where a nursing home operator has his or her nursing home 
they are not going to be worried about being dinged on some trivial 
point 
the 75volume guide shows how each of the 15000 nursing homes 
fared on 32 health safety and care standards based on periodic 
inspections by state agencies about 2400 of the 15000 received 
passing marks in all 32 categories 
the report had been scheduled for release next week but copies 
were distributed earlier to various state and local agencies as 
well as to consumer groups when the embargo was broken hcfa issued 
the massive guide immediately 
roper said all the information had been available at the state 
level if people had been willing to work hard enough to get it 
but that hcfa felt it was worthwile to compile it in a single report 
according to the survey nearly 43 percent of the homes failed to 
meet sanitary standards for food almost 30 percent failed to meet 
standards for maintaining residents personal cleanliness and 29 
percent failed to administer drugs according to doctors orders 
however the report also said that only a small percentage of the 
nursing homes failed to meet standards in many other categories 
overall among skilled homes the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in 
only 10 categories 
paul willging executive vice president of the american health 
care association which represents more than 9000 nursing homes 
said the report is misleading it is going to confuse the 
public by making it appear conditions are worse than they are he 
said that something like a cracked egg in a refrigerator could lead 
to a nursing home failing to meet a care standard 
but elma holder executive director of the national citizens 
coalition on nursing home reform said we think the national 
statistics are misleading conditions are worse

the british upperclasses got a tart reminder the 
other day of how far theyve fallen on the ladder of national 
priorities 
it came in a speech by nicholas ridley environment secretary in 
the conservative government and concerned one of the very pillars 
of british aristocracy the stately home 
addressing the historic houses association on nov 22 ridley 
delivered a blunt message on these lines if you cant afford the 
upkeep of your stately home dont ask the government for help sell 
it to the nouveaux riches 
the speech which brought ripples of reproach from the landed 
gentry was another sign of how the old britain has been transformed 
the conservative party once topheavy with squires and knights of 
the shires today is peopled with the likes of ridley a civil 
engineer and prime minister margaret thatcher the daughter of a 
chemist and a grocer 
things have changed drastically since 1938 when noel coward 
wrote 
the stately homes of england 
how beautiful they stand 
to prove the upper classes 
still have the upper hand 
the postworld war ii labor party government intent on fostering 
socialist egalitarianism imposed massive taxation on inherited 
wealth forcing many owners to turn their stately homes over to the 
public 
the homes became museums while the owners moved into small 
corners of the estate by one estimate the number of major stately 
homes occupied by one family shrank from 10000 to 2000 
ridley recalled the days when governments to preserve historic 
mansions for the nation had to pay simply to keep roofs on and 
walls standing 
but after a decade of thatcherism he said things have 
changed everywhere we see the new prosperity millionaires abound 
and there are many more budding ones called yuppies 
yet he was still hearing cries from some quarters for more 
rather than less state help that he said was out 
there have to be some opportunities for todays nouveaux 
riches so i am not impressed by the case of the anciens pauvres 
he said 
nor was he impressed by noble lineages many families who pride 
themselves on having always lived in a house in fact married into 
it bought it or stole it at some point in their murky history when 
they were robber barons property speculators or simply won the 
pools 
ridleys blunt talk drew some testy responses 
rightwing commentator roger scruton suggested that as the second 
son of noble family ridley 59 suffered from the british 
affliction of younger son syndrome a resentment born of 
primogeniture whereby the firstborn inherits the title and estate 
while the others must fend for themselves 
in the conservative daily telegraph james leesmilne called 
ridleys remarks totally unwarranted arguing that stately 
families were doing a service to conservation by staying on their 
land 
hugh montgomerymassingberd author of a guide to british country 
houses says the problem is not with the larger homes which can 
easily be turned into moneyspinning public attractions but the 
smaller homes whose owners are hardpressed to survive 
the families that are still in their homes have a lot of 
influence and do a lot of good he said in an interview 
they feel greater responsibility for their tenant farmers and 
hold unpaid public posts like high sheriff and justice of the peace 
i wonder whether the nouveaux riches who use these places as 
weekend pads to impress their friends would be willing to take on 
these responsibilities he said 
also he said the attraction of country homes is their valuable 
furnishings historic collections that risk being broken up and sold

his name is not as familiar as chief 
executive f ross johnson or buyout specialist henry kravis but as 
the key decisionmaker in historys largest corporate takeover 
charles e hugel held the fate of both dealmakers in his hands 
the 60yearold hugel is chairman and chief executive officer of 
his own 3 billion company combustion engineering inc of stamford 
but he also serves as nonexecutive chairman of the board of rjr 
nabisco inc and head of rjrs fivemember special directors 
committee 
in the latter role he was responsible for choosing a winner in 
the nations biggest and wildest corporate bidding war which 
produced an apparent triumph for kravis and his buyout firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co late wednesday 
kraviss muchrevised bid of 2453 billion for rjr nabisco was 
chosen over a competing offer from a johnsonled management group 
in the eye of the hurricane whipped up by the bidding stood the 
unassuming hugel who is described by those who know him as an 
innovative businessman who quietly tackles goals that some will only 
talk about 
for instance he was one of the first american businessmen to 
negotiate a major deal with the soviet union 
in june combustion engineering announced it had reached an 
agreement to help build and manage a multibilliondollar 
petrochemical complex in two western siberian cities it was the 
companys second deal with the soviet union in six months 
hugel also has previous experience in the merger and acquisition 
wars as a director of primerica corp a greenwich connbased 
financial services giant sold earlier this year to commercial credit 
corp in a cashandstock deal valued at 165 billion 
a former executive vice president of american telephone and 
telegraph co and former president of ohio bell telephone co hugel 
was regarded as neutral in the nabisco battle because he is 
nonexecutive chairman which means he is not an employee of the 
company 
when he took the nabisco post he became the only fortune 500 
company chairman also serving as chief executive officer and 
chairman of another major firm 
the role of his special committee was critical to the future of 
the atlantabased food and tobacco conglomerate the committee was 
criticized by some on wall street for adding to the confusion of the 
bidding process by extending the deadline for bids to nov 29 and 
even then the deadline proved meaningless since both principal 
bidders upped their offers well after the time limit 
but for hugel and the committee it was a finely calculated risk 
by extending the bidding hugel hoped to maximize the offers for the 
company and the return to shareholders 
while deadlines were abused the extensions may have spared the 
company some future litigation from shareholders complaining they 
didnt get the best deal possible 
still the one goal that eluded hugel was orderliness the 
auction was confused and rife with personality clashes to the end 
and in a final cruel twist of fate hugel and the committee 
decided to spurn their own management team led by johnson in favor 
of the outside buyout specialists 
raised by a single mother during the depression hugel served a 
stint in the army and started at atampt as a student engineer he said 
teamwork is a key part of his management philosophy 
i worked at atampt for 30 years and at atampt you learn how to 
delegate to good people and how to build teamwork he said in a 
recent interview 
a business associate said he is sure hugels experience was an 
asset at the negotiating table while the rjr deal was being worked 
out 
he is a very practical businessman and a hard worker said 
primerica chairman gerald tsai jr if he has a goal he gets it 
charlie was the first in america with this size contract with 
the soviet union he was very persistent and he finally got it 
hugel is straightforward tsai said if he says something 
you can bank on it 
several wall street analysts declined to talk about hugel during 
the rjr negotiations one who spoke on condition of anonymity was 
critical of hugels management of combustion engineering 
hes running ce into the ground the analyst said the 
costs are out of sight hes getting his comeuppance 
i think he ought to stay in ce more he said its tough 
enough to run one company well hes spending his time handling 
nabisco 
combustion engineering which builds and services 
powergenerating systems for utilities supplies equipment to 
chemical and refining industries and operates wastetoenergy plants 
recently announced a loss of 629 million in its revised 
ninemonth results 
the company said the results were due to increases in estimated 
costs to complete its wastetoenergy plants cost overruns and 
repair costs 
despite those problems some analysts predict improvement in the 
companys fortunes next year combustion engineering is in the 
process of selling off 285 million in assets and will be able to 
use the cash to reduce its debt and interest expenses 
with low demand for new power plants hugel has steered the 
company in the direction of maintenance and service where revenues 
are expected to grow 
hugel has been upbeat about his business decisions in the past 
in the 1987 annual report he told combustion engineering 
shareholders that the company had made considerable progress 
toward becoming a new and different company 
hugel is also a member of the boards of directors of eaton corp 
and pitney bowes inc and chairman of the board of trustees of 
lafayette college his alma mater

winstonsalem nc ap when 2 billion from the buyout of rjr 
nabisco inc hits winstonsalem the people who sell jewels cars 
and houses for a living hope to be busy 
analysts estimate that 9000 people in winstonsalem former 
headquarters of the food and tobacco giant own 1 billion worth of 
stock in the company and that local trusts foundations and 
retirement plans own another 1 billion 
the estimates are based on a stock price of 100 a share the 
company was auctioned off wednesday to buyout specialists kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co in a deal worth about 109 a share to 
stockholders in cash and securities 
when local shareholders receive their share of the proceeds it 
could make for a very merry christmas for area merchants 
thomas winstead the general manager of hanes mall said that 
unlike retailers in other parts of the country merchants at his 
mall have seen strong sales so far in the christmas shopping season 
money from the buyout could only make it better 
the merchants of hanes mall as well as other retailers in this 
area are prepared to serve with whatever the stockholders need 
winstead said do i sound reserved enough 
winstead said the people who have seen their stock climb by 37 a 
share over the past six weeks might well wish to make 
celebrationtype purchases of luxury items when their checks 
arrive 
at windsor jewelers in downtown winstonsalem lois simon said 
she has already noticed an influx of customers who dont look like 
the usual clientele for expensive jewelry 
these are definitely not typical of the clientele that would be 
pricing our emeralds and diamonds mrs simon said she said she 
assumes the prospective customers are scouting out purchases they 
could make with the proceeds from the sale of their rjr nabisco 
stock 
the company moved its headquarters to atlanta last year but 
maintains the core of its tobacco operations here 
tim a cooper sales manager at a mercedes dealership said he 
hasnt yet seen any customers who are eager to put down their rjr 
profits on a new mercedes 
but he added i hope we do see some increase in traffic due to 
that 
two local realtors frank frye and bruce hubbard said some rjr 
investors may put their proceeds into new homes 
what i see happening is what anyone would see if you have a 
rich uncle die frye said i think a lot of people will take 
awhile but theyll eventually look at upgrading their living 
standards 
but economists at two local universities said the windfall 
probably wont spawn a huge spending spree in winstonsalem 
donald frey an economics professor at wake forest university 
said many investors and especially large institutions will 
probably just reinvest their money 
most people arent going to confuse it with income he said 
they would say these are assets that i worked to create so im 
not going to go out and blow it on a vacation 
he said employees of subsidiary rj reynolds tobacco co who are 
worried about the future of their jobs will probably be careful 
about how they use the money from the sale of their company 
not all of that spending will take place immediately and not 
all of it will take place in winston said g donald jud a 
professor of finance at the university of north carolina at 
greensboro

some of the worlds bestknown food brands may 
ultimately be sold and spending on marketing and new product 
development may be cut as a result of the 245 billion buyout of 
rjr nabisco inc analysts said thursday 
but the analysts said they cannot predict whether retail prices 
will go up or consumers will find it harder to locate their favorite 
snacks until it becomes clear who winds up with specific products 
many analysts expect the apparent winner in the buyout battle a 
group led by the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co will 
be forced to sell chunks of the company to meet interest payments on 
the huge debt that will be incur in making the purchase 
ive got to assume they will sell a lot of the foods 
operations said neal kaplan the food and tobacco analyst for the 
investment firm interstatejohnson lane in charlotte nc 
he said kohlberg kravis probably would keep the tobacco company 
because of the strong cash flow it generated and then sell stock to 
the public later to raise money 
officials of kohlberg kravis could not be reached for comment on 
their plans for rjr nabisco a spokeswoman speaking on condition 
that she not be identified said the firm had said repeatedly it 
wanted to keep the company as intact as possible and avoid 
massive selling of all the food operations 
but kaplan and other analysts said the debt costs would make it 
all but certain that the new owners would be forced to sell some key 
operations such as nabiscos cookie and cracker business its 
candy cereal and snack foods interests or its del monte canned 
vegetable and tropical fruits divisions 
david goldman the food and tobacco analyst for fahnestock amp co 
estimated the new owners could get 8 billion for either the nabisco 
foods business or the reynolds tobacco business 4 billion to 7 
billion for del monte and 800 million to 12 billion for the 
planters nuts and life savers candy business 
the list of buyers who analysts cite as potential buyers of parts 
of the nabisco operations include the biggest names in consumer 
products procter amp gamble ralstonpurina quaker oats pepsico 
and borden 
john maxwell food and tobacco analyst for wheat first securities 
in richmond va said procter amp gamble for instance might be 
keenly interested in nabiscos readytoeat cookie business 
nabiscos cookie brands include oreo chips ahoy and fig newton and 
it also owns ritz crackers 
he said ralston or quaker might be interested in adding nabiscos 
shredded wheat to their line of cereals while pepsico and borden 
might want planters nuts to expand their own snack food operations 
whether or not major assets are sold goldman said the new 
owners will have to cut corners to meet debt payments 
you could see some modest reductions in advertising and other 
marketing tools such as couponing and consumer promotions he said 
rjr nabisco was for fifth largest national advertiser in 1987 
spending nearly 840 million in support of both its food and tobacco 
businesses last year according to the trade journal advertising age 
goldman expects a sharp decline in new product introductions 
because you just dont have the latitude for loss that you had as 
an ongoing company 
martin friedman editor of gormans new product news said less 
than 1 percent of the 11000 new food and drug products this year 
will produce the level of national sales that major companies 
generally consider a success 
gary stibel a partner in the marketing firm new england 
consulting group in westport conn said the prospects for any 
given line of food products rests entirely with the group that 
ultimately ends up owning them 
companies that buy a product line to expand their existing share 
of markets generally spend heavily to promote them and may raise 
prices he said 
but companies that buy a product line in hopes of selling it 
later for a profit may be more apt to cut promotional spending and 
try to live off the lines reputation as long as possible he said 
the fallout from the rjr nabisco buyout would no necessarily be 
limited to the food operations fahnestocks goldman said 
he said the buyout could mean an early end to rjr nabiscos 
twomonth test of its smokeless cigarette premier which delivers 
nicotine like a cigarette without much of the smoke 
the premier appeared to be a dead product to begin with 
consumer aceptanmce of the product has been dismal health 
authorities have been rallying against it goldman said 
he said the new owners might decide to spare themselves the legal 
costs that might be needed to defend the product against legal 
challenges 
premier will become the edsel of 1988 he predicted 
referring to the automobile that proved a costly failure

as this weeks deadline for final bids approached 
rjr nabisco incs f ross johnson told a reporter for time 
magazine if i fail im on the hook 
that worstcase scenario nows faces the onceconfident chief 
executive whose management team launched a bidding war six weeks 
ago in hopes of taking the nations 19th largest industrial company 
private 
johnsons group apparently lost out to buyout specialists 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co on wednesday after running up the 
price tag for the food and tobacco company to more than 24 billion 
for johnson it was a stunning defeat that contrasts sharply to 
his quick rise to the top of the food and tobacco conglomerate 
also at stake were immense financial rewards under his initial 
bid johnson stood to make 100 million 
whats worse a corporate takeover by outsiders can mean 
unemployment for a target companys top management and a kohlberg 
kravis buyout of rjr nabisco makes it unlikely johnson will stay 
there for long 
but the turmoil that generally accompanies takeovers hasnt 
stopped the 56yearold johnson before on his path from canadas 
prairies to the riches and celebrity that accompany leadership in 
the upper echelons of corporate america 
as the youngest chairman and chief executive officer ever to head 
standard brands inc johnson made the packagedgoods company an 
enticing target for a 1981 takeover by nabisco inc 
he got the top post at the newlycreated company three years 
later when robert schaerberle nabiscos chief executive officer 
took early retirement under johnsons leadership an increasingly 
profitable nabisco caught the eye of rj reynolds inc which 
acquired the food company for 49 billion in 1985 
again johnson did not immediately get the top management job 
but rjrs board presented it to him the following year 
his willingness to take risks with his own job has contributed to 
johnsons reputation as an aggressive executive with an uncanny 
intuition and lightning responses 
he operates from the gut and makes some large decisions from 
the gut said stanley katz whose fcbleber katz partners handles 
some rjr advertising 
johnson had been rjr nabiscos chief executive just 15 days when 
he announced the company was moving its headquarters from 
winstonsalem nc home for over a century to its central tobacco 
division to atlanta 
on day 16 he announced the sale of rjrs heublein liquor and 
wine business for 12 billion kentucky fried chicken canada dry 
and more than two dozen other operations also went on the block 
later as johnson focused the company on packaged food and tobacco 
early plans to sell the tobacco division were canceled as it 
became clear that cigarettes remained a profitable business and 
johnsons previously announced plans to reorganize the company 
internally to boost its stock price were canceled in midoctober 
when philip morris cos inc offered nearly 12 billion for kraft 
inc 
johnsons leveraged buyout proposal for rjr nabisco came soon 
after amid a wave of takeovers aimed at food companies such as his 
when an opportunity hits you got to hit he once told the 
atlanta journalconstitution punctuating his remark with a boxers 
jab 
once he decides to make a move he makes it said longtime 
associate robert j carbonell he likes to speak in terms of 
quantum leaps in achieving competitive advantages 
johnson was born in winnipeg manitoba and earned a degree in 
commerce at the university of manitoba while serving as president of 
his fraternity and a member of the basketball team 
he paid his own way to toronto after graduation to accept a job 
with general electric of canada during his 12 years there he went 
to night school to earn a masters degree in business administration 
after six years with two other companies working in retail and 
as an executive he joined standard brands in 1971 
johnson likes to say if you dont take risks you cant 
compete the fruits of his risktaking show in his jaguar his 
corporate jet his homes in manhattan atlanta and florida his golf 
games with bob hope and gerald ford his friendships with frank 
gifford and don meredith he steers clear of the social scene but 
appears at companysponsored benefits 
he has a very strong aversion to two things bureaucracy and 
incompetency carbonell told the atlanta newspapers he does not 
tolerate incompetency hes demanding and you better deliver you 
never want to let ross down

stock prices drifted lower today in a lackluster 
performance restrained by anticipation of fridays release of 
november employment statistics 
the market had rallied earlier this week on indications that the 
economy may be growing at a more moderate pace 
that presumably would mean that the federal reserve policymakers 
who meet in middecember may not feel compelled to encourage higher 
interest rates to restrain growth and inflation 
but analysts said trading slowed today as investors looked toward 
fridays report on november employment for confirmation of economic 
growth trends 
if the report shows strongerthanexpected job growth some 
market watchers expect the fed may feel obliged to encourage higher 
interest rates 
rising interest rates hurt stock prices because they make yields 
on fixedincome investments such as treasury bills relatively more 
attractive compared with the risks inherent in owning stocks

american telephone amp telegraph co said thursday 
it will post the first annual loss in its 103year history as a 
result of a 67 billion pretax charge that covers the costs of 
scrapping outdated equipment and moving retiring or laying off 
16000 employees 
wall street saw the giant charge as a sign that atampt was moving 
aggressively to cut costs and install a new digital network to meet 
the competition the stock was fairly stable falling 50 cents to 
2937 a share in consolidated new york stock exchange trading 
the charge will not affect atampts cash flow its ability to pay 
dividends or the money available for investment 
this reflects the adjustment of going from a regulated 
marketplace to a competitive marketplace said robert morris iii 
a san franciscobased analyst for goldman sachs amp co 
atampt said the charge would reduce its aftertax profits by 39 
billion that makes it likely that the company will lose about 16 
billion in all of 1988 and 33 billion in the fourth quarter alone 
the only larger quarterly losses in us history were atampts own 
487 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 1983 which involved a 
charge to prepare for the bell system breakup and texaco incs 
476 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 1987 stemming from its 
legal fight with pennzoil co 
longdistance phone companies have been moving aggressively to 
replace their oldfashioned analog equipment with new digital 
equipment that provides higher quality and is better suited to 
custom services and transmission of computer data 
the bulk of the charge 50 billion is to reflect on the books 
the lower value of outdated analog network equipment the remaining 
17 billion is for the costs of removing the outdated equipment 
writedowns in the value of related equipment and reductions in 
employment 
atampt said it would reduce the number of its network employees by 
10000 and the number of its operators by 6000 over the next few 
years 
atampt does not yet know how many of the employees will be given 
jobs elsewhere in the company because that depends on the companys 
growth spokeswoman luann gardner said 
the communications workers of america the union representing 
135000 atampt workers issued a statement saying nonmanagement 
employees have suffered the loss of 78500 jobs since 1984 while 
management ranks have risen by 13600 
this company just has not bitten the bullet it has not come 
out of its monopoly cocoon levels of management the union said 
atampt spokesman burke stinson responded that the company had to 
hire whitecollar workers because of its new thrusts into computers 
and foreign markets but he said were not blind to the fact 
that staff jobs need to be cut 
atampt has a freeze on hiring over most of the company that gives 
the displaced employees a better chance to find work elsewhere 
within the company than if they had to face competition from new 
hires 
plans to reduce 3000 of the network jobs and all 6000 of the 
operator service jobs had already been announced to employees atampt 
said the company is setting aside 400 million to cover the cost of 
redeploying them or giving them payments or incentives related to 
separation from the company by retirement or resignation 
the job cuts are possible because improvements in the network 
reduce the need for maintenance engineering service order 
processing and call handling operators at new stations are able to 
handle 25 percent more calls per hour the company said 
atampt has switched over to a digital network far more rapidly than 
it had previously planned 
the company predicted early in 1987 that it would take until the 
year 2010 to have an alldigital network by the end of 1987 it said 
it could do the job by 1991 on thursday it said it could do the 
job by the end of next year 
mci communications corp and us sprint communications co the 
no 2 and no 3 competitors in long distance have also moved 
rapidly to put in digital networks and have taken big charges to 
write down the book value of their outdated analog equipment 
executives of atampt had said in october that writedowns in the 
fourth quarter could be substantial by taking the pain of the 
writedown all at once atampt no longer has to lower its quarterly 
profits to reflect the costs of depreciating the older equipment 
we view this as very positive news ms gardner said our 
network will continue to be the best out there 
atampt took a 10 billion pretax charge at the end of 1983 to 
prepare for the divestiture of its local telephone companies it 
also took pretax charges of 200 million in 1985 and 32 billion 
at the end of 1986 
atampt has reduced employment by 64000 since the breakup of the 
bell system on jan 1 1984 it has about 310000 employees now and 
that could drop to below 300000 over the next three to five years 
ms gardner said 
as large as the job cuts are securities analysts said they could 
be even larger 
they have grossly too many people at the time of divestiture 
a lot of people were unloaded onto them said james mccabe an 
analyst at nomura securities international inc he said the cuts 
have occurred gradually because theyre a very humane employer 
the communications workers of america said atampt had originally 
indicated it had a surplus of 12000 to 14000 operators and that 
the union bargained the company down to 6000 
stinson said the thrust of the statement was correct but atampt 
could not confirm the unions numbers

when the managers of rjr nabisco inc aligned 
themselves with a competing investment house and put the company in 
play it didnt take long to flush out henry kravis the master of 
wall streets buyout game 
six weeks after jumping into the fray to protect his 
franchise on leveraged buyouts king henry is still on top 
at 44 kravis is the highest profile member of the partnership of 
kohlberg kravis amp roberts co which is credited with making the 
leveraged buyout technique a powerful factor in the biggest takeover 
binge in american history 
the partnerships apparent victory in the unprecedented auction 
for rjr nabisco with a bid exceeding 245 billion joins other 
crown jewels in kohlberg kraviss expanding showcase of corporate 
acquisitions 
before the food and tobacco gem came beatrice cos for 61 
billion in 1986 safeway stores inc for 42 billion the same 
year storer communications inc for 25 billion in 1985 and stop 
amp shop cos for 12 billion in 1988 among others 
kohlberg kravis is the undisputed leader in lbos in which it and 
other investors put up a small amount of money and borrows the rest 
repaying the debt with the acquired companys earnings the sale of 
assets or both 
in the past 10 years kravis has spent more than 38 billion 
acquiring about 35 companies investors in the firms growing lbo 
investment fund have earned about 40 percent returns in the process 
and kohlberg kravis has become manager of a huge conglomerate 
the man at the top of the heap of all that debt and power is 
kravis an oklahoma boy who has found a home on wall street and the 
social circles of manhattan 
married to a glamorous fashion designer carolyne roehm kravis 
lives a life straight out of tom wolfes novel the bonfire of the 
vanities while he works incessantly he finds time to dash out to 
key dates on the party circuit and entertain guests at his 
connecticut estate where rumor has it the smell of freshbaked 
croissants is piped into the guestrooms every morning 
its a highvoltage existence his wife said in an interview 
with newsweek magazine earlier this year 
at work kravis was the protege of jerome kohlberg who left the 
fold last year after a falling out with kravis and george roberts 
the other major partner the principal point of disagreement between 
kohlberg and his partners was the size of deals the firm should 
pursue 
kravis and roberts stand ready to scale ever more challenging 
heights although the rjr nabisco buyout carries more than 20 
billion in debt kravis believes the deal is still conservative 
the amount of equity in the acquired company is estimated at 
about 74 billion for a debttoequity ratio of 3to1 in terms 
of leveraged buyouts that is considered low kravis said thursday 
the deal was an even more critical measure of kraviss personal 
and professional prestige which is why he entered the bidding in 
such a brazen way in the first place 
after rjr nabisco chief executive f ross johnson first announced 
his plan to take the company private oct 20 kravis rushed to make 
his own proposal initially he tried to call off johnsons 
financial advisers shearson lehman hutton inc in a meeting in 
which kravis offered to top johnsons bid to protect his 
franchise 
kraviss overtures were greeted with a flat rejection from the 
management group and the bidding war was on 
if kravis succeeds in adding rjr nabiscos tobacco and food 
holdings to his stable the lbo kingdom will boast revenues of 50 
billion or more about the same as bluechip international business 
machines corp 
theres a sense of oneupmanship in the financial markets 
said one stock analyst early on in the battle for rjr nabisco 
these people want to say weve done the biggest deal were 
the best 
for the moment king henry is just that

wheat futures prices fell sharply thursday on the chicago board 
of trade reflecting disappointment that the new grain deal with the 
soviet union had not yet produced a wheat transaction analysts said 
other grain futures closed mostly lower and soybeans posted 
substantial losses on fears of a wet weekend in the south american 
soybean belt 
on other markets sugar futures rose sharply precious metals 
declined energy futures rallied livestock and meat futures were 
higher and stockindex futures advanced 
many wheat traders had expected the agriculture department to 
offer the soviet union a large amount of subsidized us wheat under 
the export enhancement program within days of mondays signing of a 
27month grain agreement 
the absence of such an offer spawned speculation thursday that 
the superpowers were still haggling over price and that any 
purchases would not be immediately forthcoming said dale gustafson 
a grain market analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago 
the trade is beginning to believe that we may not see the wheat 
business coming in december and maybe not until well after that 
he said 
the new grain agreement calls for the soviets to purchase 4 
million metric tons of wheat 4 million tons of corn and 1 million 
tons of their choice in both the current year which began oct 1 
and the following year 
conflicting forecasts for the weekend weather in brazil and 
argentina where soybean planting is under way prompted a selloff 
in the soybean pit analysts said 
if the dry weather that has marked the early part of the planting 
period persists into the growing season south american forecasts 
could lend a fair amount of volatility to the us futures market 
gustafson said 
wheat settled 3 cents to 10 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in december at 416 a bushel corn was 4 cents lower to 
cent higher with december at 257 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 
5 cents lower with december at 191 a bushel soybeans were 5 
cents to 8 cents lower with january at 758 a bushel 
sugar futures made strong gains on new yorks coffee sugar amp 
cocoa exchange in a rally linked to bullish technical signals and 
indications that world production may fall short of consumption this 
year leading to a reduction in stockpiles 
at this point though there appears to be plenty of physical 
sugar available so it seems to be just a speculative rally said 
erik dunlaevy sugar market analyst with balfour maclaine corp in 
new york 
sugar settled 31 cent to 49 cent higher with the active march 
contract at 1144 cents a pound the highest price for march 
delivery since july 25 
platinum prices dipped amid profittaking on the new york 
mercantile exchange following wednesdays stunning advance of nearly 
25 a troy ounce 
a strengthening of the dollar also contributed to lower 
preciousmetals prices as did jitters prior to fridays release of 
november unemployment figures 
that always makes traders uneasy said bette raptopoulos 
metals analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
platinum settled 780 to 1380 lower with january at 60090 a 
troy ounce 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 90 cents to 110 
lower with december at 42390 a troy ounce silver was 4 cents to 
51 cents lower with december at 6096 a troy ounce 
energy futures prices rose on the new york mercantile exchange in 
technicallyinspired trading in the absence of new supplydemand 
developments analysts said 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 10 cents to 29 cents higher 
with january at 1561 a barrel heating oil was 17 cent to 94 
cent higher with january at 4918 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 25 cent lower to 83 cent higher with january at 4598 cents a 
gallon 
cattle futures firmed in a rebound from three consecutive days of 
lower prices on the chicago mercantile exchange 
people know the longterm outlook is bullish said charles 
levitt senior livestock analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
chicago 
expectations for a middecember slowdown in hog slaughters 
boosted pork futures he said 
live cattle settled 18 cent to 35 cent higher with december at 
7250 cents a pound feeder cattle were 45 cent to 73 cent higher 
with january at 8315 cents a pound hogs were 28 cent to 55 cent 
higher with december at 4037 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 15 cent to 55 cent higher with february at 4507 cents a 
pound 
stockindex futures finished slightly higher on the chicago 
mercantile exchange where the contract for december delivery of the 
standard amp poors 500 settled 15 point higher at 27320 each point

stock prices drifted lower thursday in a sluggish 
session marked by worries that interest rates may be headed higher 
analysts said many investors appeared to prefer standing aside in 
advance of the november employment report due friday which could 
provide some indication of whether the economy is moderating or 
overheating 
right now everybody is sitting back waiting for the employment 
figures said alfred e goldman an analyst for the brokerage ag 
edwards amp sons inc in st louis nobody has any conviction one 
way or the other 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks up 1298 points on 
wednesday and nearly 40 points over the past three sessions lost 
1263 to close at 210188 
declining issues outnumbered gainers by about 8to7 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
680 issues up 805 down and 486 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse came to 12938 million shares 
down from 15781 million in the previous session nationwide 
consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including trading at 
regional exchanges and on the overthecounter market totaled 
15512 million shares 
analysts said traders were worried that employment growth in 
november would indicate fasterthanexpected expansion in the 
economy 
if the economy were found to be expanding too quickly many 
analysts fear that the federal reserve may feel compelled to push 
interest rates higher to slow it down and restrain inflation 
higher rates make shortterm fixedincome investments more 
competitive with the uncertain returns on stocks threemonth 
treasury bills for instance are yielding about 810 percent 
goldman said most economists expect payroll growth of between 
225000 and 250000 in november 
a number significantly higher than that he said would mean 
the economy is in fact overheating and the fed is going to have to 
step on the monetary brakes more heavily than they have already 
but there is considerable uncertainty about how fast the economy 
is expanding 
stocks rallied earlier this week on indications that the economy 
may be growing at a more moderate pace 
in a new report thursday the government said its chief 
forecasting gauge of future economic activity edged up a sluggish 
01 percent in october after falling by a revised 03 percent in 
september 
rjr nabisco fell 1 to 91 and was the most active stock on the 
nyse the company said late wednesday it had accepted an offer of 
109 a share in cash and securities from buyout specialist kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co spurning a competing offer from a management 
group 
american telephone amp telegraph co was also active it fell to 
29 after saying it will take a 67 billion charge against its 
fourthquarter earnings to cover expenses related to getting rid of 
outdated telephone equipment 
general cinema climbed 2 to 23 after announcing its planned to 
sell its soft drink bottling business to pepsico inc for 15 
billion pepsico fell 2 to 38 
stocks of some of the major retailing companies slipped after 
they reported november sales that analysts called sluggish sears 
roebuck lost to 39 and jc penney fell to 52 but k mart rose 
to 35

nbc stunned cbs with a record bid of 401 million 
thursday to win the us television rights to the 1992 summer 
olympics in barcelona spain 
nbc which televised the summer olympics in seoul south korea 
had been considered a longshot to get the barcelona rights cbs was 
favored because it already owns the tv rights to the 1992 winter 
games in albertville france 
the barcelona fee topped the previous olympic record of 309 
million paid by abc for the winter olympics in calgary alberta nbc 
paid 300 million for the tv rights in seoul 
we didnt go into this to lose money nbc president robert 
wright said at a news conference our plan was designed to 
minimize losses its not designed to make a lot of money 
wright also said that as part of the agreement nbc agreed to 
spend 10 million to promote the city of barcelona 
michael weisman executive producer of nbc sports said he was a 
little bit surprised that the network got the barcelona rights 
the first call after i found out was to terry ewert our 
coordinating producer in seoul weisman said i said i sure 
hope you saved all your notes because i threw mine out 
bryant gumbel who anchored nbcs primetime telecasts in seoul 
said i think its terrific news especially for the guys who 
worked in seoul im a little surprised though i naturally assumed 
that cbs had the inside track 
neal pilson president of cbs sports said the record fee 
indicated his network might have gotten a bargain when it won the 
albertville rights for 243 million 
certainly the magnitude of nbcs bid for barcelona reaffirms 
the marketplace value of albertville he said 
dennis swanson president of oabc sports said we are 
disappointed but we congratulate nbc on the acquisition 
it was not immediately known how much cbs and abc bid but a 
source said nbcs offer was substantially higher olympic 
officials were seeking a minimum of 350 million 
abc lost an estimated 75 million in calgary nbc said it made a 
modest profit in seoul although it was much lower than expected 
due to disappointing ratings that forced the network to give 
sponsors free advertising 
nbc is expected to recoup some of its barcelona fee by selling 
about 75 hours of olympic programming to a cable network for between 
50 million and 75 million 
arthur watson the president of nbc sports said the network had 
a detailed cable plan but would not elaborate he also said 
events probably would not be shown on cable at the same time nbc was 
broadcasting 
unlike seoul primetime coverage from barcelona will be taped 
because of the sixhour time difference with new york but that 
drawback may be offset by the earlier starting date of the 1992 
games which will not have to compete with football and the final 
weeks of baseballs pennant races 
the seoul olympics started sept 17 while the barcelona games 
are to begin july 25 
every olympics has its own feel and i think barcelona will have 
a totally different look than seoul weisman said i think were 
in a very good position having done the seoul olympics we were very 
proud of what we did in seoul but i would be less than honest if i 
said i didnt expect to do this one better

an opec team plans to visit mexico and other 
nonopec producing nations to discuss mutual reductions in export 
quotas according to a published report thursday 
the report followed an offer by mexicos energy department to 
negotiate a reduction in mexicos oil exports in a bid to put some 
teeth into the opec cartel agreement to restrict production 
energy secretary fernando hiriart this week repeated an offer 
previously spurned by the 13member cartel to reduce mexicos 135 
millionbarrel daily export platform provided opec members enact 
similar reductions 
reductions also would be sought from other independent producers 
hiriart said 
he said department officials planned informal talks with opec and 
independent producers on possible quota reductions 
the energy department announced that an opec committee plans to 
visit mexico and other independent producers to negotiate reductions 
to buttress mondays opec pact the mexico city newspaper la jornada 
reported thursday 
department officials could not be reached for comment thursday a 
national holiday called to mark the inauguration of president carlos 
salinas de gortari 
the agreement by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries calls for a cartel export ceiling of 185 million barrels 
daily roughly 4 million barrels below current production 
a statement issued this week by former president miguel de la 
madrid praised the agreement and urged immediate consultations 
between cartel and independent producers but he warned much 
remained to be done to shore up the weak global market 
mexico urges all producers whether or not they are members of 
opec to act with caution in the next few months the statement 
said 
mexico the worlds sixthlargest oil producer has closely 
followed the cartels pricing and production guidelines 
only two weeks ago hiriart announced mexico was abandoning that 
policy because overproduction by opec members had rendered its 
market quotas useless 
mexico severely criticized opec this year for engaging in a price 
war it said threatened mexicos share of the us market and dragged 
down average prices of mexican export crude to under 10 
mexico loses an estimated 500 million in foreign earnings for 
each 1 drop in crude prices energy department officials 
acknowledge the country has lost 2 billion in anticipated revenue 
this year
