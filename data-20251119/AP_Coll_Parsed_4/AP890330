francis patrelle is a choreographer who uses 
classical and neoclassical ballet to create characters in dance he 
also has enough inventiveness to remain interesting and not keep 
repeating himself without getting way out 
dances patrelle formed a year ago is holding its first 
oneweek season at florence gould hall in the french institute 
most of the dancers are guests from established companies the idea 
of the company is to show patrelles choreography as effectively as 
possible 
on wednesday the second night the program began with adieu 
with a handshake with peter boal of the new york city ballet as 
vincent van gogh james jordan as his brother theo who tried 
unsuccessfully to sell his paintings and jana fugate as theos 
wife they danced to a debussy recording 
boals part became increasingly searching reaching extending 
anxious the other two responded sometimes affectionately 
sometimes coldly to his thrusts into their midst we like that 
ballet best 
two pleasing pas de deux followed judith fugate of the new york 
city ballet and medhi bahiri danced fantasy pas de deux from 
belovedmemories patrelle choreographed that for cynthia 
gregory and fernando bujones together performances at the city 
center last september 
patrelle who was born in bucks county pa was resident 
choreographer for the berkshire ballet from 1974 to 84 and created 
a fulllength romeo and juliet there jana fugate and jordan 
danced the balcony scene it was full of romance but didnt 
build instead of meeting shyly and falling more and more in love 
the dancers met with familiarity 
the final dance come raincome shine is 55 minutes long 
and was new in 1986 when it starred merrill ashley of the new york 
city ballet this season it stars cynthia gregory of american 
ballet theater she brings the strength of assurance to it when 
she and her partner donald williams of the dance theater of 
harlem are dancing one is enthralled 
the music is recordings by judy garland the concept however 
seems forced onto the songs the stage is a boxing ring hwere three 
couples do maritalbattle dances 
we particularly tired of judith fugate and medhi bahiris 
characterizations hes an unfaithful lover and shes always 
pleading to get him back when he decides to grant her the favor 
she always turns aside cynthia ry and donald williams have 
nearly as much nonmotivated topandfor togetherness and anger 
louise nadeau ando merlo dance a couple who get along better 
thesh and has lots of dance sequences to relish but 
the idea oftet fit the lyrics

palestinians from the occupied territories will 
no longer be allowed to clean the streets of tel aviv and jews 
will be encouraged to take their place city officials say 
the arabs from the territories cant be depended on to get to 
work meir doron the municipalitys deputy directorgeneral 
said wednesday 
since the palestinian uprising began nearly 16 months ago army 
curfews on arab villages and threats by uprising leaders warning 
the workers to stay away from jobs in israel have kept many from 
getting to work 
about 100000 palestinians work in israel mostly in menial 
labor construction and hotel maintenance 
most of the 300 street sweepers tel aviv hires on a daily basis 
have been palestinians from the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
many days only a dozen or so would arrive municipality 
spokesman benny cohen said one day only four showed up for 
work 
but city officials say they may have trouble finding israelis 
who want to sweep streets although they are prepared to pay jews 
more than the arabs received 
the problem is that people dont want to take this kind of job 
because of the stigma once associated with it doron said 
people think that cleaning houses or sweeping streets is a job 
for laborers brought in from africa or arabs

the air force found no 
problems in inspections wednesday of at least 19 b1b bombers 
which were grounded two days earlier after one of the planes swing 
wings punctured a fuel tank a spokesman said 
col larry greer of the strategic air command said six more of 
the older b1bs would be inspected before the air force decided 
whether to clear them for flight the inspections were to be 
completed at offut air force base by early thursday greer said 
sac has 97 b1bs which are up to 2 years old 
the 25 picked for inspection were representative of older b1bs 
at sacs four b1 wings greer said most are stationed at dyess 
air force base in texas mcconnell air force base in kansas grand 
forks air force base in north dakota and ellsworth air force base 
in south dakota 
other planes are stationed at a maintenance depot at tinker air 
force base in oklahoma and a contractors plant in palmdale calif 
the colonel said 
gen john t chain jr sacs commander will review inspection 
reports and make a final decision on whether the bombers should be 
returned to service greer said 
the fuel tank damaged during a routine preflight check at dyess 
was apparently punctured when the mechanism that sweeps the 
bombers wings back and forth malfunctioned pentagon spokesman dan 
howard said tuesday 
we are looking at something called the wingsweeper gear 
subassembly greer said wednesday thats the gear box inside 
the swing wings which gives it power to sweep the wings up and 
back you can sweep them back for a sort of delta shape to fly 
close to supersonic speeds and you sweep them out for landing and 
takeoff 
howard said the texas bombers crew was sweeping the wings 
forward and backward before taking off and discovered the wings 
were not moving evenly together

consumers union reported wednesday 
that it found the controversial additive alar in nearly 
threefourths of the apple juice samples it tested and said five 
of them had unacceptably high levels 
the report came on the same day an industry group the processed 
apple institute said in washington dc that it tested 4623 
samples of juice and apple sauce and found only eight with 
detectable levels 
consumers union which published consumer reports said 
virtually all the juices containing alar came from processors who 
had pledged not to use alartreated apples it also found the 
chemical in 11 of 20 raw apples purchased in the new york city area 
the government has estimated that only 5 percent to 10 percent 
of apples are sprayed with alar the trade name for daminozide it 
is used to help keep apples on the tree until they are ripe and 
keep them firm and red after harvest 
the chemical got attention recently when a private environmental 
group released a report saying children were at increased risk of 
cancer from eating apples and apple products containing alar 
several cities including new york and los angeles banned 
apples from school cafeterias some later resumed serving apples 
the epa announced last month that it will soon propose a ban on 
daminozide which would probably take effect in late 1990 
at question is what level of the chemical is acceptable the 
federal environmental protection agencys limit is 20 parts per 
million 
the five juices declared unacceptable in the may issue of 
consumer reports had levels ranging from 062 parts per million to 
180 parts per million the industry group said a detectable level 
meant a trace of at least 1 part per million or 20 times below the 
epa limit 
consumers union tested 44 adult apple juices bought in 1988 and 
1989 as well as seven babyfood apple juices 
the brand rated unacceptable by cu and their alar concentrations 
were hudson pride 180 ppm waldbaums 108 pathmark 072 
and pathmark natural style 091 all from the new york region 
and lady lee 062 sold in lucky stores in the west 
all five were rated unacceptable by the magazine not because 
drinking them is likely to cause cancer but because many other 
products are far less likely to contain high alar levels 
responding to cus report the processed apple institute said 
we are pleased that their results so closely mirror our own 
spokesmen for waldbaums and pathmark said they had taken the 
products in question off the shelves they said the stores had been 
assured through legal documents that suppliers didnt use products 
made from alartreated apples 
robert wunderle spokesman for supermarkets general corp 
parent company of pathmark said the company had required apple 
juice suppliers since 1986 to certify they werent made from 
alartreated apples 
are we splitting hairs here or are we dealing with something 
of substance he said of consumer reports cutoff level for 
deeming a product unacceptable 
we have been doing spot testing so this came as a surprise to 
us said mike rourke spokesman for aampp the parent company of 
waldbaums he said the batch tested by consumers union had been 
traced and taken off shelves 
dr edward groth iii associate technical director at consumers 
union said our results show that the industrys voluntary 
boycott of alar isnt working 
consumers union said it found six brands with very low or 
undetectable levels for both years martinellis gold medal minute 
maid musselmans red cheek speas farm and motts natural style 
another seven tested in 1989 showed similarly low levels 
consumers union said key food lincoln lincoln natural style 
lucky leaf veryfine 100 mcintosh finast and a generic brand 
bought at a finast store 
the babyfood apple juices had very low levels cu said with 
beechnut and gerber products having no detectable residues

venezuelan president carlos andres perez said 
wednesday that us treasury secretary nicholas bradys new plan to 
tackle latin americas debt crisis offers hope for the regions 
troubled democracies 
perez said the brady plan dovetails with proposals developed by 
latin american finance ministers and that together the two plans 
provide an excellent basis for dialogue and a meeting of minds 
perez who spoke in spanish through an interpreter made his 
comments on the first day of the hemispheric agenda a twoday 
conference at the carter center cochaired by former presidents 
jimmy carter and gerald ford 
us secretary of state james baker argentine president raul 
alfonsin uruguayan president julio sanguinetti and other us and 
foreign officials are scheduled to speak thursday 
the conference is aimed at coming up with ideas on key 
hemispheric issues particularly the debt problem 
perez said the latin american democracies 400 billion debt 
places unsustainable pressures on local economies 
he said both the brady and finance ministers plans involve a 
reduction in the amount of the debt extended repayment periods and 
an increase in the capital flows needed to help financially 
strapped countries get on the road to recovery 
recent public disturbances in venezuela illustrate the urgency 
of the change in the debt repayment plan he said 
while the governments of latin america have proven their 
willingness to adopt disciplined administration to prevent 
funds being misused perez said the creditor countries must 
acknowledge latin americas need for a continuing influx of 
investment capital 
under the current debt structure perez said we are being 
drained of our resources by having to make debt payments with the 
meager funds of austerity policies that irremediably affect our 
peoples behavior to the dramatic extent shown recently in 
venezuela 
at least 247 people were killed and scores injured during riots 
two weeks ago in caracas following an austerity program that 
brought steep increases in bus fares gasoline and other goods and 
services 
the unsustainable pressures of the economic crisis on our 
democracies decapitalize all our countries slash our per 
capita income and drastically wipe out the investment necessary to 
restore economic growth perez said 
the venezuelan president said solving chronic economic problems 
is critical for the survival of the latin american democracies 
time is running out for latin america the debt is already 
eroding our democracies assets perez said the solution lies 
in making traditional markets dynamic again but as long as latin 
america is in a state of economic gloom this option will be 
nonexistent

despite official predictions that oil from the 
largest us spill ever will not reach canadian waters the 
spreading alaskan slick is causing growing concern about arctic 
development and tanker shipping 
i think its so massive that we just dont know what were 
going to do with it at this time arne hansen of the western 
canada wilderness committee said wednesday by telephone from 
vancouver british columbia 
he said the the environmental group long has been worried about 
supertankers in the pacific lanes off of canada 
we had been expecting a spill like this for years hansen 
said its like a meltdown of a nuclear reactor 
the spill in alaskas prince william sound has been a leading 
news story in canada since the tanker exxon valdez ran aground on 
friday 
environment minister lucien bouchard told reporters tuesday at a 
meeting in meech lake quebec that it might be a good idea to 
review the canadaus agreement on west coast oil shipping 
we are concerned about what happened because we know that 
these kind of disasters can happen everywhere he said so we 
will see what we can do for the future 
bouchard and his aides have said repeatedly that it is unlikely 
the oil spill off valdez alaska will directly affect canadian 
waters or shores 
when asked about the us plan to allow some oil and gas 
drilling in an alaskan wildlife refuge bordering canada bouchard 
said the arctic is an extremely fragile area 
we are extremely worried we are opposed to this he said 
the canadian government has said it opposes the plan for the 
alaskan development next to its yukon territory because it could 
disrupt the migratory patterns of the porcupine caribou herd 
james fulton environment critic for the socialist new 
democratic party predicted in a telephone interview from ottawa 
that some oil from the valdez spill eventually will affect canadian 
territory even if the prevailing currents move the bulk of it north 
ive looked at all of the most recent tidal and current 
charts he said i dont think theres much doubt that some of 
the spill is likely to reach canadian territory 
fulton represents in parliament british columbias skeena 
district which includes the provinces northwestern pacific coast 
he said the difficulties in the cleanup show that the oil 
industrys state of prepardeness is very close to zero 
calls to his office have been running 9to1 in favor of action 
such as a halt to tanker traffic fulton said 
people are mad he said people are getting really sick 
and tired of being kicked around by large corporations

doctors should ease the dying of their hopelessly 
ill patients by giving them as much pain medicine as they need and 
even helping them commit suicide if they wish a report today 
concludes 
the report drawn up by a panel of prominent physicians 
contends that doctors have an obligation to help terminally ill 
patients have a good death just as they help them lead a 
healthy life 
we really think that the physician has a responsibility to be 
actively involved in creating an environment in which a peaceful 
death can occur said dr sidney h wanzer principal author of 
the report 
the most controversial of the groups conclusions was that it 
is not immoral for a physician to assist in the rational suicide of 
a terminally ill patient 
wanzer said doctors can ethically prescribe sleeping pills or 
other drugs to dying patients knowing they will use them for 
suicide and even tell them how big a dose is lethal 
the doctors said such assistance is certainly not rare 
however they added that if physicians tend to their dying 
patients comfort and dignity suicide requests should be 
infrequent 
two doctors on the 12member committee disagreed with the 
suicide guideline 
i dont want a blanket statement to say it is not immoral i 
can accept that someone else may say it is moral but i want to be 
able to say i dont like this said one of the dissenters dr 
jan van eys of the university of texas system cancer center in 
houston 
the report is the second from the committee which was chaired 
by dr daniel d federman of harvard medical school former 
president of the american college of physicians it was published 
in todays new england journal of medicine 
its first report issued five years ago also dealt with the 
ethics of obeying patients final wishes including removing 
feeding tubes some of its recommendations have since been widely 
adopted by doctors and courts 
the doctors noted that one of the greatest concerns of the dying 
and their families is that doctors wont give enough painkillers 
they said this fear is largely justified 
the group said that allowing a patient to experience unbearable 
pain or suffering is unethical medical practice when death becomes 
inevitable the importance of relieving pain outweighs the risk of 
hastening death 
it is morally correct to increase the dose of narcotics to 
whatever dose is needed even though the medication may contribute 
to the depression of respiration or blood pressure the dulling of 
consciousness or even death provided the primary goal of the 
physician is to relieve sufferingrote the proper dose 
of pain medication is the dose that is sufficient to relieve pain 
and suffering even to the point of unconsciousnessanel recommended that 
doctors qupatients about 
whether they want aggressive treatment to prolong the dying 
proess their values and wishes shoart of their medical 
records aursing homes should regularly rents 
preferences 
besides harvard and the university of texas panel membewere 
from pritzcine in chicago massachusetts general 
hospitalounty medical center in minneapolis the 
univeria medical center the university of california 
school of medicine in san francco the mayo clinic and the

rain man the story of a conniving car 
salesman who learns to love his autistic brother won the oscar as 
best picture wednesday night and brought top honors to actor dustin 
hoffman and director barry levinson jodie foster the victim of a 
gang rape in the accused was named best actress of 1988 
rain man also captured a prize for the original screenplay 
ronald bass and barry morrow bringing its total to four oscars at 
the 61st academy awards tying with three each were dangerous 
liaisons the ornate drama of drawing room seduction in 
prerevolutionary france and who framed roger rabbit the 
brilliant combination of live action and animation 
geena davis the freespirited dog trainer in the accidental 
tourist and kevin kline the wildeyed oversexed safecracker in 
a fish called wanda were surprise winners in supporting roles 
this is such a big deal said miss foster a former child 
star who won her first oscar 
cruelty might be human and it might be cultural but its not 
acceptable and thats what this movie is about she said 
im supposed to be jaded by this time but im not said 
hoffman who also won the award for kramer vs kramer in 1979 
he embraced loser gene hackman while on his way to the stage where 
he basked in a standing ovation in tribute to his meticulously 
researched portrayal of an autistic savant 
we tried to be as faithful as we could and be entertaining 
said levinson of the lowkey rain man which also starred tom 
cruise as hoffmans brother and has grossed 1346 million at the 
box office 
this is really about two actors dustin hoffman and tom 
cruise levinson said if they didnt deliver the performanaces 
they gave i wouldnt be up here this evening 
first of all i want to thank anne tyler for writing such a 
wonderful book miss davis said in accepting the first prize of 
the night at the 61st academy awards she has said she read miss 
tylers novel when it was first published and coveted the role of 
muriel 
the award to miss davis drew yelps of approval from the audience 
of 6500 in the shrine auditorium possibly because the favorites 
appeared to have been frances mcdormand for mississippi burning 
and sigourney weaver for working girl 
this is astonishing said kline who also had not been 
considered a frontrunner 
liaisons won oscars for christopher hamptons adaptation of 
his play and for art direction and costume design roger rabbit 
won for film editing sound effects and visual effects 
the milagro beanfield war won for best score and 
mississippi burning for cinematographybird won the oscar 
for best sound and beetlejuice for makeup 
named best song of the year was carly simons let the river 
run from working girl the academy could find only three 
songs to nominate this year instead of the usual five and didnt 
see fit to have them performed during the show 
the years best foreign language film was denmarks pelle the 
conqueror a grim tale about an exploited farmworker and his son 
with wednesdays ceremonies the academy dropped the traditional 
line the winner is in favor of and the oscar goes to 
the intent was to soften the sense of competition but 
several presenters including cher for best picture reverted to 
the old line 
more than 1500 early bird fans many with sleeping bags and 
food had packed bleachers facing the four 24foot oscars that 
guard the moorish arches at the entrance to the auditorium 
hollywoods annual tribute to itself televised live on abc 
moved at its usual plodding place and was burdened with 
heavyhanded production numbers the industry relied heavily on 
nostalgia recruiting as presenters such oldtime partners as james 
stewart and kim novak and bob hope and lucille ball 
the 1989 season followed a record year at the box office more 
than 1 billion tickets were sold in 1988 with gross revenues of 
438 billion

producer allan carr promised an infusion of glamor for the 
awards show whose nielsen ratings have declined steeply over the 
years 
but the telecast opened with an embarrassing production number 
that included a snow white character who talked like betty boop and 
accompanied actor rob lowe in a rendition of the rock song proud 
mary amid dancing nightclub tables 
security was much in evidence as the time approached for the 
ceremonies one hundred los angeles police were on special 
assignment at the event augmenting the private security guards who 
had been at the shrine for five days said one of them a lot of 
people want in on the action and we have to see that they dont 
get it 
last year traffic planning was a fiasco forcing many 
participants to leave their limos and walk blocks to the 
auditorium this year 75 officers from the state department of 
transportation were assigned to the area a couple of miles south 
of downtown by the university of southern california campus 
nominations for acting directing art direction and specialized 
categories are handled by select branches and committees of academy 
members 
all voting members of the academy can participate in the best 
picture nominations and may vote for the final awards in all 
categories winners for best documentary feature best animated 
short film and best liveaction short film are chosen by only those

expected by monday

seven people including a sitting member of the 
bahamian parliament and a highly visible boston defense attorney 
have been indicted on charges they schemed to launder illegal drug 
profits the government announced wednesday 
the indictment returned by a federal grand jury a week ago and 
unsealed wednesday centers around the activities of reputed drug 
mogul salvatore m caruana according to acting us attorney 
jeremiah t osullivan 
it charges that caruana made 75 million selling marijuana 
then conspired with the other six defendants to invest and launder 
the money using front companies in the bahamas panama and the 
united states 
caruana he is charged with racketeering and along with the 
other six defendants conspiring to defraud the irs 
the others include kendal w nottage a member of the bahamian 
parliament and a former cabinet minister to bahamian prime minister 
lynden pindling and prominent boston attorney joseph j balliro 
caruana has been a fugitive on the governments most wanted list 
since 1984 when he jumped bail after being indicted for allegedly 
smuggling 173 million of mariujana into new england 
nottage 48 who is an attorney was charged with conspiring to 
defraud the us government 
the indictment accuses nottage of transporting large sums of 
money to the bahamas for caruana and executing a false document 
that concealed caruanas interest in the islands islander hotel 
which was used to launder the money 
nottages wife rubie 45 also an attorney in nassau was one 
of four people charged with conspiring to violate federal 
racketeering laws 
both nottages are accused of lying about caruana and their 
activities on his behalf to a special commission appointed by the 
bahamian government to investigate drug trafficking there 
the couple released a statement wednesday maintaining their 
innocence they said kendal nottage simply negotiated a loan to pay 
off a mortgage on the hotel he had owned and occupied since 1976 
before he became a cabinet minister no money was sent to the 
bahamas because the lenders and mortgage holders were in the boston 
area and the loan was arranged by attorneys who did not disclose 
the lenders identity the statement said 
to our knowledge neither kendal nor i have broken any law in 
the united states or at home here in the bahamas the statement 
said 
the nottages have previously stated their innocence and called 
the indictment which has been expected a political move by the 
united states to smear the bahamas as a drug laundering center 
a bahamian with close ties to pindling was one of 30 people 
indicted last week by a federal grand jury in jacksonville fla 
for allegedly taking bribes to allow columbias medellin cartel to 
use the bahamas as a way station for drug shipments 
osullivan said the two cases were unconnected 
he said the caruana case also was unrelated to indictments 
announced in washington in what federal officials called 
operation polar cap a crackdown on an alleged billiondollar 
international drug laundering operation 
the boston indictment accuses balliro 61 and another boston 
attorney edmund m hurley 54 of brookline of racketeering and 
income tax violations 
balliro has represented a convicted mafia defendant on 
conspiracy to defraud the irs hurley has represented caruana on 
civil matters 
last week balliro held a news conference to deny any wrongdoing 
and called the charges a personal attack by osullivan balliro 
demanded a special prosecutor be appointed in the case 
osullivan called balliros claim that the charges resulted from 
personal animosity between himself and the lawyer a figment of 
mr balliros imagination 
the interim us attorney who will step down from his post 
friday said he took the unusual step of having the entire twoyear 
investigation and the indictments reviewed by two independent 
sections of the justice department 
osullivan said his superiors found no need to appoint a special 
prosecutor 
also indicted were david t gorwitz 58 also a fugitive and 
charles r burnett age 47 a pompano beach fla attorney 
osullivan said the state department had received help from the 
bahamian commission of inquiry had notified the bahamian 
government of the indictments and would ask that the nottages be 
extradited 
but in a statement released wednesday evening the bahamian 
government said the united states had not supplied any evidence 
that couple had violated any laws or provided any details of the 
indictment 
the statement called the indictment an attempt to extend 
united states legal jurisdiction beyond its shores into the 
sovereign territory of an independent nation 
the bahamian government also questioned the timi of the 
indictment which comesth before congress is to consider 
certifying the bahamas as a cooperating country in the fight 
against drug trafficking

people who want to learn to fly can save as 
much as 1850 by qualifying for a new recreational pilot license 
the federal aviation administration announced requirements for 
the new license wednesday saying it was designed for wouldbe 
recreational or sport pilots who are willing to fly short distances 
in daylight at low altitudes within 50 miles of the airport where 
they train 
the new recreational certification for flying basic aircraft 
including homebuilt and experimental models will require less 
training or experience than a private pilot certificate 
the faa estimates that the new rules will save a wouldbe pilot 
between 1200 and 1850 from what it would take to get a private 
pilot license the cost of training for a full private license is 
estimated at between 3100 and 4750 depending on hourly fees 
charged said spokesman john leyden 
pilots who get the new license will not have to learn how to use 
sophisticated navigational or radio equipment which is required of 
other private pilots the faa said in a news release but they 
cannot fly in areas which require communication with air traffic 
controllers 
the faa said the sport pilots training will focus on basic 
flying skills 
the new rule limits recreational pilots to singleengine 
aircraft with no more than 180 horsepower engines a fixed landing 
gear and no more than four seats they will be allowed to carry 
only one passenger and cannot fly for hire 
at the same time the agency imposed new testing requon 
student pilots and new annual reviews for inexperienced pilots who 
are not rated to fly with instruments 
the faa also increased the flight visibility requirement fortudent 
pilots from one mile to three miles and r they 
pass a written test before their first solo flight

president bushs chief spokesman is touting 
random drugtesting for federal employees and says he thinks it is 
shortsighted for white house workers to resist it 
commenting wednesday on a longstanding suit against the testing 
by some 30 employees of the executive office of the president 
press secretary marlin fitzwater called drug abuse an insidious 
problem in america 
its everywhere its throughout our society the spokesman 
said and all of our institutions should be taking a look at ways 
to curb it and thats what the federal governments doing 
fitzwater defended the governments right to subject employees 
to random drugtesting as the secret service disclosed that four 
officers accused of drug abuse had been removed from its payroll 
spokesman bob snow said there had been two resignations and two 
firings in the uniformed division of the agency which guards 
foreign embassies and the white house grounds the departure of the 
four guards stemmed from an investigation that surfaced last may 
a source who declined to be named publicly said us attorney 
jay stephens office decided that there should be no prosecution 
for the alleged drug use which was said to involve cocaine but it 
could not immediately be learned whether the two resignations and 
the two firings resulted from negotiations with stephens office 
from our standpoint theyre gone snow said he said the 
more than 950 officers in the uniformed division are now subjected 
to routine drug testing 
fitzwater noted that the suit initially was filed in federal 
court here against thenpresident reagan and that reagans name was 
replaced with bushs when the administrations changed jan 20 
the reagan white house chafing over revelations of drug abuse 
by presidential employees in sensitive jobs announced june 30 that 
everyone on its payroll would be subject to random drug tests in 60 
days but that program has been held up by court challenges 
the employees say false test results could make them subject to 
undeserved penalties 
reagans announcement had been preceded by revelations that two 
national security council clerks resigned and three secret service 
officers were suspended while awaiting the outcome of an 
investigation into alleged drug use 
neither the white house nor the secret service would describe at 
the time what drugs were involved in the investigation which led 
to the resignations of the two nsc clerks and placement of three 
uniformed division officers on administrative leave 
during a speech last week to several delaware groups involved in 
combating drug use bush hailed two supreme court rulings upholding 
mandatory workplace drug testing for people in law enforcement and 
public safety jobs 
i hope this will help achieve our goal of a drugfree 
workplace he said 
neither of the two supreme court opinions dealt headon with the 
constitutionality of random drug testing for some 400000 federal 
workers 
on wednesday fitzwater was asked what bush thought of the 
attempt by employees in the white house complex to stop random drug 
testing of some 1500 of the 1850 employees in the executive 
office of the president 
the spokesman replied that bush was concerned that they dont 
understand the need for random drug testing and the need to take 
steps to make sure that we keep drugs out of the federal service 
the evidence is considerable on the importance of random drug 
testing and curbing drug use

male insects whose pursuit of sex leads them 
to ravage peach trees are being drawn by an artificial perfume into 
wearing themselves out on plastic strips instead 
scientists are holding out hope that the method of pest control 
by way of birth control will cost less and be safer than 
insecticides being used on peach trees 
the male pests are the lesser peachtree borer which attacks the 
trunk or limbs of the tree and the larva of a close relative the 
peachtree borer which chews at the base and roots 
both are looking for female borers and are drawn by the scent 
into thinking they have found potential mates but its a fatal 
attraction say agriculture department scientists 
it works like this said entomologist j wendell snow the 
insects try to mate daily from around 11 am until about 2 pm 
for about two weeks the lifespan of adults when the male futilely 
approaches the scents dispenser repeatedly he becomes totally 
confused and exhausted 
femalo compete with the artificial sex 
scents remain barren thereby breaking the reproductive chain or 
egglarvaeadult cycle 
the fiveyeact described by the departments 
agricultural research serviceled by entomologist j wendell 
snow who delved into the sex scents or pheromones emitted by the 
female borers 
snow who is in charge he southeastern fruit and tree nut 
research laboratory in byron ga hung disprs containing the 
artificial sc in each peach tree of the test ds 
the sex attractants whn the tops of test trees 
achieved almost complete control of the borers in several 
orchards in central georgia he said 
snow said t pheromone dispensers which are made of plastic 
and resemble tash bag twist ties are being reviewed by the 
environmental pro use 
the lesser borer resides in canada and the eastern united 
states while the peachtre inhabits most of the united 
states the pests cost american peach growers an eted 20 
million annually 
only two chemical pesticides lre 
approved for control of the e pheromones leave no

first lady barbara bush is taking medication 
to control a thyroid disorder that produced an eye irritation and 
caused her to joke she would have dropped a few dress sizes had the 
condition gone unchecked 
after taking the medication for four days mrs bush has 
noticed marked improvement in her eye symptoms her press 
office said wednesday in a statement 
the statement said mrs bush suffers from graves disease and 
sought treatment after mild swelling and irritation of the eyes 
and some loss of weight 
mrs bush told a group of reporters wednesday that she did not 
know about the overactive thyroid condition until her eyes started 
bothering her although she had lost about 18 pounds over the past 
several months the thyroid just went wacko she said 
i might have gone down to a size 6 said mrs bush who 
would not reveal her new size but then she added how can any 
grownup in america be so dumb as to think weight would just fall 
off 
now please dont have me dying she joked 
sondra haley a press aide to mrs bush said the condition 
which included swelling and watering in her eyes was completely 
under control 
itswas more of an eye irritation ms 
haley said 
other than mild eye discomfort mrs bush has felt fine and 
kept her usual active schedule the statement said

millions of americans with arthritis must 
decide between enduring painful swollen joints or risking the 
development of a bleeding gastric ulcer according to a new survey 
of physicians 
the arthritis foundation said that a survey of 1009 physicians 
who treat arthritis patients showed that 93 percent of the doctors 
believe that aspirin ibuprofen and some prescription 
antiinflammatory drugs are the most useful of a limited number of 
medications available to treat arthritis 
but the survey also found that 81 percent of the doctors regard 
ulcers and other digestive problems to be the most serious 
complication in the treatment of arthritis the survey was released 
today 
when you look at the number of patients who take this 
medication it becomes a major health problem said dr naurang 
m agrawal a physician on an arthritis foundation advisory panel 
he said about one in every five arthritis patients taking aspirin 
and the other socalled nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs 
nsaids develop some type of gastric problem as a result 
and yet he said the nsaids remain the most effective drugs for 
control of the pain and swelling from arthritis 
the arthritis foundation said in a statement that in the united 
states about 37 million men women and children about one in 
every seven americans suffer from some form of arthritis 
arthritis is actually a family of more than 100 specific diseases 
but the most common are osteroarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis 
there is no cure for either of these common forms and treatment 
for both concentrates on relieving joint pain swelling stiffness 
and other symptoms 
osteroarthritis the most common form affects the elderly the 
most often and few who live past 60 escape at least a mild symptom 
in severe cases joints degenerate until they are useless and in 
some cases must be surgically replaced by implants 
rheumatoid arthritis strikes usually in middle age and can lead 
quickly to disability in severe cases in addition to joint 
swelling and pain symptoms can include fever and fatigue 
both of these types of arthritis are characterized by 
inflammation in the joints aspirin and other nsaids are effective 
because they control inflammation by inhibiting the production of 
prostaglandin a hormonelike protein that is active in the 
inflammation process 
but agrawal said that while the nsaids block prostaglandins at 
the joints the drugs also deplete the hormones in the stomach and 
intestines where prostaglandins provide protection from ulcer 
development 
the result said agrawal is that arthritis patients are 
relieved of joint pain but then may suddenly develop ulcers 
it is a very serious problem that is just now being addressed 
seriously he said 
the danger of developing ulcers applies mostly to those who must 
take large daily doses of the nsaids in order to control 
inflammation occasional aspirins or other headache medicines post 
little ulcer hazard experts say 
last december the food and drug administration recognized the 
problem by ordering that nsaids carry warnings about ulcers or 
damage to the stomach from a chronic daily dosage 
the fda recently approved a new drug misoprostol for the 
prevention of gastric ulcers caused by chronic nsaid medication 
the drug marketed as cytotec by g d searle amp co permits most 
arthritis patients to take antiinflammatory drugs without risking 
ulcers but misoprostol can promote diarrhea in some patients and 
can cause miscarriage in pregnant women

the kids at the circus gasp at the whirling 
wheel of death and ooh over the amazing tahar the alligator tamer 
from morocco but they usually save their biggest ovations for the 
lowly elephant sweepers 
thats show biz 
when the ringmaster at the visiting ringling bros and barnum amp 
bailey circus introduces the next act a million pounds of 
performing pachyderms 16 elephants lumber gracefully into the 
spotlight followed by a halfdozen anonymous men in blue jumpsuits 
and carrying brooms and shovels 
for the next few minutes 16 elephants dance through their 
intricately choreographed routine with sequined showgirls 
meanwhile the sweepers are performing their own desperate minuet 
dodging a swaying trunk or a thundering hoof to keep the three 
circus rings nice and tidy 
the kids in the bleacher seats and many of the grownups howl 
with delight especially when a man in blue smilingly holds his 
shovel under an elephants tail 
sometimes the sweepers get more applause than the performers 
get said scottishborn stablemaster tommy henry 56 whos swept 
up his share of elephant manure during 40 years of circus work 
the public likes it he said they think its funny most 
of the guys think its a big joke 
a million pounds of performing pachyderms produces a lot of 
pounds of manure 
ringlings entire animal menagerie in fact fills a 
30cubicyard metal trash bin every day says general manager mike 
melssen a private contractor is paid to haul it away except when 
the circus hosts a manure giveaway as a promotional gimmick 
elephant manure is the most potent fertilizer in the world 
said circus spokeswoman kim turpin davis with the unabashed 
hyperbole for which ringling is famous 
it will grow tomatoes as big as beach balls she said it 
will grow spinach as powerful as popeyes 
ms davis said the stuff is so highly prized that someone in 
houston responding to a ringling newspaper ad drove his truck up 
to the circus the night before an elephant manure giveaway and 
stole the whole aromatic pile 
we put out an all points bulletin but it was never 
recovered she said

us officials reluctantly concede they will 
have to accept a compromise with europe over elimination of farm 
price supports in order to avert the collapse of international 
trade talks 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said wednesday that he had 
agreed to a formula that would call for progressive substantial 
reductions of agricultural subsidies the united states had 
originally sought the use of the word elimination of subsidies 
what we have tried to do is state it in a manner that might be 
a little more palatable politically to our european counterparts 
yeutter said in an interview on national public radio 
asked if this was a compromise compared with the hardline 
position he took at international trade talks in montreal last 
december yeutter answered not much he added that the 
proposed formula will get us to the ultimate objective of getting 
rid of tradedistorting kind of practices in agriculture around the 
world 
another agriculture department official speaking on condition 
he not be identified said the eec had indicated to us 
negotiators that it would accept the compromise this could pave 
the way for progress at a meeting next wednesday in geneva of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the montreal meeting of cabinet members from the 96 gatt members 
broke down over the agricultural clash between the united states 
and the 12nation eec with members refusing to act on other 
pressing trade issues until the dispute is resolved 
the eec which has powerful farming interests balked at the 
us demand for total elimination of the subsidies and was only 
willing to discuss reducing the supports 
the united states contends that the supports for production and 
export of agricultural products distort world market prices and 
force the administration to prop up american farmers to the tune of 
some 25 million annually so they can compete abroad 
the us position on farm supports has been gradually eroding 
since last year when former president reagan dropped his original 
goal for the worldwide elimination of farm subsidies by the year 
2000 
the united states then took the position that it was not setting 
any date for elimination of the supports but was seeking instead a 
commitment from all gatt members for eventual elimination 
in the absence of such a commitment the united states intends 
to press the eec at the geneva meeting to reduce its export subsidy 
for farmers yeutter said the united states has had to keep up with 
the europeans by increasing export supports for farmers and its 
really sheer economic madness 
another potential sticking point in geneva is a new eec demand 
that the united states freeze current limitations on the size of 
farm lands used for production the united states asked farmers to 
idle some lands last year because of the drought 
yeutter said he would reject the eec demand 
the european community is trying to lock us into that position 
forever and we just cant afford to have that take place he said 
agriculture department officials say they will decide by june 1 
whether to maintain the existing limitations on farm production 
depending on their determination of the past winters drought 
damage

attorney general dick thornburgh says drug 
users must be presented with their share of the bill for the 
nations drug problems but he doesnt plan to send out swarms of 
agents to nab them in the act 
its obvious that it would not be a maximum efficient use of 
resources just to start clapping everybody whos a drug user into 
jail or trying to fine them civilly thornburgh said wednesday 
during a luncheon with reporters 
but that deterrent effect is going to be utilized he said 
that i hope would cause people to think twice about their own 
personal use 
he does not intend to go back to an extreme zero tolerance 
policy under which agents seized boats when a single marijuana 
cigarette was found on them but if youve got half a ton of coke 
on board a yacht and we find it youre not going to have the yacht 
very long 
speaking shortly after he announced the indictments of 127 
people on drug and moneylaundering charges thornburgh said we 
talked this morning about a billion dollar moneylaundering 
operation 
every one of those billion dollars came from american citizens 
who buy and use and abuse drugs and violate the laws and suborn our 
values on a daily basis s going to ultimately be won he said 
were going to be a nation that reects the notion that a 
drugdepet lifestyle is an admissible lifestyle then an only then 
are w to make progress on the drug front 
while he said he doesnt plan to arrest individual drug users as 
eaid he instructed investigators and prosecutors to press charge 
including whitecollar workers who serve as role models 
dont let mimpression that were sending swarms of agents out 
there concentrated on socalled recreational drug users he said 
but i will not rule out using any of these tools against the drug 
user because it is the drug user which finances the drug trafficker 
that has to bsented with his or her share ofbill itll happen 
on other issues thornburgh said 
he is concerned about erosion people seeking federal law 
enforcement jobs because of the low pay being offered ive 
pledery outspoken proponent of their needs before the pay study 
commission established by congress he said the commission is 
tings in june 
he is impatient to get his own staff in plac short lists of 
candidates for virtually all the agencies his department os such

others the short list in some casedes the incumbent he said 
he may not appoint anybody to replace frank keating as assoe 
attorney general the thirdranking post in the justice department 
and a couple of other positions are also under revie he plans 
no more audits of any agencies such as those that se operations of

the united states is rejecting soviet calls 
for a special united nations investigation into us and pakistani 
support for the rebels in afghanistan 
there is no need at this time for the security council to 
review the situation in afghanistan now that soviet troops have

checkpoints on the afghanpakistani border to prevent arms and 
troops from reaching moslem guerrillas suggested that a meeting of 
the council to discuss the alleged violations could be useful

babies and toddlers by feeding them according to the same 
highfiber lowfat nutritional regime they follow themselves 
nutrition and health experts say 
in addition the experts say sugar and sodium in moderate

these points are included in new infant dietary guidelines 
developed by gerber products co and based on published statements 
of the american academy of pediatrics and the american dietetic 
association

like adults said dr guy johnson director of infant nutrition

the national transportation safety board 
which is investigating the cause of the alaskan oil spill is 
concerned that individuals with revoked auto drivers licenses 
sometimes are allowed to pilot airliners or oil tankers 
board investigators at the spill site said they were focusing on 
actions by the ships captain joseph hazelwood whose drivers 
license had been revoked three times in drunken driving incidents 
while he held the highestlevel license granted a ships captain 
hazelwood had turned over the bridge to his third mate who was 
notnsed to operate the ship in the prince william sound where it 
ran aground friday spilling moremillion gallons of crude oil that 
has spread over 500 square miboard spokesman in washington said 
investigators have not determined whether alcohol contributoil 
spill but he said they were aware of news reports concerninlleged 
record of alcohol abuse 
lopatkiewicz said he did not know whether investigators had 
examined hazelwoods highway dving records in huntington 
nyhometown 
he board had long been concerned with policies that allow 
airline pilots shipsaptains and other people with mansportation 
safety responsibilities to remain on the job while not being 
allowed to drive a ca because of alcohol abuse 
hazelwoods drivers license was revoked in 1984 when he refuse 
take a breathalleaded guilty to drunken driving near his home he 
was convicted of drunken driving in new hampshire last september 
and his license remained revoked from that incident authorities in 
new york said 
alaskas public safety commissioner art english said the coast 
a state trooper to investigate a report that hazelwood had been 
drinking before he boarded the ship thursday night 
coast guard spokesman randy peterson said officials would await 
the results of the ntsb investigation before deciding whether 
disciplinary action might be taken against hazelwood or any other 
officer of the exxon valdez 
ntsb investigations normally take about a year to complete and 
spokesman lopatkiewicz said the board would not issue any 
recommendations of action against an individual before its probe is 
complete 
toast guard deferred to the ntsb oil spill investigation 
peterson said because the service might be one subject of the 
investigation it has the responsibility of monitoring traffic in 
the sound 
frk flyntz a coast guard licensing official said that an 
applicant on the ladder to becoming a ships captain could be 
denied a license based on a history of alcohol abuse or drunken 
driving convictions 
but he said ld tke action before an administrative law judge to 
revoke a license once it isanted such action could be based on 
negligence misconduct or id 
flyntz said hazelwood because his license allowed him to 
operate the est ships was a highly qualified ships master who had 
passed extensive training and licensing procedures 
licenses for merchant ships officers have to be renewed every 
five years 
coast guard records show thatds license was issued for the 
third fiveyear period in new yoon dec 12 1986 declaring him 
master of ocean steam or motor vessels of any gross tons he 
also was qualfied as a radar navigator and was licensed for prince 
william scousins whom flyntz described as a highly qualified 
individual was licensed last jan 12 s as a second mate one 
degree higher than the post he had on the exxon valdezwas qualified 
as a radar navigatch would include the ability to use radar to spot 
the shorelinen underwater reef he did not have the pilotage 
endorsement necessary to pilot a ship throuthe sound 
pilotage licenses for specific waterways have ar flyntz said 
including the ability to take a blank piece of paper and map the 
waterway with alational marks shipping channels and depths from 
memory 
joseph angelo as of the coast guards merchant l inspection and 
documentation division said the exxon valdez built in 1986 meets 
all the latest construction and equipment requirements including 
the instion of ballasts that can help prevent oil spills in some 
instances 
its a very new ship i dont see any deficiencies at all 
said angelo 
the current standards that exist the most modern tankers are 
good said angelo but no matter what you do you cant cover 
ry possible aspect if human error is involved

latin americas foreign debt burden is 
threatening democracy by making marxist alternatives attractive to 
the people who must endure the austerity programs creditors 
demand president jose sarney says 
in an interview with the associated press on wednesday sarney 
said the debt burden is giving latin americans a sense that a 
democratic regime free enterprise is incapable of solving the 
problems of each country 
no regime can survive if it cannot at least offer solutions 
forts people said sarney who sphe palace of the dawn the 
presidential residene 
sarney a 58yearold poet and rancher took office in 1985 in a 
militarymandated electoral college elction after 21 years of 
rightwing military rule 
but chronic economic problems including a 115 billion debt and 
1000 percent inflatione led to increased popularity of leftist 
parties in advance of presidential election 
it will be brazils free presidential election in 29 years 
under the constituay not run for reelection 
the transition to civilian rule has brought parties with 
totalitarian tendies into the democratic game sarney said 
while we havent had military upngs or serious social upheavals 
we also dont have groups of subversives or ones who deny 
democratic values 
however sarney said latin americas foreign debt was a threat 
to democrbrazil and the rest of the region latin american nations 
owe foreign creditors more than 400 billion and bra debt is the 
largest 
democracy is losing ground in latin america because the 
solution ittend national problems we offer pessimistic solutions 
and the parties of the left offer optimistic ones he said 
brazil has made a brutal efforand paid a very high 
politica trying to meet debt payments and enact the austerity 
measures recommended byand the international monetary fund to 
qualify for loans 
in the past four years he said brazil has paid its creditors 
about 50 billion in interest money which would have allowed the 
implantation of a gigantic program of national development 
we dont have anything left to cut alan do is paralyze the 
country stop the administrative machine he said 
brazil suspende interest payments on part of it foreign debt for 
10 months in his year it said it could declare another moratorium 
sarney said brazil doesnt want a confrontation with its 
creditors 
we want a negotiated solution to reduce the debt together 
with other mechanisms outside the market the president said he 
praised a proposal by us treasury secretary nicholas bady to help 
nations buy back their debt at a diwe want to pay the debt but 
not if it means ireparable damage to the economy commenting on 
recent riots in venezuela sparked by economic problems there 
sarney said brazil has shown great maturity getting along with 
its problems without going to extremes 
he said brazilians have not been seduced by the temptation of 
violence or easy demagogic solutions for difficult problems but 
he said the government has a great social debt to its 144 
million people

a publishing house in western china has been 
binding 30 pages of a pornographic novel into elementary school 
grammar books an official newspaper reported today 
the china daily news said officials at the publishing house had 
yet to determine if a worker planned the escapade or their machines 
malfunctioned 
segments of the novel thoughts under the sun dirty ghosts 
from a dark cantonese corner began appearing in elementary 
school no 10 grammar book published this year 
so far the paper said it is unclear how many books included 
the pornography but 58000 copies of the grammar book were printed 
nationwide 
according to the report the pornographic segment begins right 
after the grammar books title page 
chapter three modern prostitution reads one section 
part 1 angels and beasts part 2 heaven and nymphs part 3 
girls looking for fun 
what follows is too dirty to read the paper said 
families around xian a major city in western china first 
discovered the books now they are demanding a recall 
it doesnt seem like the publishing company has much quality 
control said the father of one student if they do is it 
possible that they think the children need this kind of 
enlightenment 
according to the head of the shanxi province printing factory 
the grammar book was printed at the same time as thoughts under 
the sun 
but he said an investigation of the problem had yet to 
determine how it occurred 
maybe it was a mistake but maybe it involved a worker unhappy 
with the factory he said 
thoughts under the sun is a popular book and has gone 
through several printings 
since 1978 and chinas opening to the west pornography of both 
western and chinese origin has become increasingly popular

state treasurer a james manchin vowed 
he would remain in office even though he was impeached for the loss 
of 279 million in an investment fund he oversaw 
when you consider the leadership of the house thats 
behind all of this and how theyve been twisting arms and pushing 
im not surprised at the outcome of this vote manchin said after 
the house of delegates voted 6534 to impeach him on 17 of 18 
articles wednesday 
i have committed no wrong im going to stay around as long as 
i can 
the 61yearold twoterm democrat said he would remain in office 
even though conviction in the senate would mean that he could never 
run for office again and the immediate loss of his 50000 a year 
job it likely would jeopardize a pension estimated at 2128 a 
month too 
he faces removal from office if convicted by a twothirds vote 
of the 34member senate 
senate president larry tucker said that in consultation with 
state supreme court chief justice wt brotherton jr he has set a 
tentative date of june 12 to begin what he expects to be a 
monthlong trial brotherton will act as chief judge at the 
impeachment trial 
the impeachment resolution blamed manchin for delegating too 
much authority and failing to supervise the consolidated investment 
fund where the losses occurred primarily in april may and june 
1987 
the resolution also blamed him with making improper investments 
with state fund paying out interest that was not earned and 
covering up the losses 
the house vote came after more than six hours of debate 
wednesday 
most of the debate centered on a substitute motion to censure 
manchin but that was rejected 6039 
delegate james pitrolo defended manchin as a man who trusted 
subordinates who betrayed him the common argument advanced by 
manchin who said he knew nothing about finances and hired 
subordinates to do the work 
the house voted to drop one count based on manchins decision 
to hire arnold margolin as his assistant treasurer in charge of 
investments manchin has blamed margolin at various times during 
the impeachment hearings called a financial whiz kid and economic 
genius for causing the losses and hiding them from him 
the house of delegates also decided on 7028 vote to censure 
fourterm auditor glen gainer for his actions in the loss of the 
funds that were under the overall supervision of a board on which 
he and manchin served 
the censure motion means nothing legally against gainer except 
to give him a blot on his record as a state official he and 
manchin were on the state board of investments which had general 
supervision over the fund while the treasurers office had direct 
investment powers

us industry was 
launched into the space exploration business with the blastoff of 
the first licensed commercial spacecraft officials said 
the successful 15minute suborbital voyage wednesday of the 
consort 1 should convince potential investors and customers that 
private businesses can send a payload into space safely and 
reliably said carol lane director of the department of 
transportation office that issued the pioneer launch license 
i think well see growth she said minutes after the slender 
rocket shot its payload of scientific experiments 178 miles high 
the commercial space industry has been slow to develop and this 
is one of the most positive developments weve seen in a long 
time 
the 630pound payload capsule went through about seven minutes 
of near weightlessness then parachuted gently onto the desert 
floor of white sands missile range about 58 miles north of the 
launch pad 
a preliminary look at the payload contents showed the flight was 
successful said david dooling spokesman for the university of 
alabamahuntsville which sponsored the project 
as far as we can tell the scientific instruments worked well 
but we dont have any results yet he said we think this is an 
outstanding beginning not only for space exploration but for space 
experimentation 
the payload included experiments designed to measure how liquids 
mix in weightlessness how plastic foam forms and cures how 
liquids coat glass surfaces how epoxy reacts in weightlessness and 
how finely powdered metals bond under high temperature to produce 
alloys 
about 100 spectators cheered as the rocket streaked from its 
launch pad spewing yellow flame and leaving a white trail 
the rocket dropped its first stage six seconds and more than a 
mile into the voyage and disappeared from sight in about 25 
seconds 
most of the observers were employees or family members of 
employees of space services inc the houstonbased company that 
provided the rocket and launch services for the consort 1 
space services launched the conestoga 1 rocket in september 
1982 the first space shot by a private company that rocket 
carried a dummy payload and the launch was carried out before the 
transportation department had formulated guidelines for licensing 
private spacecraft 
the consort 1 was the first to be licensed and carry a real 
payload 
to launch conestoga 1 space services had to deal with 18 
government agencies the reagan administration directed the 
transportation department to issue launch licenses and cut through 
government red tape on private industrys behalf 
when we went up in 82 there was no infrastructure for 
commercial launches said bill vance space services vice 
president of finance and administration weve been working a 
long time to put up a successful launch its been a sixyear 
countdown weve been on long hold 
the consort 1 was a suborbital voyage meaning it went into 
space and back down again without circling the earth but space 
services plans a much more ambitious project to put a satellite 
into orbit possibly late next year company spokesman mark daniels 
said 
the cost of the consort 1 has been pegged at 1 million to 2 
million daniels said he expects space services annual revenues to 
reach 100 million to 500 million once it starts sending 
satellites into orbit

the japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average which rose 43092 points on 
wednesday added another 8885 points or 027 percent ending the 
day at 3282613 
the nikkei index lost 7405 points during the morning session

investors began buying shipbuilding and chemical issues in the 
afternoon dealers said 
investors appear not to be very concerned about factors such 
as us inflation and exchange rates said tetsuo ushijima an 
analyst for nomura securities it seems unlikely that the dollar 
will continue to rise he added 
trading led by individual players was active with volume on 
the markets first section estimated at 14 billion shares 
compared to 13 billion traded on wednesday 
on the foreign exchange market the dollar finished trading at

after opening slightly higher at 13327 yen the us currency 
edged down ranging between 13278 and 13330 yen during the day 
the dollar weakened as japanese investors reduced their dollar 
buying mainly due to position adjustments said a trader with the 
bank of tokyo 
concerted central bank intervention in the united states and 
europe for the last two days also indirectly helped stop the 
dollars recent rise he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
us and european central banks intervened in currency markets 
on tuesday and wednesday in an attempt to stabilize the dollar 
other dealers said market players were reluctant to continue 
buying dollars because of the upcoming group of seven g7 meeting 
of finance officials from major industrialized nations

parents dont deserve a tax break for paying 
tuition to send their children to private schools president bush 
says 
everybody should support the public school system and then if 
on top of that your parents think that they want to shell out in 
addition to the tax money tuition money thats their right 
bush told a student group but i dont think they should get a 
break for that 
he said it is the obligation of all taxpayers to support a 
public education system 
the reagan administration had supported the idea of tuition tax 
credits for parents who send their children to private schools but 
dropped the idea in a major overhaul of the tax system

the very young or very old make up the 
majority of americans living in poverty the census bureau says 
some 40 percent of the total 325 million poor americans were 
under 18 while those 65 or over constituted 107 percent of 
impoverished people the bureau reported 
the report poverty in the united states 1987 expanded on 
a study of income and poverty issued last august the earlier 
analysis found nearly onethird of all black americans living in 
poverty 
the poverty rate for children continues as it has since 1975 
to be higher than that for other age groups the new report said 
some 206 percent of the 632 million americans under age 18 
were listed as living in poverty compared with 135 percent of all 
americans 
this is a result of a number of factors including the increase 
of singleparent households and problems in collecting 
childsupport from the absent parent said ann kittlaus of the food

perhaps it wasnt even the most boring although it certainly 
seemed to be it was a visual and aural equivalent of empty 
calories after wednesday nights three hours and 15 minutes you 
still felt hungry 
the show as put together by producer allan carr had a theme of 
hollywood couples what it sadly lacked was a focus it begged for 
a host to tie it together it desperately needed a johnny carson or 
chevy chase who were hosts in previous years or even a billy 
crystal or robin williams who provided some of the nights only 
laughs 
it was a show without a single highlight without a memorable 
moment without an emotional peak it was flat from start to finish 
the shows only surprise the only relief in the tedium was 
jodie fosters win as best actress for her role in the accused 
nothing would have helped this show more than chopping its tacky 
20minute opening number and starting it with the presentation of 
the best supporting actress award carr wanted a shiny vehicle to 
pay tribute to hollywood extravaganzas what the abctv audience 
got was a flaming wreck 
an interesting thing about the oscar telecast is that every 
producer starts fresh each year no one ever seems to build on last 
years assets no one ever seems to learn from previous mistakes 
the biggest ongoing problem is that every new producer forgets 
this is an awards show the audience wants to see a competition 
they want to see the emotional highs of the winners and the 
letdown of the losers 
the producers also forget this is a show about the movies this 
years program seemed to have fewer film clips than any oscarcast 
in recent memory 
the one thing the oscar broadcast should not be yet every 
producer seems determined to make it such is a variety show filled 
with overblown production numbers next years producer should be 
forced to sign an oath remember the movies forget the 
extravaganza 
the most quotable quote walter matthau saying a stage hand 
said the show was running long tonight maybe it should be called 
awards and remembrances a reference to abcs 30hour 
miniseries war and remembrance 
shows best sight sean connery and roger moore two of the 
movies james bonds presenting the oscar for best supporting actor 
with michael caine 
shows funniest sight carrie fisher and martin short in the 
same dress 
shows best relief from the boredom billy crystal doing yul 
brynner as babe ruth edward g robinson as a gangster in the ten 
commandments and doing a tap dance soundalike with a cough drop 
in his mouth and robin williams as an overgrown mickey mouse 
a final thought douglas fairbanks presented all of the oscars 
in five minutes at the first academy awards presentation in 1927

the benevolent and loyal order of 
pessimists is canceling its annual conventions 
weve had enough traditions require too much optimism said 
bloop president jack duvall 
the group has met in the iowa city area once a year since 1975 
on a weekend closest to april 15 
not only is that income tax day its also the anniversary of 
the sinking of the titanic thats kind of a monument to optimism 
you recall it was the ship that couldnt be sunk said duvall 
duvall which is not his real name said he doesnt want to 
divulge his identity or background because as a pessimist you 
always worry about losing your job 
the conventions usually drew about 50 members who met to eat 
and drink and read messages and letters from chapter members 
unable to attend 
they also awarded a pessimist of the year trophy 
until a couple of years ago we gave away a really nice trophy 
in the shape of the rear end of a horse it was really quite 
coveted he said 
duvall said another chapter possibly on the west coast might 
want to host future conventions 
but mike grais spokesman for the los angeles chapter said 
nothing doing 
were too depressed about their decision to do anything about 
it he said

three admitted drug dealers were convicted in 
the murder of a rookie policeman whose death gained national 
prominence in last years presidential election and led to a major 
drive against drug traffickers 
scott cobb 25 todd scott 20 and philip copeland 23 were 
found guilty of seconddegree murder and weapons charges wednesday 
evening after two days of jury deliberations 
all three verdicts were met in the crowded courtroom by cheers 
and applause from police officers and friends and family of slain 
officer edward byrne 
speaking to reporters afterward matthew byrne said his sons 
murder was meant to send a message to society about the power 
of the drug dealers the guilty verdicts he said send a message 
from society dont kill cops 
prosecutors said byrne was killed early in the morning of feb 
26 1988 on orders from howard pappy mason a jailed drug lord 
who was seeking revenge for his weapons conviction earlier that 
week 
byrne was shot five times in the head at close range as he sat 
alone in a patrol car guarding the home of a witness in a drug case 
in the borough of queens 
in the wake of the slaying police established the tactical 
narcotics team which put a heavy police presence in the area the 
program has since been extended to other drugplagued neighborhoods 
and has resulted in thousands of arrests 
byrnes slaying also gained national attention during last 
years presidential election when the officers father presented 
his sons shield to then vice president george bush at a rally 
the elder byrne supported bushs prodeath penalty stance new 
york state does not have the death penalty 
the defendants each face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life 
on the murder charges and five to 15 years on the seconddegree 
criminal possession of a weapon convictions 
a fourth defendant david mcclary is to be tried later 
lawyers for the three convicted wednesday promised appeals

a new security zone in the waters 
off president bushs summer home is drawing fire from lobstermen 
who object to changing their fishing routines for their famous 
neighbor 
it would be a faux pas to say you poor fishermen cant 
fish basically what theyre saying is you can fish there if you 
can withstand the grief lobsterman jim nadeau said wednesday 
night after the coast guard announced lobster boats would be 
boarded and searched for bombs and terrorists before they can come 
within 500 yards of bushs home 
if i dont fish in there that one particular area will 
probably cost me 500 or 600 or 700 a week said nadeau who 
will keep working around the bush home at walkers point 
bush has said in the past he does not want to disrupt the 
lobstering done around his home by about three dozen fishermen but 
lobstermen said the bush entourage has caused problems since he was 
vice president 
lobstermen complain that coast guard cutters on security patrols 
have slashed the buoy lines on their lobster pots costing them 
hundreds of dollars as the traps and lobsters are lost 
coast guard capt rw bud breault jr acknowledged that 
more lobster traps will be destroyed with the new security zone 
and it may be difficult for the lobstermen to prove who did it if 
they try to file a claim 
this will have an impact on you and probably your lobster 
pots breault told the angry lobstermen in a special meeting 
some lobstermen said they will refuse to work the waters off 
bushs property because they dont want government officials 
boarding their boats 
none of us wants to be boarded on a regular basis said 
lobsterman knoep nieuwkerk who plans to stay away nobody wants 
to be boarded do you want police checking your car every day 
coast guard boats have cut lobster pot buoy lines because they 
are not equipped with cages that prevent propellers from 
slashing the lines the lobstermen said the coast guard said 
wednesday night it will install nozzles that wrap around the 
propellers on some of its smaller boats but not on the large 
cutters that will roam the safety zone and a larger area extending 
another 500 to 1000 yards farther out to sea

jodie foster who had the thrill and 
disappointment of an unsuccessful academy award nomination 13 years 
ago won the best actress oscar wednesday night for her portrayal 
of a rape victim in the accused 
this is such a big deal and my life is so simple the 
ebullient 26yearold actress told the shrine auditorium audience 
as she clutched the glistening trophy 
there are very few things there is love and work and family 
and this movie was so special to us because it was all three of 
those things she said 
in the accused miss foster played sarah tobias a brassy 
waitress who is raped by a gang in a taverns back room 
she reflected on the film in a touching tribute to her mother 
brandy who taught me that all of my fingerpaintings were 
picassos and that i didnt have to be afraid and mostly that 
cruelty might be very human and it might be very cultural but its 
not acceptable which is what this movie is about 
miss foster was previously nominated for an oscar in the 
supporting actress category at age 12 for her role as a prostitute 
in taxi driver 
the best actress oscar may focus attention on her maturity as an 
actress rather than the notoriety stemming from the attempted 
assassination of president reagan by john hinckley 
the mentallydisturbed drifter was trying to impress miss foster 
because of a fixation he developed after seeing taxi driver 14 
times 
before coming backstage to address the press following her oscar 
win a representative of the academy admonished reporters not to 
question the actress about the hinckley affair 
this is like winning the lottery or something miss foster 
said backstage this is my 24th year in the film industry and 
its probably the longest ive spent anywhere im very proud 
of the movie the movie is true and its honest it takes the truth 
and it smacks it in your face 
her growth as an actress was illustrated by the competition she 
faced for the award glenn close in dangerous liaisons meryl 
streep in a cry in the dark sigourney weaver in gorillas in 
the mist and melanie griffith in working girl

six black activists left the 
british embassy today a day after encamping there to protest 
police restrictions on their activities an escaped detaineee 
remained in the us consulate 
almost as soon as the six activists arrived at the british 
embassy in pretoria on wednesday british officials made clear they 
disapproved of the protest and asked that the group leave 
the activists left today after having requested britain to 
pressure the south african government to lift all restrictions on 
them and other former detainees foreign minister rf botha said 
the five men and one woman would not be arrested 
the embassy said the six would be able to make an effective 
protest to the government only if they ended their sitin and we 
therefore welcome their decision to leave 
antiapartheid groups had complained about the embassys refusal 
to allow the six to use telephones and toilets in the building 
the national union of mineworkers a militantly antiapartheid 
black union described britains stance toward the activists as 
shocking and inhuman 
denying them facilities necessary for human habitation 
confirms out longheld views that apartheid repression is fully 
supported by the british government for the realization of super 
profits accruing from their sanctionbusting companies in south 
africa the union said in a statement 
simon ntombela 27 was in the us consulate in a downtown 
johannesburg office building after escaping in his pajamas 
wednesday from a hospital in durban 360 miles away ntombela 
reportedly took a commercial flight to johannesburg 
the human rights commission a private group said ntombela was 
seeking the end of his detention without restrictions and 
unconditional freedom for all other detainees the commission said 
ntombela ended a hunger strike wednesday 
law and order minister adriaan vlok was scheduled to meet 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu and other antiapartheid clergymen 
today to discuss the fate of scores of activists still detained 
under an emergency declared nearly three years ago to control 
uprisings in black communities 
botha said wednesday that the six would not be arrested if they 
left the embassy although some had violated their restrictions 
one of the six labor official donsie khumalo is barred from 
political activities confined to his home at night and must report 
to a police station twice daily 
botha said ntombelas case was being studied and a decision 
would be made about his possible release 
ntombela was the eighth detainee to escape from a hospital since 
september three who took refuge in the us consulate in 
johannesburg and four who reached the west german embassy in 
pretoria were later allowed by the government to go free 
an estimated 600 activists have gone on hunger strikes this year 
to protest their detention without trial 
the government announced wednesday that it would now place 
hunger strikers in prison or in hospitals in bloemfontein a 
relatively remote provincial center to prevent escapes and 
publicity about them 
authorities have freed most detainees since the fasts began but 
has placed severe restrictions on their activities human rights 
sources say several hundred remain in detention including more 
than 30 on hunger strikes 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained for varying 
periods under the emergency declared in june 1986 
under apartheid the countrys 28 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

a heart attack drug developed through genetic 
engineering appears to be no better than an older medicine that is 
much cheaper scientists reported today 
the study in the new england journal of medicine found that the 
older drug streptokinase is just as good as tpa or tissue 
plasminogen activator at preserving the heart after a heart attack 
because the allocation of scarce health resources is a cause 
of concern the report concluded the lower cost of 
streptokinase is an important factor in its favor 
in an accompanying editorial dr elliot rapaport said one 
treatment of streptokinase costs 78 at san francisco general 
hospital while tpa costs 2268 
earlier research showed that both drugs break up clots that 
block the heart arteries and both can significantly reduce the 
chances of death if given quickly after a heart attack however 
many experts assumed that the newer drug tpa was better 
several studies have examined the merits of the two treatments 
the authors of the latest work said theirs is the first to compare 
them headtohead in people treated during the first three hours of 
heart attacks the period during which medicines have the best 
chance of saving the heart 
the report concluded that the health of the left ventricle the 
main pumping chamber of the heart was the same regardless of which 
medicine the patients got 
the study was conducted by dr harvey d white and colleagues 
from green lane hospital in auckland new zealand it involved 270 
heart attack patients who were ramdomly assigned to receive one of 
the two medicines 
after nine months 6 percent of the tpa patients and 9 percent 
of the streptokinase patients had died however the researchers 
said the number of people treated was too small to determine 
whether there is a true difference in the death rate

225000strong islamic community today after the slaying of a 
moslem leader who criticized irans call to kill author salman 
rushdie 
gunmen killed imam abdullah ahdal the saudi leader of moslems 
in belgium the netherlands and luxembourg in an attack wednesday 
at ahdals office in the islamic cultural center 
because of the attack protective measures for members of the 
islamic community were increased immediately interior minister 
louis tobback in a statement 
he said police will start preventive patrols in moslem 
neighborhoods aimed at restoring the peace of mind within this 
community 
separately police said they have reinforced security checks at 
the borders and airports 
police said ahdal 36 and librarian salem behir a 40yearold 
tunisian were shot at close range 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack 
and police said there were no witnesses unconfirmed reports said 
three hooded men were seen jumping from a van entering the mosque 
and then fleeing 
in london a senior moslem cleric today blamed the murders on 
jealousy between moslems after belgian authorities designated the 
brussels mosque where the slayings took place as the official 
mosque in belgium 
that creates a lot of jealousies and resentments zaki 
badawi president of the united kingdom council of imams and 
mosques said in a telephone interview the organization is one of 
about a dozen separate moslem religious bodies in britain 
ahdal an imam or preacher had been in brussels for six years 
heading the moslem community in belgium the netherlands and 
luxembourg 
behir who headed the mosques social services and library 
lived in the city for about 10 years 
ahdals center in a park near the european economic community 
headquarters is sponsored by the mecca saudi arabiabased moslem 
world league which was set up by the late saudi ruler king faisal 
to unite moslems 
on feb 14 irans fundamentalist patriarch ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini called on moslems to kill rushdie a naturalized briton 
for his novel the satanic verses many moslems consider the 
book blasphemous 
in a television interview feb 20 the day the 12 european 
economic community countries recalled their ambassadors from iran 
in response to the death decree ahdal said he agreed rushdies 
book was blasphemous 
but he said of khomeinis death sentence one should not have 
done that rushdie should have first appeared before an islamic 
tribunal he should have explained himself defended himself he 
should have been asked to repent 
in democratic societies everyone has the right to speak his 
thoughts to express himself as he wants ahdal told rtbf 
belgiums frenchlanguage television network 
claude van engeland an rtbf reporter said wednesday the 
network received angry phone calls after the interview from callers 
who claimed ahdal who spoke in arabic was improperly translated 
after the killings police cordoned off the building 
at one point a woman wearing a black veil emerged from the 
building and threatened a reporter with a handgun several police 
officers struggled with the woman and wrested the gun from her 
they said later she was ahdals widow 
rushdie born in india to a moslem is in hiding in britain 
moslems are deeply offended by the satanic verses because of 
a brothel scene in which prostitutes take the names of the prophet 
mohammeds wives and because the novel suggests mohammed wrote the 
holy koran instead of receiving it from allah

the main iranian opposition group claims 
the countrys newly ousted un ambassador was jailed on orders 
from fundamentalist patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini iran 
denied the claim 
the mujahedeen khalq holy warriors said in a telex sent 
wednesday from its headquarters in baghdad iraq that the envoy 
mohammad jaafar mahallati was arrested after returning from new 
york 
it was only a short period after his arrest that the khomeini 
regime announced his resignation on the false excuse of illness and 
doctors recommendations the statement said it could not be 
independently confirmed 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia later denied that mahallati had been arrested 
the agency quoted an unidentified foreign ministry source as 
saying the report was quite baseless 
mahallatis resignation was announced tuesday by irna hours 
before khomeinis designated successor was ousted in an apparent 
crackdown on moderates in the administration 
ayatollah hussein ali montazeri 64 was dumped after voicing 
open criticism in recent weeks of the 10yearold islamic 
revolutions shortcomings and calling for greater freedoms 
he was named in 1985 as successor to khomeini now 88 and 
ailing but had fallen into disfavor for his liberal views and 
growing alignment with former prime minister mehdi bazargan 
bazargan the revolutionary governments first prime minister 
heads a token opposition grouping known as the freedom movement 
the first indications of a shakeup in the iranian leadershp came 
sunday when the resignation of deputy foreign minister mohammad 
javad larijani was announced 
mahallati and larijani both americaneducated had worked to 
improve relations with western nations after the unsponsored 
ceasefire last august in the eightyear iraniraq war 
together with montazeri they appeared to be casualties of a 
resurgence of radical fundamentalism in iran following khomeinis 
harsh attack last month on rebuilding ties with the west 
the two diplomats belonged to the socalled pragmatist camp led 
by the powerful parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani which also 
includes the foreign minister ali akbar velayati 
rafsanjani and his supporters have argued that opening up to the 
west was essential for reconstructing the economy in the postwar 
period 
but khomeini denounced attempts to liberalize iran citing 
british author salman rushdies novel the satanic verses as 
proof western nations were trying to undermine islam 
on feb 14 khomeini ordered moslems to seek out and kill 
rushdie who was born to a moslem family in india for allegedly 
blaspheming islam with the book 
last week he said iran had drifted away from the values of its 
1979 revolution whose aim he asserted was still the creation of 
a global islamic government

at least 29 people have died and 127 
have been injured in ethnic riots in a southern province and some 
victims bled to death because fierce fighting prevented them from 
reaching hospitals news reports said today 
the death toll reported by the belgrade daily vecernje novosti 
was four higher than that given by officials an unofficial emigre 
group put the death count at 137 
an official newspaper suggested the higher numbers were aimed at 
fomenting more unrest in the province of kosovo 
marija gasi a spokeswoman for kosovos government information 
office told reporters today 23 people had died and 92 
demonstrators and 121 policemen had been injured 
vecernje novosti cited the latest available information for 
the report from pristina the provincial capital reliable sources 
in pristina said they had heard the same death toll from police 
vecernje novosti said two policemen and 27 demonstrators died in 
clashes monday and tuesday between security forces and ethnic 
albanians it said 97 demonstrators and 30 policemen were injured 
in the bloodshed which was sparked by a decision to give the 
republic of serbia more control over kosovo its autonomous 
province 
serbs contend the constitutional changes which took effect 
tuesday are needed to protect kosovos mainly christian slav 
minority from the mainly moslem ethnic albanians who make up 85 
percent of the 19 million population 
ethnic albanians say the changes threaten autonomy won under 
yugoslavias 1974 constitution 
vecernje novosti said seven kosovo settlements dominated by the 
provinces slav minority had set up patrols and posted guards 
around the settlements 
another belgrade daily borba said a policeman who died in 
titova mitrovica on monday after being shot did not die immediately 
but bled to death because intense rioting delayed his transfer to a 
hospital 
other media accounts said another wounded police officer had to 
wait an hour before getting to a hospital because of the fighting 
and died shortly afterward 
borba a communist party daily indicated some of the worst 
violence occurred in the village of zur near the border with 
albania it said protesters there used bombs in the clashes 
some of the bombs exploded prematurely and injured several 
demonstrators it said 
borba also said five policemen caught between demonstrators in 
the village of dusanovo had to be rescued by helicopters 
the entire province was under a nighttime curfew 
the slovene communist party daily delo took the unusual step of 
publishing on its front page today what it said were casualty 
figures from an emigre albanian group in brussels those figures 
listed 137 dead and 370 injured 
yugoslav authorities have said ethnic albanian emigre groups 
foment unrest in kosovo and exaggerate casualty figures 
police refused comment on the reports of higher death tolls and 
borba suggested the numbers were intended to instigate further 
unrest 
the enemy is trying everything to incite the revolt of the 
ethnic albanian population it said to this end they are 
using in particular disinformation about the number of killed 
demonstrators

five casinos accused of giving vip 
treatment to a teenager have agreed to pay penalties of up to 
100000 for allowing a minor to gamble 
the state casino control commission will meet next week to 
actually set the fines which were proposed in an agreement 
announced wednesday between the casinos and the state division of 
gaming enforcement 
the casinos were charged with treating 17yearold debra kim 
cohen as a high roller even though she was under the legal gambling 
age of 21 
miss cohen lost thousands of dollars playing blackjack and was 
offered free rooms drinks limousine rides shows and meals by the 
casinos 
leonard cohen tried to stop his daughters compulsive gambling 
by sending the casinos letters and photographs of her and warning 
security guards to turn her away in some cases miss cohen 
continued on as a preferred customer 
the proposed penalties were caesars 100000 resorts 
international 21762 harrahs marina 36387 trump plaza 
7287 and elsinores atlantis 14562 
gaming regulators had rejected the casinos initial proposal to 
make donations to medical facilities instead 
although it sounds like a lot of money its a slap on the 
wrist to these industry giants the teenagers father said 
its like paying a parking ticket 
he advocated legislation to tighten penalties against casinos 
that allow underage gambling 
last year miss cohen pleaded guilty to underage gambling and 
was ordered to attend gamblers anonymous meetings 
if the fine set by the casino commission is less than the 
proposed penalties the gaming halls will donate the difference to 
treatment centers for compulsive gamblers said assistant attorney 
general mitchel schwefel

british airways promised today to punish those 
responsible for letting a jumbo jet fly with explosives left on 
board by a bombdetection team during a drill 
the incident sparked a new controversy over airline security 
after the dec 21 bombing of pan am flight 103 
a cleaning worker found the gelignite which officials said 
could flare up but not explode aboard the boeing 747 on monday at 
londons heathrow airport said independent television news which 
broke the story wednesday night 
the flight had just returned from a flight to toronto 
police confirmed the incident saying one of their 
bombdetection teams inadvertently left the explosives on board 
after using the aircraft in an exercise to train sniffer dogs 
the department of transport said today it has called for an 
urgent report british airways chairman lord king promised a most 
thorough and detailed investigation saying if heads fall 
they fall 
an airline spokesman derek ross said cleaners found the 
substance under a seat at the rear of the plane itn news said it 
was left there for about two weeks during which the boeing 747 
made several journeys 
today airport sources said it was believed the package was 
placed in a seat pocket and then slipped through into the 
upholstery 
the latest controversy follows widespread charges that tranpsort 
secretary paul channon was lax about sending airlines warnings 
about a new type of radio cassette bomb before the pan am flight 
103 disaster on dec 21 that killed 270 people 
flight 103 which originated in frankfurt was blown up over 
lockerbie scotland after taking off from heathrow authorities 
believe a bomb was encased in a radiocassette player 
prime minister margaret thatcher has defended channon but 
speculation remains that she will drop him from the cabinet later 
this year 
scotland yard said police use british airways planes for 
explosivesearch training from time to time 
police inspector andrew nielson said the explosive weighed less 
than a pound and measured about 4 inches by 8 inch 
he said the substance was incapable of exploding by itself and 
at the very worst it could flare up if ignited by fire nobody at 
any time has been placed in any danger 
but lawmaker david wilshire a member of the governing 
conservative party and whose constituency includes the airport 
said british airways was responsible for the incident 
id say to ba theres evidence growing by the week that 
you arent carrying out your responsibility properly wilshire 
said in a radio interview the buck stops with ba on this 
occasion 
itn last week showed videotape taken by three youths who said 
they boarded an empty british airways jumbo jet at heathrow on 
march 20 without being challenged the video included a shot of one 
youth sitting in the captains seat 
british airways said it regarded the incident as extremely 
serious but stressed it took place in a maintenance area and not 
the operational area 
the opposition labor partys spokesman for transport john 
prescott called for a new supervisory security body at heathrow 
and accused the police of sloppiness its a breakdown yet again 
of simple procedures he said

moslem guerrillas appear to be 
increasing operations closer to the capital after failing to 
dislodge government forces from the eastern city of jalalabad 
sources said today 
one report reaching kabul said government troops and tanks came 
under heavy fire wednesday along the salang highway about 45 miles 
north of the city kabul itself has been generally quiet 
in pakistan the guerrillas claimed to have captured a military 
post west of jalalabad effectively blocking the road between that 
city and kabul they also claimed to have killed at least 147 
government troops in fighting this week 
a foreign official in kabul speaking on condition of anonymity 
said an afghan civilian reported serious fighting and destroyed 
tanks along the salang highway north of kabul there was no word 
on casualties 
government troops a few miles outside kabul have been firing 
rockets west and northwest of the city since tuesday the number of 
longrange scudb missiles fired from kabul toward jalalabad also 
has increased 
western reporters and foreign residents of the capital counted 
at least 13 fired wednesday and at least four more were launched 
in a 10minute period early today 
the sovietsupplied missiles can easily reach jalalabad 75 
miles away 
the usbacked guerrillas began their attack on jalalabad on 
march 6 it was their first major offensive against government 
forces since soviet troops completed their withdrawal feb 15 
ending nine years of direct combat support for the kabul government 
jalalabads fall would be a major blow to the morale of the 
government and a big boost to the rebels western observers have 
predicted a domino effect ending with kabul 
evidence of guerrilla activity near kabul also surfaced when a 
un convoy carrying seeds and fertilizer was caught in crossfire 
for about six hours sunday just beyond kabuls northwestern 
outskirts 
a un official said the shooting began when guerrillas opened 
fire on people distributing seeds he said the un workers were not 
hurt 
the government says its troops are still in control of 
jalalabad according to its casualty reports the guerrillas have 
suffered about 10 times more fatalities than government troops 
claims by both sides tend to be exaggerated and cannot usually 
be confirmed 
the guerrillarun afghan news agency said 147 government troops 
were killed this week it said at least 114 were killed or wounded 
since tuesday around jalalabad 
the agency also said guerrilla commanders rejected afghan 
president najibs appeal for them to give up their war in exchange 
for local autonomy najib made the appeal tuesday 
if najib wants to stop the bloodshed this is the best 
opportunity for him to quit his office and recognize the interim 
islamic government the agency said 
also today an explosion blew out the windows of a fourstory 
building in the heart of kabuls commercial district 
an official of the government press office said the blast was 
caused by a bomb planted by the extremists and that two people 
were injured 
but a policeman at the scene who did not give his name told 
foreign journalists a canister of gas used for cooking or heating 
blew up

divorce from his americanborn wife margaret the government 
announced 
a petition for the divorce was filed by papandreous lawyer 
athanasios liapis before an athens court and will be discussed on 
june 5 said government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos

to his 37year marriage to the former margaret chant of elmhurst 
ill 
mrs papandreou 66 who has been accused of delaying divorce 
proceedings has said she was still waiting to see her husband to 
discuss details of their divorce 
papandreou 70 left his wife to live with his 34yearold 
girlfriend former olympic airways stewardess dimitra liani in 
october when he returned from london where he had undergone 
openheart surgery 
the open relationship has offended some of the socialist 
premiers supporters and liani has been accused by the news media 
of exerting her influence over government ministers and leading 
papandreou to neglect his health 
the affair has played a major role in papandreous waning 
popularity among voters according to published public opinion 
polls 
the divorce could be issued in two months shortly before the 
scheduled june 18 elections only if mrs papandreou agrees to 
grant it 
if both parties dont agree divorce proceedings could drag on 
for more than two years before the court sanctions a divorce

the nrc has fined turkey point about 1 million over the last 
five years for safety and security violations identifying the 
plant as one of the nations 10 worst 
clark said at least three of six controlroom crews and 11 of 24 
individuals who took requalification exams earlier this month 
failed all or part of the test which is given to operators at 
regular intervals 
the plant has 52 controlroom operators those who fail any part 
of the test cannot work in the control room until recertified 
clark said workers take the exams individually and are also tested 
on their ability work as a team 
ms shaw said the reactor will remain closed while the utility 
demonstrates to the nrc that those running it are qualified she 
said the plant was to shut down later this week in any case for 
routine maintenance 
ms shaw said only a couple of those who failed are actively 
operating the plants reactors many who flunked she said are no 
longer working in the control rooms 
unit 3 was reduced to hot shutdown allowing it to return on 
line quickly if the nrc agrees unit 4 the other generator was 
out of operation for refueling 
clark said that nrc also is demanding that the utility present a 
plan by may to solve training deficiencies

a police spokesman said 14 people suffered shrapnel and glass 
shard wounds from the butane gas explosions after the attack on the 
depot 
syrian gunners also fired two rockets into the citys sin elfil 
district this morning said the spokesman who cannot be named 
under police regulations two people died there and three were 
injured he said 
the casualties raised the overall toll to 125 people killed and 
405 wounded since march 8 in fighting between christians and 
moslems 
the spokesman said more than 250000 of beiruts 12 million 
residents have fled to southern lebanon since the clashes erupted 
between the christian soldiers of gen michel aoun and syrian 
forces backing militiamen of druse warlord walid jumblatts 
progressive socialist party 
the rockets struck tanks of butane cooking gas at the dora 
district depot where fires sparked by earlier shelling already 
have destroyed 60 percent of lebanons gasoline reserves and 60 
percent of its diesel reserves 
butane is leaking from nearby tanks and exploding in balls of 
fire in midair over dora a local reporter said by telephone 
the police spokesman said the explosions smashed windows in a 
threemile radius 
a senior oil ministry official raymond roufaiel said the fire 
blazing uncontrolled in dora had consumed 10 million worth of 
gasoline and more than 35 million gallons of diesel oil 
we can hardly manage to encircle the blaze and try to prevent 
it from spreading to outside the tanks region said a beirut 
fire official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the moslemchristian rift deepened six months ago when president 
amin gemayels term expired and parliament was unable to agree on a 
successor 
just before leaving office gemayel named aoun a maronite 
catholic leader of an interim military cabinet 
moslems and syria rejected the appointment because it violated 
an unwritten national covenant that gave the premiership to the 
sunni moslems the presidency to the maronites and the house 
speakership to the shiite moslems 
they pledged allegiance to acting prime minister salim hoss who 
seeks political reforms that will give the countrys moslems an 
equal share of power with the traditionally dominant christians 
the latest violence round of began when aoun clamped a blockade 
march 6 on illegal militiarun ports which deprive the government 
of tax revenues and are used to bring in supplies for the war 
jumblatt retaliated by shelling christian territory the syrians 
later joined in the artillery duels across the 310square mile area 
where the countrys christians live

congressman defeated for reelection last year amid reports linking 
him to the pentagon procurement scandal died today after a battle 
with bone cancer he was 67 
chappell a conservative democrat from northeastern floridas 
4th district died at the national institutes of health where he 
had been hospitalized feb 23 
the former chairman of the powerful defense appropriations 
subcommittee lost to republican newcomer craig james last fall by 
791 votes out of about 250000 cast chappell challenged the

men tied to defense contractor martin marietta intervened in a 
foreclosure lawsuit against chappell involving a racquet club he 
owned 
the congressman had dismissed the allegations as bunk and 
hogwash 
i think it is mainly political he said during the campaign 
in my position ive stepped on some toes primarily in the 
pentagon 
while in the house chappell was a strong proponent of a 
balanced budget he also fought to retain a mannedbomber force and 
for a fifth nuclearpowered aircraft carrier and sponsored 
legislation that created an assistant secretary of defense for 
reserve affairs

iran said it ordered the swiss consul in 
tehran expelled today an apparent response to switzerlands 
insistence that irans consul in geneva return home after being 
accused of spying 
tehran radio said swiss ambassador heinrich reimann was summoned 
to irans foreign ministry and told his consul jakob schranz had 
one week to leave 
the radio monitored in nicosia said the ambassador was told 
schranz was an undesirable element because he had been 
involved in activities incompatible with his diplomatic status 
a term the normally implies spying 
an operator who answered the telephone at the swiss embassy in 
tehran said there were no officials there to comment on the radio 
report 
the expulsion appeared to come in retaliation for swiss pressure 
on irans consul in geneva manouchr talemassouleh to return 
home the iranian diplomat left wednesday for tehran according to 
iranian officials in geneva 
swiss officials in geneva said iranian authorities had agreed to 
have talemassouleh leave after the diplomat was accused of spying 
josef hermann a spokesman for the swiss federal prosecutors 
office said talemassouleh was not being expelled because an 
accord had been reached on his departure 
hermann said swiss authorities were conducting a criminal 
investigation into two people suspected of helping the iranian 
diplomat gather information but their nationalities or whereabouts 
have not been disclosed 
questions about talemassoulehs activities surfaced after the 
geneva consulate was occupied for five hours dec 14 by six iranian 
militants 
the iranians read what they said were confidential documents by 
telephone to accomplices outside 
at their trial in geneva in january they claimed the documents 
showed talemassouleh led efforts to spy on iranian refugees in 
switzerland 
transcripts sent to swiss authorities and media were dismissed 
by the iranian diplomat as forgeries 
but hermann said swiss authorities verified certain points 
among the very voluminous documentation he did not elaborate 
the consulate occupiers six men aged 25 to 41 all received 
fourmonth suspended prison sentences they said their action was a 
protest against executions in iran 
the geneva court threw out the prosecutions most serious charge 
of hostagetaking it said the accused deserved clemency because 
their motive of drawing attention to the dramatic situation in 
their country was honorable 
in st gall switzerland a swiss publisher who planned to print 
the satanic verses in german received a death threat prompting 
police to provide him protection authorities said today 
iranian clerics last month offered 52 million to any moslem 
who kills the novels british author salman rushdie who has 
remained in hiding since then many moslems find the book 
blasphemous 
a st gall police spokesman said that after an anonymous 
telephone threat against the publisher hansjoerg tobler 
necessary measures were taken for his safety the spokesman 
who declined to be identified would not give further details 
a spokeswoman for toblers company panorama based in altstetten 
near st gall declined to say when the book was scheduled for 
publication 
news reports said tobler was reconsidering whether to print the 
book but the spokeswoman said he was not available for comment 
the novel includes passages in which prostitutes go by the names 
of the prophet mohammeds wives and which suggest mohammed wrote 
the holy koran instead of allah

beginning this spring soviet students can defer 
their military service until after they have completed their 
education newspapers reported today 
the defense ministry newspaper krasnaya zvezda said that under 
the new rules students who go through officer training programs 
can also expect to be essentially exempted from callup for 
peacetime service after they graduate 
previously soviet students were liable for callup in the 
middle of their studies under soviet law every ablebodied male 
between the ages of 18 and 25 must serve at least two years in the 
military 
changes in the draft system have been under discussion for the 
last five years said the young communist league newspaper 
komsmolskaya pravda 
there have been some calls for a complete end to the draft 
which is estimated to take 80 percent of the male population 
normally at age 18 
now it has become obvious to everyone that a twotothree year 
break in studies spent on soldiering leads to a serious lowering of 
students educational level gf kutzev deputy head of the 
state education committee was quoted as saying 
and the national defense capability itself depends to a great 
extent on what kind of intellectual cadres we have what kind of 
specialists we prepare he said 
according to kutzev the system of officer training courses is 
being reorganized 
they will be canceled in some schools added in others and 
generally reoriented toward subjects with civilian applications 
knowledge received in officer training courses should 
contribute toward the mastering of a civilian specialty and vice 
versa he said after all its obvious that we need reserves 
of highly qualified officers mathematicians chemists 
electronics experts 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev plans to cut back the soviet 
armed forces by 500000 troops as part of his strategy to devote 
fewer resources to defense and more to the national economy 
about 75 percent of soviet military personnel are conscripts

the ranking republican on the house armed 
services committee is calling on the bush administration and his 
gop colleagues to reject a democratic plan to overhaul the nations 
landbased missile force 
rep bill dickinson of alabama said the plan under which 50 mx 
missiles would be moved from silos to a mobile rail garrison basing 
mode is a bad deal because it would place unacceptable limits 
on key defense programs 
he said it would limit the number of 10warhead mx missiles to 
the 50 already fielded and start construction of 300 to 500 of the 
smaller midgetman intercontinental ballistic missiles 
it also would mean negative growth in the defense budget and 
reduced funding for star wars and the stealth bomber programs as a 
way of paying for the midgetman 
unless the terms of this deal improve dramatically i hope 
that president bush and defense secretary richard b cheney 
ignore it altogether dickinson said in a statement issued 
wednesday 
the illusion of small icbm inevitability that has been 
cultivated by congressional democrats in recent months is just that 
illusion he added 
democrats have favored the singlewarhead midgetman while former 
president reagan and many congressional republicans have pushed for 
the 10warhead mx as a member of the house cheney was an mx 
supporter 
since taking over as defense secretary however cheney has not 
indicated if he would back a plan based on the mx the midgetman or 
a combination of the two national security adviser brent scowcroft 
is an opponent of the mx 
on capitol hill support has been building among majority 
democrats for the plan to move the 50 existing mx missiles from 
vulnerable silos to a rail garrison basing mode placing them on 
railroad cars and moving them around the country and build a 
midgetman force of 300 to 500 
dickinson said however that the plan represented a variant of 
previous efforts to reduce pentagon spending 
what we are seeing now on the small icbm is the same 
twofisted attack on defense that we see from the liberals on the 
defense bill every year he said

two czechoslovak teenagers who 
hijacked a jetliner after shooting their way onto the aircraft in 
prague may face extradition but the process could take months an 
official said today 
hungarys staterun mti news agency reported that the malev 
airlines jet had returned to the capital budapest along with its 
four crew members and the hungarian consulgeneral lajos taba 
taba traded himself to the hijackers wednesday to gain the 
release of most of the passengers before the plane took off for 
frankfurt 
mti and the official czechoslovak news agency ctk identified the 
youths as stefan macicko 17 and dusan styk 16 both of banska 
frankfurt police did not release their names 
frankfurt prosecutors spokesman hubert harth said he did not 
know if the hijackers had requested political asylum in west 
germany our main concern is dealing with the criminal act of 
hijacking he said 
officials say the two initially wanted to go to the united 
states but were foiled when the crew said the sovietmade 
tupolev154 could not make the trip over the atlantic 
the teenagers armed with a sawedoff shotgun rifle and fake 
hand grenade commandeered the aircraft wednesday in prague they 
surrendered less than three hours later and no one was injured in 
the accident 
harth said in a telephone interview the hijackers may be 
extradited to czechoslovakia but that it would be a slow process 
a decision on possible extradition would have to be made at 
federal government level and that wont come quickly it could 
take months 
hans neitzel chief spokesman for the frankfurt police 
department said officials did not know why the boys decided to 
hijack the airliner 
they said they wanted to go to america but why they wanted to 
go whether they have relatives there or what we dont know maybe 
it was just youthful adventure he said wednesday night 
witnesses at pragues ruzyne airport told the associated press 
the hijackers seized a woman crashed through a glass wall of the 
vip lounge fired several shots and threatened a flight attendant 
to gain access to the jet 
about 100 people were on board the jet which had arrived from 
budapest and was en route to amsterdam taba traded himself for 82

the army sealed off the west bank and 
gaza strip today as israeli arabs joined palestinians in a general 
strike and flagwaving protests against israeli occupation on a 
bitter anniversary 
israeli troops shot and killed one palestinian arab reports 
listed 19 wounded in the west bank while the army listed four 
rallies in support of the palestinian uprising went off 
peacefully for the most part in northern israel but police 
arrested 20 arabs for possessing leaflets officials said could 
incite violence 
the strike by arabs in israel and the occupied lands 
commemorates the march 30 1976 deaths of six israeli arabs who 
were shot by israeli troops while protesting the governments 
seizure of arab land for an army firing range 
army reinforcements were called up in both the west bank and 
gaza to prevent unrest on this anniversary known as land day 
starting at midnight the army banned palestinians from entering 
israel for 24 hours 
in the most extensive closure since november the army imposed a 
curfew in the gaza strip confining all 650000 residents to their 
homes large areas of the west bank were either under curfew or 
closed to journalists who did not have an army escort 
outlawed black red white and green palestinian flags fluttered 
from electricity poles and rooftops throughout the west bank 
an army spokesman said a 20yearold palestinian carrying a 
large stone was shot and killed in the village of shweike near 
tulkarem as he was about to ambush an army officer in a narrow 
alleyway 
the army said another palestinian died overnight after a clash 
in the west bank village of salfit between soldiers and protesters 
israel radio said his body was found in a car with four wanted 
activists 
the deaths brought to 414 the number of palestinians killed 
since the uprising against israeli occupation began in december 
1987 eighteen israelis have also died 
in the northern israeli village of kfar kanna about 400 moslem 
fundamentalists marched carrying green islamic banners and chanted 
koranic verses 
antiisraeli protests and marches were also planned in three 
other villages inside israel including nazareth where jesus spent 
his youth 
police said strikeenforcers hurled stones at taxi cabs breaking 
the strike in nazareth where shops were closed and police guarded 
the entrance to the predominantly arab town of 40000 
on the golan heights which israel annexed after capturing it 
from syria underground leaflets were distributed to druse arabs 
calling on them to join the land day strike 
ehud olmert israels arab affairs minister said on israel 
television wednesday night that the protests were not justified and 
warned arab leaders face a special responsibility test and i 
hope they pass it for the benefit of good relations 
the involvement of israeli arabs who account for 740000 of 
israels 42 million people raised particular concern in israel 
the nearly 16month palestinian uprising has led arabs with israeli 
citizenship to increasingly identify with the 17 million 
palestinians in the occupied lands 
in a recent editorial the yediot ahronot newspaper said there 
was an effort by the underground leadership of the uprising to 
sweep israels arabs into extremism and bloodshed 
the last sympathy strike by israeli arabs commemorated the 
proclamation of a palestinian state by the plos parliament which 
met in algiers nov 15 
police said the number of attacks carried out by palestinian 
nationalists in israel 69 before in 1987 jumped to 208 last 
year 
in the most serious incident 25 israelis were wounded by 
grenades in a haifa shopping district last august 
last year 30000 israeli arabs marched on land day in support 
of the palestinian revolt against israels 21year occupation 
there were no major incidents of violence inside israel but four 
palestinians died in clashes in the west bank and gaza

a judge today ordered a 17yearold youth 
returned to alabama rejecting arguments that his extradition to 
face a possible death sentence would violate the district of 
columbias ban on capital punishment 
nothing in the constitution or elsewhere grants the district 
of columbia the power to enforce beyond its borders the districts 
moral opposition to the death penalty superior court judge 
stephen f eilperin said 
in his 27page ruling eilperin gave alabama authorities until 
may 1 to pick up the 17yearold identified only by the initials 
om but he issued an immediate stay of his order until tuesday to 
give defense lawyers time to appeal his decision 
om faces alabama juvenile delinquency charges of arson and 
murder in connection with a may 1988 firebombing of a gadsden 
ala apartment in that incident 14month old tamel jackson was 
killed 
eilperin said the constitution leaves no room for the district 
to interpose its objection to capital punishment between om and 
alabama 
alabama is entitled to have alabama law govern criminal acts 
committed on alabama soil by citizens of alabama against citizens 
of alabama eliperin said 
although not the key issue in this case the age of the 
defendant could become more of one in light of arguments in two 
cases heard monday by the supreme court 
the high court is deliberating whether imposing the death 
penalty on murderers who committed their crimes before the age of 
18 represents cruel and unusual punishment banned by the eighth 
amendment to the constitution 
a ruling is expected in july 
the boys attorney gerald fisher argued at a hearing tuesday 
that legislation pased by the districts city council outlawing the 
death penalty must be applied by district courts to the interstate 
agreement governing juvenile extraditions 
but paul alper assistant corporation counsel for the district 
government said the districts obligation to enforce the 
interstate agreement was not changed by the councils ban on 
capital punishment 
alper said the agreement does not give the district the 
discretion to approve or reject juvenile extradition requests on 
the basis of whether the juvenile might face the death penalty if 
extradited 
eilperin seemed reluctant during tuesdays hearing to accept the 
contention by oms lawyers that the districts ban on capital 
punishment would be violated if he approved alabamas extradition 
request 
he told fisher a major problem with the argument was that 
om is not threatened by the death penalty if he is tried as a 
juvenile and if alabama decided to try him as an adult eilperin 
said he would be obligated under the constitution to approve the 
extradition regardless of the ban on capital punishment 
but fisher said alabama authorities cannot certify om for 
trial as an adult thus subjecting him to a possible death 
sentence unless he first is returned to the state extradition he 
argued would violate the districts death penalty ban because it 
would enable alabama authorities to try om as an adult 
om was arrested by district authorities in december and has 
been fighting extradition ever since his uncle yul devoe guice 
31 was arrested by alabama authorities soon after the bombing and 
charged with murder and arson 
the boys grandmother alice guice thomas testified at a 
hearing last month that om who is black cannot get a fair trial 
from the white authorities of etowah county ala because the 
countys law enforcement officials have a longstanding vendetta 
against her family 
but alper arguing that the fairness of the alabama judicial 
system was not at issue in the case said district officials 
would be annoyed at the very least if the courts in alabama 
attempted to pass judgment on our system of justice 
alper also contended that a refusal by the district to enforce 
the interstate agreement on juvenile extraditions in this case 
would quickly turn the nations capital into a haven for fleeing 
fugitives

secretary of state james a baker iii appealed 
to the soviet union today to limit its export of arms and ideology 
to latin america 
we are looking for signs of new thinking baker said the 
soviet union now has an opportunity to demonstrate it in central 
america 
baker made his appeal in a speech to a conference in atlanta 
hosted by former presidents carter and ford 
baker said the bush administration was committed to work with 
leaders of the hemispheric democracies to promote political 
solutions to armed conflicts 
he cited as an example last weeks accord with congress 
providing aid for nicaraguan contra rebels and support for regional 
peace efforts 
however baker said the united states will never support a 
paper agreement that sells out the nicaraguan peoples right to be 
free nor he said should any other democracy in this 
hemisphere 
directing his remarks to the soviet union and others who support 
the marxist government in nicaragua baker said we must send a 
clear message to others outside this hemisphere this is not a 
dumping ground for their arms or their failed ideology 
baker made no direct reference to the military aid the united 
states gave given to the contras in their attempt to overthrow the 
sandinista government in managua before congress ordered a cutoff 
he said the united states supports dialogue between the two 
sides and also between the usbacked government in el salvador 
and marxist guerrillas in that country so the guns of war can 
stand silent through central america 
his appeal to the soviets for new thinking appeared timed to 
the visit soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will make next week 
to cuba the soviets closest ally in the hemisphere 
baker a former treasury secretary also said there was no 
magic solution to the economic problems in latin america 
he said hardpressed countries must reform their bloated 
statedominated economies keep up with debt obligations and 
satisfy the needs of their citizens 
he acknowledged though that this was a nearly impossible 
juggling act and gave assurances that the united states was 
prepared to hear your calls for help 
bakers call for cooperation between the united states and the 
other nations of the region drew immediate praise from house 
speaker jim wright a participant in the atlanta conference who 
also pledged a spirit of bipartisanship on the issue 
when the president of the united states or our secretary of 
state speaks to a foreign audience those who hear him are entitled 
to know he speaks for all of us in the united states as one 
representative of the loyal opposition in congress i should like 
to reiterate that what secretary baker had just said is said on 
behalf of us all said wright dtexas 
referring to the united states approach to latin america 
wright said within our own internal government relations we have 
replaced an old bitter spirit of confrontation with a new spirit of 
cooperation

a senior police officer widely 
accused of torture during the regime of deposed president alfredo 
stroessner has been suspended from duty an official said today 
alberto cantero former head of the political section of the 
investigations department of the asuncion police was suspended 
tuesday so he could prepare his defense before superiors and 
perhaps before a judge said osvaldo palacios a police spokesman 
human rights groups have accused cantero of directing the 
torture of scores of political dissidents and others prior to a 
feb 3 coup that ousted stroessner an army general who ruled 
paraguay nearly 35 years 
gen andres rodriguez led the coup and is president 
this should have happened immediately after the coup not only 
with cantero but with other torturers that remain at their jobs 
said francisco de vargas a human rights attorney for the committee 
of churches 
the attorney said at least 50 people said cantero was one of 
those who ordered abuses ranging from beating whipping repeated 
dunking in a tub of dirty water and electric shocks he said 
another 12 known torturers remain at their jobs in asuncion and in 
the interior of the country 
cantero was replaced by obdulio arguello britez said palacios 
two other police officers augusto caceres spelt and camilo 
almada saprisa also accused of torture under the stroessner 
regime were suspended two weeks ago both were subordinates of 
cantero 
de vargas said no action has been taken on criminal court suits 
filed against cantero and other police officials march 17 by 42 
alleged torture victims 
this means the justice system is the same one that existed 
under the stroessner regime said de vargas we have given them 
too many days to act and they have yet to issue one arrest order 
he added 
during a meeting with human rights lawyers earlier this month 
attorney general diogenes martinez pledged to follow up on 
accusations made by those who claim to have been tortured and 
punish the guilty

the chemical is still missing the department of transport said 
today 
the 263ton indonesian ship perintis was found 35 miles 
southeast of brixham on the south coast of england said a 
transport spokesman 
the ship sank in the english channel in a storm march 13 and 
five of its six containers of lindane insecticide were recovered 
the missing container was lost when tow ropes snapped as it was 
being hauled back to cherbourg in france 
ecologists have warned that if the container spills it could 
cause an ecological disaster with dire consequences for 30 years 
afterward 
the transport spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping with 
british custom said the wreck was found by a remotecontrolled 
camera on a vessel chartered by the department 
he said the container in which the chemical is stored has an 
underwater life of a year 
lindane is a toxic insecticide used widely by farmers and 
gardeners

a highly infectious disease is 
wiping out millions of young lake trout in hatcheries and could set 
back the effort to restock the great lakes with the game fish for 
years officials say 
the best thing we can do now is eradicate all of the fish at 
infected hatcheries disinfect and start over dr terence 
bradley a university of rhode island researcher leading the trout 
herpes study said wednesday 
the great lakes fishery commission agrees recommending that 
infected hatcheries be withdrawn from stocking programs until they 
are diseasefree the commission represents the great lakes states 
ontario and two indian tribes 
bradley and federal scientists believe the virus is new showing 
up only in hatcheries in the past decade it appears to kill only 
young fish and poses no threat to humans 
infected trout havent been released into the wild said john 
driver spokesman for a state hatchery in marquette mich 
researchers are unsure how fast the disease can spread in a lake 
where fish are less crowded and under less stress 
if we stock contaminated fish nothing could happen or it 
could wipe out the entire population of lake trout it would be too 
late then to say whoops we made a mistake said jerry 
mcclain manager of a federal hatchery in iron river wis 
the loss of millions of young fish in hatcheries wouldnt 
immediately affect sport fishermen in the great lakes since they 
must take older fish but fishing would be affected in long run 
officials said 
three state hatcheries in wisconsin and michigan and the iron 
river hatchery lost their entire young lake trout populations to 
the virus in the past two years the marquette hatchery alone has 
lost more than 4 million since the virus appeared in the early 
1980s 
in the most drastic move yet to stop the infection the iron 
river hatchery killed its entire brood stock mature fish 10 to 15 
years old and started over this winter with eggs from wyoming 
mcclain said 
state officials in wisconsin and michigan are considering doing 
the same 
all of the affected hatcheries have undergone repeated partial 
disinfection programs that so far have failed to stop the disease 
all it takes to reinfect a group of fish bradley said is a 
little bit of water from one tank to another tank maybe from a 
fishnet or even an animal on the grounds it is very difficult to 
eradicate

as evidence of the diversion of iran arms 
sales money to the nicaraguan rebels seeped out one stunned 
justice department official said jeez that cant be while 
another remarked youre kidding an aide to former attorney 
general edwin meese iii testified today 
john richardson the attorney generals exchief of staff told 
the jury at oliver norths irancontra trial that as he sat in 
norths office at the national security council on nov 22 1986 
meese aide william bradford reynolds gave me a nudge under the 
table 
richardson said reynolds then showed him a portion of a memo by 
north outlining a planned diversion of money from the iran arms 
sales to the contra rebels 
i said something under my breath like jeez thats cant 
be and brad shrugged and went back to what he was doing after 
returning the memo to the file richardson 
at the time north aide robert earl was wandering in and out of 
the office 
richardson and reynolds ran into north as they went out to lunch 
and asked for files from 1985 on the iran arms initiative 
north seemed surprised and said you should have them 
all richardson testified adding that north told them i will 
make sure you have them by the time they returned from lunch 
earl testified earlier this week that north spent that lunch 
hour picking up documents from his office pertaining to the 
irancontra affair and walked them to a shredder in the white house 
situation room where national security crises are monitored 
north had destroyed so many documents the previous night that 
the shredder in his own office had broken earl told the us 
district court jury 
when reynolds told meese during lunch at a restaurant about 
norths diversion memo the attorney general was very surprised 
while meese aide charles cooper remarked youre kidding 
richardson recalled 
after they returned to norths office to continue their review 
of documents on the iran initiative north told them that he would 
be leaving the white house and back commanding a marine battalion 
soon 
someones going to have to take the hit for this arms 
initiative by the reagan administration to iran north said 
according to richardson 
the attorney general said he didnt tell north until the next 
day about the other unfolding aspect that his aides had just 
uncovered the diversion of funds to the contras richardson who 
took notes at a nov 23 1986 interview in meeses office recalled 
that north showed a flash of surprise when mention was made of 
the diversion 
norths attorneys meanwhile underscored their request for 
former president reagans appearance at the trial 
defense attorney brendan sullivan emphasized the misstatements 
reagan made as word of the iran arms initiative leaked out in early 
and midnovember 1986 
in crossexamining cooper on the witness stand sullivan brought 
out that reagan on nov 6 1986 had said there was no substance to 
news reports of the iran arms sales sullivan also mentioned a nov 
19 1986 statement in which the president said he had not condoned 
arms shipments to iran by the israelis 
reagan objected wednesday to the possibility of having to appear 
at norths trial saying through his lawyer that it hasnt been 
shown his testimony is needed 
the justice department also objected to norths subpoena for 
reagan to appear saying that any live testimony by a former 
president is fraught with peril to the national security and to 
international relations 
as reagan made his objection cooper said the attorney generals 
aides never followed through with plans to interview reagan about a 
possibly illegal november 1985 shipment of hawk missiles from 
israel to iran 
reagan who was eventually interviewed by the tower commission 
on the matter initially told the panel he had objected to the 
shipment 
but reagan later stated that both he and white house chief of 
staff donald regan agreed they couldnt recall any meeting or 
conversation about the hawk shipment 
north is accused of obstructing congress by preparing a false 
chronology that stated no one in the us government knew until 
january 1986 that the november 1985 shipment contained arms 
the cia had arranged for an agencyrun airline to handle the 
shipment which took place without prior presidential approval 
reagan signed a finding of approval after the weapons were 
delivered 
cooper said the factfinding mission in november 1986 on the 
administrations secret iran arms initiative was overwhelmed 
when north confirmed on nov 23 1986 that money had been diverted 
to the contras

a secretary in a government office in san 
francisco might make more than a secretary doing similar work for 
the same agency in kansas city under a pay recommendation submitted 
to president bush 
the proposal opposed by some union leaders is part of a 
64page report that was handed to the president wednesday by the 
national commission on the public service the report lists ways to 
make federal service more attractive 
the commission a private body with a number of former or 
present federal officials among its 36 members concluded that the 
present system of trying to make government salaries uniform 
nationwide and comparable with private industry pay is unworkable 
it recommended instead a paysetting system that recognizes 
the fact that public employees live and work in localities 
characterized by widely different living costs and labor market 
pressures and adjusts compensation upward accordingly 
under such a system federal employees would continue to 
receive the same base pay for the same job but in large areas of 
the country many would also receive an allowance designed to 
compensate for higher living costs and labor competition the 
commission said 
its report said the latest survey by the bureau of labor 
statistics shows that government employees pay lags behind that of 
comparable workers in private industry by a national average of 22 
per cent 
the commission believes the president and congress must give a 
higher budget priority to civil service pay the commission said 
but the report added it is no longer appropriate or workable 
to use a national average to establish an appropriate level of 
pay 
the world of work has changed too much for such a broad 
approach it said citing wage surveys that show geographic 
differences of more than 30 per cent in some cases for similar jobs 
these locality and occupational differences seriously 
undermine the fairness of the current civil service pay process 
especially when all federal employees receive the same pay whether 
they work in lowcost areas such as kansas city or norfolk va or 
highcost areas such as san francisco or boston the commission 
said 
douglas fraser a former president of the united automobile 
workers who is a member of the commission said organized labor 
generally supports the commissions report but is opposed to 
locality pay 
it creates in many cases gross inequalities fraser said 
spokesmen for government unions also reacted coolly 
john n sturdivant national president of the american 
federation of government employees aflcio said before the 
commission addresses the issue of locality pay for federal workers 
as suggested by this report steps must be taken to close the 
current 22 percent pay gap 
robert m tobias president of the national treasury employees 
union said the report contained no systematic program to remedy 
the pay crisis for government workers 
the report holds out the false hope that pay increases can be 
absorbed in current agency budgets and through reductions in 
force tobias said that premise is a sure road to further 
demoralization and eventual chaos in the work force 
the commission also recommended pay increases for members of 
congress federal judges and top federal officials designed to 
bring their purchasing power back to its 1969 level by the time the 
next congress meets in 1991 the commission said their purchasing 
power has declined 35 per cent in the last 20 years 
bush receiving the report said this is very timely in the 
next few days ill be making some very specific proposals 
he did not say what the proposals would be and white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater declined to elaborate 
fitzwater said today that by signaling plans to submit 
legislation bush on wednesday had meant to say that he would be 
sending congress his proposals on a new ethics law 
the spokesman said that bush would most likely have a public 
comment at that time on the pay issue but he said that it has 
not been decided yet whether that would be a pay raise for federal 
congressional and judiciary just judicial or whatever 
its unlikely that he would have anything to say about 
congressional pay raises but he will have comments about judicial 
pay raises as it relates to ethics legislation fitzwater said 
he said that bush will not have specific proposals on 
legislation on any pay raise for anyone within the next week or 
two he said

if popeye had been a sweet potato he wouldnt 
have dared say i yam what i yam and thats all i yam around 
certain people in the agriculture department 
sweet potatoes and yams come from different biological and 
geographical origins says usda economist amy allred however 
the darker varieties of sweet potatoes are often erroneously called 
yams 
in fact the united states produces virtually no yams of its 
own sweet potatoes yes around 12 million hundredweight a year 
or roughly 545000 metric tons 
but thats far down the worlds production list with global 
output in 1987 at nearly 133 million tons china is the biggest 
producer at 113 million tons 
yam production is much smaller at about 24 million tons with 
most grown in africa nigeria with a 1987 production of 16 million 
tons is the leading producer 
allred says in a report by the departments economic research 
service that sweet potatoes have been cultivated since prehistoric 
times in two widely separated parts of the world tropical america 
and the south pacific islands 
early artifacts show yams were used for food in west africa 
prior to 50000 bc and have been grown in southeast asia since 
3000 bc 
allred was amused when the label from a supermarket can of 
yams was read to her in a telephone interview the label said 
yams in large letters with sweet potatoes in finer print 
traditionally people call them yams she said its 
pretty common 
but somewhere along the line the yamsweet potato question was 
settled partly at least in north carolina the leading us 
producer it is now the north carolina sweetpotato commission with 
no mention of yams in the official title 
north carolina produced 459 million hundredweight of sweet 
potatoes last year followed at a distance by louisiana 247 
million and california 131 million other commercial sweet 
potato states include alabama georgia maryland mississippi new 
jersey south carolina tennessee texas and virginia 
allreds report included further information about the 
differences between sweet potatoes and yams 
there are a thousand species of sweet potato which has a 
twoleafed embryo and thus is called a dicot it also is a member 
of the morningglory family the flesh varies from nearly white to 
almost orange in color 
in the united states per capita sweet potato consumption 
reached a high of 64 pounds in 1982 comparatively americans eat 
an average of about 119 pounds of regular potatoes annually 
measured on the basis of farm weight 
most domestic use of sweet potatoes is in candied or baked 
dishes but they are also used in puddings pies and even ice 
cream the industry in recent years has promoted new products 
including fresh fried sweet potatoes 
yams have oneleafed embryos and are called monocots they can 
be prepared in the same way as sweet potatoes most are consumed in 
the countries that produce them often turned into flour and then 
into various staple dishes yams also are a source of a steroid 
compound used as a base in cortisone and hormonal drugs

a 10year boom in us aquaculture production 
slowed last year as catfish farmers eased back on expanding their 
operations according to the agriculture department 
overall us production of edible and nonedible aquaculture 
products increased only 40 million pounds last year compared with 
a 1987 growth of more than 100 million pounds the departments 
economic research service said wednesday in a preliminary report 
despite the throttling back in catfish production total 1988 
output grew 52 percent to a record 295 million pounds the report 
said catfish growth was more than 32 percent in 1987 and 11 
percent in 1986 
catfish production was accompanied by a 236 percent increase in 
prices paid to farmers by processors in 1988 those price averages 
ranged from 161 per pound in california to 71 cents in louisiana 
however higher feed and energy costs led to a 20 percent to 
25 percent increase in production costs which meant that net 
returns to farmers were only 5 percent to 10 percent higher 
the report said 
trout producers surveyed by the agency sold 589 million pounds 
with a value of 636 million between sept 1 1987 and aug 31 
1988 the report said producers also sold more than 361 million 
trout eggs worth 28 million 
production of penraised salmon was estimated at six million 
pounds in 1988 a 70 percent increase from 1987 the report said 
domestic salmon production will probably continue to see large 
gains in the next few years

the agriculture department says private 
exporters have sold the soviet union an additional 450000 metric 
tons of us corn the second big purchase this week 
the department said wednesday that delivery is planned for the 
current marketing year which will end aug 31 an order for 
550000 tons of corn was reported on tuesday 
officials said the latest sales brought total corn sold to the 
soviets for 198889 to almost 112 million tons additionally 
sales include 4 million tons of wheat 450000 tons of soybeans 
14 million tons of soybean meal and 507400 tons of grain sorghum 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 450000 tons of 
corn would be about 177 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 259 per bushel at the 
farm level according to the latest usda fiveday average meaning 
that the latest sale could have a farm value of around 46 million

the line for imported boots started forming just 
after dawn but the goods sold out in 30 minutes 
as the crowd pushed forward in vain a railing gave way and four 
people were hurt when they fell 12 feet to the ground 
the incident which occurred tuesday and was reported thursday 
by the newspaper moskovsky komsomolets highlights the dreary 
outlook for soviet shoppers who search the city for items such as 
sugar detergent mens socks and chocolate 
president mikhail s gorbachev has told them improving food 
supplies and consumer goods are his top priority although it will 
take time frustrated consumers complain things have only gotten 
worse 
the weekly newspaper moscow news recently counted 500 people 
lined up for fur hats and 300 waiting to buy nightgowns made of a 
synthetic fabric 
moskovsky komsomolets said the four people who were hurt in the 
shopping incident all lived outside of moscow some of the 
thousands of soviets who stream into the capital to search for 
goods not available in their towns and villages bare as they are 
moscows shelves have more than provincial cities 
moscow news said it found a 62yearold woman who had traveled 
900 miles from the caucasus city of ordzhonikidze to shop in the 
gum department store on red square she spent more than 90 minutes 
in line to buy two nightgowns one red and one blue 
the red one is for my daughter the second well i dont 
want it old as i am my daughter has a friend it quoted her as 
saying if the girl doesnt like it our next door neighbors 
would perhaps im retired on a pension so i am here to do some 
shopping where i live the shops are empty 
in another line a young couple who took their vacation to shop 
in moscow bought three pairs of romanianmade boots even though 
they didnt fit 
shoes and boots have long been a sore spot with soviet consumers 
economist abel aganbegyan a key adviser to gorbachev said in 
1987 that the soviet union produced 788 million pairs of leather 
shoes in 1985 more than twice the number produced in the united 
states but nobody wanted them 
these shoes lie around because theyre not very comfortable 
theyre not fashionable theyre not attractive he said if 
someone buys them its only because theres nothing else and if 
they buy them they never wear them 
that makes imported shoes highly desirable in the tuesday 
incident the line formed outside the shoe store an hour before the 
shop opened and the 200 pairs were gone in 30 minutes 
economics professor tatyana koryagina told the moscow news the 
only way to end the lines is to encourage a market economy in which 
prices are set by demand rather than by the government but 
consumers oppose price increases and gorbachev has promised there 
wont be any for several years 
there was a faint note of hope thursday for shoe shoppers the 
tass news agency said deals have been concluded with manufacturiers 
in italy and yugoslavia to build 10 shoe factories in the soviet 
union in the next decade 
a flood of topquality fashion shoes will engulf the soviet 
market tass said

rebel inmates who seized 
control of guatemalas largest prison agreed today to end their 
5dayold uprising a government negotiator said 
we have an agreement in principle gonzalo menendez de la 
riva the head government negotiator told reporters when he emerged 
from a morning meeting with the rebels 
menendez the special attorney general for human rights said he 
would take the accord to the capital 15 miles west of the prison 
for the signature of interior minister roberto valle valdizan then 
return to the prison 
he said he expected a the agreement would be signed by both 
sides today 
red cross officials were reportedly preparing to evacuate the 
civilians inside the prison once the accord was signed 
the government offered late wednesday to replace the warden and 
all the guards at the 1350inmate pavon prison farm if the rebels 
surrendered the warden and the guards if the mutineers surrender 
between 75 and 100 rebel inmates armed with m1 rifles have been 
in control of the prison guatemalas largest since sunday at 
least four guards and three inmates died in the easter revolt 
about 600 people mostly women and children were visiting 
when the uprising began some stayed inside with the inmates and 
authorities differed on whether they were hostages or whether they 
stayed to protect their loved ones from security force reprisals 
the government said it would consider the rebels request for 
pardons for crimes committed during the uprising and guarantee

a sheriff has resigned after admitting he 
took an inmate home for dinner and shared a hot tub with him 
jack t dolan on wednesday denied any impropriety and said his 
only wish was to help an inmate perform a community service 
county commissioners had removed the 53yearold sheriff from 
his separate job as head of the corrections department two weeks 
ago after learning he was under investigation by the attorney 
generals office and a special prosecutor 
the 18year sheriff said he brought mark woosley 21 to his 
home several times to work on a woodshop project and had dinner 
with him before sending him back to jail 
following a job well done i offered the inmate the use of 
my hot tub in the presence of my brother i spent approximately 10 
to 15 minutes in the hot tub with him dolan said 
dolan said that when woosley told other inmates woosley was 
harassed for working with the sheriff and derogatory comments of a 
sexual nature were made 
the inmates girlfriend complained and sheriffs department 
officials contacted the attorney generals office 
the sheriff said he erred by departing from the normal and 
traditional model of the jailerprisoner relationship and in 
failing to foresee that my actions could be misperceived by 
others

the federal government today said it wont 
take over cleanup of the nations worstever oil spill but will 
watch closely because of the slicks enormous potential for 
damage to the environment 
the 500squaremile slick continued to spread uncontained by 
the efforts of 444 personnel from the coast guard and other 
agencies and dozens of fishermen backed by three coast guard 
helicopters two cutters 33 contract vessels five tugboats and a 
dozen skimmers 
only 6000 barrels of the 240000 that spilled from an exxon 
tanker friday have been recovered officials said 
anyone who goes up and looks at the slick has to be humbled by 
it said chief petty officer todd nelson 
at the white house transportation secretary samuel skinner 
environmental protection agency administrator william reilly and 
coast guard commandant adm paul yost reported their firsthand 
observations to president bush who decided against a federal 
takeover 
bush gave top priority to assessing the adequacy of 
environmental protection reilly said 
this is obviously a disaster of enormous potential magnitude 
on the environment reilly said the habitats of sea otters and 
sea lions are likely to be hardest hit and the government also 
will monitor salmon and herring in prince william sound where the 
disaster occurred friday he said 
exxon whose 987foot tanker exxon valdez struck a reef 25 miles 
from port valdez is doing a very craftsmanlike job with the 
cleanup yost said 
skinner said the response could have been quicker and 
most of the damage was done in the first few hours 
yost defended coast guard radar operators who failed to spot and 
warn the tanker saying it was not in a treacherous or narrow area 
he said the coast guard will look into the license of the tankers 
captain 
a daily newspaper covering shipping reported today that the 
captain failed to disclose in his last license application that he 
had been convicted of drunken driving twice in the previous five 
years a coast guard commander in new york told the journal of 
commerce that capt joseph hazelwood checked no in 1986 to the 
applications question about traffic violations 
of the 12 million barrels of crude oil the tanker was carrying 
exxon said about 480000 were transferred to another tanker which 
left for hawaii today 
crews maneuvered another vessel to take the remainder of the oil 
from the grounded ship the operation is expected to take until 
saturday 
in anchorage the first of an expected flood of lawsuits was 
filed the classaction suit seeking unspecified damages was filed 
in the names two prince william sound fishermen they accuse exxon 
the alyeska pipeline service co and the state of gross negligence 
in the spill and cleanup 
the wall street journal reported today that a barge intended as 
a key piece of equipment against oil spills was not working friday 
and alyeska conceded it violated its own requirement that it notify 
state environmental officials that the vessel was out of commission 
exxon which has been heavily criticized for its response to the 
101 milliongallon spill said it will reevaluate how it handles 
such problems 
now that the spill has happened its incumbent on us and 
the industry to profit in the maximum extent from the experience 
said william stevens president of exxon usa the parent of the 
exxon shipping co inc 
wind and currents have stretched the slick into ragged patches 
of iridescent oil on crystal blue water the heavy goo surrounds 
several islands 
the oil is headed toward the montague strait an outlet to the 
gulf of alaska gov steve cowper said that is where everyone hopes 
the oil goes rather than bouncing around like a pinball in 
prince william sound and polluting it for years 
mayor john devens has estimated the loss to the fishing industry 
at 150 million 
this spill will devastate the ecosystem long after wildlife 
that now has been exposed has died said jon lyman a spokesman 
for the alaska department of fish and game he said thousands of 
birds including bald eagles may die in the coming years 
in another development william woody chief of the fourmember 
national transportation safety board team assigned to the disaster 
said a coast guard officer told investigators he smelled alcohol on 
exxon valdez skipper joseph hazelwoods breath a few hours after 
the ship ran aground 
but the guardsman and a harbor pilot agreed hazelwood appeared 
competent woody said 
exxon officials said hazelwood was not on the bridge when the 
accident occurred a half mile outside shipping lanes third mate 
gregory cousins who the coast guard says lacked proper 
certification was giving the orders 
on the advice of their lawyers hazelwood and cousins have 
refused to talk to investigators woody said

a third researcher has achieved cold 
nuclear fusion brigham young university reported nearly a week 
after two university of utah scientists stunned the scientific 
world with their own announcement 
byu chemist steven jones will discuss his experiments in 
roomtemperature nuclear fusion at a colloquium at columbia 
university in new york city on friday school spokesman paul 
richards said wednesday 
nuclear fusion the energy secret of the sun has been sought by 
scientists for 20 years 
university of utah researchers announced march 23 that they had 
used a simple lowcost experiment to achieve fusion 
the announcment ignited skepticism and curiosity in the 
scientific community and widespread interest among businesses eager 
to cash in on the discovery 
it also prompted speculation that the utah researchers rushed to 
disclose their findings to claim the limelight before the work 
underwent close scrutiny in scientific publications 
electrochemists stanley pons of utah and martin fleischmann of 
the university of southampton in england announced they had 
sustained a controlled nuclear fusion reaction for more than 100 
hours in a small glass flask 
they said their process involved an electrical current used to 
drive nuclear particles through a lattice of palladium and platinum 
electrodes forcing positively charged particles to fuse together 
and create a new atom 
practical ways to achieve controlled nuclear fusion have long 
been sought because of its potential as an inexpensive virtually 
inexhaustible source of energy that produces less radioactive waste 
than nuclear reactors 
nuclear reactors are powered by fission in which atoms are 
split not fused 
pons and fleischmanns process has not been subjected to peer 
review and the experiment has yet to be duplicated elsewhere 
attempts are under way at several laboratories including los 
alamos national laboratory in new mexico and italys national 
association of alternative energy near rome 
richards confirmed a report in the wall street journal on 
wednesday that jones had discovered that the nuclei of deuterium 
atoms a heavy form of hydrogen can fuse inside a solid crystal 
unaided by an external catalyst or the superhot temperatures 
previously thought necessary for hydrogen fusion 
unlike the university of utah experiment which reportedly 
produced four times as much energy as it consumed jones work 
produced extremely small amounts richards said

orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods dropped 23 percent in february the second straight monthly 
decline the government said thursday in a report offering more 
evidence the economy may be slowing 
orders fell to a seasonally adjusted 2307 billion last month 
after dropping 12 percent in january the first backtoback 
declines since orders fell for four consecutive months starting in 
february 1986 the commerce department said 
last months decline was in line with a spate of other 
government reports that showed slower growth in february and with 
widespread expectations that the economy will cool off in this 
seventh year of its record peacetime expansion 
this confirms that february was a very weak month said 
economist david wyss of data resources inc in lexington mass 
it leaves unanswered the question of whether this is the start of 
the slowdown were expecting 
the decline would have been even bigger were it not for a 224 
percent surge last month in defense orders which are subject to 
wide swings depending on when government contracts are signed 
excluding the military orders were down 3 percent last month 
the biggest negative factor in last months orders picture was a 
72 percent decline in the transportation category reflecting 
fewer orders for planes and cars 
but even excluding the volatile transportation area all other 
orders still were down 14 percent last month 
economist michael p niemira of mitsubishi bank in new york said 
that while the economy is growing at a slower pace than last year 
the drop in factory orders was largely a fallback from strong 
demand in december when orders rose 47 percent 
its more of a reaction to the strong numbers that we saw in 
the past as opposed to true weakness niemira said 
the federal reserve board for a year has been pushing up 
interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth to reduce 
inflationary pressures 
the economy grew a robust 39 percent last year the best 
showing in four years but analysts believe the pace will be closer 
to 27 percent this year with the slowdown most evident in the 
second and third quarters 
factory orders had increased a healthy 97 percent in 1988 in 
part due to an exportled boom that showed signs of stalling late 
in the year 
the backtoback declines in orders during the first two months 
of 1989 may suggest the feds slowdown campaign is taking effect 
wyss said 
the feds been raising rates for a year now he said its 
about time we started to see it in the real growth statistics 
in the key category of nondefense capital goods considered a 
good indicator of future industry investment plans orders dropped 
82 percent in february to 371 billion after rising 23 percent 
in january 
orders for big ticket durable goods items expected to last 
three years or more were down 33 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
1242 billion after dropping 28 percent during the previous month 
declines were recorded in nearly all major industries including 
a 32 percent drop in orders for primary metals with the steel 
industry accounting for much of that decline 
demand for nondurable goods was down 1 percent to 1065 
billion last month with the largest decreases coming in orders for 
chemicals and rubber and plastics products 
shipments of manufactured goods were down 17 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 2276 billion in february it was the biggest 
decline since march 1986 when shipments were down 24 percent

prosecutors are seeking staggering prison terms 
and more than 12 billion in penalties against junk bond wizard 
michael r milken and two others in the largest criminal action 
against a wall street trader 
the drexel burnham lambert inc executive was indicted by a 
federal grand jury wednesday along with his 40yearold brother 
lowell j milken and bruce lee newberg a former trader for 
drexel the nations fifthlargest securities firm 
the longexpected indictment charged the three with turning 
drexel into a billiondollar racketeering enterprise that used 
drexels junk bond department for a series of securities frauds 
with various unindicted coconspirators among them are the 
imprisoned ivan boesky and members of the defunct investment 
partnership princetonnewport partners 
all three defendants face up to 20 years in prison on each of 
two racketeering charges prosecutors said 
among other things the indictment accused milken of using 
illegal inside information about merger proposals to arrange deals 
and manipulate stocks 
us attorney benito romano said the racketeering penalties were 
the most ever sought against individuals under the 19yearold 
federal racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act 
but defense lawyers attacked the 98count indictment as an abuse 
of prosecutorial power and a tool to wrench cooperation from other 
drexel employees 
they called the charges a perversion of the racketeering 
act which was established principally to combat organized crime 
but is used increasingly to prosecute whitecollar criminals 
i think it is outrageous to use rico in a circumstance like 
this said michael armstrong an attorney for lowell milken 
they applied the statute to behavior which for the most part has 
not been considered even to be criminal much less the subject of a 
racketeering indictment 
the three defendants denied wrongdoing and said they would plead 
innocent 
after almost 2 years of leaks and distortions i am now eager 
to present all the facts in an open and unbiased forum michael 
milken said in a statement 
milken 42 has headed drexels junk bond department since the 
mid1970s and is credited with revolutionizing corporate takeovers 
by relying on the highly risky high yielding securities turning 
them into a 175 billion annual market the bonds also are often 
used to help small and mediumsize companies grow 
the indictment described the beverly hills califbased junk 
bond department as the driving force behind drexels business 
noting that between 1983 and 1987 it accounted for nearly half of 
drexels profits 
if convicted on the racketeering counts alone each defendant 
would face maximum fines of 37 billion roughly double their 
alleged illicit profits 
in addition the three are subject to forfeiture proceedings on 
virtually all money they have made through their drexel dealings 
since 1984 an estimated 185 billion that includes 12 billion 
in salaries 112 million in drexel stock 205 million in 
corporate finance fees 37 million in trading profits on allegedly 
tainted deals and 257 million in interest 
michael milken also was charged with all of the 96 
nonracketeering counts which include numerous mail wire and 
securities frauds his brother was charged with 11 counts and 
newberg with 20 counts 
if convicted of the nonracketeering charges each would face a 
maximum penalty of five years in prison and at least 250000 in 
fines per count making michael milken subject to 24 million in 
fines and a total of 520 years imprisonment 
the indictment paralleled the securities and exchange 
commissions sweeping civil insider trading action against drexel 
milken and others last september 
in december drexel struck a plea bargain with prosecutors that 
called for the dismissal of milken and the withholding of most of 
his 1988 compensation estimated at between 100 million and 200 
million 
as part of the agreement which drexel says it made to avoid 
crippling racketeering charges the firm agreed to plead guilty to 
six federal felony charges and pay a record 650 million in fines 
and penalties 
drexel has not yet pleaded to the charges and settlement of the 
criminal case remained subject to sec approval 
a drexel statement said the milkens had been placed on leave of 
absence

billion owed by the latin countries 
cristiani who won last weeks election in el salvador will be

president bush has urged soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev as he prepares to visit cuba to use his influence in 
nicaragua to further central american peace efforts white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said today 
asked if bush had renewed us requests for the soviets to push 
the nicaraguans toward democratic reforms or withdraw their 
assistance to the central american nation fitzwater noted that 
secretary of state james baker had discussed that position recently 
with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze he said the same 
us views have been expressed elsewhere 
the president has made his views known to secretary general 
gorbachev on this issue fitzwater said we would like to see 
the soviet union to use its influence in nicaragua to bring about a 
peaceful settlement of the situation 
we would like to see the soviet union withdraw their resources 
and support in nicaragua he said and we would like to see 
secretary gorbachev take an active role in furthering both of those 
objectives 
meanwhile in a speech in atlanta secretary of state james a 
baker iii urged the soviets to show signs of new thinking in 
central america he said the region was not a dumping ground 
for arms and failed ideologies of outsiders 
and at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
the soviet union and cuba through their continued aid and support 
of violence and subversion in the region have been undermining the 
prospects for peaceful resolution of the conflict in nicaragua 
through diplomacy 
one way the us official said would be to stop the flow of 
arms 
over the next week fitzwater said bush plans to meet 
separately in washington with three latin american presidents he 
said venezuelas carlos andres perez is set to arrive saturday for 
a working breakfast with bush baker treasury secretary nicholas 
brady and national security advisor brent scowcroft they are to 
discuss the latin amrican debt crisis 
costa ricas oscar arias is set to arrive tuesday for a stopover 
en route to canada and el salvadors alfredo christiani on april 7 
fitzwater said he could not reveal what specific diplomatic 
overtures had been made to gorbachev as he prepares to visit cuba 
he did say however that you can assume that the presidents 
views have been made to the general secretary in the past and 
recently 
fitzwater reiterated the us position that any positive moves 
on the part of the soviets toward nicaragua would be looked upon 
favorably by the united states officials have raised the 
possibility of improved economic relations between the united 
states and soviet union if gorbachev would take a good faith step 
in nicaragua 
it would certainly help in improving ussoviet relations 
eastwest relations in general fitzwater said 
the interrelationship of all these issues is readily 
apparent he said 
bush has said the soviets should stop providing military aid to 
nicaragua and that the soviet interest in the region is far less 
than the us concern for its relationships in central america 
while the united states has backed the contra rebels seeking to 
overthrow nicaraguas sandinista government and has imposed a trade 
embargo the soviet union has provided trade and military 
assistance to the sandinistas 
gorbachev arrives in havana sunday for a threeday visit the 
trip was to have taken place last year but was put off because of 
the disastrous earthquake in soviet armenia 
the new york times reported today that the bush administration 
wants gorbachev to say something while in cuba that would signal a 
willingness to change its posture toward nicaragua

residents in this affluent chicago suburb 
will vote tuesday on a handgun ban less than a year after an 
8yearold was killed and six children were wounded in a school 
shooting rampage 
the advisory vote was set because the issue is so emotional in a 
community still scarred by the day last may when laurie dann walked 
into a school and began shooting at pupils 
ms dann also wounded a man away from the school and then killed 
herself 
some children are drawing posters favoring a handgun ban while 
opponents are saying the ban would be announcing to the world they 
are sitting ducks 
the referendum was the idea of ban opponents who say they want 
to prove that most residents oppose giving up their firearms 
theordore herst said a handgun ban would send the wrong message 
in a metropolitan area with a high crime rate it is a simplistic 
bandaid solution to a major problem herst said wednesday 
the firearms in the village are owned by very reliable 
citizens retired military officers sportsmen herst said 
this isnt dodge city detroit or washington 
leading the ban effort is george fisher whose daughter 
lindsay was seriously wounded by ms dann lindsay fisher is 
recovered and back in school 
the carnage all over the country will not stop until local 
communities say enough is enough and apply pressure to their 
state legislators to develop statewide handgun controls and the 
states in turn start looking to congress fisher said 
highland park approved a ban on the possession of handguns

camp during world war ii flew out of the united states on tuesday 
night and arrived today in salzburg austria via zurich 
switzerland 
justice department spokesman loye miller said wednesday that 
eckert had fallen asleep at heathrow airport in london and missed 
his connecting flight that day 
eckert had concealed his auschwitz service from us immigration 
officials when he obtained a visa to come to the united states in 
1956 the department said at the time he was living in austria 
eckert who had been living in la puente calif admitted last 
sept 27 that he had been a member of the ss guard unit assigned to 
auschwitz where he guarded prisoners millions of people were 
murdered during his time of service there 
bernstein a member of the departments office of special 
investigations negotiated with the austrian government to arrange 
eckerts return to that country and austria agreed to the return 
last december 
bernstein was flying home from those negotiations when the plane 
exploded over scotland on dec 21 
the successful completion of the eckert case is a fitting 
tribute to mike bernsteins prosecutorial and diplomatic skills and 
to his dedication to the pursuit of justice attorney general 
dick thornburgh said in a statement

when mayor frank priore learned recently 
that his drivers license expired in 1987 he did more than rush to 
have it renewed he suspended himself for one day without pay 
i think that was the fairest thing i could do with myself 
priore said wednesday 
priore said he didnt realize he had been driving illegally 
until he was contacted by a reporter as head of the citys police 
department he said he had to set an example so he went to the 
police chief and told him to write him a ticket 
he was kind of shocked priore said he said i cant 
give you a ticket and i said youre being ordered to give me a 
ticket 
priore said he decided not to be lenient on himself a police 
officer driving with an expired license would be suspended for a 
day without pay so he decided he should face the same penalty 
priore said 
hell work through the suspension one day next week but will 
dock his pay 231 priore said adding that the ticket cost him 20 
priore said he decided not to send himself to jail because he 
didnt deliberately let the license expire he said the notice to 
renew probably was sent to his former address

a cuban family stranded in canada by 
immigration problems since december will not be allowed to return 
to their home in miami while their application for asylum is 
pending federal officials said thursday 
benedict ferro district director of the us immigration and 
naturalization service said he has denied a bid for humanitarian 
parole for carlos fajardo his wife bermaida zamorapowers and 
her two children yoradlys diaz and yoandys diaz 
the decision was the result of new information immigration 
officials uncovered about the family ferro said in this case 
the negative aspects of granting a parole far outweighed the 
evidence on their behalf he said 
ferro would not elaboratem but said the decision was separate 
from the familys asylum claim which will be decided in a few 
weeks 
the family have been stranded in ontario since dec 23 when 
they crossed into niagara falls to view the canadian falls and were 
denied permission to return to the united states because of what 
officials said is a history of immigration fraud 
their plight has drawn national attention with hispanic groups 
and florida lawmakers appealing to ins officials for their return 
although they were illegal aliens they lived for several years 
in miami where they owned a home and boatbuilding business and 
were active in community affairs 
last month fajardo sought a special dispensation to return to 
the united states while the application for political asylum was 
being considered the process takes several months and fajardo said 
he wanted his children to return to school and that he needed to 
tend to his business 
the family lives in fort erie ontario under the care of 
refugee assistance groups 
theyve been holding out hope that the decision would be 
positive said sister margaret quinn of the niagara interchurch 
refugee committee theyve been going on that strength now this 
will be a real disappointment 
sister margaret said the children have been attending school but 
have language problems she said fajardo and his wife who are 
prevented from working in canada were bored 
fajardo said thursday he was unsure of why ins officials had 
denied the parole and that he was hoping his lawyer could explain 
the decision

a government official thursday 
accused ethnic albanians of trying to stage an armed uprising in a 
southern province and said authorities had seized weapons and 
explosives 
stane dolanc vice president of yugoslavias collective state 
presidency said the separatists want to force kosovo to secede 
from yugoslavia 
riots in kosovo an autonomous province in the republic of 
serbia broke out monday and tuesday after legislators approved 
constitutional changes giving serbian officials greater control 
over the region 
the belgrade newspaper vecernje novosti said 29 people died in 
the unrest the staterun tanjug news agency put the death toll at 
27 while kosovo officials said 23 died and more than 200 were 
injured 
the province under a dusktodawn curfew was quiet thursday 
serbs contend the constitutional changes which took effect 
tuesday are necessary to protect kosovos slav minority from the 
ethnic albanian majority who make up 85 percent of the 19 million 
population 
ethnic albanians claim the changes threaten autonomy they won 
under yugoslavias 1974 constitution 
dolanc in a speech to the state parliament in his native 
republic of slovenia said documents seized by police in kosovo 
revealed the true aims of ethnic albanian separatists 
secession from yugoslavia 
an open call was made for armed revolt as supported by the 
fact that a large amount of explosives weapons and other war 
material was seized in kosovo dolanc said 
dolanc was the federal interior minister in 1981 when riots by 
ethnic albanians in kosovo killed nine people 
there have been frequent allegations since then that kosovos 
ethnic albanians have organized an underground movement that seeks 
to separate the region from yugoslavia and unite it with 
neighboring albania ethnic albanians deny it 
the slovene communist party daily delo took the unusual step of 
publishing what it said were casualty figures from an emigre 
albanian group in brussels those figures listed 137 dead and 370 
injured monday and tuesday 
i can guarantee to you that this is a lie dolanc said 
there were persistent reports in pristina kosovos capital 
that up to 150 ethnic albanian intellectuals were detained or 
questioned by police 
the belgrade daily borba said intellectuals who have long been 
known to act from hostile positions of albanian nationalism and 
separatism have been detained or isolated 
in addition to the ethnic problems kosovo is yugoslavias 
poorest region it has an unemployment rate of 30 percent compared 
with the nationwide rate of 15 percent

a government official said 
thursday the czech government has asked for the extradition of two 
teenagers who hijacked a hungarian airliner and forced it to fly 
from prague to frankfurt 
the extradition request would be very carefully considered 
before it will be acted upon said peter rothen a spokesman for 
the foreign ministry in bonn 
the staterun czech news agency ctk reported the extradition 
request was delivered to the west german embassy in prague the 
czech capital 
rothen citing a 1970 international agreement on aircraft 
hijacking of which west germany and czechoslovakia are a party 
said the agreement stipulates only that hijackers will be 
prosecuted 
it will definitely take some time this is a decision that 
must be very carefully considered rothen said in an interview 
the ctk reports identified the youths as stefan macicko 17 and 
dusan styk 16 both of banska bystrica in czechoslovakia the two 
armed with a sawedoff shotgun rifle and fake hand grenade 
commandeered the aircraft in prague on wednesday 
they got aboard the jetliner after seizing a woman hostage and 
crashing through a glass wall at the vip lounge in prague the 
woman was released shortly thereafter 
the incident ended less than three hours later when they 
surrendered after the plane landed at frankfurt airport no 
injuries were reported 
officials have said the hijackers initially wanted to go to the 
united states but changed their minds when the crew convinced them 
the sovietmade tupolev154 jet could not make the trip across the 
atlantic 
the hijackers released 82 passengers including all women and 
children before the airliner left prague 
in budapest the staterun mti news agency reported the malev 
airlines jet returned to the hungarian capital with the crew of 
four and hungarian consulgeneral lajos taba 
taba traded himself to the hijackers wednesday to gain the 
release of all but 11 passengers before the plane left prague 
prosecutors spokesman hubert harth when asked if the youths 
applied for political asylum in west germany responded i dont 
know if they asked for asylum our main concern is dealing with the 
criminal act of hijacking 
harth said they appeared in juvenile court and were told of the 
charges against them

a federal appeals court today upheld the 
conviction of eight people for helping central americans enter the 
country illegally 
the 1986 trial was the first major federal prosecution of 
sanctuary workers members of a churchbased movement to give 
refuge to immigrants from strifetorn central american countries 
in a 30 decision the 9th us circuit court of appeals said 
the eight including five members of the clergy had no right to 
offer as a defense their religious beliefs or their belief that the 
aliens were entitled to political asylum 
a rule which would allow the defendants essentially to put 
reagan administration foreign policy on trial would be foolish 
said judge cynthia holcomb hall 
the us government offers asylum only to those who can prove 
political persecution most applicants from el salvador and 
guatemala are turned down 
the eight were convicted in tucson ariz on charges including 
conspiracy and harboring and transporting illegal aliens all were 
placed on probation 
several other defendants were acquitted pleaded guilty to 
misdemeanors or had charges dismissed 
hall said the activists claims that enforcement of the 
immigration laws infringed on their religious beliefs was 
outweighed by the governments overriding concern in policing its 
borders

six black activists left the 
british embassy in anger thursday complaining of maltreatment 
during a 26hour sitin protesting police restrictions on their 
activities 
an escaped detainee remained at the us consulate in 
johannesburg a day after he eluded guards at a hospital where he 
was on a hunger strike 
prominent antiapartheid church leaders including anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu conferred with law and order minister 
adriaan vlok about the fate of the estimated 250 activists who 
remain detained without charge including up to 50 reportedly on 
hunger strikes 
i expect some action in the next few days said the rev 
frank chikane general secretary of the south african council of 
churches who joined tutu and two other clergymen in urging vlok to 
free all detainees 
the six former detainees who entered the british embassy in 
pretoria on wednesday expressed bitterness at britains refusal to 
provide them with food water and mattresses or to allow use of 
toilets and telephones during their stay in an entrance hall they 
also said they would defy restrictions imposed on them following 
their release from jail 
lawyers for the six said south african authorities had given 
assurances the activists would not be arrested if they left the 
embassy no assurances were given that restrictions would be 
lifted the lawyers said 
scores of detainees released following recent widespread hunger 
strikes have been placed under restrictions barring them from 
political activities confining them to their homes at night and 
requiring them to report twice daily to police stations 
british officials made clear from the start they disapproved of 
the activists protest and asked them to leave the six requested 
britain to pressure south african authorities to lift all 
restrictions on former detainees and the embassy replied that 
britain could make effective representations only if the sitin 
ended 
tutu expressed disappointment at britains handling of the 
protest saying i would have hoped they behaved in a way that 
showed they cared about the welfare of people 
the national union of mineworkers an antiapartheid black 
union described britains stance as shocking and inhuman 
denying them facilities necessary for human habitation 
confirms our longheld views that apartheid repression is fully 
supported by the british government for the realization of super 
profits accruing from their sanctionbusting companies in south 
africa the union said 
the protest coincided with a visit to neighboring zimbabwe by 
british prime minister margaret thatcher who urged negotiations to 
resolve south africas racial conflict 
simon ntombela 27 remained in the us consulate in a 
johannesburg office building after escaping wednesday from a 
hospital in durban 360 miles away ntombela a black teacher and 
antiapartheid organizer reportedly took a commercial flight to 
johannesburg 
the human rights commission a private group said ntombela was 
seeking unconditional freedom for all detainees before his escape 
he had been on a hunger strike for two weeks 
the government said wednesday it would place hunger strikers in 
prison or in hospitals in bloemfontein a relatively remote 
provincial center to prevent escapes and publicity about them 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained for varying 
periods under a state of emergency declared in june 1986 to quell 
unrest in black townships

when members of the albany recorder ensemble 
get together saturday they will be playing a centuriesold song on 
their ancient flutelike instruments in unison with musicians 
around the world 
recorder players from argentina to australia are being asked to 
synchronize their watches and play an old english dance tune the 
night watch to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the american 
recorder society in the eastern time zone the downbeat will come 
at 5 pm saturday 
the old saying that theres strength in numbers will be 
felt tim king director of the sevenmember albany group said 
wednesday this will give us an opportunity to share with people 
all over the world in a common event 
the recorder has a whistle mouthpiece a thumb hole and seven 
finger holes and has a soft reedy tone invented during the 
middle ages they have remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of 
years and were particularly popular during the 16th and 17th 
centuries 
modern flutes overtook the recorder in the 18th century but 
since the 1920s there has been a revival of interest and the 
american recorder society now 4200 has members worldwide 
andy green the societys administrative director said 
recorders are popular because they dont take a lot of skill to 
produce pleasing music 
it means that people who are involved in other things for the 
major part of their lives can still make music and in some cases 
even play great music he said in a telephone interview from the 
groups new york headquarters 
green said its hard to predict how many will take part in the 
playin but judging from preliminary reports they will number in 
the thousands most of them amateurs 
when the time comes saturday ars president martha bixler a 
nationally known recorder performer will give the downbeat for 
hundreds of players assembled in new yorks symphony space theater 
the society has taken pains to see to it that recorder players 
elsewhere whether in groups or in their homes will be playing 
along in unison or as close to it as possible 
along with copies of the night watch the society has mailed 
instructions including starting times in various time zones late 
evening in europe sunday morning in the far east and urging 
participants to be sure to sychronize your watch to the second 
with the radio or the time telephone number they also give a 
suggested metronome tempo 
green called the mass playin saturday a celebration not only 
of the recorder society but of amateur musicians playing 
together and the importance of this in our lives 
john curtis a college professor in valdosta who directs the 
16member valdosta recorder society said the low cost of recorders 
adds to their popularity good plastic instruments sell for about 
20 though the finest wooden recorders can cost hundreds of 
dollars 
its a sort of personal hobby thing said curtis a college 
professor every month we discover one or two more folks who 
like to play

a judge on thursday ordered a 17yearold 
prisoner sent back to alabama to face a murder charge and possible 
death sentence rejecting claims that the move could violate this 
citys ban on capital punishment 
superior court judge stephen f eilperin said turning down 
alabamas extradition request would make the district of columbia 
ban into national policy and turn the district into a haven for 
persons wanted by other states on capital charges 
the judge gave alabama authorities until may 1 to pick up the 
defendant identified only by the initials om he and an uncle are 
charged with murder and arson in the may 1988 firebombing of a 
gasden ala apartment tamel jackson 18 months died in the 
incident 
eilperin postponed the effective date of his order until tuesday 
to give defense attorneys time to appeal he rejected their bid for 
a 30day stay 
the judge said he could find no legal basis for allowing states 
to reject extradition requests they view as morally offensive 
including ones that could subject defendants to capital punishment 
even if such discretion existed he said alabama could get 
around it by certifying om for trial as an adult since the 
supreme court has ruled clearly that states have no such power in 
handling adult extradition requests 
a decision by the alabama courts to treat om as an adult 
could be returned in his absence and would be binding on this 
court eilperin said 
eilperin said the district cannot interpose its objection to 
capital punishment between om and alabama 
alabama is entitled to have alabama law govern criminal acts 
committed on alabama soil by citizens of alabama against citizens 
of alabama he said 
the supreme court is expected to rule in july whether imposing 
the death penalty on defendants who committed murder before age 18 
violates the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual 
punishment 
oms lawyers also had contended that the defendant who is 
black cannot receive a fair trial from white etowah county ala 
authorities they cited the death of his father in 1978 and his 
uncle in 1984 both while in the custody of local authorities 
eilperin acknowledged that testimony from the youth his 
grandmother and his friends in gadsden had depicted a dismal 
climate of summary execution illegal jailings and harassment 
but he said the law requires that fair trial claims be raised in 
alabama not the district 
courts do not sit to make moral judgments loosed from law 
he said and while legislative bodies may act on their moral 
perceptions there are limits to their powers especially local 
bodies such as the districts city council 
nothing in the constitution or elsewhere grants the district 
of columbia the power to enforce beyond its borders the districts 
moral opposition to the death penalty he said 
om was arrested by district authorities in december and has 
been fighting extradition ever since

defense secretary dick cheney said thursday he 
might ask congress to close more military bases as a moneysaving 
move in efforts to try to create a leaner more efficient 
structure for americas armed forces 
cheney in his first lengthy pentagon interview since taking 
office march 17 said a baseclosing initiative undertaken last 
year by the reagan administration was a hell of an idea but 
obviously a firsttime effort 
we may well want to go further and start again he said 
while i understand the problems that some of my former 
colleagues in congress face individual situations in their 
districts i just have to believe that there are opportunities for 
economies in reviewing a base structure that has been basically 
unchanged for 50 or 60 years said the former congressman from 
wyoming 
im not ready to make an announcement today he continued 
but i think if youre going to look at finding ways to 
maintain the nations defenses with less money then i have no 
choice as secretary but to look for ways to save money and one of 
those ways is to close bases that arent necessary to consolidate 
operations and to try to create a leaner more efficient 
infrastructure for our military forces 
cheney also said it was much too premature to discuss the 
withdrawal of american troops from europe given the absence of 
progress in conventional arms control talks with the warsaw pact 
in addition he said he wanted to do everything possible to 
provide military support to authorities fighting the drug trade but 
didnt want to see soldiers being used as policemen and agreed he 
had no magic answer to dealing with panamanian leader manuel 
antonio noriega 
the situation involving noriega is a problem the bush 
administration inherited from the reagan administration which 
tried unsuccessfully to pressure noriega to step down after he was 
indicted on drug charges in the united states 
i dont know that ive got any light i can shed on the noriega 
problem cheney said in the interview with wire service reporters 
it obviously is a continuing problem its something this 
administration inherited from our predecessors but i dont have 
anything this morning that i can give you by way of new policy or a 
new idea 
asked if he had any reason to think that elections in panama 
could be conducted democratically he replied theres always 
hope chicagos been reformed why not panama 
cheney also said that philosophically he had no problem with 
applying the death penalty in serious cases of peacetime espionage 
several arrests have been made in recent months in spy cases that 
have been described as potentially serious enough to justify a 
prosecution request for capital punishment 
cheney also said he couldnt support any type of compulsory 
national service plan for americans when they turn 18 but 
wouldnt object to a carefully crafted voluntary plan that 
recognized the need to staff the allvolunteer military 
in addition he said he and rep les aspin dwis would simply 
have to disagree about the role of top military officers in dealing 
with congress 
aspin chairman of the house armed services committee 
criticized cheney on wednesday for scolding the air forces top 
general for consulting privately with congressional leaders on 
missile programs aspin argued that contacts between congress and 
the military are not adequate as it is 
cheney responded thursday he considered aspin a close friend 
but hadnt changed his mind about having civilian executives handle 
such consultations 
cheney also said he had received several greetings from foreign 
defense ministers including the one from the soviet union since 
taking office cheney said he thought it would be useful to meet 
the soviet defense chief but that nothing was scheduled 
the baseclosing initiative began last year with an independent 
commission crafting a plan to close 86 installations most of them 
relatively small and to partially close five others for a 
projected savings of 56 billion over 20 years 
despite some opposition those closures appear likely opponents 
do not appear to have the votes needed in congress to block the 
plan

eight agencies serving vietnam veterans and 
their families were awarded grants thursday from settlement of a 
suit by veterans who claimed exposure to agent orange gave them 
cancer and other illnesses 
the programs will provide a wide range of services with 
emphasis placed on helping veterans children who have birth 
defects and other disabilities 
among the recipients was an agency that offers legal advice to 
disadvantaged vietnam veterans in san francisco another that 
enables veterans to participate in the outward bound program and a 
housing program in new mexico for the families of veterans 
receiving treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder 
the eight grants totalling 581000 are the first of many to 
be allocated from a 52 million fund the fund is expected to grow 
with interest to 70 million during the seven to 10year life of 
the program 
the money is part of a 240 million settlement of a class action 
suit brought more than 10 years ago by veterans who claimed 
exposure to the defoliant agent orange during the vietnam war 
caused cancer birth defects in their children and other illnesses 
the chemical was sprayed over southeast asia during the 1960s by 
the us military which hoped to deprive communist troops of crops 
and cover 
a large portion of the settlement 170 million has been 
allocated to the agent orange veteran payment program which 
provides cash payments to totally disabled vietnam veterans and to 
the widows or children of veterans who died distribution of these 
payments began earlier this month 
the agent orange class assistance program from which the grants 
are being awarded was designed to reach veterans and their 
families who do not meet the eligibility requirements for direct 
payments 
settlement of the lawsuit brought in 1978 was reached in 1984 
on the eve of trial in us district court in brooklyn ny when 
the veterans and defendants seven manufacturers of agent orange 
agreed to the terms the us supreme court upheld the settlement 
last june 
dennis rhoades executive director of the assistance program 
said at a news conference that special attention would be made to 
fund programs that are innovative and that can strengthen a network 
of services for vietnam veterans and their families after the 
settlement fund is exhausted 
he described the eight grants awarded thursday as flagship 
grants that would form the basis of the programs direction 
because of concern expressed by veterans about children with 
birth defects and other developmental disabilities rhoades said 
those areas would be given the highest priority in funding 
the eight organizations receiving grants were 
the federation for children with special needs in boston 
50000 for a program of training and networking of vietnam 
families with disabled children 
the occupational center of essex county nj 71000 for a

the navy finally resolving a fouryear 
dispute involving what it described as a matter of high national 
security has authorized the commerce department to begin 
publishing detailed maps of the ocean floors surrounding the united 
states 
the decision announced thursday means that most of the 
detailed oceanbottom maps of the socalled exclusive economic zone 
produced by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
will soon be declassified and released to the public the navy said 
the only maps the navy said it will continue to insist remain 
classified secret are those covering egress routes used by 
ballistic missile submarines sailing from their home ports 
there are four such home ports on the east and west coasts of 
the united states for nuclear missile submarines groton conn 
charleston sc kings bay ga and bangor wash 
the threat assessment and decisionmaking for this issue have 
been a long difficult task rear adm rf pittenger wrote in a 
letter last month to the commerce department noaas parent agency 
of particular interest to you the navy now interposes no 
objection to unclassified release of most of the noaa 
highresolution bathymetry data which is controlled under the white 
housenational security advisor memorandum of jan 7 1985 
all present and future noaa data from the us exclusive 
economic zone may be released except in broad areas to be defined 
around ssbn missile submarine egress routes 
pittenger the oceanographer of the navy sent his letter to 
commerce under secretary dr william e evans on march 23 the navy 
released copies on thursday 
the dispute now being resolved involves an effort by noaa and 
various universities to use a new extremely sophisticated sea 
beam sonar mapping system to produce incredibly detailed maps 
almost like blackandwhite photos of the ocean bottom 
noaa is trying to survey the entire exclusive economic zone 
which runs from 12 miles to 200 miles off the us coast within 
that zone the united states asserts control when it comes to such 
economic development activities as fishing mining and oil drilling 
the noaa maps are likely to prove invaluable to the oil and gas 
industry and companies that lay cables on the sea floor fisherman 
could use them to locate areas where fish congregate and 
eventually the maps could help companies mine strategic minerals 
the navy however saw another danger detailed maps of the 
ocean bottom along americas coast would be particularly useful to 
commanders of soviet submarines both those trying to hunt or 
attack american subs as well as those trying to fix their 
position to launch a missile attack 
in january 1985 the issue came to a head with the white house 
giving the navy the authority to block noaas publication of 
oceanbottom maps 
ever since noaa has been collecting the map data with the sonar 
system but holding back its release at the navys insistence 
noaa has surveyed much of the eez and the data has been 
classified secret the navy said thursday most of the data 
can soon be declassified and maps can be produced for public 
release under this decision 
stan eames a spokesman for noaa declined immediate comment 
thursday on the navys announcement but navy officials said they 
understood that noaa executives were pleased with the decision 
as part of the ruling the navy did decide thursday the sonar 
technology used to produce the maps would continue to be listed on 
the pentagons munitions list meaning it is subject to export 
controls 
this will allow us exports only to countries that will 
guarantee no reexport to east bloc nations the navy said

patched in white limestone bandages 
the sphinx had a headtotoe checkup thursday by antiquities 
officials and the prognosis was mixed 
the sphinx is in no danger of collapsing minister of 
culture farouk hosni said after a 45minute detailed examination of 
the monument with the face of a pharaoh and the body of a lion 
he admitted its problems are severe however and said egypt is 
willing to listen to any suggestions on how to solve them 
the sphinx belongs to egypt but even if someone on the moon 
has a suggestion that would help us we will listen he said 
sayed tawfik chairman of the egyptian antiquities organization 
predicted it would take at least a year before a team of 
international and local experts can agree on a permanent solution 
to the 4600yearold monuments lingering ills 
the tour by hosni tawfik and others was to counter local press 
reports that a yearlong emergency restoration effort has failed to 
stop deterioration 
the talk that the restoration work is bad was made only to 
cause a crisis hosni said these are personal rivalries and i 
dont want them to interfere with scientific work 
officials have known for years that the sphinx fashioned from 
layers of limestone piled on a natural knoll was in trouble in 
february 1988 a chunk of rock tumbled from its right shoulder and 
the patchup began 
restorers encased a critically weak portion of the endangered 
shoulder behind a limestone retaining wall limestone blocks have 
been placed alongside the body as braces 
its the clash of the bright white limestone against ancient 
brown stone that causes visitors to say the sphinx just doesnt 
look the same hosni said hes determined to find a balance between 
the subtle beauty the ancients built into the sculpture with the 
need to save it by introducing modern touches 
unesco the united nations education and scientific agency has 
given 100000 for equipment to monitor harmful natural and 
manmade phenomena like pollution and wind the antiquities 
organizations tawfik said discussions for technical help are under 
with with the getty conservation institute of marina del ray 
calif and the smithsonian institution 
this rock has been sick ever since it was hewn theres been 
repair and restoration work for thousands of years hosni said 
under the pharaohs under the romans under subsequent reigns 
weve been trying to restore this rock because it is not firm it 
has been affected by erosion by atmosphere climate or by 
subterranean waters 
hosni said antiquities officials are trying to protect the relic 
as its builders did without using cement 
nevertheless he said nothing we have done cannot be 
reversed 
tawfik noted that the sphinxs arabic name is abu elhawl 
father of terror and said experts remain terrified 
scholars are afraid to do anything to harm the wonderful 
beast he said any international expert is at once faced with 
the idea he may cause danger to one of the worlds most famous 
monuments 
tawfik described the work done so far as patchwork 
once the conclusions are in he said well take the greatest 
step ever for the sphinx to restore it as a whole but it will 
require restoration forever doctors will have to feed him what he 
needs now and then 
omar elarini the us embassys science officer said the 
sphinx must be considered 50 million years old 
thats how old the rocks are that made the sphinx he said 
the sphinx is living rock and its suffering from old age 
tourists will get used to its new look elarini said the 
sphinx has had many looks he said it had one look when it was 
built a thousand years later it had another most of the time it 
was buried in sand 
another generation of tourists wont remember how the sphinx 
looked to those who came before 
the important thing he said is to keep it standing or rather 
sitting

a new furor over airport security broke out 
thursday after the discovery that a british airways jet flew with 
an explosive aboard for at least two weeks because police on a 
bombdetection drill forgot to remove it 
the gelignite was tucked in a seat pocket in economy class of 
the boeing 747 news reports said wednesday night authorities 
would not say when the gelignite was put on the plane 
the incident was particularly embarrassing to british officials 
trying to tighten security following the dec 21 bombing of pan am 
flight 103 over lockerbie scotland 
the air transport users committee a consumer group called it 
the sort of carelessness we cant afford 
lawmaker david wilshire of the governing conservative party said 
the public was always being told british airways was among the most 
securityminded airlines 
my mind boggles at the thought of what airlines in timbuktu 
are like if this is the best he said the worst must be 
mindblowingly incompetent 
the chairman of british airways lord king said the explosives 
worked their way through the upholstery and that a cleaner found 
them monday after the jet returned to heathrow airport from toronto 
police inspector andrew nielson said the gelignite weighed less 
than a pound and was four inches long and less than an inch wide 
he said the substance had no detonator could not explode by itself 
and at the very worst it could flare up if ignited by fire 
king said even if the substance posed no danger thats not 
the point it might have been something that was dangerous he 
promised an investigation adding if heads fall they fall 
the explosives were brought aboard the plane to test security 
but overlooked by police dogs trained to search for bombs 
according to authorities 
scotland yard said an agreement with british airways permits the 
occasional use of its planes for dog training and king said he 
would think twice about allowing the arrangement to continue 
asked who was to blame king said the police say they are 
responsible for it being there i am responsible for the airline 
and whatever its involved in we dont stand back from that 
transport minister lord brabazon said he contacted the chief 
executive of british airways colin marshall to express concern 
over the incident which was being investigated by police 
asked why the police did not count the explosives before and 
after the bombdetection drill brabazon said that does seem 
rather odd i agree 
lawmaker john prescott of the opposition labor party expressed 
shock that the incident occurred after a spate of security lapses 
despite repeated government insistence on tightened security 
we are now the laughing stock of the world when we used to be 
the best the evening standard quoted him as saying 
transport secretary paul channon is under fire for alleged 
laxity in informing airlines of suspected bomb plots before flight 
103 which originated in frankfurt and stopped at heathrow blew 
up the explosion blamed on a terrorist bomb killed all 259 
people aboard the jet and 11 on the ground 
in midjanuary two journalists working independent of each 
other reported they obtained cleaning jobs at heathrow airport 
using fake names 
one of them a television reporter was filmed carrying a dummy 
parcel into the cockpit of a japan air lines plane 
on feb 14 pan am suspended its cleaning company after a 
reporter said he gave false details of his identity and could have 
planted a bomb aboard planes while working for the firm 
last week three youths in ski masks sneaked aboard an empty 
british airways jumbo jet in a maintenance area at heathrow 
photographed their escapade and gave the videotape to a television 
network

the moslem cleric slain in his brussels 
office had been threatened with death for opposing ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeinis order that author salman rushdie be killed as a 
blasphemer officials said thursday 
vice premier willy claes said abdullah ahdal who was killed 
wednesday got telephone threat march 24 because of his 
disagreement with khomeinis death sentence on the indianborn 
british novelist for writing the satanic verses 
rushdie has been in hiding in britain since khomeini issued the 
proclamation feb 14 
claes said the islamic world is deeply divided by khomeinis 
execution order which iranian clerics accompanied with a reward of 
52 million and the threat clearly referred to the moderate 
viewpoints ahdal had expressed 
he did not exclude other motives for the murder however no one 
has claimed responsibility 
britain offered to help find the killers i stand ready to 
offer any assistance which may be necessary to track down those who 
perpetrated this foul crime home secretary douglas hurd said in 
a letter to justice minister melchior wathelet 
police strengthened border security and said they had no leads 
sources reported tension among belgiums 225000 moslems on the 
rushdie issue and said ahdal had argued hours before the murder 
with some who disagreed with him 
ahdal had been in belgium for six years and directed of the 
moslem world league in belgium the netherlands and luxembourg the 
league based in mecca is a moderate islamic institution 
the 36yearold saudi national was shot to death in his office 
at the citys main mosque along with salem behir the mosque 
librarian behir 48 was a tunisian 
police said they were shot at close range with single shots to 
the head and chest with no signs of a struggle ahdal was on the 
telephone when he was shot they said 
in a belgian tv interview on feb 20 six days after the iranian 
patriarch ordered rushdie killed ahdal agreed the satanic 
verses was blasphemous but said of the death sentence 
one should not have done that rushdie should have first 
appeared before an islamic tribunal he should have explained 
himself defended himself he should have been asked to repent 
in democratic societies everyone has the right to speak his 
thoughts to express himself as he wants he said 
at a meeting of theologians last month in mecca the holy city 
of islam the moslem world league said rushdies book was 
blasphemous did not support khomeinis death sentence 
elements of the book that offend moslems include a brothel scene 
in which prostitutes take the names of mohammeds wives and the 
suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy koran rather than 
receiving it from allah 
rushdie 41 was born in bombay to moslem parents but has said 
he no longer practices religion 
because of the attack protection measures for members of the 
islamic community were immediately increased claes said 
including more frequent police patrols near mosques and protection 
for moslem leaders 
he said ahdal was offered increased protection after the threat 
march 24 but refused it 
claes joined islamic leaders in urging moslems in belgium to 
remain calm 
sheik ibrahim bakr saudi arabias ambassador to brussels asked 
moslems to refrain from violence and have confidence in belgian 
justice 
he said ahdal exemplified the young tolerant moderate moslem 
who sacrificed his life to serve islam

for the first time since its savannah river 
nuclear weapons plant was built in 1950 the energy department is 
offering performance bonuses and a guaranteed base fee to the 
plants operator department officials said thursday 
william kaspar manager of the departments field office at 
savannah river near aiken sc outlined the payment plan to a 
group of experts advising energy secretary james d watkins on 
safety issues involving the departments nuclear weapons 
facilities which includes 16 major sites in 12 states 
the payment plan which takes effect saturday with the debut of 
a new contractor at savannah river marks a significant departure 
from past practice in which ei du pont de nemours amp co operated 
the plant for 38 years without any fees 
kaspar said the new plan is intended to give du ponts successor 
at savannah river westinghouse electric corp a financial 
incentive to improve operation of the plants three nuclear 
reactors which make materials for nuclear warheads the site also 
includes other facilities that support the nuclear weapons program 
the three reactors have been shut down since last spring because 
of safety concerns last week westinghouse submitted 
recommendations on how to get them running again and their success 
or failure will largely determine how much they earn on the job 
although westinghouses contract is for five years the payment 
plan can be changed each six months kaspar said for the first 
sixmonth period westinghouse can earn a maximum of about 7 
million in performance awards and a minimum of zero he said 
mark silverman an energy department official at savannah river 
who helped draft the payment plan said in an interview that 
westinghouse would be guaranteed a fee of 750000 for running a 
naval fuel fabrication plant at the site plus 125 million for 
managing the rest of the 300squaremile complex 
the performance awards would be in addition to the guaranteed 
fees silverman said the amounts to be offered for subsequent 
sixmonth periods havent been set he said 
kaspar said the departments decisions on granting performance 
bonuses would be based on a detailed list of tasks and standards 
that place the highest priority on safety and quality of 
operations this term was chosen he said to give equal weight 
to production performance and safety achievements 
the energy department and du pont have been heavily criticized 
for putting too much emphasis on meeting production goals at the 
expense of safety concerns 
members of the departments safety advisory group questioned 
kaspar about the strong focus on rewarding excellence saying this 
approach might lead westinghouse to figure it can spend unlimited 
amounts so long as the results are judged to be outstanding the 
companys expenses will be paid in full by the government 
right now im not worrying about overkill on striving for 
excellence kaspar said

the navy believes a trident 2 missile that 
failed during a launch attempt last week suffered a mechanical 
failure in the firststage nozzle mechanism the pentagon said 
thursday 
dan howard the defense departments chief spokesman said the 
navy had managed to recover some parts of the missile from the 
ocean floor off cape canaveral fla and to analyze more of the 
radio telemetry data from the launch 
they have determined from the telemetry at this point that the 
difficulty was not with the guidance system or any of the 
electrical systems howard said 
the most likely suspect is a mechanical failure in the nozzle 
mechanism 
the navys investigation began march 21 shortly after a trident 
2 missile fired from the submarine tennessee selfdestructed just 
four seconds after launch the missile popped to the surface as 
planned and the first stage ignited properly but then the missile 
began spinning like a burning pinwheel and exploded 
it was the first submarine launch of the navys newest and most 
powerful weapon 
according to howard the firststage rocket nozzles of the 
missile are supposed to swivel immediately after firing to put the 
weapon on a 19degree angle of flight then another internal 
command is sent to the nozzles to straighten back up thus 
maintaining the 19degree flight angle 
in this case the spokesman says the nozzles never straightened 
back up after the second command and it appears the cause was 
mechanical 
the threestage trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon 
that is the heart of americas naval nuclear deterrent the trident 
1 the new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to 
individual targets up to 6000 miles away 
the navy says the new weapon is much more accurate than its 
undersea predecessors polaris poseidon and trident 1 and can 
match the targeting ability of landbased missiles even though it 
is launched from a submerged moving submarine 
the tennessee is the first of nine submarines equipped to carry 
24 of the deadly missiles

iran on thursday ordered the swiss consul 
to leave tehran and accused him of spying after its own consul in 
geneva was forced to leave 
switzerlands ambassador in tehran heinrich reimann lodged a 
formal protest after the iranian foreign ministry summoned him 
thursday afternoon and told him the consul jakob schranz had to 
leave a swiss spokesman said 
tehran radio said the foreign ministry told the ambassador that 
schranz was an undesirable element because he was involved in 
activities incompatible with his diplomatic status a term used 
to denote spying 
josef hermann a spokesman for the swiss federal prosecutors 
office said irans consul in geneva manouchehr talemassouleh 
engaged in certain activities that led to his having to leave 
switzerland wednesday night but he did not elaborate 
reimann whose embassy also handles us interests in tehran 
told iranian officials the iranian order was unacceptable 
because no real reason was given swiss foreign ministry 
spokesman michel pache told reporters in bern 
pache said switzerland considered it a purely retaliatory 
measure after talemassouleh was forced out of the country 
swiss authorities wanted talemassouleh to leave at the end of 
february but iran wanted him to stay until his tour of duty 
expired at the end of april pache said a compromise was reached 
for him to leave at the end of march he said 
hermann said swiss authorities are investigating two people 
suspected of helping the iranian diplomat gather information but 
their nationalities or whereabouts were not disclosed 
questions about talemassoulehs activities surfaced after the 
geneva consulate was occupied for five hours dec 14 by six iranian 
militants who said they were protesting executions in iran 
at their trial in geneva in january they claimed documents in 
the consulate showed talemassouleh led efforts to spy on iranian 
refugees in switzerland but the diplomat denied it

the very voluminous documentation he did not elaborate 
the consulate occupiers six men aged 25 to 41 all received

less is better and that helped make him the screens greatest 
actor the tracy credo is recommended to future producers of 
academy award shows 
wednesday nights orgy of selfcongratulation was dazzling 
glamorous and all those familiar hollywood adjectives also too 
much 
too many endless production numbers too much forced 
conversation between couples too many awards with meaning lost to 
the general public 
the use of couples costars compadres and companions as 
presenters for the 61st academy awards at the shrine auditorium was 
clever but wearing 
the best oscar shows have been emceed by will rogers bob hope 
johnny carson and other funnymen who provided continuity as well as 
a leavening of pomposity 
the brightest moments of the 61st awards came from billy 
crystal robin williams and bob hope but they were all too brief 
tom selleck remarked that douglas fairbanks sr handed out the 
first awards in 1929 in five minutes the present awards could be 
staged in two hours instead of the 3 hours and 15 minutes they took 
wednesday night on abctv 
but the show will never be shorter reason the time is needed 
to sell all those 30second adds at 375000 per 
since the academy awards are a night of superlatives here are a 
few more

a farm worker imprisoned for life after 
his seven children were fatally poisoned in 1967 was not fairly 
treated by prosecutors two decades ago an official investigating 
the case was quoted as saying 
dade county state attorney janet reno appointed by gov bob 
martinez to review the case of james richardson met with martinez 
and aides to state cabinet members wednesday the governor and the 
six independently elected cabinet members will hold a hearing next 
week to decide whether to pardon richardson 
ms reno refused to comment on the investigation but the st 
petersburg times in thursdays editions quoted several officials 
who attended the meeting as saying that she has uncovered 
significant flaws in the murder conviction 
peter dunbar general counsel for martinez told the newspaper 
there was obviously a serious question in ms renos mind about 
whether richardson should be in prison 
dunbar said ms reno found approximately six inches of 
documents that should have gone to defense attorneys when 
richardson was tried under state law a defendant has a right to 
information collected by prosecutors particularly information that 
could exonerate him 
richardson now 53 was sentenced to die in floridas electric 
chair in 1968 after an allwhite jury convicted him of the 
firstdegree murder in the oldest childs death richardson is 
black 
his sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1972 when the 
us supreme court outlawed the death penalty 
the richardson children died after eating a lunch heavily laced 
with the insecticide parathion prosecutors charged richardson 
poisoned the food before he left for work in order to collect 
insurance jurors were never told that richardson had only asked 
about an insurance policy and never purchased one 
richardsons supporters have accused bessie reese the 
childrens baby sitter of killing them the elderly woman is now 
mentally incompetent and in a nursing home 
the documents withheld from defense attorneys apparently 
included a request for a search warrant indicating that ms reese 
had traces of parathion on her clothes 
there is what i was afraid of said jim york chief deputy 
for attorney general bob butterworth the prosecutors didnt give 
the defense everything when it comes up this late in a 
prosecution its serious 
york said that in addition to the clemency study being conducted 
in the executive branch hes asked his criminal appeals division 
to look at the case 
if the problem is as serious as it appears york said the 
division would probably ask if the prosecution can give richardson 
a new trial if the 20year lapse of time makes that impossible 
richardson could be set free york indicated

park and would bbuy snacks for children terriere said 
kelm was the perfect neighbor said denise warner who lived

the federal communications commission on 
thursday made changes in its radio regulations that could provide a 
multibilliondollar boost in the development of devices such as 
wireless computers vcrs and speakers 
the commission voting 30 increased the number of frequencies 
for nonlicensed radio frequency devices and removed restrictions 
on their usage bandwidth and modulation 
these devices include television remote control units garage 
door openers wireless microphones and cordless telephones many of 
which use radio waves to send signals over short distances through 
the air 
thomas p stanley chief of the fccs office of engineering and 
technology said the agency receives 10000 applications a year for 
such devices 
he said the rule changes could lead to a 2 billion increase in 
the production of such items 
the fcc tightly controls the range and types of signals these 
devices can emit so they dont interfere with licensed radio 
operations such as commercial broadcast stations and police and 
aircraft radios 
thursdays ruling broadens the portion of the airwaves these 
devices can use while in some cases tightening emissions standards 
to prevent interference with other radio services 
the rules were implemented in 1938 since then the fcc has 
amended them on a casebycase basis for each new radio frequency 
device 
by taking this approach a number of inequities in the 
technical standards contained in the rules developed the fcc 
said 
additionally the standards needed to protect against 
interference to licensed radio services have changed over the years 
due to improvements in equipment such as receiver sensitivity 
increased proliferation of both licensed and nonlicensed radio 
operations and changes to the frequency allocations of authorized 
radio services 
the amended rules will restore the technical flexibility 
originally envisioned for nonlicensed devices and eliminate 
all unnecessary and overly restrictive technical regulations the 
agency said 
the commission also voted not to allow new radio frequency 
devices to operate on broadcast frequencies being reserved for the 
next generation of television highdefinition television which 
may require a larger piece of the broadcast spectrum than now 
needed for tv signals

review two years implementation of the sixth party congress 
resolutions and establish orientations and tasks for the next three

president bush said thursday that the oil 
spill off alaskas coast is a major tragedy but his 
administration ruled out a federal takeover of the cleanup the 
coast guard chief said the oil tankers path was so wide that a 
child could have navigated it safely 
meanwhile top administration officials reported that the 
cleanup was marred by the shipping companys failure to respond 
swiftly in the hours just after the tanker exxon valdez ran aground 
last friday 
approximately 10 million gallons of crude oil went into the 
water and most of that went into the water in the first five 
hours said transportation secretary samuel k skinner 
he said faster action by the exxon shipping co which owned the 
supertanker might have diminished it the damage somewhat 
while us officials were generally generous in their praise of 
exxons subsequent performance in the cleanup effort adm paul 
yost the coast guard commandant voiced incredulity that the 
accident could have happened at all 
yost said that the largeship channel leading from valdez 
alaska where the tanker had taken on its cargo of crude oil to 
the open gulf of alaska was wide and wellmarked 
weve got 10 miles of open water there and for that vessel to 
come over and hit a reef is almost unbelievable yost told 
reporters 
this is not treacherous in the area they went aground its 10 
miles wide your children could drive a tanker up through it 
obviously something went very badly wrong he said 
he said allegations of alcohol use by the tankers captain 
joseph hazelwood were being closely scrutinized by the government 
at the time the tanker ran aground hazelwood was in his cabin 
and a relatively junior officer third mate gregory cousins was at 
the helm 
yost skinner and environmental protection agency administrator 
william reilly spoke to reporters at the white house after briefing 
bush on their twoday survey of efforts to battle the spreading oil 
slick in alaskas prince william sound 
bush speaking to the association of community and junior 
colleges said the spill the worst in the nations history was 
a subject of concern to all americans today 
departing from his prepared text bush said theres no doubt 
this is a major tragedy both for the environment and for the 
people up there 
he expressed confidence that those involved in the cleanup were 
doing their best to see that the damage is restricted 
but the president said lets be frank there are some very 
serious problems up there right now 
he said the cleanup will not be easy 
at the same time the administration decided against one option 
initially mentioned by bush as a possibility a federal takeover 
of the cleanup process 
skinner said the cleanup operation now appears to be 
wellcoordinated among exxon federal and state agencies and at 
this point there is not a need to federalize this effort 
such a decision might be counterproductive because of the 
coordination that is now going on he added 
reilly said damage to fish and wildlife may be felt there for 
some time to come 
this is obviously a disaster of enormous potential magnitude 
and impact on the environment reilly said it seems inevitable 
that there will be a very substanial impacts 
reilly said bush had given top priority to a federal 
assessment of how to best protect the oildamaged areas of the 
oncepristine area in southern alaska 
reilly said the spill would not change the administrations 
support for oil exploration in the arctic national wildlife refuge 
in northeast alaska 
all things considered it is inconceivable that any nation 
would walk away from the resources that may exist in the magnitude 
that is potentially there in alaska reilly said 
until last friday night the record was pretty good for 
transporting oil through prince william sound the epa chief said 
the three officials will continue to monitor the situation and 
report to the president in 30 days with recommendations including 
possible options for longrange steps said white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
skinner said that at the appropriate time the government 
would decide what penalties are appropriate noting that a 
state criminal investigation was also taking place 
he said he and the other bush officials who toured the disaster 
site had stressed in a meeting with exxon shipping co president 
frank iarossi and other exxon officials our concern that the 
people most affected by this be adequately compensated 
skinner said the exxon officials vowed to put their money 
where their mouth is and that the united states would hold the 
company to its commitment 
the transportation secretary said the supertanker ripped into 
the reef at about 15 knots or about 17 miles per hour

observed for months but south africa and the rebel southwest 
africa peoples organization formally made the formal agreement 
thursday 
martti ahtisaari the un representative who will oversee the 
transition to independence is to arrive friday 
many black namibians believe the united nations will take over 
the territory saturday discrimination will end and south african 
officials will leave 
louis pienaar appointed by south africa to impartially govern 
the territory and run elections said the only immediate change 
will be the presence of mr ahtisaari 
dirk mudge president of a multiracial coalition expected to be 
swapos main competition in the november elections said 
irresponsible people are going around telling namibians that on 
the first of april things will change in this country 
theres going to be a lot of disappointment said mudge 
leader of the democratic turnhalle alliance 
danny tjongarero acting chairman of swapo which has waged 
political and guerrila campaigns for independence since 1966 said 
ahtisaaris arrival is indeed a historic event and one all 
namibians have been looking forward to 
our people in the townships see the arrival of the united 
nations as assuming responsibility over namibia tjongarero said 
pienaar said he will not rescind laws providing for racially 
segregated schools hospitals and municipal governments but after 
consultation with ahtisaari will begin repealing discriminatory 
laws that may hinder a free and fair election 
he said his first proclamation effective next week will remove 
all obstacles to political meetings previously restricted by 
security legislation south africa has administered namibia since 
world war i and the united nations has been trying to get it out of 
the territory since 1966 the south africans agreed to the 
independence plan as part of a regional accord that also calls for 
withdrawal of cuban troops from angola 
rf botha the south african foreign minister said prime 
minister margaret thatcher of britain is expected in namibia this 
weekend as the transition to independence begins 
he said mrs thatcher probably would visit british members of 
the un peacekeeping force that will monitor elections scheduled 
for november 
the un group will consist of 4650 un peacekeepers 500 
police monitors 620 election monitors from various nations at 
least 760 un civilian administrators and 820 locally hired staff 
the south african government said thursday no territory or 
colony in africa had been as well prepared for independence as 
namibia and gave itself the credit 
it said south africa had provided more resources to namibia 
than any colonial power devoted to the development of territories 
under its control

a tel aviv district court convicted a 
sovietborn israeli of passing army secrets to the palestine 
liberation organization israel radio said thursday 
it said benjamin shenkman 36 was convicted on sunday after he 
confessed to charges of transferring secret information to the 
enemy and having contacts with enemy agents he told the court he 
asked for 15 million in return for the information the radio 
reported 
shenkman who reportedly became disillusioned with israeli 
society after immigrating here from the soviet union in 1978 never 
received any of the money he requested 
sentencing was set for april 12 the maximum term is 33 years 
shenkman told the court he visited athens greece three times 
in 1988 and gave plo officials information about his military 
service including the location of bases and names of commanders 
he also offered to fly to plo headquarters in tunis tunisia 
and hold a news conference where he would rip up his passport and 
say israel is a racist state the court heard 
shenkman served in the army for four months in 1985 it would be 
unusual for a new immigrant who served for a short time to hold a 
sensitive position 
shenkman was arrested at tel avivs bengurion airport upon his 
return from his third visit to athens 
his was the second recent case of espionage involving a soviet 
emigre on dec 15 shabtai kalmanovich 45 was jailed for nine

a house chairman said thursday that reaching 
concensus in congress on modernizing the nations landbased 
missile force requires both building midgetman missiles and basing 
mxs aboard railroad cars 
if we want to settle the icbm issue once and for all we need 
a program that will take the 50 mx missiles out o silos and put 
them on rails and that will build 300 to 500 midgetman missiles 
armed services chairman les aspin dwis said in remarks in los 
angeles 
lawmakers have wrangled for years over whether to choose the 
smaller singlewarhead midgetman missile supported by many 
democrats or instead back the mobile 10warhead mx missile that is 
a favorite of republicans 
a newly unveiled democratic compromise offer calls for 
converting the 50 existing mx missiles from vulnerable silos to a 
rail garrison basing mode placing them on railroad cars and 
moving them around the country and building 300 to 500 midgetman 
missiles 
aspin said democrats will not accept more than 50 mx missiles 
for political consensus we are probably going to have to have 
both rail mx and midgetman aspin said copies of his speech were 
released by his office in washington 
but rep bill dickinson rala the top republican on the armed 
services committee on wednesday called the plan a bad deal 
because it would place unacceptable limits on defense programs 
including capping mx production at the 50 already fielded 
he also was criticial of the plans envisioned development of 
the midgetman at a cost of 25 million to 35 million negative 
growth in defense spending and cuts in funding for star wars and 
the b2 stealth bomber 
dickinson urged his fellow gop lawmakers to vote against the 
midgetman unless democrats agree to president bushs call for an 
increase in defense spending after fiscal 1990 
bush has proposed zero growth in defense spending in fiscal 
1990 1 percent growth in fiscal 1991 and fiscal 1992 and 2 percent 
growth in fiscal 1993 
the small icbm is a good system and our national security 
would benefit from having it dickinson said in a twopage 
statement but if the cost of the program is gutting sdi and 
other programs while defense budgets continue to be reduced then 
we are better off with no deal 
in his speech aspin suggested sequential spending to finance 
the plan with construction of the rail mx first and the midgetman 
second or vice versa he also proposed flattening the sdi budget 
or slipping the b2 or knocking out some operational weapons in 
order to free up money for modernization 
defense secretary dick cheney supported the mx while he served 
in the house but he has not indicated if he would back a plan 
based on the mx the midgetman or a mix of the two national 
security adviser brent scowcroft is an opponent of the mx 
last week gen larry welch air force chief of staff discussed 
the plan with legislators but was publicly rebuked by cheney for 
freelancing aspin called cheneys criticism a bum rap 
welch wasnt trying to put a deal together he made plain he 
wasnt speaking for the president he was just exploring the 
outlines of a possible compromise with congress with no intention 
of cutting the new secretary out of the deal aspin said

prices farmers got for raw products rose 07 
percent from february to march averaging 15 percent more than a 
year ago the agriculture department said thursday 
the departments agricultural statistics board said in its 
preliminary report that higher prices for eggs broilers wheat and 
potatoes were mostly responsible for the increase from the february 
average 
lower prices for tomatoes oranges milk and strawberries partly 
offset the rise for the other commodities 
market egg prices were at their highest level since april 
1984 while the average broiler price increased moderately from 
february the report said feed grain and soybean prices also 
increased from a month earlier and the allwheat price was at the 
highest level since february of 1981 
the preliminary wheat price for march was 416 per bushel up 
from 403 in february that was the highest wheat price in any 
month since it was 417 more than eight years ago 
egg prices at the farm fewer because of massive cutbacks last 
year in the nations laying hen flock averaged more than 80 cents 
a dozen up 20 cents from february and almost 30 cents from a year 
ago 
most fruit and vegetable prices were down from february and 
cattle and hogs also were down slightly 
last years drought helped reduce supplies of major crops 
including corn soybeans and wheat which has resulted in higher 
prices but cutbacks or delayed expansion by many livestock 
producers also have helped bolster market prices 
the overall index of prices paid to farmers in march averaged 
149 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison 
john buche of the departments national agricultural statistics 
service said the index has been averaging at record monthly levels 
since it climbed to 149 percent in january from 145 in december it 
dipped to 148 in february before gaining again in march according 
to the preliminary figures 
buche said the previous high for the current series of price 
statistics going back to 1965 was 146 percent in january 1984 
according to the preliminary march price figures based mostly 
on midmonth averages the index for livestock and livestock 
products as a group rose 13 percent from the february average and 
was up 81 percent from a year ago 
the departments allcrops price index for march was down 07 
percent from february but averaged 23 percent above a year ago 
no new price figures for farm production costs were included in 
the february report those have been confined to quarterly averages 
because of budget cutbacks 
in january however new quarterly figures showed that prices 
paid by farmers to meet expenses were up 12 percent from last fall 
and were 61 percent higher than a year earlier 
although the projections are subject to change usda economists 
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of 48 
billion to 52 billion this year compared with a nearrecord of 
57 billion in 1988 that is the difference between cash receipts 
and cash expenses during the calendar year 
department economists say cash expenses are expected to rise 
moderately in 1989 with expanded crop acreages and costlier 
production items 
food prices in 1988 rose an average of 41 percent and usda 
analysts say another increase of 3 percent to 5 percent is likely 
in 1989 
the report said 
cattle averaged 7120 per 100 pounds of live weight 
nationally down from 7150 in february but up from 6830 in 
march 1988 those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 3980 per 100 pounds compared with 4040 in 
february and 4220 a year earlier 
corn at 261 a bushel was up from 258 in february and from 
186 in march 1988 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 416 per bushel compared with 403 in february and 
274 a year earlier 
rice averaged 646 per 100 pounds down from 659 in 
february rice was 922 a year earlier 
soybeans were 757 per bushel up from 741 in february and 
605 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 555 cents per pound up from 
529 in february but down from 579 in march 1988 
eggs were 801 cents per dozen compared with 621 cents in 
february and 508 cents a year earlier 
milk was 1280 per 100 pounds compared with 1310 in 
february and 1190 a year earlier 
broilers were 387 cents per pound live weight compared with 
352 cents in february and 275 cents a year ago

the white house on thursday corrected the 
impression left by president bush that he opposes giving tax breaks 
to parents who send their children to private schools 
bush still supports the notion of tuition tax credits in 
concept but believes the government cannot afford them now in an 
era of big budget deficits said white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater 
thats what he meant to say fitzwater said with a smile 
thats what a careful reading will show 
bush had said wednesday that all taxpayers have an obligation to 
support the public education system 
and then if on top of that your parents think that they want 
to shell out in addition to the tax money tuition money thats 
their right and that should be respected but i dont think they 
should get a break for that 
the issue arose when bush fielded questions from a group of 
young peoplethe president said he had been intrigued with the 
concept of tuition tax credits and some say well should that 
include parachoial schools and ive said yes 
however bush said we cant afford to do that 
backpedaling from bushs comments fitzwater said he hasnt 
changed his position at all in terms of how he views the tuition 
tax credit but he does not believe we can afford it at this time 
he still supports it in concept 
bush will send a package of education proposals to congress on 
wednesday but it will not contain tuition tax credits fitzwater 
said 
in a speech thursday to the american association of community 
and junior colleges the president put in a plug for his 
alternative teacher certification proposal 
i believe secondary and elementary schools can learn a lot 
from your success starting with your policy of flexibility he 
said by this i mean the way in which you tap local talent and 
draw on the knowledge of experts from the private sector 
when a phd on sabbatical cannot volunteer as a teacher in 
many school districts something is very wrong bush said he 
said thats the reason he wants to open classrooms to every 
qualified person with the talent the knowledge and the desire to 
teach 
bush said we must all pitch in to restore our educational 
system and to help americas workers compete with those in other 
countries

problemplagued turkey points only working nuclear 
reactor remained shut down thursday until florida power amp light co 
can prove to federal inspectors its staff knows how to operate the 
plant safely 
the utility took the unit off line wednesday when the nuclear 
regulatory commission announced that half of the key control room 
operators tested had failed their routine yearly requalification 
exam that immediately barred them from running the plant 
eleven of 24 operators and three of six teams who are tested 
on their ability to work together failed all or part of the exam 
said nrc spokesman ken clark 
the results were so worrisome the nrc is sending a special team 
to review the performance of all control room staff at the plant 
located on the atlantic coast about 20 miles south of miami 
we want to take a look at the rest of the operators too even 
the ones who have passed the nrc exam clark said thursday we 
have questions now about the adequacy of their training program 
those who failed must be retrained and recertified by the nrc 
before they are allowed back into the control room the florida 
utility says it hopes to complete all the testing within a week 
if we are satisfed the plant will probably be allowed to go 
back on line clark said 
the utility must also file a full report with the nrc by may 1 
detailing how the company will upgrade training to satisfactory 
levels 
utility spokeswoman stacey shaw minimized the training 
difficulties on thursday calling the failure rate an unusual 
circumstance 
more than half of those who failed the exam were inactive 
management personnel who no longer work in the control room but 
maintain their licenses she said in all the utility has 52 
licensed operators of which 40 actually work in the control rooms 
she insisted the utility voluntarily shut down unit 3 on 
wednesday although clark said the nrc would not have accepted 
anything less 
antinuclear activist joette lorion who has conducted a 
onewoman crusade against turkey point for years said the test 
failures are extremely serious 
operators of nuclear plants are very important she said 
weve seen in accidents such as three mile island and chernobyl 
that operator error greatly contributed to and in some cases even 
caused the accidents 
the nrc has hit turkey point with about 1 million in fines over 
the past five years for safety and security violations identifying 
the plant as one of the nations ten worst ralph naders public 
citizen environmental group has also called it one of the 
worstmanaged commercial facilities 
last year the florida utility was forced by the nrc to overhaul 
turkey points management after a series of incidents including a 
leak that severely corroded a giant bolt holding the reactor vessel 
together guards found asleep on duty unescorted visitors in 
sensitive areas leaks from the spent fuel pool and other problems 
there are two nuclear units at turkey point the other unit is 
undergoing refueling and is not expected back on line until 
midapril said utility spokesman gary mehalik the two 
666megawatt units built in the early 1970s are capable of 
providing about 10 percent of the capacity of florida power amp 
light which serves more than 3 million customers in south and 
central florida

former army col david hackworth a hero whose 
disenchantment with the vietnam war led to a selfimposed exile 
wants to return to the united states a magazine reported 
hackworth who went to australia after the war and made millions 
in a restaurant business and a duck farm hopes to move to colorado 
and become a military commentator parade says in its sunday issue 
the article was written by former secretary of the navy james 
webb who praised hackworth but also said he could learn much by 
coming back to the united states and seeing how we have been 
slowly and honestly coming to grips with the vietnam war webb 
was navy secretary in the reagan administration 
my first love has always been the army webb quoted 
hackworth 58 as saying i think i have some important insights 
to offer especially in the area of readiness and training 
hackworth was awarded two distinguished service crosses nine 
silver stars four legions of merit and eight bronze stars and was 
an almost certain candidate for general when his downfall began 
during his four years in vietnam he became increasingly 
frustrated by what he saw as the armys lack of overall objectives 
and its failure to adapt its tactics to the enemy 
by 1971 hackworth said he was convinced the war was lost and 
decided to hurt the army as badly as shed hurt me i went out of 
my way to break every regulation i could 
he castigated the armys strategy and leadership on the 
television program issues and answers and predicted in a 
newsweek interview that the north vietnamese flag would be flying 
over saigon in 1975 he was nearly courtmartialed before he 
retired from the military

the federal communications commission on 
thursday adopted new rules designed to limit the payments radio and 
tv station owners may make to quickbuck artists who challenge 
station licenses 
at the same time the fcc asked for further comment on the 
standards used in the socalled comparative renewal process by 
which the commission decides if station owners are worthy 
licenseholders 
the fcc has been concerned about frivolous challenges to station 
licenses and sham applications made by entities that hope to get 
licenseholders to pay them off rather than fight the competing 
applications 
challenges may be made during the comparative renewal process or 
by a direct petition to deny a license renewal on grounds the 
station is not serving the public interest 
the rules adopted thursday would ban all settlement payments 
prior to an initial decision by the fcc in a comparative hearing 
and would limit payments after that hearing to the legitimate and 
prudent expenses of the withdrawing applicant in petitions to 
deny the payments would be limited to the same legitimate and 
prudent expenses standard 
the new rules also require prior fcc approval of all payment 
agreements and they eliminate the socalled cameron doctrine that 
allowed competing applicants to presume that they could acquire the 
incumbent licensees transmitter site and avoid completion of an 
engineering application 
the commission also voted to revise the form filed by 
challengers to require additional financial ownership and other 
information 
our actions today will greatly discourage if not eliminate 
the filing of comparative applications and petitions to deny with 
the intent to extort cash settlements fcc chairman dennis r 
patrick said

african commandos are serving prison terms authorities said 
police and army officials said the nine claimed to be salesmen 
marketing cleansers one of the group had a rocket flare and 
another had a pair of handcuffs the officials said 
a police official said on condition of anonymity that 
authorities had insufficient evidence to file any charges 
the official said the men some of them white and some black 
had very little money with them and seemed to lack expertise about 
their products 
they were arrested tuesday in francistown where south africans 
theodore hermansen and johannes basson began serving 10year prison 
terms last year after their capture during an aborted south african 
crossborder raid 
a south african army unit had been sent into botswana on a 
mission against the african national congress guerrilla movement 
the soldiers encountered a botswana police patrol and fled back 
into south africa after firing on the unarmed policemen injuring 
three of them 
hermansen and basson dressed in plainclothes were arrested at 
a roadblock near the scene of the shooting in december they were 
convicted of assault 
during their trial their botswanan defense laywer and a black 
south african were arrested and charged with plotting to free the 
two white commandos from prison that case has not been completed

defense secretary dick cheney said thursday he 
had approved plans submitted by 12 states to step up the use of 
their national guard units in fighting drug trafficking 
cheneys approval means the 12 states will be eligible for extra 
federal funds from a special congressional appropriation approved 
last year to finance such national guard operations 
i signed off this morning on the packages for 12 states 
letters to the governors announcing to them that their plans for 
using some of that 40 million that congress appropriated for the 
guard have been approved cheney said in interview 
late thursday the pentagon released a list of the project 
approvals showing the 12 states would divide 118 million or 
294 percent of the 40 million that congress set aside 
based on recommendations from law enforcement agencies plans 
from 12 border states were accorded the highest priority the 
pentagon said in a statement 
plans from the other states have been reviewed and approved by 
the defense department and have been sent to the department of 
justice for further review 
the 12 states whose plans were approved thursday include 
alabama arizona california florida georgia hawaii louisiana 
mississippi new mexico oregon texas and washington 
the pentagon said that in general the states are planning to 
increase national guard operations by emphasizing more aerial 
photography and other imagery radar surveillance longrange 
reconnaissance assistance in searching containers and the 
transportation of law enforcement personnel equipment and seized 
substances 
in addition the pentagon said some of the state governments 
planned to expand training of law enforcement personnel and 
increase the loans of military equipment 
this expanded role does not include direct participation by 
guard personnel in police activities such as arrest and seizure 
the pentagon stressed 
the goal is supporting civilian drug law enforcement agencies 
in the nationwide crusade against drugs 
earlier thursday cheney made it clear he opposed the idea of 
turning soldiers into policemen with the power to make arrests 
i think its important for everybody to remember that the 
mission of the defense department is to defend the country he 
said its not a law enforcement function 
the pentagon said the state of florida was receiving the largest 
grant of those announced thursday at 34 million the other states 
and the amounts they will receive are

a decline in marriage doesnt mean young people 
are avoiding having a continuing relationship population analysts 
said thursday adding that living together is replacing matrimony 
for some pairs at least for a while 
both in behavior and attitude the timing of the marriage 
ceremony is becoming a matter of personal taste and convenience and 
less a major lifecourse transition said larry bumpass of the 
university of wisconsin 
bumpass told a session of the population association of america 
that between half and twothirds of the decline in marriage among 
young people can be accounted for by a rise in cohabitation 
for example he said among people under age 20 the share 
married declined from 27 percent in 1970 to 14 percent in 1985 but 
the figure for people involved in a union including marriage and 
cohabitation slipped only from 29 percent to 23 percent 
for people aged 25 or over bumpass said the marriage drop was 
from 72 percent to 55 percent over the same years but including 
those living together meant people in a union declined from 75 
percent to 69 percent 
federal statistics on cohabiting adults are weak statisticians 
have said because they also include people rooming together and 
other situations in which the people are not having an intimate 
relationship bumpass based his report on the national survey of 
families and households an indepth analysis of 13017 households 
he disputed a popular notion that people cohabiting are 
welleducated affluent young persons 
rather bumpass and other analysts reported people living 
together were more likely to have lower incomes and less education 
than others 
linda a jacobsen of cornell university suggested that financial 
problems may lead to a decision to cohabit in many cases with 
young people unable to afford to set up housekeeping on their own 
they often face a need to trade privacy for companionship and 
household economies she said 
a decline in marriage among younger people doesnt mean they 
have abandoned the institution said odalia ho wong of the 
university of marylandbaltimore 
women are postponing marriage and families to complete their 
education and launch a career she said but eventually most do wed 
and are then in a financial condition to consider children soon 
after marriage rather than waiting 
christine a bachrach of the center for population research 
agreed that economics likely plays an important part in 
cohabitation but she said that population experts may be giving 
too little attention to another important factor sex 
marriage ages were unusually low in the decades following world 
war ii while early in this century weddings were delayed as they 
are now with financial considerations a factor she said 
but cohabitation was not as common years ago as it has become 
she added and this increase must be considered to be a part of a 
sexual revolution something more tolerated now 
in addition to economics the population experts said other 
factors that are important include a desire to screen a potential 
marriage partner

oliver norths lawyers argued thursday that 
former president reagan is without question a material witness 
and should be ordered to testify in norths irancontra trial 
in this country a president is up from the masses and when his 
time is over he goes back to the masses said north attorney 
barry simon we are talking about a person who is retired from 
public office 
north a former national security council aide being tried on 12 
charges in connection with the irancontra affair had wanted 
reagan as the leadoff witness when the defense case opens monday 
us district judge gerhard a gesell said he will rule friday 
which is a day off for the jury 
reagan who has called north a national hero would be the 
first expresident to testify in response to a subpoena 
the justice department and reagans personal attorney argued 
that gesell should quash the reagan subpoena because norths 
lawyers had failed to show that the former president has any 
information that bears on the case 
but simon insisted that reagan is without question a material 
witness in the case 
we have a right to subpoena put his testimony on live before 
the jury and let them assess reagans credibility simon said he 
said that a taped questionandanswer session with reagan one of 
the suggestions for handling the former presidents testimony 
would not be fair to north since it would not be live for the 
jury 
one of the charges against north is that he lied to attorney 
general edwin meese iii when he investigated the irancontra 
affair a fact simon noted by saying we have for the first time 
a presidential factfinding inquiry being the source of a criminal 
charge 
he also recalled testimony that reagan had admonished aides not 
to disclose to congress that the saudi arabian government had 
contributed millions of dollars for the nicaraguan rebels 
the prosecution wound up its case thursday with testimony from a 
witness who told of muttering jeez that cant be when he saw 
the first evidence that iranian arms sales profits had gone to help 
the contra rebels 
john richardson had been sent along with assistant attorney 
general bradford reynolds to search norths office in the white 
house complex on nov 22 1986 to clear up conflicts about 
shipments of us arms to iran 
wed been there for some time richardson testified brad 
sort of gave me a nudge under the table handed me the document and 
pointed to one paragraph 
that paragraph described using 12 million in residual funds 
from the sales to purchase critically needed supplies for the 
guerrillas fighting the nicaraguan government 
i said something under my breath like jeez that cant be 
richardson said brad shrugged and put it back in the documents 
he was working on 
richardson who was meeses chief of staff and reynolds then 
met meese and assistant attorney general charles cooper for lunch 
asked about meeses reaction to the memo richardson said he 
was very surprised 
and cooper cooper said something like youre kidding 
three days after they found the document thenpresident reagan 
and meese announced at a news conference that they had uncovered 
the money diversion earlier that month reagan had admitted that 
weapons had been sold to iran in a failed attempt to free american 
hostages held in lebanon 
national security adviser john m poindexter resigned and north 
an aide was fired at the time the use of the arms sales money was 
announced 
richardson was the 29th and last prosecution witness in the 
trial which began jan 31 the defense case is scheduled to open 
monday 
richardsons testimony and that of cooper before him was an 
attempt by the prosecution to prove one of the 12 charges on which 
north is being tried that he lied to meese who was conducting a 
factfinding inquiry for the president 
at the time they found the damaging memorandum richardson said 
north aide robert earl was wandering in and out of the office 
he and reynolds ran into north as they went out to lunch he 
said and asked for files from 1985 on the iran arms initiative 
he said well you should have them all ill make sure you 
have them when you get back ill get them out richardson said 
previous testimony has been that while they lunched with meese 
north continued the document shredding that had occupied him deep 
into the night before 
after they returned to norths office to continue their review 
of documents north remained at his desk richardson said they 
heard him tell someone on the telephone that both of our 
governments are overreacting to this neither the other party nor 
the other government were identified in court 
north also told them that soon im going to be back 
commanding a marine battalion someones going to have to take a 
hit for this richardson said

a union whose membership includes about 
170000 janitors and other building service workers filed suit 
thursday seeking expanded national regulations governing asbestos 
use in buildings other than schools 
the suit was filed by the service employees international union 
two days after the federal environmental protection agency refused 
the unions request that it draft new asbestos guidelines for 
public and commercial buildings 
an epa spokesman said the agency would have no immediate comment 
on the suit 
many states regulate asbestos and there are national regulations 
governing asbestos use in new buildings and those under renovation 
but the suit said the government is placing workers at risk by not 
expanding to public and commercial buildings far more stringent 
national regulations affecting asbestos in schools 
those guidelines require inspections abatement plans 
notification of workers who potentially could be exposed to 
asbestos and certification of contractors who perform the 
inspections or remove asbestos 
asbestos used for insulation and fireproofing has been linked 
to lung cancer 
the suit filed in federal district court in washington 
estimated that there are 700000 public and commercial buildings in 
the united states in which asbestos poses potential health problems 
unreasonable risk exists which requires the initiation by epa 
of a rulemaking proceeding the union said in the suit which 
names the agency and its administrator william reilly as 
defendants 
epa is well aware that in many perhaps most of these 
buildings no efforts have been made to identify asbestos or to 
alert building occupants so that minimal precautions may be 
taken seiu president john j sweeney said in announcing the 
filing the agencys refusal to act confirms that it would rather 
study risk than take control of it

japan urged washington thursday to resume talks to 
ease us worries over joint development of japans next fighter 
jet and said the project was important to the security of both 
nations 
foreign ministry spokesman koichi haraguchi said no date had 
been set for a new round of talks on the fsx fighter but that japan 
wanted more meetings as quickly as possible 
japan took an initial step on its part of the project thursday 
when the government signed a contract with mitsubishi heavy 
industries japans main contractor for development of the jet the 
defense agency said 
japan had set aside more than 80 million for the project in its 
fiscal 1988 budget and the agency would have lost the money if it 
had not acted before the fiscal years end on friday 
seiki nishihiro the agencys deputy director general left 
washington wednesday without reaching an accord on 
clarifications sought by the united states on an agreement for 
joint development 
us officials said the talks were continuing at other 
levels 
the countries agreed last november to jointly develop the fsx 
but the white house ordered a review after congressional critics 
charged that the project was an 8 billion giveaway of us 
technology that japan could use to compete in the civilian airplane 
industry 
we think that the effective and smooth implementation of the 
usjapan security treaty is a cornerstone of security for japan 
and its also very important for the united states as well 
haraguchi said before the mitsubishi contract was signed and we 
think this joint development plan of fsx is an important 
contribution for this arrangement 
japan refused to buy usmade f16 jet fighters and initially 
planned to develop its own jet to replace the f1 but it agreed 
under us pressure to share the more than 6 billion project to 
build 100 fsx jets 
president bush has said he backs the project negotiated by the 
reagan administration but wants safeguards for us technology 
the original agreement called for mitsubishi and general 
dynamics to build the fsx using the f16 as a model japan would 
cover all the projects costs and retain control over the fighters 
design and any new technology to emerge 
but us negotiators reportedly want clarification of which side 
would own the new technology and what portion of the fighters would 
be constructed in the united states they also want to know how the 
sophisticated us computer software used to fly the plane would be 
protected 
criticism is mounting in japan over washingtons handling of the 
fsx issue 
naotoshi sakanjo a senior fellow at the research institute of 
peace and security called the us approach unfair 
they want to restrict advanced technology transfer to japan 
but on the other hand want any technology developed by japan 
without any conditions and want a greater share of jobs in 
development and production said sakanjo a retired vice admiral 
of the marine self defense force 
on wednesday 43 legislators from the governing liberal 
democratic party presented a petition urging the government to 
proceed with development of the fighter with or without us help

the supreme court is receiving what appears to 
be a record amount of unsolicited advice as it considers a request 
to overturn or limit its 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
there are moments in history that pass quietly the period we 
are entering will not said kate michelman executive director of 
the national abortion rights action league 
the justices will hear arguments april 26 in a missouri case 
that has become the mostwatched battleground in the continuing 
political fight over abortion 
missouri and the bush administration among others are urging 
the court to use the case to reverse or severely limit roe vs 
wade the 16yearold ruling that said women have a constitutional 
right to seek abortions 
a decision is expected by july 
the court has received 47 friendofthecourt briefs 
including one submitted on behalf of the administration that 
support missouris appeal 
the filing deadline for similar briefs in support of those who 
successfully challenged a missouri abortion law was midnight 
thursday lawyers for prochoice groups said they anticipated 
that 20 or more briefs would be delivered or mailed to the court by 
the deadline 
as far as we are able to determine the largest number has 
been 58 said court spokeswoman kathy arberg 
she said 58 socalled amicus briefs were filed in regents of 
university of california vs bakke the case in which the court in 
1978 first upheld the concept of affirmative action 
before roe vs wade was decided the court received 48 
friendofthecourt briefs 42 in support of the women who 
challenged a texas ban on most abortions and six in support of the 
law 
seven of the anticipated amicus briefs in support of abortion 
rights had been received by the supreme court clerks office by the 
end of the business day thursday they included an unusual one 
submitted in behalf of women who have had abortions and friends 
prochoice group officials personally delivered copies of that 
brief which bears the signatures of more than 3500 women 
its crucial for the court to hear whats in the hearts and 
minds of women said helen neuborne of the now legal defense and 
education fund 
michelman noting that three supreme court justices were 
appointed by former president reagan an ardent opponent of 
legalized abortion said we have serious reason to be 
concerned about the missouri case 
also making the trip to the supreme court thursday were three of 
the women and one man who signed the friendofthecourt brief 
gerry robb of gaithersburg md said she had an illegal 
abortion in 1959 
she postponed the operation when she suspected the man about to 
perform it was intoxicated she later discovered the man she 
thought was a doctor was an auto mechanic 
i signed this brief so other women dont ever have to go to 
drunk auto mechanics for an abortion ms robb said 
elissa raiten of college park md received a legal abortion 
after being told that her child would be born severely 
braindamaged she said she signed the brief so safe clean 
abortions will remain available 
jennie marsh of great falls va had a legal abortion at age 17 
in 1973 only months after the courts decision in roe vs wade 
it should be a womans decision not anyone elses she said 
charles brack of new york city said he signed the brief because 
his cousin died during an illegal kitchen table abortion in 
chicago 24 years ago 
at issue in the missouri case are key provisions of an abortion 
law that lower courts barred state officials from enforcing 
among the provisions struck down 
a ban on using public hospitals and other facilities for 
abortions not necessary to save a womans life 
a ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or 
assisting an abortion 
a ban on using taxpayer money for encouraging or counseling 
women to have abortions 
a requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus believed 
to be older than 19 weeks is capable of surviving outside the womb 
by testing for weight and lung capacity 
a declaration that the life of each human being begins at 
conception 
it is possible the court will decide the missouri case without 
significantly changing its 1973 decision but at least three other 
cases apparently being held in abeyance by the justices also 
challenge roe vs wade 
those cases are from minnesota ohio and illinois

the nuclear regulatory commission voted 
unanimously thursday to authorize a fullpower license for georgia 
power co to operate the unit 2 reactor at its vogtle nuclear power 
plant 
the vote came after nrc chairman lando w zech jr reminded a 
delegation of company officials that the commission has been less 
than pleased with the operation of the unit 1 reactor at vogtle 
since it was granted a fullpower license in 1987 
according to the nrc staff the unit 1 reactor was forced to 
shut down 27 times in its first year of operation because of 
unexpected events the number of similar incidents dropped to nine 
in 1988 and to one so far this year 
a william dahlberg president and chief executive officer of 
georgia power told the commission the utility has made strong 
commitments to staff training at the twinreactor plant and to 
emergency planning 
george bockhold vogtle manager said lowpower testing on the 
unit 2 reactor should be completed by friday or saturday clearing 
the way for operation above 5 percent power unit 2 is not expected 
to achieve full commercial operation until june 
vogtle has been under construction in burke county ga since 
1978 the twinreactor plant initially was designed in the early 
1970s and estimated to cost 660 million costs eventually 
escalated to nearly 9 billion 
georgia power which has primary responsibility for construction 
and operation of the plant owns 457 percent of the total project 
oglethorpe power corp owns 30 percent the municipal electric 
authority of georgia owns 227 percent and the city of dalton owns 
16 percent

the nations 773 largest school districts use 
computers but have limited access to other technology and are not 
planning adequately for the future according to a survey released 
thursday 
nine of 10 districts reported having at least one vcr per 
building and threequarters said they could generate tests with 
computers according to the survey issued by the national school 
boards association and control data corp 
more than 60 percent of the school districts said they were 
capable of longdistance communication using computers had a cable 
tv channel for their own use and owned a videodisc player 
the study compared school districts unfavorably to business in 
that they do not seem to be anticipating technological development 
some 90 percent of the superintendents surveyed said their 
districts had a written technology plan but only 213 actually 
submitted their plans and most of those did not have a 
comprehensive flavor the report said 
among the technology plan shortcomings uncovered by the survey 
the most common focus was curriculum but onethird of the 
plans cited only computer literacy without mentioning math 
science reading or language arts 
most of the plans referred only to standalone computers a 
minority discussed computer networks only a handful of plans 
addressed other technologies such as satellites vcrs or cable tv 
more than half the plans were for instructional use of 
computing only and a handful addressed administrative use only 
many plans were drawn in 1986 or 1987 and had no evident 
provisions for updating 
the survey of 773 districts with 10000 students or more was 
conducted by the research firm of andersen niebuhr and associates 
inc questionnaires were returned by 5150 superintendents school 
board presidents technology specialists elementary and secondary 
curriculum specialists thirdparty funding administrators and 
administrators in charge of programs for disadvantaged children

the communist party chief defended 
recent trials of dissidents and declared thursday that promoters of 
westernstyle political pluralism are trying to poison social 
consciousness 
milos jakes also made clear the sovietled invasion of of august 
1968 still is officially viewed as just and leaders of the liberal 
prague spring that caused it will not be forgiven 
karoly grosz leader of the hungarian party hinted at a meeting 
of his central committee on wednesday that soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev had disapproved the soviet military interventions in 
hungary in 1956 and czechoslovakia in 1968 
jakes used a speech to the czechoslovak party central committee 
to condemn attempts by opposition forces to influence public 
opinion by casting doubt on the right of the state to intervene 
against unlawful activities disrupting public order and even 
attacking the foundations of the social system 
he accused opposition groups of inciting civil disobedience and 
putting ruthless psychological pressure on those who disagree 
with them 
people he described as enemies of communism at home and abroad 
strive to poison social consciousness through uncertainty to 
provoke illconsidered acts to promote political pluralism in the 
bourgeois western sense jakes said 
members of the opposition demand independent courts but if 
they are justly punished simultaneously they organize petitions 
with which they want to intimidate the courts he asserted 
there is no way to give in to these pressures laws must be valid 
for everyone 
the party rejects a petition signed by about 2000 wellknown 
artists and scientists who criticized police violence against 
dissidents and the subsequent trials the party chief said in the 
speech reported by the official news agency ctk 
he claimed foremost artists and most members of official 
artists unions did not take part 
prague police broke up peaceful demonstrations in january in 
february the government jailed banned playwright vaclav havel and 
other leading dissidents 
jakes also castigated church structures and church 
dignitaries who were abusing the religious feelings of people 
to open up another front of the struggle against socialism 
communism 
of aexander dubcek then party chief and others who led the 
prague spring reforms he said 
some former leading officials who had to leave the communist 
party have become active they are trying to present themselves as 
pioneers of restructuring and from this they deduce the demand for 
the rehabilitation of the policy of 1968 in particular of persons 
who were active then including their comeback into political 
life 
gorbachev calls his reform program perestroika the russian word 
for restructuring 
referring to the peaceful demonstrations of january jakes 
declared diaologue cannot be carried out in the streets where 
people are anonymous it must be carried out in work places 
classrooms in meetings of citizens where people know each 
other

prominent human rights activist samuel 
martinez lara and nine other cubans were arrested hours after an 
underground newsletter came out criticizing government policies 
another activist said thursday 
the 10 were arrested late wednesday afternoon and by thursday 
all but martinez lara and three others were released said elizardo 
sanchez president of the cuban commission on human rights and 
national reconciliation 
martinez lara is secretarygeneral of the prohuman rights party 
of cuba and is a sanchez ally 
sanchez said the four were promised a speedy trial which 
normally means a fine or several months detention 
the arrests followed distribution of a twopage newsletter 
franqueza frankness published by martinez lara 
martinez lara noted the scheduled visit this sunday of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev the first visit here by a soviet 
leader in 16 years and drew a comparison between modernday cuba 
and the era when the soviet people had to wear a stalinist 
muzzle 
sanchez said martinez lara is a psychiatrist who was imprisoned 
twice previously he was convicted in 1982 for trying to leave the 
country illegally and served a threeyear prison term and later 
drew a fourmonth term starting in late 1986 as part of a general 
crackdown on dissidents sanchez said 
he reported that martinez laras organization has hundreds of 
members 
two days ago the groups headed by sanchez and martinez lara 
joined forces with a third organization to coordinate human rights 
activities sanchez said the new group represents more than 90 per 
cent of cuban human rights activists 
the group umbrella 4970 said in a statement tuesday it 
welcomes gorbachevs visit describing him as one of the great 
social reformers of our time 
while stopping short of making an appeal to gorbachev the 
statement said previous soviet governments contributed to the 
establishment in cuba of oversized repressive machinery at 
a high human cost for our people 
the cuban government under president fidel castro has long 
maintained it has an exemplary human rights record it contends 
that few countries can match cubas performance in providing 
eduation health care and employment opportunities for its people 
castro and hundreds of thousands of havana residents are 
expected to greet gorbachev on sunday 
probably never before in the history of humanity have there 
been such fraternal relations between such a powerful country and 
such a small one the cuban communist party newspaper gramma said 
in an editorial thursday 
rolando cairo communist party leader of havana province said 
612000 people promised to turn out sunday to greet the soviet 
leader 
gramma quoted victor volki director of the soviet academy of 
sciences as saying the visit is to demonstrate the determined 
support of the soviet union for cuba against any attempt against 
the right of its people to march down its chosen path 
leonid brezhnev in 1973 was the last soviet leader to visit cuba 
gorbachev and his wife raisa are scheduled to stay three days in 
cuba

president dan quayle and by spokesmen at the white house and state 
department the administration signaled that the upcoming visit to 
cuba by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev would be a good opportunity 
for the soviets to indicate a new direction 
we are looking for signs of new thinking baker said in a 
speech in atlanta the soviet union now has an opportunity to 
demonstrate it in central america 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said gorbachev has 
been made aware in the past and recently of president bushs 
thinking that the soviets should stop shipping arms to the region 
or use their influence to push nicaraguas ruling sandinistas to 
abide by regional peace accords and make democratic reforms 
fitzwater when asked what the united states might be willing to 
do for the soviets in return told reporters the administration 
sees soviet performance in the region as interrelated with 
other aspects of ussoviet relations 
while stating he could not discuss specific diplomatic 
overtures fitzwater said the president has made his views known 
to secretary general gorbachev on this issue we would like to see 
the soviet union use its influence in nicaragua to bring about 
a peaceful settlement of the situation 
we would like to see the soviet union withdraw their resources 
and support in nicaragua he said and we would like to see 
secretary gorbachev take an active role in furthering both of those 
objectives 
baker speaking to a conference in atlanta hosted by former 
presidents jimmy carter and gerald r ford said of central 
america we must send a clear message to others outside this 
hemisphere this is not a dumping ground for their arms or their 
failed ideology 
quayle in an interview with cable news network said central 
and latin america is in our hemisphere it is in our own backyard 
we do not want to have outsiders coming in and subsidizing 
exportation of revolution in our hemisphere 
and at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
the soviet union and cuba through their continued aid and 
support of violence and subversion in the region have been 
undermining the prospects for peaceful resolution of the 
nicaraguan war 
fitzwater said baker had discussed that position recently with 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
bush on different occasions has voiced his feeling that the 
soviet union has less of an interest in the region than does the 
united states 
the central american peace efforts are expected to be central to 
separate meetings bush will hold next week with el salvadors 
incoming president alfredo cristiani and with costa rican 
president oscar arias who has been a leader in pushing regional 
peace solutions in central america bush also is expected to 
discuss the issue on saturday when he sees venezuelas president 
carlos andres perez to talk about the latin debt crisis 
bush began publicly stepping up the pressure on the soviet union 
in remarks march 24 when he announced the administrations plan to 
keep the contra rebels alive with an extension of nonlethal aid he 
blasted the soviet union and cuba for continued aid and support 
of violence and subversion in central america 
he also said that us officials see gorbachevs upcoming trip 
to cuba as an important opportunity for both the soviet union and 
cuba to end all aid that supports subversion and destabilization in 
central america 
gorbachev arrives in havana sunday for a threeday visit to the 
closest soviet ally in the western hemisphere 
us officials estimate the soviet bloc has given at least 50 
billion in aid to cuba and nicaragua combined over the last decade 
they estimate that the soviets provide 1 billion a year to 
nicaragua alone about half in military aid and the other half in 
economic assistance 
the united states for the past eight years has provided about 
300 million in military and humanitarian aid to the contra rebels 
trying to overthrow the sandinista government and has imposed a 
trade embargo on the onceflourishing commerce between the united 
states and the central american nation 
us officials have indicated that positive moves on the part of 
the soviets toward nicaragua would merit consideration in weighing 
improved economic relations between the two superpowers 
it would certainly help in improving ussoviet relations 
eastwest relations in general fitzwater said the 
interrelationship of all these issues is readily apparent he 
added when asked about linkage between the central america 
situation and overall ussoviet economic and trade ties 
baker repeated the bush administrations pledge to seek a 
diplomatic solution to the central american question 
however baker said the united states will never support a 
paper agreement that sells out the nicaraguan peoples right to be 
free nor he said should any other democracy in this 
hemisphere

rockets fired by syrian troops in their 
battle with christian army units hit the citys main fuel depot 
thursday causing fires and explosions that forced 50000 residents 
to flee 
a witness reached by telephone said butane is leaking from 
nearby tanks and exploding in balls of fire over dora where the 
depot is located in christian east beirut 
police said syrian gunners fired at least six katyusha rockets 
into east beirut killing two people and wounding three he said 
shrapnel and glass shards from the gas explosions wounded 14 people 
thursdays casualties brought the toll to 125 killed and 405 
wounded in the artillery duel that began march 8 between the 20000 
christian troopers commanded by gen michel aoun and an alliance of 
syrian forces and walid jumblatts druse militia most of the 
casualties are civilians 
explosions at the fuel depot could be heard all over the 
capital police said the blasts shattered glass within a threemile 
radius and about 50000 people had been evacuated from the densely 
populated residential districts around dora 
more tanks are full of butane and other types of gas a 
police spokesman said if the fire reaches them we will face a 
catastrophe 
butane in small tanks or bottles is used for cooking stoves and 
many heaters power plants have been heavily damaged and nearly all 
facilities from hospital operating rooms to bakeries use generators 
fueled by diesel or gasoline also stored at dora 
a relay station at jamhour in christian territory east of 
beirut was hit by syrian shellfire tuesday and beirut now gets 
electricity less than four hours a day 
aoun who also leads an interim christian government that 
competes with a moslem cabinet urged humanitarian organizations 
to shoulder their responsibilities and prevent the spread of this 
barbaric syrian crime 
his statement said the arab league should send its sixmember 
mediation committee on lebanon to see firsthand the war of 
annihilation carried out by the syrian occupation forces against 
the lebanese people 
in a telephone interview with the associated press later he 
said the syrians were committing a criminal act against the 
population they bomb the gas stations fuel depots of the city and 
the center of electricity production 
jumblatts militia began shooting two days after aouns forces 
blockaded illegal ports run by moslem militias which cost the 
governments five legal ports an estimated 100 million a year in 
revenue 
the conflict stems from a political crisis that began in 
september gave birth to the competing governments and split the 
military on sectarian lines maj gen sami khatib commands the 
22000 moslem soldiers who are poorly equipped and have stayed out 
of the fighting 
nasrallah sfeir the maronite catholic patriarch issued a 
statement thursday pleading for a consolidated ceasefire 
guaranteed by observers to save man in lebanon 
voice of lebanon a christian radio station said damascus 
like any invader wants to reduce lebanon into mere fire and 
ashes and urged the free world not to remain silent regarding 
syrias acts of terrorism 
neighboring syria has about 40000 troops in lebanon under a 
under a peacekeeping mandate from the arab league issued in 1976 a 
year after the civil war began and has become the countrys main 
power broker 
aoun has blames the syrians for the current violence the worst 
in four years and has vowed to drive them out 
more than 250000 of beiruts 12 million people have deserted 
the city for south lebanon or other safer areas since the rain of 
shells and rockets began more than three weeks ago 
christians leave their besieged 310squaremile enclave by ship 
for the security zone israel maintains with the aid of a 
predominantly christian militia just inside south lebanon moslems 
drive south in long convoys 
president amin gemayel chose aoun a fellow maronite to lead an 
interim government in september when his sixyear term ended and 
parliament could not agree on a successor moslems rejected the 
choice and supported salim hoss the sunni moslem who was premier 
under gemayel 
by unwritten agreement dating to independence from france in 
1943 the president is christian the premier sunni and the 
parliament speaker shiite moslem

the disputed investigation into canadas worst 
aviation disaster the 1985 gander crash that killed 256 americans 
will be reviewed by a retired supreme court judge who could 
recommend a new inquiry 
retired judge willard estey named wednesday to review the 
aviation safety boards threeyear investigation will have 90 days 
to deliver his report 
transport minister benoit bouchard made clear the review will 
stop short of the full judicial inquiry demanded by the 
investigations critics but he told a news conference in ottawa 
that estey could approve the boards report or decide further 
investigation or even a full inquiry is merited 
justice estey can recommend whatever he wants transport 
ministry spokesman rene mercier said in a phone interview thursday 
so its from a to z in terms of possibilities 
the arrow air charter dc8 crashed shortly after takeoff from 
gander newfoundland on a refueling stop dec 12 1985 carrying 
248 us troops home to fort campbell ky from middle east 
peacekeeping duties the eight american crew also died 
bouchard asked estey in a letter to review the entire record 
of the investigation and consider whether any other 
explanation as to the causes and contributing factors of the 
accident is consistent with the evidence gathered by the board 
the minister said public confidence in the ninemember board 
has been jeopardized by internal division during the 
investigation which found in december that ice on the wings 
probably caused the crash 
five members approved the final report four said in a minority 
report that an inflight fire or explosion was the most likely 
cause 
demands to reopen the investigation have been heard ever since 
the toronto star said in an editorial this month a total of 
256 people died in the gander crash their families and friends 
not to mention canadians who rely on ottawa for air safety now 
deserve a public inquiry 
bouchard had expressed his confidence in the boards 
investigation and accepted the icing theory the ottawa citizen 
however obtained an internal transportation ministry report that 
said board investigators mismanaged the probe and focused on a 
preconceived icing theory at the expense of other possible 
causes 
bouchard also named a judge to handle an investigation of the 
march 10 crash of an air ontario fokker f28 jet that killed 24 
people at dryden ontario although the safety board already sent 
its own investigators to the scene 
the actions i have taken will assist in restoring the 
credibility of accident investigations he said

the air force has inspected 34 of its b1b 
bombers without finding more problems with a wing mechanism that 
malfunctioned earlier this week but has decided a more extensive 
safety inspection is needed 
we have decided to devise another type of inspection a more 
thorough inspection in the same wing area in the interests of 
safety to ensure were looking at everything we need to look at 
said col larry greer a spokesman for the strategic air command 
the earlier malfunction prompted the air force to ground its 
b1b fleet on tuesday as a precautionary measure 
the standdown grounding is still in effect for the time 
being greer said 
pentagon spokesman dan howard had predicted earlier thursday 
that the grounding order might be lifted shortly 
greer said later however from sac headquarters in omaha neb 
that air force engineers had decided to be extra careful and delay 
the resumption of training flights 
the malfunction occurred monday afternoon at dyess air force 
base texas during a routine preflight check by the pilots 
the crew couldnt get the planes wings to move back and forth 
in tandem and at one point the left wing apparently moved too far 
forward and punctured the seam of a fuel tank inside the fuselage 
howard said thursday the air force had removed the gear box that 
controls the movement or sweep of the left wing on that plane and 
sent it to the sundstrand corp its maker for a detailed analysis 
the specific problem having to do with the wings operating out 
of sync fractured a coupling on a hard shaft that connects the gear 
boxes on the two wings howard said but we dont know yet if 
that was the first cause or a result of a mechanical failure in the 
gear box 
greer said he did not know if the decision to conduct another 
safety check had been prompted by the work at sundstrand 
the b1b is the nations newest longrange bomber to improve 
its performance the plane features wings that can be swept forward 
or backward in flight the wings are normally swept back for 
highspeed attack runs and forward for takeoffs and landings 
the fourengine b1b is the first new addition to the manned 
bomber force in more than 25 years built by the rockwell 
international corp the b1b has a maximum speed of about 1000 
mph and a range of more than 7000 miles 
the air force built 100 of the planes during the reagan 
administration to modernize the old b52 bomber force while it 
developed the new b2 stealth bomber three have been lost in 
accidents 
while the future of the b2 is now unclear because of budget 
cutbacks the b1b continues to have problems of its own besides 
the three crashes the plane still suffers from problems with its 
electronic warfare or radar jamming gear

canada and the palestine liberation 
organization held their first official meeting thursday after the 
canadian government lifted its restrictions on highlevel contacts 
with the plo 
canadian un ambassador l yves fortier met with the plos 
secondranking un diplomat m nassar kidwa for about 20 minutes 
at canadas un mission 
we reviewed the middle east question in a very general way 
and we had a constructive discussion fortier said this is a 
first step 
kidwa said the ambassador informed me about the decision of 
the government of canada to end restrictions on contacts between 
canadian officials and the plo as well as canadas endorsement of 
the principle of selfdetermination for the palestinian people 
canadas foreign minister joe clark said at a news conference 
in ottawa that canada endorses the principle of selfdetermination 
for the palestinian people through peace negotiations but that it 
does not recognize the palestinian state the plo proclaimed in 
november 
in december plo chairman yasser arafat said his group renounced 
terrorism and recognized israels right to exist 
clark said those moves largely address critical canadian 
concerns about the organization 
the united states resumed contacts with the plo in january after 
arafats announcement and since has held two rounds of meetings 
with plo officials the united states however also has refused to 
recognize the palestinian state which the plo has said would 
include the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
there had been speculation about a foreign policy rift between 
clark and prime minister brian mulroney who said on a trip to 
london this month that canada should move cautiously in improving 
relations with the plo 
fortier said canadas friendship with israel has always been 
and remains a cornerstone of our foreign policy 
israel has refused to accept an independent palestinian state 
and rejects negotiations with the plo which it considers a 
terrorist organization 
bnai brith canada a jewish human rights organization said it 
deeply regretted the meeting between fortier and kidwa 
the plo should not be recognized as a representative of 
palestinian interests said bnai brith president brian feldman in 
toronto 
its not a group that can be trusted he said

rebellious inmates 
thursday ended a fiveday uprising that left at least seven people 
dead and subjected hundreds of women and children trapped inside 
the prison to hunger cold and fear 
the government signed an accord with the mutinous inmates that 
calls for replacing pavon prisons authorities and entire guard 
corps and to guarantee the absolute physical integrity of the 
rebels 
there were neither victors or vanquished said prison 
spokesman conrado monroy of the rebellions conclusion the 
object was to avoid more deaths and that was done 
he said a new director and warden had been named and that the 
guards would be replaced within days 
at least four guards and three inmates were killed in the 
uprising at the countrys largest prison 15 miles east of 
guatemala city the rebels had demanded guaranteed pardons for 
crimes committed during the revolt but the government said only 
congress can pardon crimes 
interior minister roberto valle valdizan the governments 
special attorney general for human rights and three 
representatives of an estimated 100 rebel inmates signed the accord 
a day after authorities cut off food water and electricity to the 
crowded prison 
firefighters and red cross workers evacuated friends and 
relatives of inmates caught inside the prison by the revolt which 
authorities said began on easter sunday as a mass escape 
prison authorities began a roll call of the inmates and an 
inventory to account for weapons 
monroy said the rebels handed over 61 carbines they seized 
sunday 
judge daniel marroquin of neighboring san jose pinula said 
several rifles appeared to be missing but that some may have been 
destroyed 
he said the official death toll remained at seven other bodies 
were reportedly on the grounds but he said he had not had the 
opportunity to make a thorough search 
about 600 people mostly women and children were visiting the 
prison when the uprising began and most remained inside with the 
inmates authorities differed on whether they were hostages or 
whether they stayed to protect loved ones from security force 
reprisals 
by midafternoon thursday about a third of the family members 
had been taken from the prison grounds and officials said the rest 
would be removed during the night 
about 110 prisoners who did not participate in the rebellion 
fled the prison wednesday and were taken into custody twenty 
relatives of inmates also made their way out over the past few days 
the rebelling inmates reportedly held key sections of the 
25squaremile institution 
though guatemala is in the tropics its elevation makes for 
bitingly chilly nights with temperatures in the low 50s many 
inside the prison had to shiver through nights huddled in scarce 
blankets or curled up on cold concrete floors 
the rebels have been described as hardened criminals serving 
long sentences for crimes such as murder and kidnapping they 
reportedly include former security force members 
more than 1000 soldiers and police had massed outside the 
prison gates since the uprising began they were under orders from 
president vinicio cerezo not to take action unless the prisoners 
tried to shoot their way out 
pavon model correction facility designed to hold 800 prisoners 
had about 1350 inmates when the uprising began 
in the accord the government also pledged a nationwide prison 
reform but not say precisely what would be done virtually all of 
the nations prisons are badly crowded 
the government also promised to relay to the pertinent 
authorities the rebels request for pardons for crimes committed 
during the uprising guarantee the absolute physical integrity 
of the rebels after surrender promote the strict application 
of a law providing for reduction of prison sentences through work 
and present congress with a proposal for a nationwide reduction of 
all prison sentences by five years 
cerezo said tuesday that international drug traffickers may have 
paid bribes or fees to the uprisings ringleaders to arrange the 
escape of several convicted traffickers incarcerated at pavon 
prison authorities said several colombians serving drugrelated 
sentences were not involved in the uprising authorities said the 
colombians kept out of the takeover drama in a section of the 
prison they have staked out as their private domain

i would get desperate then recover my spirits but you never 
knew what was going to happen 
georgina lopez escorted out of the prison with her two young 
children said we were locked up by the mutineers that was 
hard 
some officials suggest earlier in the week that family members 
might have chosen to remain in the prison to support the rebel 
inmates demands 
thats a lie why on earth would we want to stay in there 
under those conditions ms lopez asked 
the bullets made us scared eva estrada said of the sporadic 
gunfire heard in the prison throughout the week

about the fate of prisoners who did not take part in the uprising

soviet leader mikhail gorbachev cut 
an expensive deal with the kgb to defeat a serious challenge to his 
political reforms a private kremlinologist says in a study being 
released friday 
the september 1988 bargain placed kgb chief viktor chebrikov in 
a position to influence constitutional revisions and possibly 
become a candidate for supreme power himself said researcher 
jeremy azrael a former state department policy planner 
azrael said chebrikov is believed to be uneasy with the pace of 
reform in the country 
gorbachev is in an uphill battle azrael wrote in a summary 
of the study he won a very narrow victory based on cutting a 
deal with the head of the kgb who is on record as being dubious 
about his policies chebrikov is not only the chief contender 
should gorbachev go bellyup but someone who is evidently willing 
to give him a shove in that direction 
azraels analysis comes in a study by the rand corp a 
governmentsupported think tank the 137000 study was done for 
the governmentfunded national council for soviet and east european 
research and the center for the study of soviet international 
behavior a joint operation of rand and the university of 
california at los angeles 
the study doesnt address the implications of the soviet unions 
weekend elections for a new national congress the most competitive 
elections there since 1917 embarrassing defeats for many communist 
party regulars raised the possibility of a backlash against 
gorbachevs reforms 
gorbachev may have headed off a bloodless coup of the kind that 
deposed nikita s khrushchev in 1964 through the intercession of 
the kgb the soviet secret police and intelligence agency at a 
september 1988 plenum of the partys central committee azrael 
writes 
however the researcher suggests that a humiliating defeat of 
his political reforms rather than his ouster was the more likely 
intent of a group of gorbachev adversaries that included his chief 
rival yegor ligachev 
it was only after chebrikov made it clear that the kgb was 
firmly on gorbachevs side and was prepared to play political 
hardball on his behalf that gorbachevs opponents relented the 
study says 
ligachev was demoted from his no 2 position in the party and 
several other gorbachev opponents on the politburo were retired 
after the meeting 
in contrast kgb chief chebrikov was made secretary of the 
partys central committee and his allies were installed to head 
the committee on party control and the kgb itself 
azrael disagreed with those who believe that the political power 
of the kgb has waned in recent years 
before the pivotal september 1988 central committee plenum 
azrael writes chebrikov undermined gorbachevs liberalization 
programs by engineering the ouster of prominent gorbachev ally 
boris yeltsin from party leadership 
there also is evidence the kgb encouraged ethnic violence in the 
soviet republics of armenia and azerbaijan in the spring and summer 
of 1988 to demonstrate the dangers of rapid political 
liberalization azrael wrote

walt disney co filed suit thursday against 
the academy of motion picture arts and sciences alleging 
unauthorized use of its snow white character in what it called an 
unflattering opening number of the nationally televised awards 
ceremony 
the wednesday night show began with an actress dressed as snow 
white being interviewed in the lobby of the shrine auditorium and 
then following a chorus line of dancing stars down an aisle to the 
stage 
in a betty boop voice snow white then sang spoofs of popular 
songs rewritten with oscaroriented lyrics to the embarrassment of 
stars she called attention to in the front rows of the shrine 
many critics panned the production number as arcane glitzy and 
overdone the show was broadcast live on abctv the network was 
not part of the lawsuit 
the suit filed in us district court alleges copyright 
infringement of disneys snow white character unfair competition 
and violation of the california antidilution law the law protects 
the value of a legal trademark 
disney filed suit after the academy refused its request for a 
public apology according to a statement from frank wells disneys 
president and chief operating officer 
no monetary damages were specified although disney is seeking a 
court order prohibiting the academys future use of disney 
characters without authorization said company spokesman erwin okun 
wells said disney officials were greatly surprised and 
dismayed when we viewed last evenings academy awards ceremonies to 
see that our snow white character had been used extensively without 
our permission 
disney which has a fearsome reputation for protecting its 
property and characters added that we have reluctantly taken 
this action against the academy of motion picture arts and sciences 
to make sure that our rights are fully protected under the law 
bruce davis the academys executive administrator declined 
comment on the suit saying not only do not have any comment 
but we havent even seen it 
this is kind of a down day at the academy davis added 
were not very organized the day after the academy awards 
davis added that he was unaware of details about disneys 
request for a public apology 
ill try to be more helpful tomorrow davis said 
in his statement wells said we requested of the academy only 
that it admit to its unauthorized portrayal of snow white and for a 
public apology for having used our copyrighted works without first 
receiving disneys consent if such a statement had been agreed to 
by the academy we would have considered the matter ended 
for its own reasons however the academy unfortunately did 
not accede to our request 
snow white and the seven dwarfs was released by disney in 
1937 and was the studios first featurelength animated cartoon 
critics praised the film calling it a turning point in disneys 
career and a milestone in movie history

the captain of the tanker that caused the 
worst oil spill in the nations history was fired thursday exxon 
shipping co announced earlier federal investigators said tests 
taken after the accident determined he was legally drunk 
exxon valdez skipper joseph hazelwood had a bloodalcohol 
reading of 061 when measured nine hours after the ship rammed 
bligh reef said william woody head of a fourman ntsb team 
investigating the spill 
under a federal law that prohibits operating a commercial vessel 
at sea while intoxicated the limit set by the coast guard is 04 
woody said for automobile drivers in alaska and most other states 
a bloodalcohol reading of 10 is considered legally drunk 
hazelwood was not on the bridge when the tanker ran aground 
march 24 third mate gregory cousins who the coast guard says 
lacked proper certification was giving the orders 
woody said a coast guard officer told investigators he smelled 
alcohol on hazelwoods breath a few hours after the accident but 
the guardsman and a harbor pilot agreed hazelwood appeared 
competent woody said 
woody refused to answer questions concerning whether hazelwood 
might have been drinking between the time of the accident which 
occurred shortly after midnight friday and the time the coast 
guard arrived at the scene at between 2 and 230 am 
shortly after the ntsb announcement exxon shipping co said it 
was firing hazelwood who has been convicted twice of drunken 
driving 
i do have permission to confirm that capt hazelwood has been 
released from the company as of today said brian dunphy an 
exxon spokesman im really not in a position to make any further 
comment he said that to his knowledge no other member of the 
ships crew had been fired 
on the advice of their lawyers hazelwood and cousins have 
refused to talk to investigators woody said 
coast guard spokesman todd nelson said the agency is waiting for 
final findings from the ntsb before proceeding with any criminal 
charges such charges could lead to up to one year in prison and 
not more than 5000 in fines according to the coast guard and 
marine safety office in juneau 
penalties for operating a ship while intoxicated also include 
the loss of a seamans license and up to 1000 in civil fines 
woody said there was no sign of alcohol in cousins blood or 
urine nor was there any indication of alcohol in the tests 
administered to helmsman robert kagan he said 
however woody said a civilian coast guard employee who came on 
duty just before the ship ran aground tested at 20 friday 
afternoon the employee bruce blandford was one of two people on 
duty in the radar room in valdez where tanker traffic is monitored 
as it moves through the valdez narrows 
blandford had begun work at midnight four minutes before the 
tanker accident and stayed several hours after his normal 8 am 
quitting time authorities said 
he had been off duty for several hours when he was recalled for 
the alcohol test woody said he denied drinking thursday night 
and his superiors said his performance appeared normal woody said 
the exxon valdez was beyond the narrows at the time of the 
accident and the coast guard said it routinely does not monitor 
ships in that area especially when there is no other traffic and 
the weather and visibility are good as they were march 24 
hazelwood has been arrested twice for drunken driving and had 
his license suspended three times his mother told the associated 
press that her son had undergone rehabilitation and that exxon was 
aware of his drinking problem

a reporter who is no longer at the atlanta 
journalconstitution won a pulitzer prize for his work there and 
quickly gave thanks to an editor who is no longer there either 
reporter bill dedman who quit his job in february to join the 
washington post hopped a plane to atlanta to join in the 
celebration as soon as he heard the award announced on thursday 
once back in the journalconstitution newsroom dedman thanked a 
long list of editors and assistants he reserved top credit for 
former editor bill kovach who resigned last november in a bitter 
and highly publicized management dispute and to sonny rawls a 
kovach lieutenant who remains at the paper as assistant managing 
editor for news 
dedman then accepted a plastic cup of champagne from managing 
editor glenn mccutchen and referring to staff turmoil and turnover 
prompted by kovachs departure said i think we all had a rough 
year but i think this will probably taste real good 
dedmans stories exposing unequal patterns of home loans to 
blacks and whites in atlanta won the pulitzer prize for 
investigative reporting for the journalconstitution 
we documented a social ill dedman said im excited that 
the pulitzer board would honor stories that tell the white 
community things the black community already knew and things that 
take the editors guts to put in the newspaper 
dedman and a special projects team developed the series of 
stories by analyzing reams of computer printouts obtained under 
the federal home mortgage disclosure act of 1977 of home loans 
made by census tracts 
dedman a 28yearold college dropout who joined the atlanta 
newspapers in april 1987 spent five months developing the story on 
socalled redlining of mortgage loans to blacks who make up 
twothirds of atlantas population 
the newspapers analysis of loans made by every bank savings

home loans as black neighborhoods with the same income level 
while our newspaper and particularly bill dedman were 
honored today atlanta also ought to feel very good because of the 
way it behaved publisher jay smith said a lot of communities 
would have gotten their backs up the political leadership

matter of days or weeks not months 
journalconstitution editor arnold rosenfeld credited his 
predecessor kovach who is now studying as a nieman fellow at

prime minister noboru takeshita expressed deep 
remorse to all koreans on thursday over japans militaristic past 
and said his nation sought to improve relations with communist 
north korea 
japan ruled korea as a colony for 35 years until japans world 
war ii surrender in 1945 
takeshita spoke before a parliamentary committee as a goodwill 
mission from the japan socialist party the largest opposition 
party left for beijing on its way to pyongyang for talks with 
north korean leaders 
the socialists said their mission led by former party 
secretarygeneral makoto tanabe had the governments backing in 
efforts to find a breakthrough in relations with north korea japan 
and north korea have no formal ties 
foreign ministry spokesman koichi haraguchi said that following 
takeshitas statement we hope for some response from the north 
but have no expectations 
asked if the statement was a prelude to full diplomatic 
relations with the north he replied many steps remain before we 
go into that stage we are sending a signal that wed like to 
have meaningful dialogue with north korea 
haraguchi said japan made its position clear to north korea on 
several occasions in messages conveyed through third countries he 
would not elaborate 
takeshita said on this occasion when the situation 
surrounding the korean peninsula is entering upon a new era i 
would like to express toward all the people of the peninsula our 
deep remorse and regret for the unfortunate past 
the government and people of japan are profoundly aware that 
past actions by japan have inflicted great suffering on the peoples 
of nearby lands he said adding that japan was determined that 
it shall never happen again 
he said japan hopes to improve relations with the democratic 
peoples republic of korea on the basis of the abovementioned 
reflection giving due consideration to the new situation on the 
peninsula 
kyodo news service said it was the first time a japanese prime 
minister had used north koreas official name 
the government has made public since last year its hope to 
enter into discussions without any preconditions with the 
north on any aspect of pending issues takeshita said 
japan offered a similar apology when it normalized relations 
with south korea in 1965 after japans defeat korea was split 
into capitalist prowestern south and communist north 
the 195053 korean war deepened enmity between the two koreas 
but in recent months they have held contacts aimed at easing 
tensions 
japans efforts to improve relations with north korea coincided 
with south koreas call for its allies and noncommunist friends to 
help create a climate favorable for efforts toward korean 
reunification 
seoul has adopted a new northern policy seeking trade and 
diplomatic ties with communist countries 
so far the japannorth korea parliamentarians friendship league 
and the socialist party have been japans main bridges to north 
korea 
north koreas foreign ministry issued a statement on jan 20 
accusing japan of a hostile attitude toward pyongyang and demanding 
an apology for past crimes it said japan supported 
perpetuation of koreas division in a twokorea policy 
japans foreign ministry said in a policy statement japan has 
no intention of supporting the perpetuation of division desired by 
neither north nor south 
ministry officials have said that in moving toward improved 
ties the government also hoped for the speedy release of two 
japanese seamen sentenced in december 1987 to 15 years in prison 
for alleged spying against north korea

a frenchmans exhausting effort to beat a 
monthold new yorktosan francisco sailing speed record fell just 
a few agonizing hours short on thursday after an 81day 
14500mile journey 
a tired and bloody philippe monnet steered his battered trimaran 
under the golden gate three days after he threw his food overboard 
to lighten his boats load and squeeze out another knot or two he 
had gone four days without sleep 
monnet 29 lost his bid for the record after a series of 
heartbreaking setbacks including a brush with a submerged iceberg 
off cape horn that cost him a week for repairs and a tussle with 
18foot seas and capricious winds off the california coast 
but monnet became the first sailor to make the voyage alone and 
appeared jubilant as he bounded out of the cabin of the 60foot 
elle et vire arms raised to greet a crowd of wellwishers at pier 
39 
leaping onto the deck as the boat was tied up he received a 
kiss from his girlfriend and popped the cork of a bottle of french 
champagne 
later on the dock he said simply i am very tired but i am 
here in san francisco my boat is here and it is good no 
asked if he would like to get away from his boat the 
indefatigable sailor looked puzzled shrugged and said i like 
sailing 
monnet needed to arrive at the golden gate by 734 am to snap 
the mark set feb 12 by the american sloop thursdays child which 
took 80 days and 20 hours port to port to break a 135yearold 
record 
in addition to his collision with an iceberg monnet slashed his 
hands and arms on monday after the main wire supporting his mast 
snapped off the coast of southern california monnet had to climb 
the mast and spent hours cutting the tangled sail away and 
repairing the vital cable 
michael fortenbaugh representing the manhatten yacht club 
which put up the clipper challenge cup trophy for the record 
attempt said that missing the record doesnt diminish monnets 
acheivement 
its sad and all that he missed the record but he is the 
first person to do it singlehanded fortenbaugh said his 
acheivement is not dimmed one bit 
plans call for monnet to catch the first available plane to new 
york and then to paris fortenbaugh said the ship will remain 
behind on view at touristy pier 39 
i dont know what the french will do with it after that he 
said 
somewhere to the south is another trimaran that had been trying 
for the record the 50foot finistere bretagne skippered by anne 
liardet 
with fiance joseph le guen as crew she started jan 1 from new 
york but was overtaken by monnet liardet was the first woman to

carl reiners long career in show business has 
been a succession of possible dreams from your show of shows 
to the dick van dyke show and the 2000yearold man 
the dream began in the mid1940s when he saw sid caesar in the 
musical tars and spars and reiner vowed to work with him some 
day he would eventually become a key writer and performer on 
caesars your show of shows the classic 50s tv comedyvariety 
program with imogene coca and went on to create the dick van 
dyke show in the 60s 
he also starred in the hit film the russians are coming the 
russians are coming and directed wheres poppa and all of 
me among other movies his son rob starred in the landmark 
television sitcom all in the family and is now a director in 
his own right 
but the 67yearold reiner hasnt lost his touch two years ago 
he went to see me and my girl and was overwhelmed by the shows 
star robert lindsay 
i said to my wife afterwards not since dick van dyke have i 
seen a guy that intriguing he combined everything hes a great 
actor he learned to dance for me and my girl he had never 
danced professionaly 
to reiners delight lindsay was open to working with him and 
stars in bert rigby youre a fool a musicalcomedy that 
features the tony award winners acting and dancing talents 
when you see talent like lindsays you have to get him in 
front of the public said reiner who wrote and directed the 
film hes well known only in the theatrical circles so we have 
to tell the world theres a new star on the horizon 
helping others has been a trademark of reiner since joining 
your show of shows in 1950 and working with a highpowered 
writing team that included mel brooks and neil simon 
we were all screaming towards the center trying to get our 
jokes heard reiner recalled neil simon had a soft voice so i 
always spoke up for neil 
he also played straight man to brooks in the comedy sketch 
the 2000 yearold man helping to launch the career of the 
director of such outrageous hits as the producers and young 
frankenstein 
its totally adlibbed i came into the office one day and 
heard something that bothered me on television somebody who 
actually said they saw something that they couldnt have seen 
i turned and said to mel so you were actually at the scene 
of the crucifixion and mel said with a heavy accent oh boy 
vat a day and for the rest of the day i interviewed him 
reiner and brooks performed the routine at private parties for 
several years until steve allen suggested they make a recording 
2000 years with carl reiner and mel brooks was released in 
1960 and was so popular that the pair recorded a number of sequels 
by 1965 reiner and brooks had sold over 2 million records 
steve allen said why dont you put on tape reiner 
recalled i said this is nothing this is for friends but we 
went ahead and did a twohour tape which was cut down to 47 
minutes the rest is history 
reiner stuck with caesar through various incarnations of your 
show of shows before taking a shot at a solo career in the late 
50s he had an idea about starring himself in a situation comedy 
about a television writer for the alan brady show a variety 
program starring a talented but volatile man a benevolent 
dictator 
but reiner realized he wasnt good enough to do it himself so 
he turned to a unknown actor called dick van dyke 
dick van dyke is one of the rare talents said reiner who 
wrote 40 of the first 60 episodes himself he was what i call 
leftright coordinated he can do anything anything hes asked to 
do and he can do it very easily 
rob reiner then a teenager and his friend albert brooks who 
became an actor and director as well were frequent visitors on the 
dick van dyke set 
rob is one of the spongelike people his father noted he 
absorbs everything he learns by being around i never gave him 
instruction 
and reiner had no objections to his child entering show business 
why would you warn somebody against the best job in the world

the ski cap from his days in the monkees is 
gone the hair is tinged with gray and when michael nesmith 
speaks a soft southern accent can be detected 
but in his own quiet way nesmith remains a force in the 
entertainment industry since leaving the monkees he has released 
a series of critically acclaimed countryrock albums developed the 
idea for a music video television station that would lead to the 
creation of mtv and served as producer of the cult movies repo 
man square dance and the recently released tapeheads 
you can bounce around my career ill tell you nesmith said 
in a recent interview 
tapeheads stars john cusack and tim robbins as a pair of 
ambitious video producers called the video aces who eventually 
strike it rich through a series of bizarre incidents including the 
death by explosion of a heavy metal singer 
singers sam moore of the 1960s soul group sam and dave and 
junior walker a star for motown around the same time play a 
rhythm n blues duo called the swanky modes whom cusack and 
robbins are anxious to promote 
i thought boy if we could get a really good rampb duo to play 
the swanky modes and a really good group to play the video aces 
this could be a movie id want to see nesmith said it was 
really the music that was most attractive to me 
the film pokes fun at the music video industry with its 
everchanging fashions and glitzy imagery and even features a 
cameo by exmtv veejay martha quinn nesmith had hoped that mtv 
would participate in making the film but the music channel was not 
amused 
we thought wed tie in with them but mtv didnt want to have 
anything to do with it nesmith said we thought theyd enjoy 
being part of it it made fun of them so they said no i dont 
think we did anything disrespectful to mtv it was just a funny 
little poke a way of saying come on dont take yourself so 
seriously 
nesmith a native of san antonio texas first became famous in 
the 60s as the serious member of the monkees the madefor 
television softrock group that had a string of hit records 
including daydream believer and last train to clarksville 
the monkees whose funloving image was closely modeled after the 
beatles did not play on their early records or write their own 
material 
but nesmith considered himself a musician rather than a pop 
star before joining the monkees he had played at the troubador 
club in los angeles an early venue for such stars as neil young 
stephen stills and linda ronstadt who had a hit with the nesmith 
composition different drum 
i was the master of ceremonies and every monday night was sort 
of talent night he said because it was a folky kind of club 
there were acoustic instruments and everybody sang it consisted of 
pretty much the locals and outofwork musicians and people who 
didnt have a chance to play anyplace else 
nesmith would eventually take advantage of the monkees 
popularity to get wider exposure for his own writing 
it took me a long time to think of the monkees as a way of 
expressing myself musically nesmith said 
by 1970 the monkees had broken up and nesmith was surprising 
critics with his own imaginative blend of country and rock in 
1976 island records asked him for a video to go along with one of 
his songs rio telling nesmith that the clip would help sales 
in europe island expected nesmith to simply record himself singing 
the song but the artist decided to try something different 
producing a concept video instead 
they had 30odd promotional people around the country and when 
the other clips started playing through i became nervous because 
they were all just performance clips nesmith recalled but 
when it was over they all stood up and cheered my video from 
there the idea kind of emerged that this is an art form 
he quickly built on the concept of a music video channel 
putting together a halfhour program called popclips nesmith 
eventually sold the idea to warner amex and in the early 1980s 
music television was conceived 
the needle just went off the meter for popclips nesmith 
said mtv wanted me to program the station but at that point i 
made the decision to just stay involved on the creative end 
he is now concentrating more on film production operating his 
own pacific arts video company which encompasses home video 
distribution film production and the creation of future home video 
programming formats nesmith also is a major supporter of the 
american film institute 
i still dont have much of an idea of what video means 
socially i come to it as an artist i dont think video i sort of 
think about video

nbc may have developed a reputation for 
sensationalism thanks to the geraldo rivera special and some racy 
madefortv movies but the case of the hillside stranglers 
about the reallife murders of 10 young women avoids exploitation 
in favor of crack storytelling 
the movie airing sunday benefits from superb performances all 
around especially richard crenna as reallife homicide detective 
bob grogan 
steven gethers who directed the movie and wrote the script 
based on the darcy obrien book two of a kind the hillside 
strangers gives his actors gritty dialogue and realistic scenes 
what more do we need to know about grogan when he gets out of bed 
and goes to the refrigerator to find nothing but a solitary pickle 
floating in a jar 
dennis farina a former reallife cop and goodguy star of 
crime story is evil incarnate as angelo buono the upholsterer 
who with his cousin kenneth bianchi was eventually convicted of 
murder billy zane as bianchi seems at the beginning of the movie 
almost too much the charming pretty boy but by the end of it his 
character has become a malevolent manipulator 
gethers effectively follows both the cops and the killers 
through the events of 197779 the heart of the story belongs to 
grogan a toughtalking cop obsessed with his job to the detriment 
of his marriage when he comes in to the office before dawn the 
first thing he does is pour himself a stiff drink and complain to a 
colleague james tolkan that his estranged wife is demanding he 
lead a normal life and wear pajamas karen austin plays jd 
jackson the wouldbe witness who becomes grogans understanding 
girlfriend and so caught up in the case she even poses as a 
customer to get a load of buono 
the movie opens with the handsome bianchi gaining entrance to a 
womans apartment by flashing a police reserve badge and 
telling her that her car has been damaged in the parking lot her 
body is found dumped on a hillside hence the name of the crime 
wave that shocked and fascinated los angeles as well as rest of 
the country in late 1977 and early 1978 
grogan immediately makes two accurate assumptions that there 
are two men involved and that they are raping torturing and 
murdering women for fun 
the psychopaths bianchi and buono are outwardly normal guys at 
one point buono shows his cousin his collection of rare fish and 
recalls how he and his third wife awakened their 6yearold 
daughter to watch one of the fish give birth to live offspring 
they shoot em out like a rocket he says admiringly adding 
it was great sex education for the kid bianchi tells him hes 
a great father 
for buono there was a psychological reward in not getting 
caught but buonos downfall eventually was his cousins need for 
celebrity 
buono and bianchi would pose as police officers while driving in 
their car at night pull over an unsuspecting woman driver then 
abduct her and take her back to buonos suburban home the bodies 
were disposed of on the wooded hillside not far away 
the movie portrays abduction scenes but only conveys the 
horrific nature of the crimes through brief scenes showing marks of 
torture on the bodies there is one scene though when buono with 
a bound and struggling young woman in his arms turns to bianchi 
before slamming the door and says in a monotone me first 
it appears that the stranglers might have gotten away with the 
crimes except that bianchi exiled to bellingham wash by his 
cousin for being too careless messily murdered two young women 
there after his arrest bianchi tries to fake insanity but the 
la cops get a psychiatrist to declare him a fake 
theres a somewhat abrupt transition to the middle of the trial 
but a nicely played scene has grogan showing the jury in the dark 
of night the hillside locations where the bodies were found

when jennifer fleming died after a car 
crash early on new years day 1988 it changed the way los alamos 
looked at alcohol 
its totally just not cool to drink and drive anymore said 
los alamos county youth coordinator peggy vigil students see 
those who drink and drive as the enemy they saw public outrage 
perhaps you could say community anger 
jennifer 16 a los alamos high school junior was fatally 
injured while driving around to help sober up a friend whod been 
drinking jennifer had spent the evening at an alcoholfree dance 
shed helped organize 
i didnt want to go home at the time because i was afraid my 
parents would find out said laura root who was with jennifers 
and two friends when a pickup swerved to avoid a stopped car and 
crushed jennifers car 
before the accident i was on a crash course laura said 
i was doing things i was lying to my parents i was totally out 
of control i guess for me it took one of my best friends dying to 
realize i couldnt live that way any more it wasnt worth it it 
just wasnt worth it 
she lost 12 teeth suffered a bruised spinal cord and a crushed 
knee that had metal from the wreckage embedded in it theyre 
still reconstructing my mouth sometime this summer they should be 
done 
jeff bussolini permanently lost all but peripheral vision in his 
left eye and suffered a fractured hip arm and 20 to 30 fractures 
in his face 
stephanie van dyck had fractures of the foot arm ribs hand 
and face and a punctured lung she still feels pain more than a 
year later 
after they got out of the hospital jeff stephanie and laura 
helped found a chapter of students against driving drunk the 
20member chapter held an alcoholfree st patricks day dance this 
year 
ms vigil said she has seen a change in how the kids perceive 
and treat their peers who drink and drive there has been a 42 
percent decrease in arrests for driving while intoxicated since 
1986 she said 
the biggest decline came after the crash said police chief alan 
kirk the last year in los alamos theres been a tremendous 
publicity campaign by various organizations in the community to 
bring attention to the drunk driving problem the county council 
passed several laws the past year which also deal with drunk 
driving violations 
these include extending a ban on open beverage containers to the 
passenger not just the driver a mandatory 30 days in jail for 
thirdtime offenders 15 days for driving on a dwirevoked license 
and two days if breath alcohol is 015 percent or higher the legal 
limit for dwi remains 010 
police also have intensified roadblocks and have been speaking 
at schools and civic organizations kirk said jennifers death 
definitely impacted the community it was tremendous just as far 
as the publicity aspect 
when you go to parties anymore the discussion is we need to 
be careful and not become intoxicated to drive home or there may be 
a roadblock and i think that has caused people to drink less 
certainly pickup driver jack kerns views have changed kerns 
31 who admits he was drinking but denies he was drunk was accused 
of driving while intoxicated and without a license it had been 
revoked for dwi he is serving 7 years in los lunas correctional 
facility for vehicular manslaughter 
nobody regrets what happened more than i do kerns said 
adding that when he gets out of prison he hopes to work in alcohol 
counseling 
from that night on i have not had one thing to drink one 
alcoholic beverage of any kind he said i am totally against 
alcohol and i am angry that people treat it as a socially 
acceptable beverage 
jennifers mother marion fleming who is in the process of 
founding a chapter of mothers against drunk drivers in los alamos 
issued a plea to people who think they are sufficiently in control 
to drink and drive 
if they had any idea what its like to go through something 
like this they would never take the risk she said what 
little enjoyment there can be cant possibly be worth the risk 
what jack kerns did to us was bad but what he did to himself was 
in many ways just as bad

people knew paulino fernandez as a 
reserved distant man obsessed with his plots of land in this 
isolated mountain hamlet but one day the 64yearold farmer 
unsheathed the knife he used to slaughter pigs and stabbed six 
neighbors to death 
then he burned himself to death in his farmhouse 
news of the killings march 7 caught the attention of all spain 
it had happened in galicia a longignored underdeveloped 
northwestern region where only 27 percent of the population lives 
in cities 
it appears clearly to have been an attack of madness said 
historian ramon villares paz yet its a paradigmatic incident a 
sort of death cry of a rural society of elderly people with a 
tightly held conviction that their culture has no future 
surribas is isolated like a majority of villages in galicia 
populated mainly by old people with problems of communication 
between them without any future without horizons 
galicia is sometimes called spains ireland because of its 
celtic origins the playing of bagpipes is common and every summer 
an international celtic music festival is held in ortigueira 
attracting musicians from all the celtic regions of europe the 
celtic cross is a familiar sight throughout galicia and a dance 
called the muneira is similar to the irish jig 
galicia is a fourprovince region of verdant hilly land 
geographically cut off from the rest of the country by poor 
communications and a rugged mountain range ringing its eastern 
flank and its southern border with portugal 
since prehistoric times it has been characterized by a social 
and economic structure not usual in the rest of spain 
subsistence farming remains the norm in much of the interior of 
galicia today 
and there lived paulino fernandez in his farmhouse with his 
fears 
paulino had been extremely worried about someone taking his 
land but he faced no threat of any kind and had normal relations 
with neighbors said sergio vazquez yebra fernandezs lawyer and 
mayor of the nearby town of chantada 
the galician village is a world subject to drastic 
transformations wrote columnist carlos luis rodriguez in la voz 
de galicia the regions leading newspaper 
the crime is in part an expression of the daily dramas of 
rural galicia that stun us because they shatter our ideal of the 
bucolic village 
the galician village is a genuine pressure cooker where all 
kinds of conflicts simmer over a low fire and where the modern and 
the ancestral crash into each other as if upon a breakwater 
the peasant who listens to the sermon of the parish priest in 
the morning and watches dallas on television by the light of the 
hearth must necessarily suffer a shock due to the sudden clash 
between a world view proper of the last century with another that 
is an advance of that to come in the next century between 1950 
and 1970 the region of 3 million people underwent a rapid but 
incomplete industrialization mainly involving shipbuilding and 
steel plants on the atlantic coast 
but more than 20000 relatively recent highpaying jobs were 
lost in these smokestack industries through drastic restructuring 
forced by spains decadelong economic recession that ended in 1984 
galicia contributes less than 6 percent to spains gross 
national product and agriculture still dominates the economy 
potatoes corn grapes and cabbage are the principal crops and 
the dairy industry provides 25 percent of the milk for spains 39 
million people 
paulino fernandezs obsession with his land rang true to the 
galicians fabled ties to the earth and their legendary longing for 
it after they had emigrated to latin america or more recently to 
west germany or france 
an estimated 1 million galicians haunted by the specter of a 
dark future left in this century 
among the bestknown products of galicia are cubas fidel castro 
and raul alfonsin the president of argentina 
other spaniards see galicians or gallegos as melancholy 
broodingly pessimistic people obsessed with death and witchcraft 
they are also known for their cunning and their contradictory 
nature 
if you see a gallego on a staircase a popular saying goes 
you can never tell if hes going up or coming down 
while galicians sometimes exaggerate their love for their 
homeland in many cases when they move to other parts of the 
country they identify themselves more with spain than with galicia 
and have a lovehate relationship with their birthplace said 
mayuor vazquez yebra 
the historian villares paz said paulino fernandezs violent 
attack on his unsuspecting neighbors was more than homicide an 
incident that suggests a kind of attempt at collective 
selfpunishment we have no exit where can we go we have no 
future

if not for the efforts 50 years ago of 
frank w cyr the ubiquitious yellow school bus might be a bus of a 
different color 
green white bright red just about every color showed up on 
the vehicles that carried kids to class back in 1939 some 
districts painted theirs yellow as safety experts had begun to 
urge but others had the idea that redwhiteandblue buses would 
make children more patriotic 
chaos reigned and it didnt end with color 
in kansas children traveled to school in wooden wheat wagons 
in many rural states it wasnt unusual for youngsters to ride in 
trucks with floorboards covered with cow flop 
to survey this school transportation mess cyr then a rural 
education expert at columbia teachers college in new york toured 
10 states with the help of a rockefeller foundation grant 
returning he gathered educators school bus manufacturers and 
paint experts for a landmark meeting that produced a 42page 
pamphlet containing the nations first school bus safety standards 
from axles to brakes to color 
on april 26 half a century after the gathering teachers 
college plans a luncheon in honor of cyr now 88 and the 
acknowledged father of the yellow school bus 
school bus yellow is now as natural to americas morning 
landscape as the sunrise more than 22 million public 
schoolchildren ride in 361998 buses each day says larry mcentire 
president of the national association of state directors for pupil 
transportation services 
the formula for the orangeyellow paint used on virtually all of 
them is on file at the national bureau of standards 
it is hard to imagine today any area of education policy where 
you could gather people in one room and cause such a national 
change to occur said p michael timpane president of teachers 
college 
the standards agreed upon at that meeting had impact far beyond 
color 
what the next 50 years revealed is that this simple 
instrument the school bus can be a powerful instrument in 
education policy said timpane 
if not for national standards that put safe buses in each 
district the school consolidation movement would have stalled 
there were 80000 school districts in the 1930s today there are 
just 16000 
later buses became both the symbol and engine of racial 
integration 
within a few years of the conference about 35 states adopted 
bus standards the last state minnesota switched from minnesota 
golden orange to yellow in 1974 
but safety was by no means the sole reason for standardizing 
school bus color cyr told a visitor to his white clapboard 
victorian home in the tranquility of this northern catskills hamlet 
economics and bureaucratic chaos were at least as important in 
causing the clamor for standards during the 1930s he said 
terrible is how he described the student transportation 
situation 
cyr who had grown up in a sod house in the republican river 
valley of nebraska and had taught in country schools was by then a 
noted authority on rural education it was his idea in the 1930s to 
form school cooperatives to help rural districts provide student 
services they couldnt afford on their own 
the rockefeller foundation invited him to study the shortcomings 
of rural school transportation 
he drove through 10 states 
the local districts all told me they were in trouble they all 
said state officials had standards for manufacturing vehicles and 
kept changing them 
the state departments were even more unhappy they lacked 
expertise they didnt know how to establish standards 
i visited bus companies and they were having more trouble than 
anyone cyr continued they had to cope with the differing rules 
requirements and tastes from 48 states 
for every different color the bus companies had to have 
different booths to spray paint them 
even before the conference some school districts were using 
yellow buses because the color was known to be highly visible in 
rain and fog cyr said 
but a number of states wired us to ask if they should go 
redwhiteandblue i said please dont do anything until weve 
had our meeting 
cyr chuckled as he thought back redwhiteandblue was 
camouflage if you think about it it was to make kids patriotic 
it was wellmeaning but they made the buses less visible and i 
dont think it really had much affect on patriotism 
armed with 5000 in rockefeller foundation money a small 
fortune at the time cyr invited state education officials from 
across the country engineers from chevrolet international 
harvester dodge and ford and paint experts from dupont and 
pittsburgh paint to teachers college to set bus safety standards 
when talk turned to color cyr displayed 50 shades ranging from 
lemon yellow to deep orangered 
there was no bitter debate cyr said the group appointed a 
committee of education officials and they settled on the color 
seen on buses ever since 
fifty years later cyr likes to tell the story of how his son 
bill once asked if youre the father of the yellow school 
bus what does that make me 
i told him that anytime a school bus goes by he can say 
there goes one of my brothers

theres crime in the streets rivers are polluted 
and children are dropping out of school the china daily informs 
its readers 
scholars foresee a national crisis it headlines price 
rises start panic buying it warns officials power abuse is 
major concern it says 
for the foreign visitor expecting a tightly controlled goodnews 
press chinas only englishlanguage daily is full of the 
unexpected 
but a crusading communist daily hardly 
like the increasingly lively chinese vernacular press from which 
it takes most of its more eyeopening material the china daily 
sticks to those social ills the government wants exposed 
criticism of senior leaders questioning oneparty rule or 
delving into sensitive subjects such as unrest in tibet are 
strictly off limits 
what the eightpage paper does offer particularly for a 
foreigner far from home is uptodate figures from world stock 
markets international news from the western news agencies and a 
wideranging sports page carrying the latest in american 
basketball european soccer or asian table tennis 
our philosophy is to provide our readers with what is 
happening in china and what is happening in the world said 
deputy chief editor chen hui 
chinese press authorities began mulling the idea of an 
englishlanguage daily in 1979 the year china embarked on its 
economic reforms and opendoor policy before that nonchinese 
speakers or readers lived in a news vacuum except for several dull 
propagandafilled englishlanguage periodicals 
the china daily with technical assistance from the australian 
thomson foundation and the melbourne age began publishing june 1 
1981 with a first edition of 10000 copies 
within two years it had an airmailed north american edition and 
in 1987 began satellite transmissions to london for distribution in 
western europe besides london it now publishes in new york san 
francisco hong kong canton and shanghai 
originally printed five days a week the paper now comes out six 
days and has a fourpage business paper on sunday chen said 
domestic circulation has risen to about 130000 with twothirds of 
the readership being chinese 
chen said the daily which delivers to major hotels for 
foreigners is chinas first not to depend entirely on the plodding 
post office for distribution it is also the first with about 25 
percent of space devoted to ads to obtain a large percent of its 
revenues from advertisements 
the paper also is financed by sales it costs only 30 fen 8 
cents a copy and like all chinese papers government subsidies 
chen insists though that government backing does not make the 
china daily official papers like the communist partys 
peoples daily renmin ribao have the role of explaining 
government and party policies to the people thats not our 
purpose we cant get the foreigner to do anything 
the editorial board which puts together a weekly commentary and 
oversees daily articles is not subject to outside influence chen 
said 
but like all chinese media the china daily exercises 
selfcensorship and doesnt report for the sensationalism 
involved to widen readership chen said 
asked why the paper carries reports of strikes in poland but 
little about strikes in china he said we must exercise a little 
more care in considering the social consequences of events closer 
to home 
charles frankel one of about 10 foreigners on oneyear 
contracts at the paper said that on sensitive issues such as 
antichinese riots in tibet or recent confrontations between 
chinese and african students who say they are victims of racial 
prejudice the papers reporters make no effort to get the 
other side of the story 
if they did they didnt report it said frankel who worked 
28 years for the honolulu starbulletin and taught journalism at 
hawaii university before coming to china 
frankel noted that although china was one of the biggest victims 
of japanese aggression in world war ii the china daily again 
following the government lead has made no appraisals of the role 
of the late emperor hirohito of japan in the war 
chen acknowledged that statements by the dalai lama the exiled 
tibetan religious leader appear only as background in articles 
where the chinese side condemns his calls for tibetan autonomy 
it would be better to report the straight news first he 
said 
frankels wife helga who also works at the paper said 
reporters are shocked at the way westerners find fault with their 
governments 
theres no bridging the gap that you reporters criticize 
your leaders 
but charles frankel said the paper shouldnt merely be judged by 
american standards 
it serves its purpose im glad this paper exists because it 
does present a window on the world

when workers at the savannah river plant 
report for duty monday theyll find a new name on the entrance sign 
and a new logo on their coffee cups small symbols of broad change 
at the nations largest nuclear weapons plant 
after 38 years of operating the sprawling weapons plant for the 
energy department chemical giant ei du pont de nemours amp co is 
giving way to westinghouse electric co leaving behind a backlog 
of problems that some say jeopardize national security 
the three active nuclear reactors at savannah river plant have 
been shut down for nearly a year because of safety and structural 
problems and a series of mishaps in recent months has raised 
doubts about whether improvements are likely anytime soon the 
reactors are the nations only source of tritium a highly 
radioactive gas used at other government defense plants to make 
nuclear warheads 
the pentagon has said that unless at least one of the reactors 
is restarted by the end of this year it might have to deactivate 
some warheads to preserve supplies 
the energy department is beleaguered by safety and operational 
problems throughout its nuclear weapons complex which includes 16 
major plants in 12 states savannah river has been the focus of 
criticism because it forms the most vital link in the chain of 
nuclear weapons development production and testing 
as a result the departments massive effort to rejuvenate 
savannah river has become a testing ground for its controversial 
plan to spend at least 81 billion over the next two decades to 
modernize and clean up the weapons complex 
westinghouse has vowed to impose a stricter more streamlined 
brand of management and a new approach to ensuring reactor safety 
westinghouse officially took over as the energy departments 
contractor on saturday although for most of the roughly 20000 
people who work at the site in western south carolina monday will 
provide the first taste of life with a new boss 
some of the immediate changes are symbolic such as changing the 
name to savannah river site to reflect the idea that its 
laboratories and other support facilties are crucial to the safe 
operation of its beleaguered nuclear reactors 
some outside experts question how effective westinghouses 
changes will be and even the companys top managers concede some 
improvements may be slow in coming 
were going to have problems believe me said james moore 
president of westinghouse savannah river co a unit of the 
pittsburghbased parent company i hope what people will find is 
different is that when we have those problems therell be a 
different way of solving them 
john ahearne chairman of an energy department advisory group 
said in a recent interview that westinghouse may find it difficult 
to impose change throughout the huge workforce since it has 
brought in only a small number of its own managers westinghouse 
has kept on more than 97 percent of the du pont staff 
moore said he wanted a large share of the du pont people to stay 
to provide continuity 
du pont has defended its record at savannah river saying it 
fulfilled its mission of helping build and maintain the nations 
nuclear arsenal it has stressed that no one ever was injured as a 
result of any accidents at the plant 
moore is reluctant to criticize du ponts performance although 
he suggested in an interview with the associated press that du pont 
was out of its depth 
du ponts a good company but theyre a chemical company 
moore said in his transition office a few miles from the plant 
theyre not a nuclear company and they really dont have any way 
of getting any specific interaction with the commercial side of 
the business weve been steeped in it from day one 
westinghouse is the worlds largest builder of commercial 
nuclear power plants it also is the energy departments contractor 
at nuclear weapons plants in washington state and ohio 
taking over operation of the savannah river plant is a massive 
undertaking for westinghouse 
besides the plants three active nuclear reactors code named 
k l and p reactors two others are permanently shut down the 
site also includes a research laboratory a chemical separations 
plant that makes weapongrade plutonium a facility that fabricates 
fuel for the navys nuclear fleet and a plant that makes fuel to 
run the onsite nuclear reactors a building that prepares 
highlevel nuclear waste for permanent disposal is due to open 
later this year 
the emphasis on safety and secrecy at savannah river is obvious 
from a tour of the 300squaremile site 
armed guards in combat fatigues patrol the area which is closed 
to the public slogans are posted on large signposts near buildings 
and among the ramrodstraight loblolly pines that cover much of the 
site mums the word says one others say security protects 
your jobs and take safety home 
moore and other officials interviewed at savannah river said 
recent national publicity about the reactor problems has unfairly 
cast the plants workers in a bad light 
theyve really been dumped on said moore he praised the 
workers dedication and said the main problem has been inadequate 
training for reactor operators whose decisions in the event of a 
reactor mishap are critical to avoiding a catastrophy 
were not going to make nuclear physicists out of all the 
operators but were going to give them a better understanding of 
whats behind some of the procedures moore said 
andrew cwalina a member of the management team preparing for 
restart of the k reactor and a 15year savannah river plant 
veteran said most workers are receptive to westinghouses ideas 
for change 
some view it as a matter of survival he said 
the energy department too is changing its ways it has decided 
that the amount of money to be paid to westinghouse under its 
fiveyear contract will depend on how well it performs in the 
first six months of the contract westinghouse could earn a maximum 
of 75 million or it could get nothing said mark silverman a 
department official at savannah river who helped write the award 
fee plan 
du pont at its own insistence received no fees for operating 
the plant although all its expenses were covered by the 
government as is the case with westinghouse 
one could argue there was relatively little incentive for du 
pont even to do all that doe asked of them said silverman let 
alone strive for improvement

westinghouse electric corp says that when it 
bid last year to take over operation of the savannah river plant it 
was not aware that the nuclear reactors would have to be shut down 
because of safety and structural problems 
but the company insists its decision to take the job will prove 
to have been sound 
james moore president of a westinghouse unit that will run the 
federal weapons plant said money was not a motivation for seeking 
the assignment which will pay a maximum of 75 million over the 
first six months or zero if the energy department determines 
that plant performance is too far below minimum standards 
moore in an interview cited three key reasons for assuming 
responsibility at one of 16 major nuclear weapons plants a complex 
that a government auditing agency called one of the more 
potentially dangerous industrial operations in the world 
it offers the possibility of blunting the spread of bad 
publicity about nuclear power to the commercial nuclear field 
which is westinghouses main business 
there was an element of defensiveness i guess to try to get 
involved to see if we could bring our capabilities and experience 
to move forward here and get more positive publicity moore said 
the companys nuclear specialists can remain involved and 
motivated in their field at a time when new activity in the 
commercial nuclear sector is at a standstill 
savannah rivers other facilities including its research 
laboratory and new plant for processing highlevel radioactive 
waste can put westinghouse at the cutting edge of nuclear 
technology

so far this year four people have been killed 
in the streets of washington every three days thats the rate of 
one every 18 hours 
the city has been dubbed the murder capital surpassing 
detroits percapita murder rate 
as of midday wednesday the police say 123 murders have 
occurred compared to 78 at this time last year 372 for all of 
last year the previous record for washington was 287 set in 1969 
in almost every case the victim is a black male and he meets 
his demise in one of the citys poorest neighborhoods according to 
a report by washingtons office of criminal justice plans and 
analysis 
four out of five times the report says the slaying is 
drugrelated a prospective drug seller trying to encroach onto 
another dealers turf a drug courier trying to keep more than his 
share of the profits or a user who didnt come up with the 10 or 
20 he owed his dealer 
the murders start to look alike a black man between the ages 
of 18 and 32 ends up lying in the street shot in the head or 
peppered with gunshot wounds from an automatic or semiautomatic 
weapon 
the slums have become a battleground for rival crack dealers 
trying to gain a foothold on the market the police say crack a 
cocaine derivative which arrived in the city two or three years 
ago gives an intense high for a very short time the cravings that 
follow drive people to violence more than most other drugs they 
say 
murder has become a way for dealers to settle disagreements and 
keep others in line the police add 
homicide is highest in communities that have the greatest 
inequalities extreme differences in income and wealth said 
criminologist lawrence sherman president of the crime control 
institute and that is certainly the case in washington compared 
to other cities 
the district is 67 percent black 28 percent white and 5 percent 
other races the black migration intensified after 1950 when job 
opportunities lured blacks from the south according to gan ahuja 
a demographer with the citys office of policy 
a high birth rate among black women coupled with the declining 
number of births to white women produced more black offspring 
ahuja said and many whites moved to the suburbs to take advantage 
of better housing and schools 
the district has the second highest per capita income in the 
nation according to the 1980 census yet 14 percent of its 
residents live in poverty the youth unemployment rate was 30 
percent higher than the national average more than 28 percent of 
adults over age 25 have a college education but 16 percent never 
finished elementary school according to the census

with the military back in the barracks 
practically everywhere in south america civilian government and 
democracy will be put to the test in six countries this year the 
outcomes could signal the continents future course this is 
another in a series of periodic reports by the associated press on 
the economic social and political turbulence that has turned south 
america into a continent in crisis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
south americas social and political 
fabric loosely woven at the best of times is fraying in these 
most difficult times 
from bloody protests in venezuela to disruptive strikes in 
brazil to spreading guerrilla influence in peru and colombia the 
symptoms of widespread discontent are making themselves 
dramatically evident in this year of crucial elections in a half 
dozen countries wracked by crushing indebtedness and recession for 
seven years the continent that began the 1980s in the flush of a 
democratic rennaissance is ending the decade weary and frustrated 
few foresee doom but many warn of a deepening gloom that could 
become politically explosive 
the misery the depressing conditions of life the lack of 
food housing health training education and jobs create a 
culture dish that can be exploited by ultras and extremists of 
whatever tendency argentinas president raul alfonsin recently 
warned in buenos aires 
president jose sarney of brazil sees extremists on the left 
gaining ground 
democracy is losing ground in latin america because the 
solution it has presented do not attend national problems he 
said in an interview with the associated press in late march we 
offer pessimistic solutions and the parties of the left optimistic 
ones 
in 16 days in may three countries paraguay bolivia and 
argentina will elect new presidents three others uruguay 
brazil and chile will do so by years end 
it should be a time of renewal and democratic reaffirmation but 
theres no sense of celebration at best theres a feeling of 
having held off defeat 
the democracies one way or another have managed to 
survive said jose joaquin brunner academic coordinator at the 
santiagobased latin american faculty of social sciences 
in an interview with the associated press he said the simple 
fact that elections were being held is a sign that all is not bad 
it wasnt a given that the new democracies were going to 
become strong quickly 
he added however that the combination of tender democratic 
institutions and an economic crisis is a very explosive mixture 
since 1978 a byandlarge moderate political leadership has 
directed the transition from military dictatorship to democracy in 
ecuador peru bolivia argentina uruguay and brazil it has taken 
the unpopular path of austerity curbing imports and limiting 
spending on public services in wrestling with south americas 
foreign debt of 277 billion 
the social cost has been high public hospitals and schools are 
understaffed and in disrepair their paint peeling and their 
equipment antiquated or simply broken down overworked 
statehospital doctors in brazil make the equivalent of about 130 
a month in peru about half that university professors commonly 
hold two or three jobs to make a subsistence wage in most 
countries highpaying employment is hard to find and stories of 
architects and physicists driving taxis now are common 
even in venezuela whose oil wealth kept it immune to the 
economic ailments afflicting its neighbors real wages are slumping 
dramatically and there is a growing shortage of basic consumer 
goods with supermarket shelves empty for the first time in 30 
years 
it was an increase in bus fares and the prices of some basic 
consumer needs that set thousands to rioting across venezuela in 
late february by official count 276 people were killed and 
thousands injured but unofficial accounts put the death toll at 
300 to 500 
the political cost of the economic and social unrest in south 
america overall is likely to be seen in the upcoming elections 
incumbent leaders and their parties are behind in the polls in 
several countries including argentina and bolivia presidents 
sarney of brazil and alan garcia of peru are beseiged by critics

some challengers are employing strains of populism or 
nationalism reminiscent of the 1940s or 1950s while disturbingly 
familiar to some older south americans they may carry appeal to a 
new generation only beginning to learn about democratic processes 
in brazil about 65 million of the 90 million eligible voters 
will be voting for president for the first time in their lives on 
nov 15 the last direct election was in 1960 sarney was picked by 
an electoral college in argentina and uruguay many millions will 
be voting for president for only the second time in their lives 
while a halfyear of campaigning remains one of the major 
contenders in brazil is gov leonel brizola of rio de janeiro a 
classic latin american populist who heads the democratic labor 
party his europeanstyle socialist party and the leftist workers 
party scored important victories in municipal elections last 
november another is the leftist luis lula da silva of the workers 
party 
in venezuela where elections were held in december the leftist 
movement to socialism doubled its representation in congress it 
appeared to gain more popular ground three weeks ago when it 
denounced police repression after the price riots 
but analysts dont foresee a continental resurgence of the 
classic marxist left which is losing ground to more moderate 
europeanstyle socialism in most countries 
now no leftist with any sense would declare that capitalism is 
exhausted brunner said 
in many countries the right appears the more formidable of the 
two extremes despite having surrendered power the rightwing 
military is still considered to have a powerful influence in brazil 
and in argentina where barracks revolts have forced the government 
to make political concessions 
the peronist carlos menem holds an advantage in argentinas 
preelection polls with a strongly nationalist campaign message a 
rightwing former military dictator hugo banzer is the pollsters 
favorite in bolivia 
venezuelas new generation party became that countrys first 
rightist group with a significant congressional presence right 
behind the movement to socialism colombia is struggling with a 
chilling surge in rightwing death squad death squad activity 
only in peru are leftist guerrilla organizations making inroads 
the maoist sendero luminoso shining path and the procastro tupac 
amaru are winning new recruits among the countrys largely indian 
and impoverished masses 
but they have not inspired revolution outside perus borders 
when an illorganized group of leftists recently attacked an army 
base outside buenos aires in argentina a nationwide wave of 
condemnation followed 
nonetheless most of the regions leaders say real political 
stability can only be achieved by improved social conditions they 
say that can only come when the crushing burden of the foreign debt 
is finally lifted 
many see us treasury secretary nicholas bradys proposal for 
debt relief and new credit as a possible solution but they see it 
through tired eyes having witnessed the failure of previous 
initiatives 
there is more weariness said gert rosenthal president of 
the united nations economic commission for latin america he said 
bradys plan needed to be laid out in more detail with the 
regions debtor countries participating before announcing a light 
at the end of the long dark tunnel

since a pair of young east coast investors 
launched a takeover bid for the holding company interco things 
have changed in hermann mo the shoe plant the biggest employer 
in town and an interco division closed to make up some of the 
millions spent fending off the financiers longtime plant workers 
have gotten severance checks 30 for each year worked what they 
havent gotten is a satisfactory explanation of why an inconclusive 
skirmish in the corporate takeover wars left so many casualties in 
a little hardworking town 
</TEXT>

in her 5anhour workaday world linda 
eikel never cared much about wall street wheelerdealers or 
billiondollar buyouts not until it hit home and tore apart her 
life 
millions were spent on a bid to buy her company millions to 
successfully block it and now that its over the shoe factory 
worker has no job no insurance and no security 
im kind of bitter she says i think the big shots the 
ones real high up do not realize we have to struggle to make a 
living 
eikel worked at the florsheim shoe plant the biggest employer 
in this small town until it closed in february as part of a giant 
complicated plan that allowed the parent company interco inc to 
fend off a 27 billion hostile takeover 
the fourmonth fight by interco is the kind of saga thats 
become more common in the mergermania 80s a fortune 500 company 
facing two thirtysomething corporate raiders and duking it out in a 
fight that leaves many outside the ring bloodied and dazed 
its also a story of how a hostile takeover bid can be a 
moneymaker for those with the least stake in the company 
financiers and lawyers and a heartbreaker for those with the most 
basic vested interest the loyal employees 
elwood woody wesselschmidt made shoes for nearly 30 years and 
was manager of the 275worker florsheim plant in hermann the big 
people all they decide is what they want to buy and sell he 
said the little guys are the ones who lose their jobs 
the losers may be obvious but the winners of this skirmish in 
the takeover wars arent that clear take interco for exmple 
to reorganize and avoid a takeover by cardinal acquisition 
corp controlled by steven and mitchell rales interco estimates 
itll pay more than 65 million to banks lawyers advisers and 
others 
it also borrowed 19 billion and developed a restructuring plan 
that involves cutting 75 million over the next year and selling 
off all but four or five of about 20 major companies 
one costcutting measure estimated to save 2 million annually 
was closing the hermann plant and a second florsheim factory in 
paducah ky which together employed 650 people their work will 
be consolidated elsewhere 
for those keeping score it might seem as if its interco 1 
raiders 0 not so the raiders appear to have made millions and 
while interco executives kept their jobs they will be running a 
shrunken debtburdened company 
they end up selling their crown jewels to cover their 
expenses said said kathryn rudie harrigan strategic management 
professor at columbia universitys graduate school of business 
theyre not in better shape now 
interco recently sold londontown corp maker of london fog 
outerwear as part of a plan to sell all its apparel and most of 
its retail groups the 334 billion corporation will keep its 
footwear and most of its furniture divisions although one of its 
most prestigious names furniture maker ethan allen is for sale 
the corporations managers will have to make the remaining 
companies sell better said budd bugatch research director at 
the investment banking firm ferris baker watts inc they have a 
real monkey on their back 
for interco with 115 billion in loans to pay back by may 
1990 much remains uncertain but one thing about its 
restructuring is for sure 
the plant closing has hurt hermann a proud german town in 
winemaking country where shoes have been made since the beginning 
of the century 
theres a lot of the german work ethic here said perry 
lovett city administrator in this eastern missouri town of 2700 
there are a lot of people whove never been out of work 
i havent looked for a job in almost 30 years wesselschmidt 
said ive never written a resume in my life yes its scary 
still hes more disappointed than angry 
you bust your buns to make the shoes look good he said 
then something like this happens and you feel betrayed we 
did our best now our best isnt doing us any good 
pam terrill the union president is angry 
they said quality was no 1 the people took it seriously and 
they closed the plant anyhow she said i wish theyd go under 
personally ive heard that from quite a few other people 
the florsheim workers cant realistically expect to find new 
jobs in their industry in just the last decade 317 us shoe 
plants have closed according to footwear industries of america 
imported shoes make up 816 percent of the market 
many now rely on unemployment compensation severance pay came 
to 30 for each year on the job with a 15year minimum and 30year 
maximum 
theyve caused our life to be in a heck of a turmoil said 
eikel i think people are bitter toward interco not florsheim i 
dont think the big guys from interco are hurting they got 
themselves into this takeover 
interco through its publicrelations firm fleishmanhillard 
refused to discuss the attempted takeover or any plans but some 
analysts say eikels assessment isnt far off 
this is a management that acquired some wonderful brand names 
and did nothing with them said juli niemann analyst with 
stifel nicolaus inc an investment banking firm the stock 
languished for years call it lack of stellar management 
bugatch concurred they did not operate the business in a way 
that maximized shareholder value 
the result interco was ripe for raiders to come in carve up 
the company and sell it

enter the rales brothers two aggressive savvy washington 
dc businessmen with interests in tools consumer plastics and 
tirechanging equipment who reportedly were attracted to the 
furniture business 
they made four bids starting with 64 a share ending with 74 
a share 
interco which rebuffed the bids as inadequate countered with 
its own restructuring and recapitalization plan it said was valued 
at 76 a share counting cash and securities to be offered to 
shareholders plus the stocks residual value 
the company also adopted a poison pill defense designed to 
make an unwelcome takeover prohibitively expensive according to 
government documents the rales brothers filed 23 interco 
executives were to receive golden parachutes totaling more than 16 
million if control of the company changed 
by november the rales brothers nonetheless controlled nearly 93 
percent of the stock their original stake of 87 percent plus 84 
percent tendered by shareholders 
but they let their final offer lapse believing the fight had 
dragged on too long and that intercos value was deteriorating 
said neil call their spokesman the brothers declined to be 
interviewed 
they didnt acquire interco but they didnt lose either 
the st louis postdispatch said the rales brothers sold their 
stock for a gross profit of 597 million and analysts estimate 
the takeover bid cost about 10 million figures call doesnt 
dispute 
among intercos costs are 405 million in fees to four banks 
that arranged the 19 billion in loans up to 9 million to a 
financial adviser and 155 million to lawyers accountants 
printers and others 
there are better uses for the money niemann said id like to 
see 65 million in capital spending instead its for lawyers and 
investment bankers to send their kids to college 
the middlemen always win professor harrigan said 
regardless of whether they catch their prey or not they get 
paid 
other winners include shareholders who bought and sold stock as 
it rose from 42 a share in march to 6850 in july 
as for the shoe plant workers theyre going to grab their 
boots and pull them up a little higher and grab their belts and 
make them a little tighter and see that it works out said tom 
cabot president of the hermann area chamber of commerce 
a printing company has expressed interest in the old florsheim 
building which the city of hermann purchased 
and eikel has a wish for the corporation 
i hope interco gets their thing together and gets back on the 
right road she said so they dont have to do this to any more 
people

the sprawling indictment of junk bond wizard 
michael r milken should speed settlement of fraud charges against 
his former bosses while provoking an intense legal battle over the 
use of racketeering laws defense lawyers say 
the drexel burnham lambert inc financier the crown jewel in a 
twoyear investigation of the wall street investment firm was 
charged wednesday along with his brother and an associate who face 
mammoth prison terms and up to 11 billion in penalties 
defense lawyers attacked the 98count indictment on racketeering 
and securities fraud charges as an abuse of prosecutorial power a 
rehash of old allegations and a tool to wrench cooperation from 
other drexel employees 
they also called the charges a perversion of the federal 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act which was 
established in 1970 principally to combat organized crime but is 
used increasingly to prosecute whitecollar criminals 
i think it is outrageous to use rico in a circumstance like 
this said michael armstrong an attorney for lowell milken 
they applied the statute to behavior which for the most part has 
not been considered even to be criminal much less the subject of a 
racketeering indictment 
while certain to be hotly contested the charges against milken 
42 who almost singlehandedly created the 175 billion highyield 
junk bond industry are expected to help resolve separate civil and 
criminal charges against drexel 
negotiations between drexel and the securities and exchange 
commission to settle civil fraud charges including insider 
trading deadlocked earlier this month when the firm balked at a 
provision to fire milken before resolving the claims 
with the indictment drexel placed milken on leave from the 
firm clearing one roadblock once the sec settlement on the civil 
charges is signed drexel is to plead guilty to six felonies and 
pay 650 million to settle criminal fraud charges brought by the 
manhattan us attorneys office 
at issue in all the investigations accusations and negotiations 
is the use of federal racketeering statutes and government power to 
obtain cooperation from defendants in cases linked to the 
confessions of jailed insider trader ivan boesky 
drexel has said publicly it agreed to settle with the government 
last december to avoid a racketeering indictment that could have 
frozen its multibilliondollar assets and crippled its operations 
as part of the pact the nations fifthlargest brokerage house 
agreed to fire milken and withhold his 1988 pay estimated at 100 
million to 200 million in the sec deal the government reportedly 
wants to bar milken from the firm for life and prohibit drexel 
employees from talking business with him 
the wideranging charges in the 110page indictment of the 
milkens and former drexel trader bruce lee newberg parallel last 
septembers sec complaint and the governments racketeering 
indictment of princetonnewport lp a defunct investment 
partnership a month earlier newberg also was charged in that 
case set for trial june 5 
drexel allegedly illegally concealed the ownership of blocks of 
stock for princetonnewport in a deal engineered by milken 
in its lengthy probe of drexel that began when boesky squealed 
in late 1986 the government has achieved but one criminal 
conviction lisa jones a 26yearold bond traders helper found 
guilty last week of lying to a grand jury in the princetonnewport 
probe 
a major point of contention in the new indictment promises to be 
the governments attempt to seize under the rico law 37 billion 
from each of the defendants twice the total amount of their 
salaries stock holdings and other compensation from 1984 through 
1987 plus interest in addition michael milken faces a sentence 
of up to 520 years in prison 
the indictment says michael milken amassed a fortune of more 
than 1 billion in the four years through his prowess as the head 
of drexels beverly hills califbased highyield bond division 
in part from his relationship with boesky 
it maintains that all money made by the men through illict 
trades or not is tainted because it constitutes the proceeds of 
their unlawful schemes and their interest in the racketeering 
enterprise charged drexel is considered the racketeering 
enterprise and michael milken its leader 
the charges against milken include using illegal inside 
information about merger proposals to arrange deals and stock 
manipulation only one transaction has not been publicized before 
the government has 70 days to bring its case to trial unless a 
judge grants an extension or defense attorneys file motions 
delaying the case which they said is likely 
we will fight this case in the courts the sanctuary of due 
process not in the press said arthur l liman michael milkens

</TEXT>

the nations fifthlargest securities firm last december agreed 
to plead guilty to six felony counts for securities and mail fraud 
and pay a record 650 million in fines and restitution 
the charges brought by the us attorneys office in manhattan 
included stock manipulation fraudulent filings with the securities 
and exchange commission and a stock parking scheme with 
nowimprisoned inside trader ivan boesky 
drexel said it agreed to the deal with the government rather 
than face a racketeering indictment that could have frozen its 
assets and crippled its operations 
under the deal drexel agreed to fire michael milken and 
withhold his 1988 compensation estimated at between 100 million 
and 200 million it agreed to similar terms for milkens brother 
lowell a drexel executive 
the milkens and former drexel trader bruce lee newberg were 
charged wednesday in a 98count racketeering and securities fraud 
indictment handed up by a federal grand jury 
drexel will not formally plead guilty under the criminal plea 
bargain until the firm settles civil charges with the sec and a 
federal judge approves the deals 
the government began investigating drexel and milken in late 
1986 after the firm was named by boesky who agreed to pay 100 
million and cooperate with the government to settle insider trading 
charges against him 
</TEXT>

the sec last september accused drexel milken and five others of 
fraudulent schemes including insider trading stock manipulation 
failure to disclose stock ownership and other violations of 
securities laws the civil complaint says milken schemed with 
boesky in at least 16 transactions that violated securities laws 
negotiations between drexel and the sec hit numerous roadblocks 
and stalled earlier this month when the government demanded the 
firm fire milken before the settlement was completed one proposed 
condition would bans milken from the firm for life and bars other 
drexel employees from talking business with him 
the sec deal is a precondition for settlement of criminal 
charges against the firm

focus of government investigators for more than two years 
the 42yearold junk bond financier received a letter from the

milken is challenging drexels criminal settlement in federal 
court charging it violates his constitutional rights by forcing 
the firm to fire him and withhold his 1988 pay an april hearing is 
scheduled the case is not expected to derail the plea agreement

financier michael milken accused 
racketeer also has been called a devoted father a generous 
supporter of charity and creator of the most innovative financial 
engine of the century 
milken 42 head of drexel burnham lambert incs highyield 
bond division was indicted wednesday by a manhattan federal grand 
jury for massive securities law and racketeering violations in the 
ivan boesky insidertrading probe 
while the indictment apparently will cost the trader his job and 
compensation of more than 100 million a year the muchpublicized 
investigation has done little to dim milkens image in the eyes of 
friends and those who have profited from the junkbond market he 
created 
as recently as january barbara firestone who runs a los 
angeles organization for retarded or emotionally disturbed 
children sang the praises of a man who has donated hundreds of 
thousands of dollars and given unstintingly of his time 
its not the man you see in the newspaper ms firestone 
said of milken 
through three family foundations milken and his brother 
lowell gave more than 17 million to 200 charities over the last 
six years 
milkens place in modern financial history appears assured by 
his role as the virtually singlehanded creator of the modern 
market in junk bonds 
the highrisk highinterest bonds have been used to quickly 
raise large cash war chests for corporate takeover strategists and 
to fund business expansion by those who couldnt persuade banks or 
more conservative venture capitalists to back their efforts 
a dozen years ago milken began preaching the value of the 
bonds which were issued by companies not strong enough to command 
favorable ratings from the agencies that advise investors on the 
soundness of corporate bonds because they are low rated junk 
bonds have to offer higher interest rates to attract investors than 
do bonds with higher ratings 
milken reasoned that by buying a diverse portfolio of junk 
bonds an investor could hedge against the risk of default by any 
one company the explosive growth of the junk bond market 
responsible in part for waves of corporate takeovers in recent 
years is credited to milkens fervant advocacy 
drexel dominated the market largely because of milken who 
presided over an informal network of satisfied clients those who 
had successfully financed a deal by selling junk bonds stood 
willing to buy bonds issued by others 
in 1977 milken pulled off a coup by persuading drexel to let 
him move the junk bond division from manhattan to beverly hills 
near his boyhood home of encino 
he lives there now with his children and wife lori in a home 
once owned by clark gable 
being separated from my lifes work is an extremely difficult 
step milken said in a statement wednesday i am enormously 
proud of my 20 years with drexel burnham lambert and it has been an 
honor to work with the companys dedicated employees

at least nine oil spill experts including exxon 
corps senior environmental officer left the company during 
personnel cutbacks in 1985 and 1986 a specialist in oil pollution 
said 
its not clear whether the departures affected the companys 
response when one of its tankers struck a reef off alaska and 
leaked 101 million gallons of crude oil said richard s golob 
publisher of golobs oil pollution bulletin 
but he said wednesday it might be a contributing factor 
because they do not have the same experienced cadre of oil spill 
professionals that they had prior to the 1986 early retirement 
offer 
this is not just an exxon problem its an industrywide 
problem he added 
exxon co usa spokesman les rogers said the company is confident 
it has the expertise it needs to tackle fridays spill in prince 
william sound in addition to its own staff he said those who 
have retired are readily available and the company already has 
tapped two former employees as consultants 
one went up on the first plane from houston to alaska on 
friday rogers said 
seven of the nine experts left five exxon subsidiaries and 
affiliates in 1986 during an industrywide slump when exxon and 
other oil companies offered retirement incentives to reduce their 
workforces golob said 
an eighth expert in oil spill response departed in 1985 and a 
ninth left either in 1985 or 1986 he said 
even earlier the alyeska pipeline service co the consortium 
operating alaskas port of valdez cut back its staff of oilspill 
experts the seattle times reported tuesday 
the newspaper quoted james woodle general manager of the port 
from 198284 and jerry nebel alyeska oilspill response 
coordinator in 198182 as saying they were fired for complaining 
about the cutbacks 
exxons alaska coordinator don cornett told the newspaper he 
was not aware of any such cutbacks at alyeska exxon is part of the 
alyeska consortium 
golob said the frequency of major spills has declined in the 
last few years and career opportunities in the field have 
decreased but an environmentalist said staff departures should 
raise a red flag 
it would be troubling if the company did not replace those 
people with equally knowledgable spill response personnel said 
lisa speer senior staff scientist with the natural resources 
defense council in new york while exxon is clearly trying to do 
everything they can right now the response has really been 
inexcusably slow 
we think we have acted responsibly and promptly exxons 
rogers said from houston we were moving a good deal of material 
up to the alaska area from the very start and we were employing 
that equipment and materiel as soon as it got there 
a new york oil industry analyst confirmed deep staff cuts at 
most oil companies but said he had no indication that oil spill 
control suffered more than any other area of the industry 
stephen smith an analyst with bear sterns compared keeping a 
large staff of oil spill experts to buying insurance if its not 
a here and now present danger those people are not essential he 
said 
a spokesman for atlantic richfield co said the company had 
trimmed its workforce by more than 19 percent starting in 1985 but 
insisted its oil spill programs had not been affected 
obviously in the process there we lost a number of skilled 
people arco spokesman albert greenstein said in an telephone 
interview from los angeles wednesday but to imply that the oil 
spill effort suffered as a result of that is really off base 
its not a matter of having a handful of experts who know 
how to fight spills greenstein added

federal prosecutors are seeking staggering 
prison terms and billions of dollars in penalties plus 257 
million in interest against michael r milken and two others 
charged in a mammoth racketeering and fraud indictment 
a federal grand jury in manhattan handed up a 98count 
indictment wednesday against the drexel burnham lambert inc junk 
bond financier his brother lowell and former drexel trader bruce 
lee newberg 
the longexpected indictment was the biggest development yet in 
the snowballing ivan boesky insider trading investigation that has 
stunned wall street for more than two years 
the three are charged with turning drexel into a billiondollar 
racketeering enterprise that allegedly used its highyield or 
junk bond department for a series of securities fraud schemes with 
various unindicted coconspirators including the nowimprisoned 
boesky and members of defunct investment partnership 
princetonnewport lp 
this threeyear investigation has uncovered substantial fraud 
in a very significant segment of the american financity said us attorney 
benito romano 
romano said the 185 billion in forfeitures were tgainst individuals 
under the federal racketeer influenced 
and c milken has headed drexels junk bond department since the 
mid1970s and is credited with turning the highrisk highyield 
securities into a 175 billion annual market the bonds often are 
used to finance corporate takeovers and the growth of small to 
mediumsizedompanies 
the indictment described the beverly hills califbased 
department as the driving force behind drexels business 
noting that between 1983 ait accounted for nearly half of 
drexels profitl three defendants denied wrongdoing and said they would 
plead 
nnocent 
the allegations against me are b lowell milken said 
in a statement the proof will show that virtually no 
contacts with ivan boesky and that i had little if anything to 
do with the events the prosecumisrepresent in order to 
construct their charges 
i have been thrown into this indictment because of a fact in 
which i take great pride i am michael milkens brother 
michael milken said he would plead innocent and vigorse accusations 
in america an indictment marks the beginning of the legal 
process not the end after 2 years of leaks and 
distortions i am now eager to present all the facts in an open and 
unbiased forum hitatement said 
newberg and several princetonnewport partners were indicted 
last year on fraud and racketeering counts in another stock case 
which defentorneys claimed was brought to pressure them into 
cooperating against drexel 
newbergs lawyers gerald lefcourt and frederick p hafetz 
called the second racketeering indictment a total perversion of 
the rico statute 
if convicted on the racketeering counts alone prosecutors said 
the defendants face maximum fines of 37 billion each all three 
face maximum prison sentences of 20 years on e two 
racketeering charges 
ition the three are subject to forfeiture proceedings on 
virtually all money they have made through their drexel dealings 
since 1984 an estimated 185 billion 
that includes 12 billion in salaries 112 million in drexel 
stock 205 million in corporate finance fees 37 million in 
tradingon allegedly tainted deals and 257 million in 
calculated at a blended rate of 791 percent 
michael milken also was charged with all of the 96 
nonracketeering counts which include numerous mail wire and 
securities charges lowell milken was charged with 11 counts and 
newberg was charged with 20 counts 
each faces a maximum penalty of five years and at least 250000 
in fines on each of the nonracketeering charges making michael 
milken subject to 24 million in fines and a total of 520 years 
imprisonment 
the indictment palleled the securities and exchanns sweeping civil 
insider trading action against drexel 
milken and others last september 
in december d struck a plea bargain with federal 
prosecutors that called for the dismissal of milken and the 
withholding of most of his 1988 compensation estimated at be100 million 
and 200 million 
as part of the plea bargain which drexel says it made to avoid 
crippling racketeering charges the firm agreed to plead guideral felony

that beer your favorite movie star quaffed in 
his most recent film may be part of an insidious advertising 
scheme according to an advocacy group that wants to require 
moviemakers to reveal when theyre being paid to show commercial 
products 
the center for science in the public interest says the movie 
bull durham included 21 shots of miller lite beer superman 
ii featured the marlboro cigarette logo and et the 
extraterrestrial prominently displayed reeses pieces and coors 
beer 
while the center didnt know if money changed hands between 
filmmakers and manufacturers on all these movies it said philip 
morris paid 42500 to get its marlboro logo into the superman film 
on the coming james bond movie licensed to kill philip 
morris paid 350000 to have lark cigarettes shown on screen 
center staff attorney charles mitchell said 
the center is asking state attorneys general to determine 
whether the undisclosed placement of commercial products in films 
constitutes deceptive advertising that violates state laws 
it also said broadcasting movies on television in which there 
are paid placements of cigarettes violates a 1971 law that 
prohibits advertising of cigarettes on tv 
mitchell said the center urged states to require filmmakers to 
state at the beginning of a movie for example notice this film 
contains paid advertising for marlboro cigarettes 
the center also said it would ask state officials to determine 
whether the placement of alcoholic beverages and cigarettes in 
youthoriented films should be prohibited because youths cannot 
legally buy such products 
the group said it was petitioning the federal communications 
commission to rescind a rule that exempts theatrical films from the 
general requirement for television programs that paid product 
placements be disclosed 
the paid placement of junk foods alcoholic beverages and 
cigarettes in movies is one of the most insidious forms of 
advertising said michael jacobson the centers executive 
director advertising in movies is blatantly unfair to audiences 
who go to be entertained not advertised to 
elizabeth barnes a spokeswoman for the motion picture 
association of america said the association had no comment 
rep tom luken dohio on march 17 asked attorney general dick 
thornburgh to investigate whether paid placement of cigarettes in 
movies made for theaters and then shown on television violates the 
1971 federal cigarette labeling and advertising act that prohibits 
cigarette ads on tv 
a senior aide to luken who spoke only on condition he not be 
identified said the 350000 and 42500 payments from philip 
morris were made directly to the producers of the films liggett amp 
meyers also paid 30000 to have its eve cigarettes appear in 
supergirl the aide said 
our position is that if you show superman or supergirl 
on tv you violated that law the aide said 
violating the act is punishable by a fine of up to 10000 
steven weiss a spokesman for philip morris usa said the 
350000 payment was the total for a sixmonth promotional campaign 
that was to coincide with the bond films premiere in japan where 
philip morris markets lark he said the product placement portion 
was only a small amount of the 350000 
he said philip morris policy is not to pay for use of its 
products or logos in movies but that it will provide such materials 
free 
when requests are made of us we will do so only if there 
is a smoking scene already in the film but we dont pay to have 
our products placed in films weiss said 
weiss said liggett amp myers markets lark in the united states and 
that philip morris could not benefit from lark appearing in the 
us showings of the bond film 
lukens aide said the bond movie script specifies the use of 
lark cigarettes the contract for the product placement also says 
if philip morris doesnt like what it sees on screen it can get 
its money back the aide said 
weiss said he was unaware of that contract language

despite official predictions that oil from the 
largest us spill ever will not reach canadian waters the 
spreading alaskan slick is causing growing concern about arctic 
development and tanker shipping 
i think its so massive that we just dont know what were 
going to do with it at this time arne hansen of the western 
canada wilderness committee said wednesday by telephone from 
vancouver british columbia 
he said the the environmental group long has been worried about 
supertankers in the pacific lanes off of canada 
we had been expecting a spill like this for years hansen 
said its like a meltdown of a nuclear reactor 
the spill in alaskas prince william sound has been a leading 
news story in canada since the tanker exxon valdez ran aground on 
friday 
environment minister lucien bouchard told reporters tuesday at a 
meeting in meech lake quebec that it might be a good idea to 
review the canadaus agreement on west coast oil shipping 
we are concerned about what happened because we know that 
these kind of disasters can happen everywhere he said so we 
will see what we can do for the future 
bouchard and his aides have said repeatedly that it is unlikely 
the oil spill off valdez alaska will directly affect canadian 
waters or shores 
when asked about the us plan to allow some oil and gas 
drilling in an alaskan wildlife refuge bordering canada bouchard 
said the arctic is an extremely fragile area 
we are extremely worried we are opposed to this he said 
the canadian government has said it opposes the plan for the 
alaskan development next to its yukon territory because it could 
disrupt the migratory patterns of the porcupine caribou herd 
james fulton environment critic for the socialist new 
democratic party predicted in a telephone interview from ottawa 
that some oil from the valdez spill eventually will affect canadian 
territory even if the prevailing currents move the bulk of it north 
ive looked at all of the most recent tidal and current 
charts he said i dont think theres much doubt that some of 
the spill is likely to reach canadian territory 
fulton represents in parliament british columbias skeena 
district which includes the provinces northwestern pacific coast 
he said the difficulties in the cleanup show that the oil 
industrys state of prepardeness is very close to zero 
calls to his office have been running 9to1 in favor of action 
such as a halt to tanker traffic fulton said 
people are mad he said people are getting really sick 
and tired of being kicked around by large corporations

mcorp which declared itself a momentum 
company when it was formed five years ago was the victim of 
texas downward economic spiral caused by falling oil prices even 
though the bank holding company poured more money into real estate 
than energy analysts said 
the 18 billion 25bank holding company was stripped of all but 
five banks by wednesday after federal regulators declared the banks 
involvent the government pumped in 300 million in what likely 
will become the third largest commercial bank rescue ever 
the 20 banks were combined into the governmentowned deposit 
insurance bridge bank na while officials search for a buyer for 
some of all of the banks 
once the texas real estate markets began to slip there really 
was very little they could do said banking analyst michael starr 
at duff amp phelps inc in chicago what youre seeing in the real 
estate market is simply what started a decade ago in energy 
problems mcorp is at the tailend of feeling those problems 
mcorp probably was guilty of overaggressive lending starr 
said but not to the extent of other texas banks most of its 
loans he said were made to reputable developers unlike many 
troubled thrifts that had backed inexperienced developers 
the straightforward honest answer is that the state of texas 
was hit by an economic hbomb that had effects on real estate 
portfolios energy portfolios said robert d rieke a 
banking analyst with the dallas firm of rauscher pierce refsnes inc 
to its tribute mcorp has been able to withstand the fallout 
longer than anybody else said rieke once a vicepresident and 
treasurer at mcorp 
mcorp which has yet to report annual earnings also has blamed 
its troubles on real estate telling stockholders last december 
that asset quality problems largely related to loans secured by 
real estate and assets acquired through foreclosure adversely 
affected the companys financial performance in the third 
quarter when mcorp posted a 517 million loss the federal deposit 
insurance corp has said mcorps banks lost another 213 million in 
the fourth quarter and 903 million for the year 
while a weak real estate climate hurt mcorp its final tumble 
began last week when a connecticut bond trader and two employees 
who together held just over 2 million in bonds moved to force 
the company into bankruptcy because they had not been paid since 
october when the company announced a moratorium on payments on 470 
million in bonds and preferred stock 
mcorps response on monday was to announce it would seek 
protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy 
code the resulting uncertainty apparently set off a run on 
deposits 
federal regulators speaking on condition of anonymity said 
between 50 million and 100 million was withdrawn tuesday from the 
flagship mbank dallas the withdrawals came both from individual 
depositors and some of mcorps other subsidiary banks the 
regulators said 
the federal reserve bank of dallas called in a loan to mbank 
dallas but the bank couldnt pay and was declared insolvent 
depositors at 19 of the failed institutions including those 
with funds in excess of the 100000 insurance limit were fully 
protected the fdic said at mbank abliene only deposits up to 
the insurance limit were transferred 
all the banks remain open for business as usual with former 
mcorp employees now working for the government 
the remaining five mbanks in brownsville corpus christi el 
paso new braunfels and waco plus a trust and investment 
subsidiary form the nucleus of a new beginning for mcorp the 
company said wednesday 
while the nature of mcorp has been altered dramatically a 
solid healthy core remains said mcorp chairman gene h bishop 
but analysts are unsure whether mcorp can survive in any form 
mcorp still faces claims against its remaining assets by 
bondholders and the fdic which chairman william seidman said holds 
substantial claims against the parent company 
analysts said it is unlikely those claims can be resolved in any 
fashion other than liquidation 
the governments rescue came almost six months after mcorp had 
asked for federal assistance 
bishop and other managers had put together their own bid for the 
bank but the fdic rather than acting on the plan opened up the 
bidding to all comers setting an april 3 deadline 
seidman said wednesday that deadline may be extended several 
groups have been reportedly looking at mcorps books including 
wells fargo co leveraged buyout firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co apparently representing management interests of chicagos 
wealthy pritzker family which controls the hyatt hotel chain and 
first city bancorp of texas inc itself the recipient of federal 
assistance

the internal revenue service nearing the end 
of a tax filing season that so far has been almost a breeze is 
still promising refunds within six weeks but not for long 
those who file closer to the april 17 deadline will probably 
have to wait longer for their refund the irs said wednesday in 
renewing its file early plea 
the agency said that heading into the last three weeks of the 
filing season more than half the 109 million couples and 
individuals who are expected to submit returns sometime this year 
still had not done so that means a crunch as the deadline 
approaches with nearly 32 million returns expected in the final 
two weeks 
but while that represents about 30 percent of the years total 
it is about the same percentage of procrastinators as in 1988 the 
irs said 
through last friday the irs had received 531 million returns 
up 07 percent from 528 million during the same period a year ago 
the agencys 10 service centers had processed 33 percent more than 
at this time last year 424 million compared with 411 million in 
1988 
three of the 10 centers in atlanta memphis and austin texas 
have processed slighly fewer returns than they had at this time a 
year ago 
that is not a matter of concern said irs spokesman frank keith 
because those three centers were given new territories this year as 
the agency redistributed its workload and have received fewer 
returns so far the important statistic keith said is that the 
three have processed more returns than they had been scheduled to 
the only black mark on this years filing season from the irs 
perspective is the low accuracy rate on answering taxpayers 
telephoned questions 
in some areas of the country irs surveys found the agencys 
assistors are correct barely half the time nationwide these 
5000 employees gave incorrect responses to 308 percent of test 
questions 
publicity about those wrong answers could account for the fact 
that fewer taxpayers are calling the agencys tollfree answer line 
with specific tax questions through last week 193 million calls 
had been received down from 206 million during the same period a 
year ago 
on the other hand the number of calls received by the irs 
teletax system has nearly tripled from 54 million to 151 
million teletax whose tollfree numbers and subject list are 
included in the back of the instruction packages mailed by the irs 
offers taperecorded advice on more than 140 tax topics 
you may call the same number if you have not received your 
refund you will need the first social security number shown on 
your return your filing status and the exact amount of your refund 
more than 74 percent 314 million of the returns so far this 
year have been certified for refunds totaling 256 billion an 
average refund of almost 816 at this time last year 75 percent 
of filers 308 million had had refunds approved those refunds 
totaled 252 billion and averaged 817

the eec commission thursday proposed to 
ban advertisements by tobacco makers for nontobacco products and 
said visible health warnings should be printed on all tobacco 
advertising 
ads for clothing and other nontobacco items using a symbol or 
trademark of a tobacco brand will be banned if the 12 eec states 
adopt the european economic community commsision proposal 
it also suggested forcing tobacco makers to display any of 12 
health warnings in their ads and that ads for a particular brand of 
cigarettes only show a pack of cigarettes and their tar content 
any warning about the health hazards of smoking should cover at 
least 10 percent of the advertisements total space the commission 
recommended 
the commission said in a statement it made its proposals as part 
of its europe against cancer program annually 440000 eec 
nationals die of diseases caused or aggravated by smoking it said 
the requirement that only a cigarette packet and the tar content 
be shown in advertisements is already in effect in france 
but of the 12 eec states only portugal and ireland have a total 
ban on tobacco advertising greece luxembourg and spain have few 
restrictions on such ads 
in the other six eec nations tobacco ads must carry the same 
health warning that appears on the packet 
the commissions proposals for eecwide rules on tobacco ads 
must be approved by the european parliament and the 12 eec states 
before they can take effect

about 800 amoco production co employees will be 
cut from company payrolls as part of a reorganization this spring 
reflecting a trend by major oil companies to emphasize foreign 
exploration and production over us operations 
amoco production is the oil and gas exploration subsidiary of 
amoco corp the nations fifthlargest energy company and 
officials say the reductions are designed to reduce costs and 
better focus resources 
the cuts announced wednesday amount to about 10 percent of the 
us employees officials said 
the subsidiary has 15000 workers worldwide including about 
8000 us citizens who are paid in us dollars no matter where 
they work according to spokesman richard judy of chicagobased 
amoco corp 
the job cuts slated to begin in may would come through 
placement of employees with other amoco corp subsidiaries 
voluntary retirement voluntary resignation and some firings the 
company said 
the reductions will be made to reduce our costs and focus our 
resources money physical assets and people on those areas 
where the projected financial returns are the most attractive 
said patrick j early president of amoco production 
early said the changes reflect general trends of shrinking the 
companys domestic organization while expanding international 
operations 
for the first time in its 100year history amoco plans to spend 
more money in 1989 searching for oil and gas abroad than in the 
united states 
the company said it plans to take advantage of its strong 
natural gas reserve position look into property trades with other 
companies and continue divesting marginal and nonstrategic 
properties 
the reorganization of amocos us exploration and production 
operations follows similar moves recently by texaco inc atlantic 
richfield co and phillips petroleum co 
the majors are looking in foreign areas because theyve got a 
better chance of finding a big field there said ray beresford a 
principal of international energy consultants ltd in morristown 
nj 
the lower 48 states is pretty well picked over and the only 
hopes of a big field in the us alaska or offshore california 
you cant touch because of environmental concerns he said 
in the last year us oil production has dropped 5 percent 
amoco corp and its subsidiaries employ 55000 people worldwide 
the energy and chemical company sold 6 percent of all refined 
petroleum products in the united states last year and had 1988 
revenues of 239 billion judy said

computer giant unisys corp expects to lose 
up to 80 million in the years first quarter partly because of the 
navys suspension of bidding rights for three of its defense 
divisions 
the company also cited slow sales of its 1100 line of mainframe 
computers which was replaced by the 2200 series last month 
in a statement wednesday unisys said it anticipates turning a 
profit in the second quarter as it steps up delivery of the 2200 
series mainframes 
the estimated loss for the quarter ending friday would be about 
55 cents to 65 cents per common share the company said it expects 
to report final firstquarter results april 21 
michael geran an analyst with nikko securities international in 
new york said the projected loss was higher than the 20 million 
to 25 million he had expected 
but once you go negative theres a natural tendency to throw 
everything but the kitchen sink in he said 
unisys said the governments operation ill wind 
investigation and the indefinite suspension of three defense 
divisions caused disruption and added costs during the quarter 
the navy announced earlier this month that it had suspended 
bidding rights of the shipboard and ground systems group the 
computer systems division and the communications systems division 
of unisys 
the former sperry corp divisions based in great neck ny 
eagan minn and salt lake city utah provided 70 percent of 
unisys defenserelated revenues 
peter hynes a unisys spokesman said the suspended units 
performed about 16 billlion worth of federal government work last 
year unisys as a whole had 99 billion in revenues last year 
the suspension came less than a week after a former unisys vice 
president and a former unisys consultant pleaded guilty in federal 
court in alexandria va to trying to bribe former navy officials 
another unisys executive and a second unisys consultant entered 
guilty pleas on jan 27 to making illegal campaign contributions to 
members of congress 
unisys was formed when burroughs corp took over sperry in 1986 
in a 48 billion deal 
the company also said firstquarter sales were affected by a 
restructuring of its us computer business the formation of new 
product groups and the integration of convergent technologies inc 
a california computer company acquired in 1988 
the company said in february it had laid off 1700 employees at 
60 us sites and would close an assembly plant in nogales mexico

a group of american and soviet businessmen said 
thursday they have signed an agreement that could create joint 
ventures worth up to 10 billion over the next two decades 
the agreement reached by the american trade consortium and the 
soviet foreign economic consortium establishes a legal and business 
framework for the development of joint ventures between the two 
groups 
it was the first time a private commericial agreement was signed 
in the kremlin and caps a year of negotiations said james h 
giffen president of the american group 
some of the possible joint ventures could include oilseed 
processing manufacture of floppy discs and production of crackers 
and cereals 
giffen said difficult issues such as ways to repatriate profits 
earned in the soviet union and how investments will be made had 
been resolved in principle by the agreement 
however he declined to provide details of how profits would be 
taken out of the soviet union 
repatriation of profits has been the key problem for western 
companies trying to do business in the soviet union the soviet 
ruble is not convertible and any profits earned in rubles are 
worthless outside the country 
feasibility studies will be conducted over the next year and 
giffen said the first of some 25 joint ventures could start up 
within 18 months 
the us consortium consists of six companies including archer 
daniels midland chevron corp eastman kodak co johnson amp 
johnson rjr nabisco inc and the mercator corp 
ford motor co the seventh member of the group announced 
thursday that it has pulled out of the consortium saying that the 
accomplishments between the american trade consortium and the 
soviets had not gone far enough 
fords withdrawal will not affect the future of the project 
giffen said at a news conference he said ford had been looking at 
the project for about a year and that the timing of the withdrawal 
with the signing of the agreement was coincidental

a federal appeals court has effectively cleared 
the way for a california company to pursue its 970 million 
takeover bid for prime computer inc turning attention to an 
expected proxy fight at primes annual meeting in may 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals ruled wednesday that an 
injunction blocking mai basic four incs bid would be lifted after 
the tustin califbased company provided specific details of 
drexel burnham lambert incs financial involvement in the deal 
the court upheld a december ruling by us district judge a 
david mazzone who was ordered to lift the injunction once 
appropriate discloures are made 
mai basic has offered 20 a share for natickbased prime which 
is four times the size of its suitor 
william b patton mai basics president said the court 
explicitly stated what information needs to be provided 
once thats provided the injunction will be lifted said 
patton 
the court decision requires mai basic to provide drexel 
financial statements records of recent stock trading activity and 
identification of all drexelaffiliated officers and directors 
patton said the legal fight over mais bid for prime could prove 
moot after primes shareholders hold their annual meeting on may 12 
the whole thing is going to come down to a proxy fight 
anyway patton said in a telephone interview from california 
weve applied to the sec for approval and were expecting it any 
day after that the court actions become nothing more than legal 
jostling 
but prime spokesman joe gavaghan said the appeals court ruling 
affirmed the companys position that stockholders needed additional 
information to make an educated decision in the takeover battle 
basically we feel that the lower court decision being upheld 
will ultimately serve our shareholders in obtaining for them the 
additional information that weve argued needs to be disclosed 
here gavaghan said 
mazzone last month continued the order blocking mais bid while 
asking for additional information about how drexel burnham would 
finance the deal 
in january mai basic said officials at the new york firm were 
confident they could raise the 875 million to finance the takeover 
despite its guilty plea in a massive securities fraud settlement 
patton said wednesday that mai officials would work with drexel 
burnham to comply with the courts guidelines and disclose all 
pertinent documents

orders to us factories fell 23 percent in february the 
government said today in a report that added to a string of recent 
statistics suggesting economic growth has slowed 
the commerce department said orders for durable and nondurable 
manufactured goods dropped to a seasonally adjusted 2307 billion 
last month after declining 12 percent in january 
it was the biggest decline since a 36 percent drop last july 
and was consistent with a variety of other government reports on 
the economys performance last month that have pointed downward 
in reports wednesday the commerce department said new home 
sales and the index of leading economic indicators both declined in 
february 
the index the governments chief economic forecasting gauge 
fell 03 percent last month the biggest drop since july when the 
index slid 08 percent 
meanwhile sales of new singlefamily homes slumped 94 percent 
in february to the lowest level in more than a year analysts said 
further declines are expected as rising mortgage rates push more 
people out of the market 
sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626000 
after advancing 25 percent in january when unusually mild weather 
brought out more buyers 
the reports had little effect on the nations financial markets 
which expected the declines 
analysts said the declines were consistent with other recent 
signals that the economy may be losing steam welcome news to 
those who say growth must slow in order to keep inflation from 
spiraling 
this should reduce concern about the economy overheating 
while the decline is not sharp enough to give any signal of a 
recession said jerry jasinowski chief economist for the 
national association of manufacturers 
others however are concerned that the economy will slow too 
much and that the federal reserve boards yearlong campaign to 
raise interest rates and dampen inflationary pressures will stifle 
growth altogether 
the monetary tightening that we have experienced and some 
monetary tightening that is probably still to come are going to 
cause a downturn said economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch 
amp co in new york 
analysts blame the slow home sales pace on the pinch of higher 
mortgage interest rates which forced some lowerincome buyers out 
of the market 
the leading index designed to foretell economic activity six to 
nine months into the future advanced 06 percent in december and 
07 percent in january after vacillating during much of 1988 
in february eight of the 11 indicators that make up the leading 
index declined with the biggest negative factor a drop in 
manufacturer orders for new plants and equipment 
the other negative factors were a drop in building permits a 
decline in manufacturers orders for consumer goods a contraction 
in the money supply a dip in an index of consumer expectations an 
increase in initial claims for unemployment benefits faster vendor 
deliveries to companies signaling slower demand and a decline in 
manufacturers unfilled orders 
two indicators made positive contributions an increase in 
prices for raw materials indicating stronger demand and rising 
stock prices one indicator was unchanged last month the length of 
the average work week

the organization of arab petroleum exporting 
countries urged its member states thursday to invest in oil 
refining industries to meet new trends in world demand for oil 
products 
an oapec statement issued at the end of a threeday seminar on 
the arab refining industry affirmed the need to direct 
investment toward building new refining units in the arab countries 
that can process heavy highsulphur arab crudes and handle surplus 
fuel oil 
such investement will increase the marketing potential of arab 
producers since these crudes constitute a large portion of their 
oil reserves the statement said 
more than 100 delegates and oil experts from arab countries 
regional and international companies and organizations including 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries attended the 
meeting 
the kuwaitbased 11member oapec in which seven countries 
double as members of opec provides a forum for coordinating arab 
oil policies 
oapec members are kuwait saudi arabia qatar the united arab 
emirates iraq algeria libya bahrain syria tunisia and egypt 
the first seven are opec members 
the participants noted the share of light products in the total 
demand for oil was growing steadily and that there is a trend 
toward eliminating pollutants such as sulphur and lead from oil 
products in line with new environmental regulations in major 
markets

the environmental protection agency today 
added 101 sites in 33 states to its list of hazardous waste dumps 
that pose the greatest longterm threat to public health and the 
environment 
the additions bring to 1163 the number of waste sites eligible 
for federal funds under the epas 85 billion superfund 
cleanup program 
epa identifies and ranks the sites on its list according to 
health threats to nearby populations through contamination of 
groundwater surface water or air money for the cleanup fund comes 
from taxes mainly on the chemical industry 
the latest additions to the superfund list include garbage 
dumps refineries dry cleaners chemical dumps and a variety of 
manufacturing plants including a steel company tanning company 
paint works and a forest products company 
pennsylvania had the most sites 12 followed by new york with 
10 and michigan with seven 
of the total sites identified so far new jerseys 107 is the 
most for any state pennsylvania is second with 94 followed by 
california with 88 the list was started in 1983 
the epa has been under attack for years for the pace of cleanup 
under the superfund program which was created by congress in 
response to a series of dramatic toxic waste problems that surfaced 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
various congressional reports criticized the program last year 
resulting in congress cutting the cleanup budget by 175 million 
in a statement accompanying todays announcement that 101 sites 
had been added to the superfund list epa administrator william k 
reilly said he was trying to speed up the process 
the slow progress of superfund frustrates a lot of people i 
know he said it frustrates me at epa were looking at ways 
to speed up this process and to spur cleanups by responsible 
private parties including making expanded use of enforcement 
actions 
the latest additions to the cleanup priority list include eight 
federal facilities although superfund money cannot be used for 
cleanup on federal sites the epa said it had decided to put 
eligible sites on the list regardless of their regulatory status 
federal agencies and the military services are required to pay for 
hazardous waste site cleanups out of their own budgets 
the epa said that in addition to the eight federal sites added 
to the superfund list it has decided to extend the site area of 
the rocky mountain arsenal near denver which already was on the 
list the extension was made to include contaminants and releases 
from an area of the arsenal called basin f the agency said

spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez 
said thursday that spain intends to join the european monetary 
system in the near future 
a lot of time will not go by before this decision is made to 
join the ems he said 
the 10yearold system is a grid of eight european economic 
community currencies that by common agreement must move in bands 
between fixed upper and lower limits if they exceed the limits 
central banks must intervene or governments take monetary action 
gonzalez said it did not seem reasonable to expect a country 
to announce in advance precisely when its going to ask to enter 
the ems 
of the 12 eec currencies only the spanish peseta the british 
pound the greek drachma and the portuguese escudo are not part of 
the ems exchange rate mechanism 
spain has said it would join the ems several other times 
british prime minister margaret thatcher who has long been under 
pressure to join has said repeatedly she will do so when the 
time is right

opec ministers pledged today to stand by 
an agreement to slash production in the next three months as they 
wrapped up a twoday strategy session 
opec secretarygeneral subroto said a panel of eight ministers 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries renewed their 
intention to adhere very strictly in the apriljune quarter to 
a november pact to slash production 
the meeting was the organizations first formal review of the 
oil market since the accord which covers the first six months of 
the year 
the ministers addressed tactics for maintaining the surprising 
strength of the current market there had been indications some 
ministers ministers wanted to raise the production cap to keep oil 
prices from rising too fast 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh said everything is 
going very well everybody is satisfied with the current market 
stability 
diego tamariz the ecuadoran oil minister attending the talks as 
an observer said the discussions centered on the market situation 
and longterm strategy 
since the cartel agreed in november to slash production in the 
first half of this year prices have rallied unexpectedly reaching 
this week the opec benchmark of 18 a barrel 
with firming prices the ministers were already beginning to 
turn their attention to the output accord that will be hammered out 
in early june to cover the last half of the year 
the november arrangement called for the countries to limit their 
production to a total of 185 million barrels a day well under the 
level of last last year it also set the target price of 18 a 
barrel 
the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by the 
cartel reached 1801 a barrel tuesday the price is up more than 
5 a barrel since november 
the may contract price for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude was up 39 cents in early trading today to 
2059 cents a 42gallon barrel after rising 29 cents wednesday on 
the new york mercantile exchange 
the price the highest for the nearterm contract since august 
1987 was lifted partly by concern about the oil tanker spill off 
alaska on friday 
prices for west texas intermediate and north sea brent blend 
the most widely traded international crudes have climbed more than 
the middle eastern crudes offered by the opec countries 
the price surge has been linked to the reduction in opec 
production as well as unforeseen accidents in producing regions 
that have clipped supply demand also has been stronger than 
forecast 
subroto said the monitoring committee would meet several 
times many times before the june meeeting 
sabah indicated in a recent interview with the middle east 
economic survey that he would like the daily output cap lifted to 
20 million barrels in the last six months of the year 
asked wednesday about the interview he said it is my 
position but we are reasonable people we have to look at supply 
and demand and decide on that basis were going to look at the 
figures and then decide in june 
other ministers have been more cautious about urging changes in 
the accord several have insisted that the cartel must wait to see 
how the market acts in the apriljune quarter when prices 
generally weaken as demand slips with the coming of warmer weather 
in oil importing nations 
indepednent oil exporting nations including the soviet union 
have agreed to help opec in the second quarter by trimming their 
exports to a total of about 300000 barrels a day 
members of the monitoring committee are algeria indonesia 
iran iraq kuwait nigeria saudi arabia and venezuela 
other opec members are ecuador gabon libya qatar and the 
united arab emirates

in the neverending search for a strategy 
to beat wall street two professors and their partner have created 
an innovative investment fund they say could become a new york 
stock exchange trading leader 
the supertrust investment fund designed for all kinds of market 
conditions is the brainchild of university of californiaberkeley 
finance professors hayne leland and mark rubinstein and their 
associate john obrien 
the three principals of lor associates are better known as the 
fathers of portfolio insurance a hedging strategy that was 
supposed to protect institutional investors against market declines 
but fared poorly in the crash of oct 19 1987 
portfolio insurance in which traders sell stock index futures 
and options to reduce the impact of a falling market on their 
holdings was blamed by some for accelerating the crash lor 
managed more than 60 million in portfolio insurance before the 
crash and has since dropped to about 20 million 
to overcome some failings of portfolio insurance leland said 
he and his partners went to work developing the supertrust fund 
on oct 20 
the resulting fund would allow individual and institutional 
investors to tailor their investments to different objectives 
unlike portfolio insurance supertrust would be collateralized by 
underlying securities 
this is an idea that has been around for some time in very 
theoretical form leland said in an interview the problem was 
to engineer it to the point where we could bring it to the market 
supertrust is expected to be approved for listing by the 
securities and exchange commission in a few months it will be 
divided into two superunits one invested in stocks and the other 
in interestbearing securities 
the underlying assumption is that when the stock market falls 
interest rates tend to move higher and vice versa 
the stock superunit will be a fund of the standard amp poors 500 
index managed by wells fargo investment advisors it will be 
subdivided into two types of supershares appreciation shares that 
would do best if the stock market soars and index income shares 
that would do best if the market rises only moderately 
the other superunit will be a money market fund invested in 
shortterm highgrade securities mainly treasury bills this 
trust also will be split into money market income shares that would 
do best in a flat market and protection shares that would do best 
if the stock market falls 
what supertrust doesnt do is eliminate the need for investors 
to determine when to move from one fund to the other there also 
will be a charge for trading supershares about 25 percent for 
small accounts and 025 percent for large ones 
leland told analysts recently that supertrusts assets would 
have to be large enough to provide liquidity for institutional 
investors he estimated the assets could reach 2 billion to 10 
billion its first year 
supertrust might confuse some small investors and retail brokers 
initially some analysts said but it is already creating 
excitement among institutional investors 
i find it extremely fascinating said joel damon a vice 
president at bank of america who helps guide the investment of a 
850 million pension fund and 400 million savings plan i think 
its a well thought out strategy but its too early to tell if our 
pension fund can make use of these products 
it doesnt help provide you with a crystal ball but it does 
provide you with alternatives to the futures and options market for 
hedging your bet he said 
john dolanm of dolan capital management in menlo park calls 
supertrust sheer genius its going to change the way the world 
thinks about investing 
investors who lost money with portfolio insurance may avoid the 
supertrust dolan said but lor wont necessarily be selling to 
the same group of people theyll be selling this to people who 
werent sophisticated enough to buy portfolio insurance its much 
more straightforward the potential market will be much higher

after six months of saying it was only for 
universities steve jobs on thursday offered the general public a 
chance to buy his scholars workstation through the nations 
top retailer of desktop computers to business 
jobs said university officials nationwide had encouraged him to 
get his next computer system onto the retail market 
they told us they think weve got a revolutionary product but 
they said weve got to get it out into a broader market so their 
students will see it when they get into the workplace after 
graduating jobs said at one of his typically glitzy news 
conferences 
with the announcement jobs often described as a guru of the 
personal computer industry formally launched a race to capture a 
major market share of a new generation of computers machines that 
could revolutionize the industry and redefine personal computing 
jobs president of next inc and cofounder of apple computer 
inc confirmed at the news conference that a distribution deal had 
been signed with businessland inc which has 112 outlets and 
annual sales last year of 12 billion 
the agreement will give jobs palo altobased company greater 
visibility it will also speed up development of software and deal 
a blow to rival sun microsystems inc which had been negotiating 
with businessland and other resellers over the same distribution 
rights 
this deal is a major coup for both companies said jonathan 
seybold a leading computer industry expert it gives 
businessland an extremely attractive product and it gives next 
the premiere company for selling highend computer desktop systems 
to the public 
i think the industry has been frankly just stunned by this 
development because now its become clear jobs is a serious 
contender in the industry once again 
more than two dozen software developers also attended the news 
conference where they unveiled an array of programs that jobs says 
will make the next an incomparable office research and educational 
tool 
the businessland deal was particularly important for software 
developers because they view it as a move to put the machine into 
wide circulation thereby assuring a larger market for their 
programs which next needs if it hopes to set industry standards 
with its operating system and thereby establish itself as the 
industry leader 
jobs announced software development was already under way at 
several companies including adobe systems inc lotus development 
corp and sybase inc 
the retail price of his machine is expected to be between 
10000 and 12000 there was no immediate announcement of price 
jobs claimed last fall that his next computer initially would be 
sold exclusively to educators and students at a discounted price of 
6500 he said he would not venture immediately into the business 
market 
bruce lupatkin analyst for hambrecht amp quist inc in san 
francisco called that claim a smokescreen anybody who is 
awake would realize you couldnt build a big business in 
workstations and avoid selling to the corporate and technical 
market i dont believe it is a shift in strategy its a shift in 
tactics 
the worldwide market for generalpurpose and technical 
workstations highpowered desktop computers that range in cost 
from 8000 to 80000 is estimated at 4 billion and growing 
rapidly such machines give desktop users vastly improved abilities 
over standard personal computers particularly in visual displays 
speed and mathematical calculations 
next incs workstation is a sleek black magnesiumboxed 
computer which features an erasable optical disk drive that can 
hold about 200000 typewritten pages of information it is jobs 
first product since his 1985 ouster as chairman of apple computer 
inc which he cofounded in the 1970s in a garage

president bush today called the massive oil 
spill in alaskas prince william sound a major tragedy as his 
administration ruled out as counterproductive a federal takeover of 
cleanup operations 
the cleanup will not be easy bush said but as with 
other serious disasters we must and will work together at all 
levels public and private to remedy the damage thats been done 
and then to safeguard the precious environment for the future 
separately coast guard commandant paul yost said it was 
almost unbelievable that the supertanker exxon valdez could 
have gotten outside a 10mile wide shipping lane to run aground 
last friday 
obviously something went very badly wrong yost told a white 
house news briefing after he and two other senior federal officials 
reported to bush on their twoday factfinding trip to the site of 
the largest oil spill in us history 
the president referred to the accident in a speech to the 
association of community and junior colleges 
departing from his prepared text he called the 100mile long 
oil slick a subject of concern to all americans today 
theres no doubt this is a major tragedy both for the 
environment and for the people up there bush said he said the 
report from the three officials was not all negative but lets 
be frank there are some very serious problems up there right now 
this was not a treacherous area not treacherous in the area 
where they ran aground adm yost told reporters its 10 miles 
wide your children could drive a tanker up through it 
yost said allegations of alcohol use by the ships captain 
would be thoroughly investigated by the government 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said cleanup operations 
were now being well coordinated all of us are convinced that the 
effort after a somewhat slow start is going at full speed 
skinner said 
he said there was no need to federalize this effort and that 
such a move might be counterproductive bush had initially 
mentioned a federal takeover as one option 
environmental protection agency administrator william reilly 
called the spill the nations largest ever obviously a disaster 
of enormous magnitude 
he said it seems inevitable that there will be a very 
substantial impact particularly on the habitats of sea otters and 
sea lions 
however reilly said its too soon to say in any conclusive 
way what the impact on habitat or on the wildlife will be 
he said bush had directed that environmental and wildlife 
protection in the oncepristine sound be given top priority 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the officials 
would continue to monitor the cleanup from washington and would 
report back in 30 days with broader recommendations including 
possible options for longterm action 
skinner said exxon corp was making an allout effort but 
that the federal government would make sure that the corporation 
honored its commitments he declined to criticize exxon for its 
current efforts but said its initial response could have been 
quicker 
if we dont learn from this experience we are just not 
performing our job skinner said 
he said most of the damage was done in the first few hours after 
the 978foot tanker ran around spilling more than 10 million 
gallons of crude oil into the once pristine sound 
the transportation secretary said the tanker was moving at a 
brisk 15 knots when it ran into the reef well outside the regular 
navigation channel 
the three officials met with bush for about 45 minutes then 
spoke with reporters in the white house briefing room 
skinner said alaska gov steve cowper told the federal team 
that the effort is now going forward at the correct pace exxon 
the state and the federal government were working well together 
he said the prospect of a federal takeover of the cleanup will

indicting junk bond whiz michael r milken on 
racketeering charges could speed settlement of a wideranging 
securities fraud case against his exbosses but defense lawyers 
call the racketeering attack an abuse of prosecutorial powers 
a 98count federal grand jury indictment claims the drexel 
burnham lambert inc financier his brother and associate bruce l 
newberg schemed with former speculator ivan boesky and others to 
defraud clients and investors through a range of securities laws 
violations 
the three face huge prison terms forfeiture of 18 billion in 
personal assets and total fines of more than 11 billion under the 
federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
established in 1970 principally to combat organized crime but now 
increasingly used to prosecute whitecollar criminals 
i think it is outrageous to use rico in a circumstance like 
this said said michael armstrong an attorney for lowell milken 
they applied the statute to behavior which for the most part has 
not been considered even to be criminal much less the subject of a 
racketeering indictment 
the indictment says milken and the others made 244 million in 
illegal fees and profits by cheating clients through insider 
trading stock manipulation and parking schemes that conceal 
the true ownership of securities 
some of the alleged illegal trades were used in mergers or 
takeovers and to control financial markets for personal gain the 
indictment says 
charges against milken 42 who almost singlehandedly created 
the present 175 billion highyield bond industry are expected to 
help resolve separate civil and criminal charges against drexel 
said one defense lawyer who asked not to be named 
negotiations between drexel and the securities and exchange 
commission to settle civil fraud charges including insider 
trading deadlocked earlier this month when the firm balked at a 
requirement that it fire milken before resolving the claims 
with the indictment drexel placed milken on leave from the 
firm apparently rendering the issue moot once the sec settlement 
is signed drexel is to plead guilty to six felonies and pay 650 
million to settle criminal fraud charges brought by the justice 
department 
at issue in each case is the use of racketeering statutes and 
government power to obtain cooperation from defendants in the 
prosecution of drexel and milken 
drexel has said publicly it agreed to settle the criminal 
charges to avoid a racketeering indictment that could have frozen 
its multibilliondollar assets and crippled its operations 
as part of the pact the nations fifthlargest brokerage house 
agreed to fire milken and withhold his 1988 pay estimated at up to 
200 million 
in the sec deal the government reportedly wants to bar milken 
from the firm for life and prohibit drexel employees from talking 
business with him 
the 110page indictment handed up wednesday parallels last 
septembers sec complaint and the governments racketeering 
indictment of princetonnewport lp a defunct investment 
partnership a month earlier newberg a former drexel trader was 
charged in the case set for trial june 5 
in that case also cited in the milken charges 
princetonnewport allegedly sold securities to drexel to conceal 
their ownership and claim losses for tax purposes parking isnt 
illegal but the government is seeking to prove it violates 
securities laws if conducted with fraudulent intent 
indictments of other drexel employees are expected and the grand 
jury investigating the firm still is calling witnesses defense 
lawyers contend the milken charges are aimed at pressuring other 
potential defendants to cooperate and avoid charges 
they shouldnt be using indictments as leverage in their 
publicity campaigns and trying to induce people to talk one 
defense lawyer said 
a major point of contention promises to be the governments 
attempt to seize under the rico law 37 billion from each of the 
defendants twice the total amount of their salaries stock 
holdings and other compensation from 1984 through 1987 plus 
interest 
the indictment says milken amassed more than 1 billion in the 
four years including 550 million in 1987 compensation as head of 
drexels beverly hills califbased junk bond division partly due 
to his relationship with boesky 
it maintains all money made by the men through illict trades 
or not is tainted because it constitutes the proceeds of their 
unlawful schemes and their interest in the racketeering enterprise 
charged drexel is considered the racketeering enterprise and 
michael milken its leader

the bitter battle over ownership of the famous 
harrods department store broke out anew thursday when lonrho plc 
published a special edition of its newspaper the observer 
detailing what it said was a government report on an investigation 
into the matter 
the government moved quickly to block the special edition which 
was devoted entirely to the longrunning dispute between lonrho and 
the egyptian alfayed brothers it obtained a high court order 
against its distribution at midday thursday 
paul spicer a lonrho director said the british conglomerate 
probably would contest the injunction claiming that it was in the 
public interest to publish the report which the government so far 
has withheld 
mohamed alfayed who heads the retail chain house of fraser 
plc harrods owner told british broadcasting corp television 
however much tiny rowland lonrhos managing director abuses his 
ownership of the observer he will never own harrods 
donald trelford editor of the weekly observer denied that the 
newspaper was being used by its proprietor 
the egyptian alfayed brothers purchased house of fraser in 1985 
for 615 million pounds 103 billion after lonrhos repeated 
attempts to buy it were thwarted by the monopolies and mergers 
commission 
since then lonrho has waged a campaign against the alfayeds to 
have the takeover reversed 
a department of trade and industry inquiry into the alfayeds 
ownership of house of fraser began in april 1987 but the results 
have not been published the trade department says it has withheld 
its report at the request of the serious fraud office which is 
investigating the affair 
lonrho has repeatedly alleged that the alfayeds made a series 
of false representations about their wealth and their origins to 
make their bid allegations which the alfayeds deny 
the observer normally published on a sunday was due to be 
issued at noon thursday and included what it claimed were long 
extracts from the department of trade and industry report on the 
matter 
the observer printed 250000 copies but 10 minutes before the 
16page paper was due to hit the streets the trade department was 
granted an injunction by high court justice tudor evans against 
lonrho and the observer 
the department of trade and industry called american news 
organizations including the associated press saying the 
injunction applied to them 
lonrho chairman sir edward du cann told shareholders at their 
annual meeting in london thursday i cannot understand why 
the department of trade and industry is continuing to try and hush 
this up 
trelford the observers editor defended the decision to 
publish the special edition 
it was my idea trelford told bbc television adding that 
the government report was a major scoop which couldnt wait until 
the regular sunday publication of the newspaper 
the injunction did not prevent the special edition from getting 
out lonrho distributed copies of it to its shareholders at their 
meeting before the injunction was granted and afterward some 
newsagents still were selling it

a federal judge in miami on thursday considered whether to order 
pilots back to work at strikecrippled eastern airlines while the 
board of the companys parent texas air corp met to mull buyout 
plans for the airline 
eastern lawyers returned to court seeking to force pilots back 
to work after almost four weeks of a strike arguing that the 
pilots union was illegally using the walkout to change its contract 
but the pilots told us district judge edward b davis they 
joined the machinists on march 4 in a legal sympathy walkout 
because they feared that texas air chairman frank lorenzo would 
destroy both unions as he had at easterns sister carrier 
continental airlines in 1983 
it was unclear when davis would make a decision 
in houston texas airs headquarters its directors gathered for 
what was expected to be a crucial meeting 
they were considering a 500 million offer for eastern from 
outgoing baseball commissioner peter v ueberroth who has garnered 
union support in recent days as one of two leading contenders for 
the airline sources close to the situation said 
the status of a longawaited bid for eastern from the second 
contender takeover strategist and twa owner carl icahn wasnt 
immediately clear 
developer donald trump meanwhile pressed ahead in negotiations 
to buy easterns northeast air shuttle despite a possible 
competing bid from america west airlines of phoenix 
trump agreed in october to buy the shuttle from eastern for 365 
million but he told texas air last week that the strike against 
eastern had lowered the shuttles value and that he would reduce 
his offer by about 125 million 
texas air countered by telling trump it would look for other 
buyers of the hourly service which links new york with boston and 
washington 
trump appeared willing to pay an amount close to his original 
365 million offer but also is looking to increase the number of 
planes included in the deal from 17 to 20 or 21 sources said 
america west the nations 10thlargest carrier recently 
expressed interest in the eastern shuttle said the sources who 
requested anonymity 
under terms of the america west offer current employees of 
eastern would be excluded from working for the shuttle after it was 
sold to the phoenixbased carrier the sources said 
trump on the other hand has recognized easterns unions as 
valid bargaining representatives for future shuttle employees he 
has said he plans to negotiate separate agreements with them 
america west is mainly interested in the shuttles landing slots 
in the three cities and in purchasing boeing 757s from eastern to 
augment its fleet the sources said trumps agreement with texas 
air calls for him to buy 17 smaller and older boeing 727s but the 
sources noted that none of those planes are specifically attached 
to the shuttle service 
america west spokesman dick shimizu declined thursday to comment 
directly on the shuttle and reiterated the statement made by a 
spokeswoman late wednesday america west has an interest in 
certain assets or opportunities that might be available in the 
eastern situation 
any offers for eastern or its shuttle would have to be approved 
by the us bankruptcy court in new york where eastern filed for 
protection from creditors on march 9 
neal mann the assistant us trustee helping administer the 
eastern bankruptcy said us trustee harold jones doesnt expect 
to select an examiner in the case before monday 
us bankruptcy court judge burton lifland recently ordered the 
appointment of an examiner for eastern with sweeping powers to 
mediate the bitter dispute between the airline and its unions and 
to review easterns finances

a criminal indictment against the man who led 
drexel burnham lambert incs junk bond operations to the top of 
the heap is considered unlikely to stir the multibilliondollar 
market in those securities but some say it gives competitors an 
added edge against the firm 
because the governments action against 42yearold michael 
milken had long been expected nobody really cares one trader 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said thursday 
prices of highyield lowrated bonds were little changed to 
slightly higher in quiet dealing the day after a federal grand jury 
indicted milken and two others on 98 counts of racketeering and 
fraud 
traders contacted seemed more interested to learn that milkens 
salary topped 1 billion between 1984 and 1987 than to ponder the 
market impact of the charges 
the nonchalant reaction was reminiscent of how the market 
shrugged off news last december that drexel agreed to admit guilt 
to six felonies and pay a record 650 million fine to settle 
sweeping government securities fraud charges unrelated to its junk 
bond operations 
it also seemed to indicate how the market for lowrated 
highyield corporate debt securities which drexel almost 
singlehandedly expanded into a 180 billion industry has become 
an institution that can weather the storm 
under milkens guidance drexel exploited the gigantic us 
corporate appetite for financing by using junk bonds so called 
because they carry a greater risk of default than highergrade 
investment quality paper as a means of borrowing money to pay for 
deals ranging from mergers and hostile takeovers to corporate 
expansions 
junk bonds formerly were used primarily by borrowers with weak 
credit ratings or scanty earning histories 
experts say drexel has carved a niche so substantial that it 
will continue doing well in the junk bond market 
last year drexel issued 1159 billion in new junk bonds 
giving it 41 percent of that market according to securities data 
co milkens department is believed to have generated more than 
half of the firms profits 
there is lingering speculation that some drexel clients who feel 
particularly loyal to milken will take their business elsewhere 
they might feel drexel treated him too harshly one trader said 
under its settlement with the government drexel agreed to fire 
milken and deny him his 1988 bonus although the firm continues to 
pay milkens legal fees drexel placed milken on a leave of absence 
following the indictment 
sources said some clients are establishing relationships with 
other junk bond issuers as a hedge against possible future problems 
involving drexel 
and those other players are out courting business 
john moran a trader with advest inc said a number of 
investment firms have built up tremendously over the past six or 
seven months anybody who wanted to compete with drexel decided 
to do that when the whole scandal broke more than two years ago 
when the no 1 people are in trouble it gets the others 
running in the door faster it gives the others an edge he 
said 
in the 1989 first quarter drexel for the first time was 
supplanted by goldman sachs amp co as the no 1 new junkbond 
underwriter 
drexels 800 million in sales ranked fourth with a 16 percent 
share of the market down from 175 billion and a 43 percent share 
in the yearago quarter goldman sachs firstquarter share totaled 
125 billion or 25 percent according to figures from securities 
data 
other major players in the junk bond market include merrill 
lynch capital markets prudentialbache securities inc and first 
boston corp 
but drexel is likely to recapture its lead in the second 
quarter the firm has yet to repackage about 5 billion in junk 
bonds that financed the megabuyout of rjr nabisco inc those 
issues should be coming to market in the next few months 
other firms may have issues in the private market that 
eventually will go public but its nothing like a 5 billion 
deal said fran wissak an assistant vice president at securities 
data 
and there seems to be little concern that the market will have 
anything but a healthy appetite for the nabisco issue 
theyve already done their road show and i understand theyve 
done a good job trying to generate interest in the issue among 
investors wissak said

it sounds like something from a hollywood 
script an actor turned takeover strategist wrests control of a 
movie company away from its founder 
thats what tim matheson better known as the philandering 
fratbrother otter in animal house has done with national 
lampoon inc which produced the 1978 hit film and publishes 
national lampoon magazine 
matheson and partner daniel grodnik dont see themselves in the 
same vein as carl icahn or ronald perelman the takeover 
strategists who respectively bought trans world airlines and revlon 
inc 
we want to build a company grodni in an interview with 
matheson chiming in a significant entment company 
yet the pair won national lh some triedandtrue methods of 
corporate acquisition perhaps because they were schooled by david 
batchelder exadviser to another renowned takeover strategist t 
boone pickens jr 
matheson and grodnik an independent film producer hankered for 
their own movie company after they coproduced the film blind 
fury 
they retained batchelder telling him they wanted to raise 50 
million to form a production company 
buttchelder said it made more sense to buy an existing company 
rat a lesson many corporate acquirers and entrepreneurs have 
learned 
grodnik quoted batche the pair just find a company that has 
an operating history that you feel is undervalued inrketplace 
they settled on moneylosing nl lampoon whose stock price was 
languishing at around 250 a 
was it a coincidence they chose the producer of animal house 
not entirely it l of our needs and purposes matheson said 
it was the best company that we came up with 
with batchrs help grodnik and matheson persuaded nine national 
lampoon stockholders to assign the pair their voting rights these 
stockholders had bouat 7 or 8 a share grodnik said and they 
wanted some relief 
the agreements gave the pair control over 185 percent of the 
stock and a 3 percent stake they bought boosted the figure to 215 
pe 
at that point late last year they approached national lampoon 
founder and chairman matty simmons and said they wanted to join the 
companys management grodnik matheson and simmons downplayed any 
resemblance betw and a classic takeover fight 
it wasnt simmons said in an interview 
but matheson acknowledged that it was a surprise to simmons 
that we ch over 215 percent of the voting stock and that it 
took some pressure to move the national n founder 
it became very obvious to him that were not g matheson said 
adding that their voting stake became irresistible we had 
this critical m of support 
simmons may have balked at first but he say the idea came 
from me of them buying my stoand taking over the management of the 
company 
simmons said he was tired of trying to run the movie producin 
california and the magazine in new york and wanted to concentrate 
on filmmaking so he soldercent stake march 16 to grodnik and 
matheson at 6 a share or corporate acquirers the men who now 
control national lampoon must try to turne business around 
national lampgazine known for salacious humor after its founding 
in 1970 has lost readers over the years 
the company needs direction money and management 
grodntheson and grodnik admit they have little experience with 
magazines but with an injection of outside capital which 
batchelder will arrange they want to hire people who can revive 
the magazines former glory 
the magazines alnown as the cutting edge of comedy in 
america said matheson but the proper attention wasnt paid to 
staythe cutting edge 
would they sell the magazine or other national lampoon assets 
no way said matheson 
were not in here to do a kohlberg kravis roberts were going 
to piece this thing apart and sell if off he said referring to 
the investment firm that has financed multibillion dollar takeovers 
partly through the sale of corporate assets 
grodnik said he expected that the movie company will 
strengthen the magazine and the magazine will strengthen the movie 
company 
among the people working on movies for national lampoon 11 are 
in development is matty simmons 
national lampoon will continue mady films under its flagship 
label but grodnik and matheson als want to do more serious 
pictures and action movies 
well come up with our own version of the touchstone label 
said matheson referring to the walt disney co division that has 
produced hits like good morning vietnam and ed roger rabbit 
noting that they already have production experience matheson 
and grodnik sound confidl succeed 
what were doing here is not unlike any busineto try the 
business end of movies clint eastwood and michael douglas are 
producers and he rejects the suggactor may not be qualified to 
run a business 
41 started in the entertainment business 30 years ago as a 
child actor in television he appeared in leave it to beaver 
and was a regular on the virginian bonanza and other shows 
besides animal house his movie credits include the mel 
brooks film to be or not to be 
he turned to production with blind fury and last year did an 
abc comedy sies just in time he also starred in the t show 
playing a magazine publisher 
grodnik 36 said he has always been an entrepreneur starting 
in childhood by selling soda and moving on to setting up high 
school dances ski trips and concerts 
at the university of southern california he studied film and 
found that producing a movie wasnt that different from putting on 
a concert 
matheson and grodnik met eight years ago and began working on 
the pro became blind fury 
we worked so well together said matheson so tey made the 
partnership permanent and started on the road that brought the 
ack to national lampoon

more brandname products and shifted to everyday low pricing 
thursdays announcement calls for streamlining the merchandise 
group which is structured horizontally with an everwidening 
chain of commmand 
the goal is creation of six crisp new operations with direct 
reporting and accountability from the retail store to the group 
vice president in applianceselectronics home fashions home 
improvement womens apparel menschildrens apparel and 
automotive the company said 
i think what is necessary for sears to be competitive 
given the change in pricing structure is to reduce cost of the 
operation and this a step in that direction said analyst joseph 
ronning with brown brothers harriman inc in new york 
each of these businesses in sears stores will report directly 
to a district manager for that distinct business who will be 
accountable for customer service sales and profits in 10 stores 
and report to a region manager for that business said michael 
bozic chairman and chief executive officer of sears merchandise 
group 
the new structure will allow us to better execute the 
strategies that will make us more competitive and more 
profitable bozic said 
the reorganization takes away the old structure and makes a 
leaner company one that has more room for profit improvement 
said analyst walter loeb of morgan stanley amp co in new york 
the merchandise groups restructuring effective aug 1 will 
eliminate numerous field offices including the 24 regional 
administrative offices that oversee sears 824 stores under the 
current system ten regional locations will be retained to provide 
support to retail store operations 
the new field operation will operate with about 800 fewer 
management positions than the current system with 7700 such jobs 
the company said 
no layoffs are anticipated said sears spokesman ernest arms 
citing attrition and reorganization incentives that include a 
salary continuation plan and early retirement benefits 
a similar restructuring of a sears headquarters organization is 
under way on a departmentbydepartment basis bozic said and is 
to be completed this year 
speculation about the sale of the 110story sears tower 
continued thursday with reports that sears had moved back its 
schedule and was seeking a sale in four years instead of two 
but arms said the twoyear timetable had been just an example in 
documents for perspective buyers 
were not being coy we just dont know he said first 
weve got to determine where it is were going 
all but 600 of the 7400 sears workers in the tower are to be 
relocated and the company is being wooed by several states though 
weve expressed the desire to remain in the chicago area arms 
said 
sears prospectus does not mention a price the wall street 
journal quoted unidentified industry sources thursday as saying 
sears is asking 11 billion to 13 billion the most ever asked 
for a us office building

steve jobs jumped back into the commercial 
computer market on thursday by announcing that his fast 
highpowered next workstation will be sold at retail stores 
nationwide 
weve found that this machine is going to be the computer for 
the 1990s said david norman president of businessland inc 
which will exclusively distribute the next computer system at its 
112 outlets 
businessland which had 12 billion in sales last year is the 
nations biggest retailer for desktop computers for businesses 
industry members characterized the deal as a major coup for jobs 
3yearold company founded after he was ousted as president of 
apple computer inc in 1985 
in one fell swoop jobs has come up with a clean 
highquality professional distribution network that is the envy of 
everyone at the very least its a nice first move for a new 
company said wood lotz president of michiganbased absoft 
which also unveiled its nextcompatible software 
the computer system which includes an erasable opticaldisk 
drive with storage compacity for 200000 typewritten pages will 
sell for 9995 it was offered to universities for 6500 
since unveiling the sleek computer in a blackmagnesium case six 
months ago jobs has maintained he would sell initially only to 
universities 
but at a glitzy news conference on an enclosed pier on san 
francisco bay jobs said school officials across the country 
encouraged him to get his system onto the retail market nearly a 
year earlier than he had planned 
they told us they think weve got a revolutionary product but 
they said weve got to get it out into a broader market so their 
students will see it when they get into the workplace after 
graduating jobs said 
the worldwide market for general purpose and technical 
workstations highpowered desktop computers that range in cost 
from 8000 to 80000 is estimated at 4 billion and growing 
rapidly such machines give desktop users vastly improved abilities 
over standard personal computers particularly in visual displays 
speed and mathematical calculations 
the market is expected to reach 20 billion by the early 1990s 
and major semiconductor and computer manufacturers are jockeying 
for a share 
analysts say jobs move is a big step toward carving out a major 
role for his company in the field of computers that use american 
telephone amp telegraph cos unix operating system software 
jobs predicted the nexts unixbased operating system will 
become standard in the industry because of its speed power and 
versatility 
analysts hailed the businessland deal for giving jobs palo 
altobased company greater visibility speeding up development of 
software and dealing a blow to rival sun microsystems inc which 
also had been negotiating for distribution with businessland 
next is now openly competing against players in the broad 
desktop marketplace and i believe for that market theyve created 
a machine that is extremely attractive said jonathan seybold a 
leading industry expert 
in response to some criticism there is comparatively little 
software available for the next seybold said that should be 
expected from a machine on the leading edge of technology 
jobs also announced software development is already under way at 
several companies including adobe systems inc lotus development 
corp and sybase inc some 15 other companies demonstrated programs 
already written for the next after the news conference 
the next is jobs first product since he left apple computer 
inc which he cofounded in the 1970s in a garage 
over the last three months jobs said 1000 computers have been 
shipped from nexts fully robotic factory in fremont calif to 
more than 60 of the countrys major universities

a group of us corporations on thursday signed a wideranging 
agreement with the soviet union setting the framework for new joint 
ventures worth up to 10 billion over 20 years 
the group calling itself the american trade consortium has 
been negotiating for a year to complete the deal with the soviet 
foreign economic consortium which establishes a legal and business 
framework for the development of joint ventures between the groups 
the us consortium consists of giant food processer archer 
daniels midland co chevron corp eastman kodak co personal 
products maker johnson johnson rjr nabisco inc and the 
mercator corp a banking concern 
some of the possible joint ventures that now will be negotiated 
include oilseed processing manufacture of computer discs 
production of crackers cereals tobacco products and sweeteners 
and oil and gas exploration 
but although at least one member of the atc indicated it was 
moving ahead with talks to set up joint ventures several major 
hurdles remain 
additionally one original member of the group ford motor co 
dropped out of the consortium saying there had not been enough 
progress to warrant its continued participation 
a significant issue is the repatriation of profits from the 
soviet union which has been a key obstacle in previous attempts by 
western companies to do business there the soviet ruble is not 
convertible and any profits earned in rubles are worthless outside 
the country 
james h giffen president of the american group said in an 
announcement from moscow that thursdays agreement resolves that 
issue in principle but he declined to provide details 
feasibility studies will be conducted over the next year and 
giffen said the first of some 25 joint ventures could strt up 
within 18 months 
kodak indicated it was negotiating seven joint ventures to 
market cameras film and other photographic products and to process 
photographic film other ventures would sell computer discs and a 
blood analyzer 
ford had planned to begin selling west germanmade scorpio 
automobiles in the soviet union by the end of this year later the 
company hoped to begin an automobile manufacturing project in the 
soviet city of gorky where the gorky auto works is making cars in 
a plant built with fords help in the 1920s 
although there was progress the framework of understandings 
reached so far between the atc and the soviets was not sufficient 
to make feasible a project of the scope and complexity of fords 
said philip benton president of fords automotive group 
ford spokesman al chambers declined to say how much money ford 
had spent on the project 
at a later date when the environment for doing business in 
the ussr is better defined it may be possible to complete such a 
major project benton said in a prepared statement released in 
detroit in those circumstances we would certainly welcome the 
opportunity to participate

the dollar finished lower thursday as the 
federal reserve stormed into the foreign exchange market selling 
dollars to squelch the currencys rally 
gold prices slipped in new york after rising overseas republic 
national bank of new york quoted a late bid of 38155 for a troy 
ounce of gold down slightly from wednesdays late bid of 38180 
the dollar advanced in early trading in response to rising oil 
prices said jack barbanel an analyst with gruntal amp co inc 
the fed entered the market several times selling small amounts 
of dollars but the us currency continued its climb 
however in midafternoon with the dollar at a peak for the day 
of about 13450 japanese yen the fed made what barbanel called a 
massive intervention selling dollars for west german marks and 
japanese yen 
the fed when they really mean what they say intervenes in 
stages that over time become more sizable said barbanel 
west german and japanese officials dont want to see the 
dollar gaining any more strength and the fed acted in response to 
those countries wishes barbanel said 
traders took the hint and sold the dollar down against other 
currencies as well 
the dollar ended the day in new york falling to 18910 west 
german marks from late wednesdays 18934 marks it slipped to 
13200 japanese yen from wednesdays 133115 yen 
what the dollar does next depends on whether the intervention 
continues friday barbanel said 
however another factor that could affect the currency markets 
is a possible hike in the japanese discount rate which was rumored 
to be in the offing barbanel said 
a hike in the key japanese interest rate would likely be 
followed by increases in west german and british rates that would 
boost those currencies and cause the dollar to decline 
overseas dealers described thursdays trading as nervous 
following intervention by central banks over several days 
theres very little going on people dont know what they want 
to do said one dealer at a west german bank 
in london one british pound cost 16875 late thursday more 
expensive for buyers than wednesdays 16870 in new york trading

deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the fed in february reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 
3 percent to 7 percent growth in m2 and 35 percent to 75 percent 
growth in m3 the fed has not set a target for m1 growth since 
early 1987

general motors corp on thursday announced a 
buyer incentive package featuring 29 percent financing and cash 
rebates a day after ford motor co began offering a similar 
program 
like ford gm indicated the new package was mandated partly by 
the recent rise in other kinds of interest rates including 
adjustable rate home mortgages that have slowed consumer spending 
on big ticket items such as cars and trucks 
chrysler corp which has a program featuring 49 percent 
financing on some auto loans did not immediately indicate it would 
match the cutrate deals 
in addition to 29 percent financing which is good only on 
twoyear loans gm said it was offering cash rebates ranging from 
300 to 1500 depending on model fords rebates range from 300 
to 4000 per vehicle 
the incentive programs offered by each of the big three have 
sliding scales for lowinterest financing with rates decreasing 
for shorterterm loans rate ford and gm offer 99 percent 
financing on fiveyear loans while chryslers package calls for a 
109 percent rate on a 60month loan 
gms new incentives take effect friday and expire june 5 fords 
new program took effect wednesday and is to end may 31 chryslers 
current program runs indefinitely 
the move toward lower financing rates comes as the automakers 
watch early 1989 sales fall below expectations through march 20 
this years vehicle sales by the eight companies making cars in 
north america were running 54 percent behind last years pace 
monthly sales figures for march are due out next week 
on wednesday ford lowered its 1989 sales forecast to about 15 
million cars and light trucks down from a 154 million vehicle 
estimate made less than two months ago 
at the same time production by the nations big three 
automakers have been keeping up with ambitious schedules and 
inventories of unsold vehicles have been hovering around the 80day 
level 
one way to trim large inventories is to offer incentives 
although manufacturers pay for such programs out of their own 
profits the prospect that automakers will have to offer bigger and 
bigger incentives to buyers has some analysts raising the prospect 
that earnings reports for the first half of this year could be 
lower than initially expected 
ford and gm also were attempting to use their new incentives to 
encourage buyers to take shorter term loans both automakers have 
dropped their rate on fourtyear loans to 69 percent from 89 
percent 
about half of the loans written by big three automakers have 
fiveyear terms which have contributed to an increasing rate of 
loan defaults and repossessions

opec ministers winding up a twoday 
strategy session thursday indicated cartel members planned to stick 
to their current production restraints through midyear but said 
there were proposals to loosen the curbs later 
subroto secretarygeneral of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries said the meeting of the cartels eightmember 
monitoring committee was held in a very frank good atmosphere 
but declined to provide details 
the ministers he said renewed their intention to adhere very 
strictly in the apriljune quarter to last novembers agreement 
that called for production curbs in order to raise sagging crude 
prices 
prices since then have risen by more than 5 a barrel for opec 
crudes and before the meetings there were indications some 
ministers wanted to consider raising the production limit for the 
second half of 1989 to keep prices from rising too sharply 
iraqs oil minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi when asked by 
reporters if he expected opec to raise its output limits said 
well this is one of the proposals that has been put forward 
he declined to elaborate 
the meeting was the organizations first formal review of the 
oil market since the accord which covers the first six months of 
the year 
the supply cuts combined with greater demand and accidents in 
producing areas have driven the price of a basket of opec crudes 
to the cartels benchmark of 18 a barrel 
in futures trading the may contract for west texas 
intermediate the benchmark us crude closed up 61 cents thursday 
at 2081 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange that level 
is more than 7 higher than the twoyear lows reached last october 
crude prices were boosted somewhat thursday by indications there 
could be further supply problems stemming from the major oil spill 
at valdez alaska 
analysts say most of the 13 opec nations have curtailed 
production to try to meet the cartels daily output cap of 185 
million barrels in the first six months of the year 
the key violator analysts say has been the united arab 
emirates 
but subroto announced that abu dhabi which accounts for about 
twothirds of uae production planned to limit output to 850000 
barrels a day in march it has been producing an estimated 1 
million barrels daily compared with its quota of 988000 barrels 
the promise he said is a good sign of the willingness of 
everybody to adhere to the agreement 
opec says 12 nations supplied 174 million barrels of oil a day 
to the world market in february compared with the ceiling of 1751 
million barrels for the dozen 
the united arab emirates was not included because it did not 
supply figures to the cartel 
subroto said the ministers discussed a variety of topics 
covering shortterm and longterm issues confronting the oil market 
this weeks talks laid groundwork for opecs june meeting when 
ministers will discuss an accord for the second half of this year 
kuwaits oil minister sheik ali khalifa alsabah suggested in 
a recent interview that the cartel should boost its production cap 
15 million barrels a day to a total of 20 million barrels in the 
last six months of the year 
but other ministers have said they wanted to see how prices 
perform in the second quarter normally weaker than the 
januarymarch period with the coming of warmer weather in oil 
importing nations 
subroto said demand for oil in the second half of 1989 will 
be increasing 
subroto said the ministers would have many contacts with each 
other before june but he said there was no decision to convene 
the monitoring committee before then 
before thursdays formal talks the ministers met privately in 
their rooms at a luxury hotel 
independent oil exporting nations have agreed to help opec in 
the second quarter by snipping their exports a total of about 
300000 barrels a day 
members of the monitoring committee are algeria indonesia 
iran iraq kuwait nigeria saudi arabia and venezuela 
other opec members are ecuador gabon libya qatar and the 
united arab emirates

the kroger co said thursday that if there are 
no more objections it will proceed with a courtapproved 
settlement of a classaction suit by shareholders who challenged 
the 46 billion restructuring the company announced last september 
under the settlement the cincinnatibased grocery company will 
pay 1275 million in attorneys fees to about 20 law firms around 
the nation which represented the suits plaintiffs 
kroger also agreed in the settlement to make changes in the way 
employee shares are voted in its worker benefit and compensation 
plans and to amend terms of debentures it issued to about 60000 
shareholders as part of the restructuring 
the changes include shortening the maturity date by two years 
altering procedures for redeeming the debentures and providing 
procedures in which employees can vote their shares in benefit 
plans confidentially 
hamilton county common pleas judge william mathews conducted a 
hearing earlier this month to allow lawyers for kroger and the 
shareholders to comment on the settlement which was proposed jan 
24 mathews approved the settlement tuesday and kroger announced 
its details thursday 
anyone who wants to appeal mathews ruling must do so within 30 
days 
cincinnati lawyer gene mesh who represented several dissident 
stockholders who objected to the settlement was out of his office 
thursday when a telephone call was placed to ask whether he would 
file an appeal 
kroger which operates supermarkets and convenience stores in 
much of the nation began the restructuring in part to fend off 
takeover bids last fall by dart group inc of landover md and by 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co of new york city kroger defeated the 
takeover bids but has since sold assets including some stores and 
food processing plants and laid off 300 of its 800 headquarters 
employees last october

as officials from 151 nations began arriving 
for pivotal discussions on third world debt secretary of state 
james a baker iii warned latin american leaders thursday that they 
must make economic reforms to participate in the administrations 
new debt reduction program 
baker said the bush administration stood ready to negotiate 
debtreduction packages on a casebycase basis as long as the 
debtor countries accepted responsibility to make payments on their 
reduced debt and to make internal reforms 
baker a former treasury secretary who crafted the debt approach 
followed by the reagan administration said that there was no 
magic solution to the 12 trillion debt crisis which has left 
developing nations facing mounting problems of economic and 
political unrest 
democratic governments must try to reform bloated 
statedominated economies service their debt and satisfy the real 
needs of their citizens baker said in atlanta at a conference on 
latin america hosted by former presidents carter and ford 
we understand that facing this challenge alone is a nearly 
impossible juggling act baker told the gathering it included 
the president of venezuela a nation where 270 persons were killed 
in rioting last month sparked by a new austerity program 
implemented to please that nations creditors 
as you move forward to take the necessary but difficult steps 
to restructure and reform your economies we must be prepared to 
hear your calls for help said baker he urged a new bond of 
cooperation and mutual responsibility between the united states 
and the countries of latin america 
bakers comments came as the administration stepped up efforts 
to sell its new debt reduction proposals which were unveiled on 
march 10 by treasury secretary nicholas brady 
the administrations plan will come under global scrutiny at 
meetings beginning friday of the 151nation international monetary 
fund and its sister lending organization the world bank 
both of the large lending organizations have a role to play in 
the new initiative which is being called the brady plan and the 
administration is hoping to get general approval of the new policy 
approach by the time the sessions end next tuesday 
under the new plan commercial banks would be asked to forgive 
voluntarily a portion of the loans they have made to poor nations 
in return the imf and world bank would provide assurances that the 
remaining debt would be repaid 
the administration has estimated that over the next three years 
its proposals could result in wiping out about 70 billion of the 
340 billion in debt owed by 39 developing nations a group which 
includes all of the largest debtors and many of the smaller ones 
the debt strategy represents a major aboutface for the united 
states which under the baker plan rejected all proposals for 
broadbased debt forgiveness and instead emphasized obtaining new 
lending for poor nations 
while not admitting that his approach had failed to generate the 
hopedfor new loans to spur growth baker said clearly latin 
america must begin to grow again and the fruits of that growth must 
be more widely shared 
at the white house officials announced that venezuelas 
president carlos andres perez and el salvadors president alfredo 
cristiani both newly elected would meet with president bush in 
the next week 
perez who has taken a leadership role in the latin american 
debt crisis said at the atlanta conference that the 
administrations new debt plan offered hope for the regions 
troubled democracies which he said were facing unsustainable 
pressures from the debt burden they are now carrying 
in a speech in his own country on wednesday perez had been more 
blunt blaming the price riots which broke out on feb 27 on 
intolerable and obscene debt repayment terms and warning that 
those riots could be repeated in any of the countries of latin 
america 
perez who accompanied baker back to washington was scheduled 
to meet bush on saturday at a breakfast session to be attended by 
baker brady and national security adviser brent scowcroft 
officials of both venezuela and mexico have been engaged in 
intensive talks with us treasury officials in the past several 
days it is expected that those two nations will be the first to 
qualify for debt relief under the brady plan 
meanwhile officials said that the imf and world bank were close 
to resolving a turf battle between the two organizations that has 
hampered their efforts to aid poor countries 
an official of the world bank who spoke on condition that he 
not be identified by name said that the imf board had already 
reviewed the proposal and the matter was pending before the 
directors of the world bank 
the agreement follows principles set out by a committee of 
senior finance officials of the 10 leading industrial countries and 
delineates areas of responsibility for both organizations 
officials said the accord should help to resolve tensions 
between the two agencies which have found their lending functions 
increasingly overlapped in recent years 
in another development the agency that guarantees investments 
by industrial countries against political risk in the third world 
said it will likely begin writing its first insurance policies this 
june 
leigh p hollywood an official of the new multilateral 
investment guarantee agency said that most of the 60 applicants 
for insurance policies have come from companies located in the 
united states 
the us government and 72 other countries have pledged 744 
million to establish the new agency which was created as an arm of 
the world bank to encourage foreign investment in the third world 
by protecting investors against such risks as war civil 
disturbances and expropriation of assets

a circuit judge on thursday said he 
would allow home shopping network inc to ask for 1 billion in 
punitive damages against gte corp in a suit over telephone service 
and set trial for june 5 
pinellas circuit judge howard p rives reversed an earlier order 
and said he would allow hsn to make the hefty punitive claim 
against the telephone company 
james v carideo vice president and general counsel of gte 
florida said rives ruling was purely procedural 
the punitive damages are in addition to the 500 million hsn is 
seeking from gte in compensatory fines 
in september 1987 hsn sued gte claiming the utility knowingly 
provided defective and inadequate telephone equipment and services 
hsn alleged that gte deliberately concealed the defects and misled 
the video retailer in order to keep the lucrative account 
last november rives ruled that it was necessary for home 
shopping to present evidence of gte misconduct before claiming 
punitive damages 
in asking to have the claim reinstated hsn presented documents 
some from from gte files which the company says backs its 
allegations rives ruling thursday means hsn may take its case 
before a jury 
hsn was convinced when it filed the lawsuit in 1987 that it 
was entitled to punitive damages todays ruling will allow us to 
present all our claims to the jury said nando difilippo jr 
executive vice president and general counsel for hsn 
rives said the case should take four to six weeks 
gte floridas carideo said we look forward to showing at 
trial as our counterclaim states that hsns suit is a sham and 
an attempted coverup for management problems

trade minister john crosbie announced thursday 
that canada will impose trade sanctions against the united states 
in retaliation for a us oil import tax that has been ruled 
discriminatory under world trade rules 
the action was seen as an escalation of a uscanadian dispute 
over canadian fish export regulations 
crosbie said in a statement that canada has lost patience with 
us failure to comply with a 1987 ruling by the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade that the socalled superfund oil tax a tax 
imposed to help pay for environmental protection violates world 
trade rules 
the move came two days after us trade representative carla 
hills said the united states will retaliate against regulations 
that protect canadas west coast herring and salmonprocessing 
industry 
i would call it a titfortat move said one us official 
who spoke on the condition of not being identified 
spokeswoman danielle ayotte of the external affairs department 
however denied any linkage between the disputes she said no 
decision has been made on what us products may be affected by 
sanctions 
she said the oil dispute came up when hills and crosbie met in 
washington this month but that there was no movement on the us 
side 
it has been going on for a long time i think we have been 
very patient she said 
ayotte said canada had no option but to seek formal authority 
from gatt to remove us trading privileges the sanctions probably 
would comprise tariffs or quotas on us products it could take 
months before they could go into effect 
crosbie expressed hope that washington would act before that 
happened saying our preference is that the united states remove 
this discriminatory tax we are not interested in retaliatory 
action for its own sake 
but a us official also insisting on anonymity said canada is 
irritated that washington acted to retaliate against canadian fish 
products without approval by the genevabased 96nation gatt 
organization and could be out to teach the united states a lesson 
crosbie chided the americans on wednesday for acting under us 
trade law before getting approval from gatt 
canada says it will replace the export restrictions on raw 
herring and salmon with new conservation regulations that will 
conform to gatt 
the united states imposed the oil tax in 1986 as part of the 
us superfund to finance a multibilliondollar war chest for 
environmental cleanup 
although canada supported the principle of the superfund it 
complained to gatt because the us tax on imported oil was 117 
cents per barrel while the tax on oil produced in the united states 
was only 82 cents 
the tax adds 837 million a year to the cost of oil imported 
from canada and canada would be allowed to impose sanctions of the 
same value 
hans maciej vice president of the canadian petroleum 
association in calgary said he didnt know if this was the right 
bullet to use the bush administration has been working to get 
congress to comply with the gatt ruling anyway he said 
however he said the superfund tax isnt a critical issue for 
canadian oil exporters its an irritant

oil and entertainment mogul marvin davis 
offered 26 billion cash thursday to buy northwest airlines a 
company that just this week erected takeover defenses in response 
to an overture from a different suitor 
nwa inc parent of the eagan minnbased airline refused to 
comment on the unsolicited davis bid which the investor stressed 
was friendly 
davis who made his fortune in oil and real estate and has 
traded in hollywood companies in recent years said in revealing 
his offer that he had already accumulated 3 percent of nwa stock 
he offered 90 a share for the companys 291 million 
outstanding shares for a buyout to be negotiated with management 
northwest spokesman spokesman bob gibbons said company officials 
would withhold comment until its board of directors had studied the 
bid which was revealed late thursday afternoon here 
on tuesday the airlines board adopted a poison pill 
takeover defense in response to expressions of interest by a 
potential buyer whose identity the company wouldnt reveal that 
suitor has bought 49 percent of nwas stock and expressed an 
interest in a leveraged buyout nwa said 
davis statement indicated he wasnt involved in the earlier 
offer 
his bid announced after the stock markets closed values the 
company at considerably more that its current stock price nwa 
shares closed at 6825 thursday down from 6875 the day before 
davis 63 former owner of 20th century fox film corp said 
that if he were successful in buying northwest he would keep the 
company intact and under present management 
he believes that minnesota is the logical and best place for 
this airline said davis spokeswoman mary conway there is no 
intention of selling off any assets to finance this deal 
davis is willing to boost his bid if the company agrees to 
negotiate and demonstrates it is worth more ms conway said 
in response to the earlier suitors expression of interest 
northwest management and unions promised to fight to remain 
independent and state officials suggested they might consider 
legislation to hamper a hostile takeover the companys poison pill 
defense gives current stockholders the right to buy new stock 
cheaply in the event of a hostile takeover attempt thereby making 
it more costly to obtain a controlling amount of stock 
guy cook head of northwests machinists union local said 
our main concern is does marvin davis or any other suitor wish to 
run an airline or make a lot of money and walk away i would want 
more details before i make up my mind whether marvin davis is ready 
to come in and run an airline 
analysts have suggested the company is a tempting takeover 
target because of its lagging stock price and attractive real 
estate holdings in tokyo 
nwa reported 1988 earnings of 1351 million a share up 311 
percent from 103 million in 1987 in august 1986 northwest 
acquired rival republic airlines for 884 million 
davis built his empire on davis oil co in denver and on 
extensive real estate investments he was in the news most recently 
last week when he teamed up with prudential insurance co to buy 
spectradyne a richardson texas paytelevision company for 635 
million 
in march 1988 he was rebuffed in a 770 million bid for lorimar 
telepictures corp a tv production firm that since was bought by 
warner communications inc 
he bought 20th century fox in 1981 and sold it to media tychoon 
rupert murdoch in 1985 making an estimated 325 million on the 
deal he also is rumored to have explored the possibility of 
bidding on mgmua communications co and warner which is in the 
process of merging with time inc 
his real estate holdings include the snomwass buttermilk and 
aspen mountain ski resorts in colorado and golf courses in pebble 
beach calif

junk bond financier michael r milken is as 
unlikely to receive a multibillion dollar fine as he is a 500year 
prison term even if he is convicted on every count of a mammoth 
racketeering and securities fraud indictment a federal prosecutor 
said thursday 
milken head of drexel burnham lambert incs high yield bond 
department and two others were indicated wednesday on charges they 
turned drexel into a racketeering enterprise that engaged in 
securities violations ranging from insider trading to stock market 
manipulation 
all three were charged with racketeering and conspiring to 
violate federal racketeering laws which each carry a maximum 
20year sentence upon conviction 
milken his brother lowell and former drexel trader bruce 
newberg each face maximum fines of 37 billion if convicted on 
either or both of the racketeering counts said assistant us 
attorney bruce baird 
those fines represent the highest possible amounts under federal 
racketeering law that is double the gains made from the 
allegedly illegal enterprise that a judge may impose 
the defendants also face fines of at least 250000 and up to 
five years imprisonment on each of the lesser charges of mail wire 
and securities fraud in michael milkens case thats an 
additional 96 counts or a total of 24 million more in fines and a 
possible 520 years imprisonment 
but baird conceded such totals were unrealistic 
neither the possible maximum fine nor the possible maximum 
prison term is a penalty that the government expects will be fully 
imposed said baird head of the securities and commodities fraud 
unit at the us attorneys office in manhattan 
a fine like a term of imprisonment is something within the 
discretion of the judge after conviction said the prosecutor 
for example he added for milken a judge could impose either no 
jail time or the maximum 520 years upon conviction 
but based on past sentencing practices in other major 
racketeering and securities cases it appeared unlikely a judge 
would impose the fullest possible penalties against the three 
baird indicated 
far more realistic said baird was that if the three were 
convicted of either racketeering count they would have to forfeit a 
total of 185 billion in allegedly illegal gains made from their 
enterprise 
forfeiture is a penalty unique to the federal racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act baird said 
the 185 billion represents virtually all the money milken and 
his codefendants made from their dealings with drexel or from 
their financial stake in drexel from 1984 through 1987 the years 
covered by the indictment which is subject to forefeiture under 
the federal racketeering law 
that includes all salaries and bonuses totaling 12 billion 
drexel stock worth 112 million 205 million in corporate finance 
fees and 379 million in drexel trading profits allegedly tainted 
by fraud 
prosecutors also are seeking 257 million in interest 
baird said the trial jury would decide whether to order 
forfeiture after a racketeering conviction 
baird said the government did not plan to seek a court order 
freezing the trios assets 
were going to give them an opportunity to post a bond 
first said baird he said the bond would be like posting bail 
for their assets to assure the assets will still be there in the 
event of a conviction on the rico charges
