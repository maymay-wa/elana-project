the chinese sturgeon a 10foot ocean fish is in 
danger of extinction because a yangtze river dam is blocking it from 
the breeding grounds it has used for 300 million years an official 
newspaper reported today 
the china daily said the number of mature chinese sturgeons 
known scientifically as acipenser sinensis gray has fallen to 5000 
and at least 400 are being killed each year 
there are even fewer of the smaller white sturgeon it said 
the fish which weigh between 330 and 550 pounds when they lay 
eggs are unable to reach their breeding grounds in the upper 
reaches of the yangtze because of the newly completed gezhouba dam 
in central chinas hubei province 
the dam under construction since 1974 and partially operating 
since 1981 prevents the fish from reaching 19 of their 20 breeding 
grounds 1800 miles upstream in the jinsha river a yangtze 
tributary 
the dam builders originally agreed to put in a passageway for the 
fish around the dam but abandoned the idea because of the expense 
every year about 30 dead sturgeons are found at the base of the dam 
the newspaper quoted ke fuen director of the yangtze river 
aquatic products research institute as saying female sturgeons 
reach maturity at age 13 or 14 when they begin their 20month 
journey into chinas largest river 
because the fish eat nothing while they are in the river they 
are exhausted by the trip and are not ready to breed again for four 
or five years 
an average sturgeon he said lays about 18 pounds of eggs or 
about 450000 fry but 80 percent are eaten by other fish and most 
of the young sturgeon do not survive their sixmonth journey to the 
sea 
ke said about 370 sturgeon a year are caught at the mouth of the 
river by fishermen unaware the fish is now under state protection 
kes institute which has a budget of only 6750 a year for 
sturgeon research is now trying artificial breeding to save the 
fish from extinction it has been putting about 350000 sturgeon fry 
into the river a year 
the dam with a designed capacity of 27 million kilowatts will 
supply 20 percent of the central china networks electricity when it 
is fully operating

carnaby street which soared to fame as the fashion 
pacesetter for beatles generation of the swinging sixties is 
seeking a new incarnation as a mecca for stylish yuppies of the 
1980s 
when mary quants miniskirts and john stephens bellbottom 
hiphuggers clothed the flower children london became the fashion 
capital of the world and carnaby street the favorite haunt of the 
mods and rockers 
for about a decade young people from new york to sydney flocked 
to boutiques called tom cat take 6 and lord john to buy the latest 
in hot pants platform shoes wide floral ties and psychedelic 
shirts 
but as styles changed and rents soared in the early 1970s 
stephen and other designers moved out and carnaby street took on a 
tacky downmarket flavor 
the street remains a microcosm of english fashion over the last 
20 years shoppers can buy the 60s mod look 70s hippie and ethnic 
fashions and 80s punk leather and sadomasochistic gear including 
studded leather belts sex pistols tshirts and neofascist and 
nazisymbol buttons 
now the peachey property corp the private real estate company 
that owns about threequarters of carnaby street wants to restore 
some fashion magnetism to the twoblock thoroughfare tucked behind 
regent street in the heart of central london 
were not trying to revive the 60s said peter bourne 
peacheys surveyor for carnaby street what we are aiming to do in 
carnaby street is cater to the betteroff young market the 1530 
age group who like the young kids in the 60s had no shops 
catering to them especially in central london 
over the last two years peachey has replaced about half of the 
shops that sold this fashion mishmash with branches of pricier 
fashion chains like benetton supreme capricorn confetti and midas 
the naziinsignia merchants have proved such an embarrassment 
that the two main stores on an alley off carnaby street are being 
forced out of business under pressure from peachey westminster 
borough authorities and antifascist campaigners 
mary quant who worked out of the kings road in chelsea in the 
1960s has opened her first shop on carnaby street selling makeup 
and accessories she said she was lured by the revival of the 
surrounding soho area as a center for young people and young 
industries 
bourne hopes the whole street eventually will be yuppified with 
wine bars restaurants and art galleries 
it does take a long time to move a whole area around he said 
in an interview not only do we have to change tenents but we 
have to tell the world this area has changed 
last june peachey relaunched carnaby street with balloons 
20000 leaflets and the message that it was now synonymous with 
chic and stylish london this year it hopes to start regular 
street theater and entertainment and stage fashion and art shows 
knitwear designer marion foale who moved into carnaby street in 
the early 1960s and did clothes for the beatles remembers when it 
was a quaint backwater where you could get a saddle mended 
now its beginning to come up again she said but its 
always different the next carnaby street will have its own 
incarnation 
but many shoppers designers and storekeepers mourn the carnaby 
street they say is gone forever 
its an interesting historic relic its where it all 
started said los angelesborn giffi fields who started selling 
handpainted madetomeasure mens clothes to carnaby street shops 
in the late 1960s 
carnaby street was a oneoff oneofakind area at its time 
because it was a street devoted to youth culture he said every 
major city in the world today doesnt have only one street but many 
streets devoted to youth culture so you just dont get the 
uniqueness anymore and you wont get the uniqueness 
at inderwicks pipe shop a carnaby street landmark for at least 
70 years and the only store left from the 1960s owner peter 
anderson doubted peachey would succeed because the street is getting 
the same stores as dozens of other shopping areas in london 
most shops are multiple or franchises not one shop has 
individual character except the great frog because they make their 
own jewelry said the 64yearold businessman 
i cant see it ever becoming what theyre aiming for its 
still a street without any character 
shopkeepers at both ends of the market are unhappy with carnaby 
streets current clientele 
those at the top said the street was still attracting the same 
customers it did in 1975 young people looking for cheap clothes 
but those at the bottom complained that the punks mods skinheads 
and hippies had gone and the street was attracting too many straight 
people in suits 
potential shoppers wandering along the street recently were also 
unimpressed 
its just like a pedestrian walkway with tacky shops on either 
side complained allen sawkins 30 a student and motorcycle 
courier its just a tourist trap most people from london 
wouldnt come here 
alan tate 20 a student from manchester said its gone 
downhill its too respectable now the businessmen have taken over 
it tries to be anarchic and antiestablishment but it does it all 
commercially so its not unique

no one in britain outside of the moslem community 
has endorsed the iranian death sentence against salman rushdie but 
some are supporting the author of the satanic verses through 
gritted teeth 
an insidious outbreak of yesbut has entered the public 
debate on the rights and rightness of his case the observer 
newspaper said in an editorial sunday 
the debate even popped up at a writers day conference organized 
by british pen the association of poets essayist and novelists 
most wrote supportive greetings to rushdie in a book that was 
left open for messages but one entry said personal freedom is 
constrained by personal responsibility you are shown to be wanting 
in the latter 
below it another writer asserted freedom is freedom it does 
not imply restraint 
the liberal observer said it was disturbed by statements by prime 
minister margaret thatcher and foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe 
last week that the book was offensive and by the opinion of lord 
jakobovits britains chief rabbi that such books should be banned 
they are not alone in their criticisms 
mr rushdies life has to be defended at all costs but not 
necessarily his book the daily telegraph a conservative 
newspaper said in an editorial last week 
a cartoon in the sunday express showed rushdie dressed like 
irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini with a flowing beard of pound 
notes labeled my royalties and threatening the foreign 
secretary blasphemy sir geoffrey the caption said i shall 
call upon the authors of the world to spear you with their pens 
rushdie has been in hiding since feb 14 when khomeini sentenced 
him to death iranian clergymen have offered a bounty of as much as 
52 million 
mrs thatcher said saturday that britain still insists iran 
repudiate the death sentence before diplomatic relations can be 
normalized britain has withdrawn its diplomats from tehran 
the majlis irans legislature has set tuesday as a deadline for 
breaking diplomatic relations unless britain clarifies its 
position on the book 
irans official news agency said sunday that the withdrawal of 
all copies of the satanic verses and banning of its reprinting by 
the british government would certainly bring london closer to the 
implementation of the iranian conditions 
many of those in britain who criticize the book stop short of 
calling for it to be banned 
hartley shawcross a prominent attorney and a former chairman of 
the press council wrote to the times that rushdie had committed a 
deplorable abuse of the freedom which he shares with the rest of us 
but which we must nonetheless defend 
the rushdie book has done incalculable harm to the interests of 
all people not with any intention of contribution to scholarship 
but in order to sensationalize a novel in the hope of securing its 
better sale shawcross wrote 
in its editorial the telegraph said that free speech to some 
degree depends on responsibility in exercising it 
a civilized society is unwise to insist that all abuses of 
freedom of expression within the law regardless of the damage done 
form part of the ark of the covenant and so are sacrosanct the 
newspaper said 
auberon waugh fuming over rushdies past criticisms of british 
imperialism and racial prejudice wrote in the spectator magazine 
perhaps the real debate is not so much whether rushdie should 
be executed but just how much we should exert ourselves as 
deeply stained white imperialists to protect him from his own 
people 
i really do not think it unreasonable in the circumstance of 
rushdies having made several million pounds through insulting 
islam to suggest that he should pay for any police protection he 
may judge advisable said waugh a columnist for the spectator and 
the sunday telegraph 
a letter to the times from jeremy treglown editor of the times 
literary supplement argued that rushdies critics might want a 
broader revision of the literary canon 
miltons pamphlets and drydens and popes satires which 
caused deep and violent feeling in those they attacked should 
obviously have been toned down many readers have been made 
uncomfortable by the moral insights of jane austen and dickens 
clear cases for sensitive editing treglown wrote 
wouldnt we be easier in our minds if there were no books at 
all

alphabetically speaking yuba city calif was 
used to being last on lists but catching the caboose in rand 
mcnallys places rated almanac four years ago insulted residents 
right down to their toes 
at first they fumed they raged they stamped their collective 
civic feet then they got smart 
city leaders decided there are only two places to be on the 
list the top and the bottom said mary knapp yubasutter 
chamber of commerce executive vice president it depends what you 
make of both of them 
what yuba citians made from last place was a heap of firstrate 
public relations hay 
in the 50 years since one el thorndike created his goodness 
index for american cities academicians special interest groups 
magazines and the federal government have cranked out a plethora of 
rankings identifying the best of all possible towns 
stressed out live in state college pa says one survey cedar 
rapids iowa says another 
best place for a hip contemporary career woman seattle savvy 
magazine says 
easiest place to make friends san francisco forbes magazine 
says 
no 1 overall its pittsburgh says one survey danbury conn 
says another 
in a nation where everybody loves the underdog but nobody wants 
to be one where everyone says it doesnt matter what other people 
think but no one believes it city ratings have become a source of 
indignation elation frustration and always fascination 
now its almost time for another edition of places rated 
the most objective and carefully researched of the bunch like the 
presidential election it appears every four years and a lot of 
people dont like the results 
the fallout has included threatened lawsuits map and magazine 
burnings and on a number of occasions campaigns for civic 
improvements 
but ask researchers city officials and municipal groups what 
city rankings mean and how seriously to take them and the answers 
seem to be not much and not very 
theres no best city just like theres no best work of art 
said bert sperling a portland ore computer researcher who 
despite that opinion created software that rates cities whos to 
say van goghs sunflower is better than da vincis the last 
supper 
and whos to say there are 328 better places to live than yuba 
city why places rated authors david savageau and richard 
boyer thats who 
when yuba city leaders reflected on how to make the best out of 
being the worst they decided to lighten up 
if you screamed and ranted and raved you made a fool of 
yourself knapp said we decided to make a fun thing of it 
first 1000 residents burned hundreds of rand mcnally maps at a 
community pep rally packaged the ashes in a walnut box and had a 
local mortician present them to a rand mcnally vice president who 
flew out from chicago just for the occasion 
then the city helped a radio station in pittsburgh rated no 1 
in the same survey award an allexpense paid trip to yuba city as 
a contest prize the happy winners toured the city by limousine and 
rode a float in the 105th annual bokkai festival a good time was 
had by all 
and at years end when life magazine wrapped up 1985 it was 
yuba city not pittsburgh that received a full page and they 
spelled the name right knapp mused a little amazed 
it took places rated to not only rocket yuba city out of 
obscurity but to propel the metro ratings game onto the bestseller 
list 
the idea sprang from the authors desire to move out of boston 
and their discovery that there was no single source for good solid 
data on life in us cities they decided to compile a comprehensive 
american cities reference guide and sold rand mcnally on the idea 
in 1978 
the first edition with atlanta at the top and lawrence mass 
in the cellar came out in 1981 
more than 300000 book sales later savageau says hes a bit 
disappointed that the book is considered more the topic of cocktail 
party chitchat than the serious reference tool the authors intended 
and he acknowledges its popularity still baffles him 
i wouldnt go out and buy a book that said pittsburgh was the 
best place in the country he said taking a rare break from his 
computer and the latest edition of places rated due out this 
fall from simon amp schuster inc which acquired the series last year 
from rand mcnally 
when the statistics laid the exalted mantel of extreme livability 
on pittsburgh a city once known as hell with the lid off even 
rand mcnally didnt believe it at first 
the crowning of pittsburgh illustrates the key difference between 
places rated and other city rankings 
the savageauboyer study gives equal weight to climate housing 
crime transportation health care recreation education the arts 
and economics that might tend to give an edge to larger cities 
which have more amenities and doesnt take into account which 
factors people think are most important 
other studies tend to focus on one aspect of life such relief 
from stress which the advocacy group zero population growth found 
in cedar rapids and a study in psychology today magazine found in 
state college 
or they consider the preferences of a specific group of people 
as money magazine does polling 251 subscribers in its 1987 survey 
pittsburgh was 43rd nashua nh was no 1 last year pittsburgh 
moved to no 20 danbury conn was top of the heap 
a change from one year to the next in what the subscribers 
consider most important say education over leisure or 
transportation over weather plus even a small shift in a citys 
vital statistics can account for a wild fluctuation said sperling 
whose company fast forward has created a computer program called 
places usa used by money 
some of the cities that have been disappointingly rated have 
used it to say oh yeah and show they have a strong community 
support base said randy arndt spokesman for the national league 
of cities it depends on the resourcefulness of the city 
the league wouldnt dream of ranking its 1400 members i dont 
know who these surveys benefit except the authors everybody 
doesnt live in the perfect place but its home to us arndt 
said whether you live in scarsdale or saginaw life is what you 
make of it 
the same can be said of city ratings 
in the next places rated savageau and boyer plan a section 
designed to make everyone happy by showing how under certain 
conditions using factors in the book any burg can be a pittsburgh 
for instance if the only thing youre interested in are cities 
in california with a moderate climate and low cost of living 
savageau said yuba city would be the best place in the whole 
country

outrage over a schoolyard massacre led five california cities to 
ban semiautomatic rifles but legislative attacks on socalled 
assault weapons elsewhere in the nation are facing stiff opposition 
from gun advocates 
bills to ban or restrict militarystyle assault rifles have 
surfaced or are planned for introduction in congress 11 states and 
at least a dozen cities following the jan 17 shooting spree at an 
elementary school in stockton calif 
five children died and 29 others and a teacher were injured 
when drifter patrick purdy opened fire with an ak47 assault rifle 
on a crowded playground he fired 106 bullets in two minutes and 
then killed himself 
the shock and anger that erupted combined with concerns over the 
mounting use of assault weapons by drug gangs prompted bans in the 
california cities of stockton los angeles san diego carson and 
compton outside california cleveland has banned the weapons 
but elsewhere the outrage seems to be losing some of its 
persuasive power 
bills to ban or restrict assault weapons have died in the 
maryland indiana and washington legislatures in hutchinson kan 
summit county ohio los angeles county calif and new orleans 
in hutchinson city commissioners rejected a ban on assault 
rifles after facing an angry crowd of 150 only one of whom spoke in 
favor of the ban 
the issue has revived familiar guncontrol arguments one side 
says the bloodshed must stop while the other says americans have a 
constitutional right to own guns 
we think america is tired of picking up the newspaper or 
watching tv and seeing kids and police officers lying in pools of 
blood said jim scutt national sheriffs association spokesman 
we share the grief of the tragedy in stockton said national 
rifle association lobbyist james baker but the answer does not 
lie in restricting the rights of lawabiding citizens the answer 
lies in getting the criminal off the street 
the nra has challenged the california cities bans in court 
arguing that only the legislature has the power to regulate firearms 
in california 
the biggest legislative battles are still to come congress is 
considering four bills to ban or restrict assault weapons bills are 
pending or expected to be introduced in california florida 
massachusetts minnesota new york north carolina oregon and rhode 
island 
debate on all the bills focuses on how to define assault rifles 
an automatic weapon or machine gun fires bullets as long as the 
trigger is pulled a federal permit is needed to own one 
semiautomatic rifles which can be bought over the counter in 
nearly all states fire one bullet for each pull of the trigger but 
do not need to be cocked or loaded between pulls most states allow 
such rifles in hunting but usually limit the size of the ammunition 
magazine or clip 
distinguishing assault rifles such as the sovietdesigned ak47 
from semiautomatic hunting rifles can be difficult 
they all function the same way said tom hill spokesman for 
the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms all that 
changes is you take off the wood stock and put on a plastic or metal 
folding stock or you put on a banana clip rather than a small 
hunting clip or you put on a bayonet 
some legislation would ban specific brands of guns but the nra 
argues that is useless the ak47 this year will be the ar48 next 
year and theyd be out from under the regulation baker said 
while the debate bogs down in detail the issue remains clear to 
janet geng a stockton teacher whose leg has a hole the size of a 
grapefruit from purdys shooting spree 
these people against a ban id like to have had them standing 
out there next to me she said i dont believe there is any 
reason for that type of weapon to exist in our society 
hill said imports of ak47s which at 250 to 350 are among the 
cheapest assault rifles have increased tenfold in the past four 
years more than 40000 were imported during the 14 months ending 
nov 30 he said 
if anything hill said debate over banning assault rifles has 
boosted sales demand is reported especially high in california and 
when a store in menomonee falls wis ran a get 
embeforeyoucant sale on ak47s it sold out and had to order 
150 more 
in stockton meanwhile police are relying on the honesty of gun 
owners to turn in their now illegal semiautomatic rifles theyve 
received seven

islam may surpass judaism as the nations largest minority 
religion by the turn of the century but american moslems still are 
struggling to find their place in a nation that has long defined 
itself as protestant catholic jewish 
the us publication of salman rushdies the satanic verses 
a novel some consider blasphemous is to many of the nations 
estimated 35 million moslems only the latest example of how 
acceptable antimoslem prejudice has become in america 
the eight years they lived under reagan were not easy years 
the enemy moved from being the evil empire of the soviet union to 
islam said yvonne haddad a professor of islamic history at the 
university of massachusetts at amherst ive seen the prejudice 
its almost american to bash islam 
nor has their exclusion from the american religious landscape 
ended with reagans departure according to moslem leaders there 
were neither moslem participants nor any mention of islam at an 
interfaith national prayer service after president bushs 
inauguration 
we felt a bit insulted but blamed it on their ignorance rather 
than discourtesies said mohammed mehdi a cochairman of the 
north american interfaith network and secretary general of the 
national council on islamic affairs the service was organized by a 
national day of prayer and thanksgiving committee 
ever since interfaith support was drummed up for world war i 
with protestant catholic and jewish leaders showing unprecedented 
cooperation the portrait of the nation as consisting of three basic 
faiths has been implanted in the public mind 
moslems have settled in america since the 19th century but 
tremendous growth did not take place until the 1960s and 1970s when 
relaxed immigration rules and a jump in islamic students related to 
the oil boom coincided with a movement by blacks to islam 
no one knows how many moslems there are in the us estimates 
range from 2 million to 10 million but many scholars and religious 
leaders say haddads estimate of between 3 million and 4 million is 
the most reliable 
if that estimate is correct there are more moslems in the united 
states than two of the nations most influential denominations the 
3 millionmember presbyterian church usa and the 25 
millionmember episcopal church 
because of higher rates of immigration births and conversions 
among moslems there also is substantial agreement with haddads 
assessment that if current demographic trends continue the nations 
moslem population will be larger than the jewish population 
possibly by 2000 definitely by 2015 the nations jewish 
population is estimated at 59 million 
but growing numbers have not meant growing respect for moslems 
who still must contend with public perceptions of them ranging from 
camel jockeys to more dangerous stereotypes fostered by american 
anger over ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in iran 
the amazing thing about it is that they persist so 
perversely said marston speight director of the office of 
christianmoslem relations for the national council of churches 
everywhere i go no matter what i say people always come up with 
the stereotype of islam being a fanatically aggressive type of 
religion 
speight said the ethical principles of peace and mercy in the 
koran the sacred book of moslems simply belie the negative 
militant violent image he said violent acts committed in the 
name of islam have parallels in christian history but morally and 
ethically islam and christianity and judaism are on common ground 
many religious groups have made improved relations with moslems a 
priority 
john borrelli executive secretary of the office for 
interreligious relations of the us catholic conference said 
catholicmoslem dialogue is going on in cities such as los angeles 
and new york and he expects more meetings and discussions nationally 
rabbi james rudin of the american jewish committee said the the 
test of american religion in the 21st century will be its ability 
to integrate other religious groups such as moslems 
if we fail if we cannot have a mutually respectful society 
then we can end up with religious sectarian strife and god 
forbid he said adding that his organization has increased 
efforts to have contacts with moslems 
mehdi said that with the exception of unofficial isolated 
letters from christian fundamentalists who label moslems 
heathens the overwhelming number of established religions 
have been supportive 
but discrimination persists he and others contend 
haddad said since 1985 mosques have been bombed in philadelphia 
and indianapolis and others have been desecrated 
the publication of the satanic verses showed moslems are 
not perceived as being part and parcel of american society and are 
misunderstood said brother ihsan babgy education director for 
the islamic society of north america in plainfield ind 
rushdie has said the book is a work of fiction that was not 
intended to offend anyone viking penguin the books us 
publisher has said its position is freedom of speech freedom to 
publish and freedom to read must be guaranteed internationally 
but the turmoil caused by the book may have longterm benefits 
for american moslems according to officials here 
the atmosphere has changed remarkably in recent times this 
whole issue of satanic verses is pushing us together more babgy 
said i think there is a clear and dramatic unification of moslems 
in this country 
since the controversy developed mehdi said his office has 
received about 20 calls from people who used obscene language to 
express their point of view and four times as many calls from 
people wanting to find out more about islam

today is monday march 6 the 65th day of 1989 there are 300 
days left in the year 
todays highlight in history 
on march 6 1836 the alamo in san antonio texas fell to 
mexican forces after a 13day siege all 187 defenders of the 
mission compound including davy crockett and james bowie were

us officials are concerned that afghanistan 
already a principal opium producer could become an even greater 
source of illicit narcotics in the wake of the soviet troop 
withdrawal 
afghanistan worries everyone who is interested in this 
issue said ann wrobleski the assistant secretary of state for 
narcotics affairs 
ms wrobleski in discussing the departments annual narcotics 
control report said the problem is likely to be aggravated when the 
estimated 3 million to 5 million afghan refugees return to their 
homeland 
in the wake of the destruction caused by the nineyear war 
against the soviet occupiers traditional agriculture has been made 
nearly impossible in many regions 
as we see refugees moving back into a wartorn country where 
there is no strong central government we see them returning to a 
fairly easy quick profitable means of supporting themselves ms 
wrobleski said 
therefore the prediction is that output of opium will increase 
out of afghanistan which then leads to a chain reaction of 
increased heroin moving through pakistan she added 
throughout the opiumproducing region that also includes iran 
burma and laos prospects are not good for any reduction in the 
opium trade in the coming year ms wrobleski said 
with some 700800 metric tons produced last year afghanistan is 
second only to burma in opium production in southern asia the 
report said 
compounding us government frustration at increasing worldwide 
opium supplies is the fact that about 90 percent of the worlds 
opium production takes place in areas in which the united states has 
little or no access such as afghanistan lebanon laos and 
burma the report said 
the united states long warned the mujahedeen rebels against 
producing and smuggling drugs to support their war effort against 
the soviets with the soviets gone the rebels are now attempting to 
overthrow the communist regime of strongman najibullah 
us officials are concerned that amid a possible struggle among 
the various rebel factions narcotics control might not be given a 
high priority 
current agricultural production is roughly half of the prewar 
level insufficient to support the existing population let along 
the large numbers of returning refugees says james phillips a 
senior policy analyst at the conservative washington think tank the 
heritage foundation 
drug production could be a major problem he said in an 
interview but perhaps im just more pessimistic than others 
another state department afghan expert who spoke on condition he 
not be identified by name said the united states must wait for a 
central government to be formed to start any kind of comprehensive 
drug eradication or crop substitution program 
but he took a more positive approach to the postsoviet era 
the agency for international development has been involved in a 
pilot program near the city of jalabad encouraging farmers to 
switch from poppy growing to wheat and vegetable production he said 
were pleased with it he said claiming a quite 
impressive success with the local farmers and expressing hopes the 
pilot program could be used elsewhere once calm is restored 
at present however cooperation can only be obtained in certain 
areas where rebel leaders are in control and sympathetic to such an 
approach the official said 
my sense is the resistance leaders we work with are 
exceptionally sensitive to this aware that it is a domestic issue 
in the united states added the official 
he predicted that fundamentalist rebel leaders intend to apply 
the rigid tenets of islam and police drug production if they gain 
control

law enforcement is a lonesome job in nearly a 
thousand american communities with oneofficer police departments 
according to a government study 
although some big cities and counties boast thousands of 
officers nearly half of all police and sheriffs departments have 
fewer than 10 officers the bureau of justice statistics reported on 
sunday 
law enforcement agencies ranged in size from 34 police 
departments and 12 sheriffs offices with more than 1000 officers 
apiece to the 987 departments with just one according to the study 
the first detailed statistical analysis of local law enforcement 
staffing 
all state police agencies 99 percent of sheriffs offices and 97 
percent of local police agencies with 135 or more officers require 
at least a high school diploma the 1987 study found a separate 
analysis of police standards in 1967 found only 70 percent required 
such a diploma 
in fact the new study found about 10 percent of the larger 
police departments and 6 percent of sheriffs operations are now 
requiring prospective officers to have at least some college 
education 
the justice department report said that overall the nation has 
11989 local police departments 3080 sheriffs departments and 49 
state police agencies hawaii has no state police even though such 
a department was once featured in the television show hawaii 
five0 
nationally law enforcement agencies had 757508 employees 
including 555364 sworn officers 
of those agencies 526 percent of local police departments have 
fewer than 10 officers and 79 percent have under 25 the report 
found among sheriffs offices 336 percent had under 10 deputies 
and 673 percent had fewer than 25 
thus of the 15057 local police and sheriffs agencies 487 
percent had fewer than 10 officers 
sheriffs departments led the way in employing women at 125 
percent of their sworn deputies the report found women constituted 
76 percent of local police officers and only 42 percent of state 
troopers 
blacks were more strongly represented on local police 
departments making up 93 percent of the officers sheriffs 
offices reported 83 percent black deputies and state police lagged 
with 65 percent 
average annual starting salaries for police officers ranged from 
13768 in the smallest departments to 23000 in cities of a 
million people or more local police chiefs were paid salaries of 
between 18503 and 87044 
salaries and wages accounted for six of every seven dollars spent 
on police work by governments total police spending was 283 
billion 
twothirds of the departments that have 135 or more officers said 
they allow collective bargaining 
nationwide 317 percent of police agencies and 283 percent of 
sheriffs departments said they participated in the 911 emergency 
telephone system the highest rate was 88 percent for police in 
cities of between 250000 and 500000 people sheriffs offices 
serving communities of under 10000 reported that only 157 percent 
had the 911 system in use 
the responsibilities of the law enforcement agencies vary from 
place to place in addition to regular peacekeeping functions 
nearly half of the departments are also responsible for animal 
control in their communities for example and one in four handles 
emergency medical services 
other special functions include court security handled by 22 
percent of the departments civil defense 21 percent civil process 
serving 18 percent jail operation 12 percent training academy 6 
percent drug testing 4 percent and ballistics testing 2 percent

the burgeoning homicide toll in the nations 
capital is providing doctors with a new source of organs for 
transplant 
theres always going to be tragedy and there are going to be 
fatalities with young people says dr john macoviak medical 
director of the washington regional transplant consortium 
and the one and only clearcut benefit to society of that 
which didnt exist until recently is the fact that other lives can 
be saved as the result of these people that lose their lives 
prematurely 
the district of columbia and neighboring prince georges county 
md and fairfax county va each had record homicide rates in 
1988 in the district alone more than 90 people have been killed 
thus far this year that is far above the 1988 rate 
in the district and prince georges county many of the homicides 
are attributed to drugs 
the record homicide rates are absolutely increasing the 
number of available organs and tissue for transplant said macoviak 
who performs heart transplants at the washington hospital center 
the citys largest and most active trauma facility 
i would say that probably about twice the number of donors are 
being procured this year as were being procured last year he said 
last august the consortium received 14 referrals for organ 
donations six months later the number had risen to 27 
in addition to the record homicide rates the availability of 
organs for transplants also has been assisted by a district of 
columbia law passed in january 1988 requiring that families be asked 
to donate organs 
victims felled by a single gunshot wound to the head are the most 
likely candidates for donation because their organs arent damaged 
said macoviak 
when they can doctors keep gunshot victims alive on a 
ventilator but if its certain the person is braindead hospital 
and consortium officials ask the bereaved family to donate the 
victims organs 
id say the families of drug victims are very supportive as a 
rule he said they want to donate the organs 
its solace concurred john bardi a consortium executive 
committee member and assistant administrator at george washington 
university hospital its the way they deal with their grief to 
know the individual is alive in someone else to know theyve 
touched someone else 
when dealing with homicide victims hospital staff also must 
cooperate with homicide detectives and the medical examiner and 
these delays sometimes make it impossible to perform transplants 
said macoviak 
tests are run to ensure that the potential donor meets rigid 
criteria if there are signs of intravenous drug use or a history of 
promiscuous homosexuality transplants are ruled out because of the 
aids risk to potential recipients doctors said 
when doctors are finished removing organs and tissue the 
respirator which has kept the victim alive is quietly turned off 
as many as 16 people can benefit from a single persons death 
receiving the heart lungs kidneys liver and assorted tissue such 
as bones eyes and skin said macoviak 
recipients for the various organs are chosen from waiting lists 
and summoned to the hospital within eight hours about 20 people in 
this region are waiting for new hearts and are likely to die in less 
than a year without transplants said macoviak 
ninety percent of organs procured in the washington area are used 
for people on waiting lists here only those organs for which 
theres no local match are sent elsewhere 
the washington regional transplant consortium was created by six 
area hospitals in 1986 to pool resources for heart transplantation 
it coordinates organ procurement in the metropolitan area and last 
year was authorized to perform liver transplants 
its unfortunate that someone has to die to save another life 
but thats the way it is said bardi its a cycle

a group has threatened to blow up a 
monument to dante alighieri because the medieval poets famed 
divine comedy places the prophet mohammed in hell officials 
said sunday 
mayor mauro dragone said he ordered increased security around the 
monument to the poet who died in ravenna in 1321 after receiving a 
threatening letter from a group calling itself guardians of the 
revolution 
it is an initiative taken in a prudent way because i am more 
inclined to think that the letter which also was sent to a local 
newspaper is a joke orchestrated in bad taste or a provocation 
dragone was quoted as saying by the italian news agency ansa 
however the mayor said he warned police and demanded stepped up 
security because he believes the potential danger from such threats 
should not be underestimated 
he said the letter also demanded that he repudiate the false 
poet dante and declare publicly that dante lied and that these 
verses can no longer be read or studied 
the divine comedy is considered a literary masterpiece that 
established the tuscan dialect as the literary language of italy 
the work a poem of more than 14000 lines in 100 cantos recounts a 
poets journey through hell purgatory and heaven it places 
mohammed in the ninth pit of hell 
it comes in the midst of the controversy over the satanic 
verses by author salman rushdie a native indian now living in 
briton iranian clerics have offered a 52 million reward for 
rushdies death because they say the book blasphemes islam by 
portraying mohammeds wives as prostitutes and suggesting that 
mohammed not god was the source for the koran islams holy book

members of congress are voicing concern over 
the bush administrations delay in naming an official to head a 
newly reorganized drive to assist us industry with hightechnology 
innovation 
in addition to the absence of a permanent appointee to the new 
post of commerce department undersecretary for technology the 
effort also is being hampered by lack of money for a key program at 
the departments national institute of standards and technology 
im deeply concerned about it said rep george e brown jr 
dcalif who closely follows technology issues on capitol hill 
i would say that at this point the administration has not got 
their act together first in terms of making the key appointments 
that would be involved in policy in this area and of course 
establishing the policy framework necessary to be able to go ahead 
brown is a member of the house science research and technology 
subcommittee which is set to hear testimony tuesday by ernest 
ambler who last december was named acting undersecretary for 
technology but is planning to retire at the end of march 
at his confirmation hearing in january commerce secretary robert 
a mosbacher said the role of the undersecretary for technology is 
an extremely high priority and that he was concerned about us 
capability in high technology 
so far however mosbacher has been unable find a willing 
candidate for the undersecretary job which pays 82500 a year 
brown said a number of people including mary l good 
chairwoman of the national science board which oversees the 
national science foundation had been offered the post but had 
turned it down 
rep don ritter rpa said the failure to implement a pay raise 
for congress the judiciary and top federal executives apparently 
figured in the decisions by several people who would have had to 
take a substantial cut from their privatesector incomes 
under a reorganization plan approved by congress late last year 
commerces new technology administration includes 
the office of technology policy a policy analysis and 
development organization 
the office of commercial affairs which promote cooperative 
joint ventures with us industry in areas of research and 
technology development 
the national institute of standards and technology or nist 
which works in areas ranging from automated manufacturing 
electronics and materials research to computer science and 
technology building and fire research and biotechnology 
the national telecommunications and information administration 
responsible for developing federal telecommunications technology 
policies 
the national technical information service which disseminates 
the results of governmentsponsored research 
ambler said in a speech last month that the office of the 
undersecretary for technology is a catalyst a friend a forum a 
listening post and a voice in washington for technologybased 
industry 
at the same time he emphasized that it is the job of the 
private sector to develop and sell goods and services government 
has never been successful in showing industry how to do its job and 
there is absolutely no reason to think that will change in the 
future 
legislation passed last fall also established within nist an 
advanced technology program intended to be a civilian counterpart 
of the pentagons highly touted defense advanced research projects 
agency 
the program is designed to coordinate development of 
emergingtechnologies and manufacturingresearch consortia foster 
industry government and university partnerships and monitor 
cooperation between federal and regional agencies 
however so far the program has no funding either for this fiscal 
year or in the fiscal 1990 budget 
brown said that in the absence of leadership by the 
administration on issues related to civilian technology we may go 
ahead with proposed legislation which would compel them to start 
focusing on this 
what we also need are some shortterm decisions having to do 
with selecting targets of opportunity and providing some funding for 
civilian advanced technology projects this fiscal year the 
california democrat said 
ritter who serves along with brown on the science research and 
technology subcommittee said that after a meeting last wednesday 
with mosbacher he is optimistic about the longerrange prospects 
for developing the technology administration into an effective 
agency 
i think that given the feelings of the secretary of commerce 
its going to be an important new feature on the landscape the 
pennsylvania republican said i think hes committed to it he 
just has to get people to work for him

the defense department in a test program 
ordered by congress has begun reimbursing some of the expenses of 
activeduty servicemen who adopt children 
the unusual program which provides up to 2000 to offset the 
expenses of legally adopting a child is set to last through the end 
of the current fiscal year or until sept 30 unless congress 
votes to make the benefit permanent 
the adoption reimbursement program was formally launched by the 
pentagons personnel chief grant s green last september and as of 
dec 31 the army had processed 69 claims the air force and navy 
lagged behind the army in publishing their regulations and are only 
now handling claims 
the test was ordered in the pentagons fiscal 1988 budget bill 
and was championed by rep patricia schroeder dcolo 
it was proposed not only as a moralebuilding benefit that might 
play a role in keeping men and women in the military but also as a 
benefit for adoptive parents that parallels the cost of health care 
provided to women bearing babies in military hospitals 
the defense department nonetheless opposed the program arguing 
congress wasnt providing any extra money for the payments and it 
couldnt afford to tap other accounts 
in the current fiscal climate this program might negatively 
affect the other personnel and family initiatives that benefit a 
greater percentage of the military population the pentagon argued 
unsuccessfully 
the defense department has not requested any funding for the 
program in the fiscal 1990 budget pending before congress but 
promised it would look at the results of the test program to 
determine further action 
the reimbursement payments are available to anyone on active duty 
who initiates adoption proceedings after sept 30 1987 and 
before oct 1 1989 the pentagon regulation states 
benefits paid under the test program may be paid only after the 
adoption is final the adoption of stepchildren does not qualify for 
reimbursement under this program 
service members who adopt more than one child can claim a maximum 
5000 per year the regulation adds 
according to the national committee for adoption a group 
headquartered in washington the average agency adoption fee was 
about 6000 in 1987

a wiryhaired socialist with free market 
notions has touched off a battle of ideas in the party that created 
swedens welfare state challenging some of its basic principles 
finance minister kjellolof feldt a fivefootsix dynamo is at 
the center of a reform movement in his social democratic party 
which has governed for all but six of the last 56 years 
since the social democrats were reelected in september they 
have loosened foreign currency exchange rules outlined tax reforms 
reduced farm subsidies and warned the troubled textile industry that 
government help is tapering off 
by fighting entrenched interests in order to give socialism the 
new direction he thinks it requires the 57yearold feldt has 
alarmed party stalwarts and the unions 
the internal debate he has set off is known as the war of the 
roses after the partys red rose election symbol 
we must stop slandering the market economy defined as 
decentralized economic decisionmaking competition on free markets 
and a free choice of consumer goods feldt wrote in a recent 
edition of tiden the social democratic magazine on the global 
level it is known that market economy in this form has won a 
complete victory over its only known alternative the planned 
economy 
feldt said a tax policy which takes half the wages of the average 
worker as does swedens has made a historical contribution but 
should now come to an end 
although as finance minister he collects some of the highest 
taxes in the world 72 percent as a maximum on high incomes feldt 
consistently ranks near the top in popularity polls 
a quarterly survey published by pk banken a stateowned bank 
said feldts proposals amount to the introduction of a new 
economic policy regime in sweden 
in the draft budget presented last month feldt announced 
measures to cool the overheated economy by stimulating supply rather 
than lessening demand among the proposals were lowering trade 
barriers and taxes 
the debate he is stirring comes as the social democratic party 
in its 100th year reviews its platform a party committee charged 
with the task is to offer a new draft program by august 
although the social democrats espouse undiluted socialism sweden 
is far from being socialist about 90 percent of production is in 
private hands and big businesses like volvo and the ericsson 
telecommunications group play by capitalist rules 
while a few big companies drive swedens economy the government 
controls transportation communications health care and other 
services 
advocates say the system gives sweden one of the worlds highest 
living standards with basic necessities provided for everyone 
critics say that while the country may seem rich the individual 
swede after paying taxes and high living costs often has little 
money left over to spend as he chooses 
feldt has said he wants to change the pervasiveness of the public 
sector which employs about half the work force and which he says 
has grown fat and inefficient 
an opening salvo in the ideological debate was fired in january 
by feldts treasury officials who drafted a working paper for a 
closed meeting of the scandinavian labor movement it suggested 
citizens be allowed to choose private alternatives to public 
institutions such as day care centers and hospitals 
the report met with such fierce opposition that the meeting tried 
to suppress it when it leaked last month it created a furor among 
traditionalists in the party 
foreign minister sten andersson led a counterattack against what 
he saw as a threat to the partys underpinnings he likened the 
reformists among his colleagues to rivals in the nonsocialist 
opposition 
that the liberals and conservatives want to undermine the 
general welfare is not so strange anderson wrote in the socialist 
daily arbetet but now this has gained a foothold within the 
workers movement disquieting me and others 
prime minister ingvar carlsson was compelled to defend feldt and 
reassure his party 
the general welfare policy will not move carlsson said in a 
television interview we managed to retain it during the difficult 
years and were not abandoning it now 
he denied that a battle was being waged between feldts 
pragmatists and socialist orthodoxy in the government there is no 
right wing there is just the social democratic government and that 
is to the left he said 
however feldts article attacked the argument that a free market 
inevitably leads to social gaps and impoverishment of the worker 
it is definitely misleading to describe capitalism not to 
speak about the market economy as the source of all misery and 
injustice whereas the public sector is described as a perfectly 
working idyll he wrote in tiden 
the conservative newspaper svenska dagbladet called the article 
one of the most remarkable political pieces of recent years and 
said feldt has decided to start the fight for a modernization of 
swedish social democracy 
aftonbladet the popular tabloid owned by the bluecollar union 
lo accused feldt of trying to throw the basic ideals on the 
garbage heap of history and attack the soul of the party

sir yehudi menuhin honored for 
promoting germanjewish reconciliation made a plea for dialogue 
between israel and palestinians 
the chances for positive change are closer than we believe 
the 72yearold virtuoso violinist said sunday during an address to 
west germanys societies for christianjewish cooperation 
earlier menuhin was awarded the buberrosenzweig medal for his 
outspoken efforts to promote dialogue between jews and christians 
the award established in 1968 commemorates the jewish philosophers 
martin buber and franz rosenzweig 
the award cited his performances in germany immediately after 
world war ii including giving concerts for fellow jews and others 
who survived the nazi holocaust 
menuhin said he hoped talks between arabs and jews could produce 
agreement on one state for both peoples 
it may be the modest and lonely view of one man but i believe 
there are only two possibilities either two independent states and 
that means a divided jerusalem or a united jerusalem that would 
mean at the very least a united binational stateisrael must 
follow this second path if it wants to survive

once congressional pages together paul 
kanjorski and bill emerson both realized their dream of being 
elected to the us house 
as if that were not unusual enough both also were witnesses to 
the rarest of events an attack by gunmen on the congress of the 
united states 
kanjorski dpa and emerson rmo stood together on the house 
floor last wednesday to mark the 35th anniversary of an event they 
said will always seem fresh in their minds 
the two were 16yearold pages and roommates on march 1 1954 
the day that four neatly dressed puerto ricans walked into the 
public galleries unfurled a flag shouted free puerto rico and 
began shooting randomly from large automatic pistols 
house speaker joseph w martin jr who had been counting heads 
in a quorum call on a bill dealing with migrant laborers banged 
the gavel 
a few congressmen fell bleeding some raced for the doors some 
hid under the tables 
as one who has never been particularly ageconscious i stand 
in awe of the fact that this event occurred 35 years ago and i 
remember it as though it were yesterday emerson said last week 
kanjorski had just gotten out of his seat on the democratic side 
in the rear of the chamber when the shooting started 
when the shots started to be fired they sounded like 
firecrackers going off kanjorski said last week there were a 
lot of them and they were differentsounding because there were 
several weapons that were being used the only thing that made it 
clear they werent firecrackers is that i got sprinkled with some of 
the marble that flaked off 
emerson thought the noise was firecrackers too but when i 
looked up i could see fire coming out of the end of the barrels of 
those guns 
wounded were reps alvin bentley rmich ben jensen riowa 
george fallon dmd kenneth roberts dala and clifford davis 
dtenn all recovered 
before it was over a photographer snapped a picture of kanjorski 
and emerson carrying one of them off on a stretcher 
as bad as the moment was the news photo gave kanjorski and 
emerson temporary celebrity status among their peers and linked 
them together in time 
all through our lives we have been very close friends 
kanjorski said he classified the odds of both becoming congressmen 
as remote even though he said both dreamed about the 
possibility 
one of the attackers died in 1979 and the other three were given 
presidential clemency the same year after 25 years in prison 
emerson was elected to congress in 1980 kanjorski four years 
later 
i might say it was a great pleasure for me personally when my 
friend paul kanjorski joined us here two terms ago emerson said 
he and i were roommates and colleagues of that era and it was 
great to see an old buddy come back to congress 
i have often thought it the shooting was a terrible thing to 
have happened but since it did i was glad i was here to observe 
that little anecdote in american history emerson said

the white house struggle to save john towers 
nomination has turned into the first major test of president bushs 
political mettle and is being watched as a barometer of how hell 
deal with a congress dominated by democrats 
republican strategists say the stakes are high for bush in 
office only six weeks 
hes got to fight to let the democrats shove him around or to 
knuckle under to them this early in his presidency would only give 
them more feeling that they could go after him down the road said 
lyn nofziger who was the first political director for president 
ronald reagan 
mitchell daniels another white house political director under 
reagan said bush should make clear that there will be political 
consequences for anyone who opposes the administration 
if he just sort of smiles and forgets it i think its the same 
as putting up a kick me sign daniels said 
hes got to put this in the memory bank and as he has 
opportunities out of public view hes got to get even as he makes 
decisions and doles out political favors over the next four years 
said daniels 
while the white house still talked about victory nofziger and 
daniels said there was virtually no chance tower could win 
confirmation as secretary of defense with the democrats holding a 
5545 majority in the senate 
even among republicans there is a feeling that the white house 
has not done a good job with the tower nomination the former texas 
senator has been buffeted by accusations of excessive drinking 
womanizing and conflict of interest with defense contractors 
up until now the brits have had better scandals said rep 
lynn martin an illinois republican this one is understandable 
drinking and sex 
the white house has not tried to pressure congress by drumming up 
a groundswell of public support for tower 
the publics uncomfortable with the rumors daniels said 
theres no prodrunkenness caucus out there 
in a speech last week bush observed this is a tough town a 
lot of rumors out there he has spoken out on towers behalf 
numerous times discounting the allegations against his nominee as 
mere innuendo 
a white house official said bush is not trying to mobilize a 
national campaign on towers behalf because it is not the kind of 
issue that can generate much public support instead he said bush 
is struggling to find a few votes in the senate 
this is a battle with an audience of about eight people said 
the official who declined to be identified by name 
i dont see any point in making this personal bush said 
recently theres no point making this into a fight 
looking ahead to relations with congress after the tower affair 
bush said were going to have to work together on a lot of other 
issues 
andrew card a top lieutenant to bush said the president 
understands politics and he knows that most people dont hold 
grudges and can move from one issue to the next without a lot of 
bias 
by the traditional rules of politics towers nomination should 
have been safe as a former senator he was a member of the 
congressional club the beneficiary of special courtesies and favors 
however the normal scenario turned into chaos for tower when 
paul weyrich a conservative activist testified publicly about 
towers drinking 
what paul weyrich did was to present an uneasy group of 
senators who really didnt like john tower anyway with a fig leaf 
said stephen hess a brookings institution specialist on the 
presidency 
george bush makes ethics and personal conduct almost a hallmark 
of his administration and gets hoisted on his own petard hess 
said 
the white house has acknowledged shortcomings in handling towers 
nomination blaming some of the problems on incompetence and 
inexperience among the new staff 
nofziger traces the mishandling back to december even before 
tower was actually nominated 
they let the naming of him dangle for two months secondly 
after they named him they didnt do anything they just let it sit 
there nofziger said 
when the negative stuff came out they didnt seem to put 
together a campaign to support him nofziger added the only 
support that i see is coming out of the white house and republican 
senators 
just as this thing is beginning to heat up he added 
george bush goes off to the far east and takes with him his chief 
of staff and half his staff leaving nobody to stay behind and fight 
the good fight 
it was on bushs first full day in tokyo that the senate armed 
services committee voted along party lines 119 against towers 
nomination

john tower and his formidable washington 
reputation are under siege in the senate but the oncepristine 
reputation of his principal opponent sen sam nunn of georgia has 
been assailed in the battle as well 
nunn hailed for years as a principled nonpartisan 
hardworking democratic chairman of the senate armed services 
committee is now accused of making a purely partisan grab for power 
theres a lot more going on here than meets the eye says 
sen ted stevens ralaska who characterizes allegations against 
tower of excessive drinking and suspect ties to defense contractors 
as total character assassination 
its a power struggle stevens says john towers opponents 
are contending he is not the person to head the department of 
defense rather than admitting they disagree violently with his 
policies 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas says nunn is 
obviously partisan he has said republicans intend to examine 
the allegation that sam nunn has some motive in his conduct of 
the tower affair 
in nunns case what is under attack is the reputation he has 
built as a highly regarded and respected architect of defense policy 
who puts us security interests ahead of other considerations 
it is sam nunns unique qualities of intelligence thoroughness 
and thoughtfulness that have with good reason made him one of the 
most respected members if not the most respected member of the 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said last week 
although many republicans aim the power play charge against 
nunn and the democrats sen john warner rva the senior 
republican on the armed services committee walks a middle line 
on the one hand he implies there are partisan motivations behind 
the assault on tower on the other he absolves nunn from complicity 
its not a power grab of trying to run the pentagon from 
capitol hill he says 
nunns democratic colleagues are predictably even more 
emphatic 
there has been no power grab by sam nunn or anyone else thats 
hogwash said sen ernest f hollings dsc a tower opponent 
who opened a counterattack of his own 
there is no question about the partisan nature of sen dole and 
his assault on this body he said 
nunn says developments have put him in a nowin situation 
when you agree with them they say hes a statesman nunn 
says if you disagree they say how can he be so partisan 
either i would be a scapegoat because i was taking on a 
president or i would be covering up the alleged transgressions of 
the nominee 
is he upset by the power play accusations 
thats part of the process nunn says theyve got to find 
something to throw at me the only way to handle a situation where 
you dont have the evidence on your side is to go after the person 
who is making the case the effort here is to basically destroy my 
credibility 
is he attempting to assert power over the pentagon to prevent a 
strongwilled leader like tower from taking over 
bob dole knows better than that nunn says its 
preposterous to think that anyone can run the pentagon from capitol 
hill 
as the battle over the tower nomination raged in the senate the 
wall street journal reprinted a december 1972 article from the 
atlanta journal reporting that nunn had pleaded either guilty or no 
contest in 1964 when he was 26 to leaving the scene of an 
accident 
the article implied nunn had been drinking at the time and the 
senator admits it 
i pled guilty to leaving the scene paid my fine apologized to 
all concerned and at age 26 learned a valuable lesson which i have 
not forgotten he says 
i dont know that this is relevant but i guess when youre 
in this kind of fight everything is fair game 
nunn likes to point out that before the presidential election he 
and warner sent a letter to candidates george bush and michael 
dukakis emphasizing the importance of highquality nominees for 
defense department posts 
they said the letter was sent principally to avoid any 
suggestion of partisan motivation 
it hasnt worked out that way

communist party for 32 years until his ouster last year will not 
attend tuesdays meeting of the partys governing central committee 
a newspaper reported 
vasarnapi hirek sunday news quoted party spokesman laszlo major 
as saying kadar would not attend because he has not fully recovered 
from hand surgery but there is speculation he may be staying away 
for other than health reasons 
the 76yearold kadar who now holds the newly created post of 
party president also missed the committees last meeting 
in the last years of kadars rule hungarys economy fell into 
decline and independent groups agitating for multiparty democracy

in elections have now obtained a foothold in the heights of the 
communist party 
the reformers include politicians thrown out of the leadership 
when kadar was installed as party chief in 1956 the year soviet

a nuclearpowered soviet icebreaker came within 40 
minutes of a meltdown last fall when an operator mistakenly drained 
cooling water from a reactor according to a soviet newspaper 
vodny transport a staterun newspaper that covers shipping said 
the incident occurred nov 11 aboard the rossiya while it was docked 
at murmansk 1000 miles north of moscow in kola bay 
it was there for routine changing of a filter in a reactor the 
newspaper said 
the reactor was shut down and cooling water was supposed to be 
drained before changing the filter the newspaper explained but a 
chief physicist aboard the ship gave incorrect instructions to an 
operator who opened a drainage valve on the ships other reactor 
which was in operation vodny transport said in its saturday 
editions 
the main supply of cooling water was drained off mistakenly just 
30 or 40 minutes worth of backup water was left in a reservoir 
before the reactor would have melted down and released radiation 
the newspaper said 
it took four minutes to bring the problem under control 
according to dmitri tarakanov the newspapers murmansk 
correspondent he did not provide details of what action was taken 
radiation could have spread from the ship to the city of 440000 
people tarakanov indicated 
vodny transport comes out three times a week there was no 
explanation for the fourmonth delay in reporting the incident 
a meltdown the worst possible nuclear accident occurs when the 
reactor core overheats to such a degree that the fuel begins 
melting as happened at three mile island in pennsylvania in 1979 
if the fuel penetrates its protective housing radioactive 
materials are released into the environment 
the rossiya was launched from the baltic yard in leningrad in 
1983 and went into operation in 1986 according to janes fighting 
ships it is one of five ships in the arktika class run by the 
soviet merchant marine ministry 
two pressurized water reactors drive the rossiyas steam turbines 
to generate a total 75000 horsepower according to janes 
in january the ship made headlines when it rescued soviet 
researchers stranded on a drifting ice floe north of greenland 
on thursday the government daily izvestia quoted a nuclear power 
official as saying there have been no accidents aboard the rossiya 
or four other nuclearpowered icebreakers a zhuravkov also said 
the reactors on board the ships are a different design from those at 
the chernobyl nuclear power plant in the ukraine where a reactor 
exploded and caught fire april 26 1986 killing at least 31 people 
and spewing radiation worldwide 
an operator cannot race it to a critical state as happened at 
the chernobyl atomic power station zhuravkov told izvestia 
the article quoted m rabkanov chief of the vladivostok port in 
the soviet far east as saying safety of nuclearpowered vessels is 
very reliable 
izvestia said people in vladivostok on the pacific ocean are 
alarmed that a nuclearpowered ship a sister of the rossiya called 
sevmorput was heading their way government authorities in another 
far east port nakhodka supported residents calls to close the 
harbor to the sevmorput 
there was no indication the people quoted by izvestia had heard 
about the reported incident on the rossiya

in a finding hailed as an exciting step toward 
treating humans for the most common form of muscular dystrophy 
scientists have corrected a muscle defect in mice by injecting 
immature muscle cells 
mice that could not make a protein called dystrophin in their 
muscles began to produce it after the injections two teams of 
researchers report 
in humans lack of the protein causes duchenne muscular 
dystrophy the most common and severe form of the disease 
the research represents the most exciting approach for human 
therapy that in my opinion has ever come along said donald 
wood director of research for the muscular dystrophy association 
preliminary experiments in a limited number of duchenne patients 
may begin this summer after researchers from several nations meet 
in june to discuss the issues involved wood said 
those studies focusing on single muscles or a few muscles could 
lead to larger human studies it is too early to say when the 
injection procedure could be made widely available if it proves 
useful wood said 
one mouse study was performed by louis kunkel and eric hoffman of 
harvard medical school childrens hospital and the howard hughes 
medical institute in boston and terry partridge and others at the 
charing cross and westminster medical school in london 
we basically have the first step toward a potential to do 
therapeutics it looks promising said kunkel said in a recent 
interview 
their study is extremely exciting work said theodore munsat 
professor of neurology and pharmacology at the tufts university 
medical school and director of neuromuscular research at the new 
england medical center hospital in boston 
the other mouse research was done by george karpati and 
colleagues at the neuromuscular research group of the montreal 
neurological institute 
both studies were presented at a recent meeting of muscular 
dystrophy researchers in perth australia 
duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder that strikes 
boys almost exclusively appearing in about one in every 3500 male 
births in the united states it causes a progressive weakening and 
wasting of voluntary muscles most patients must use wheelchairs by 
age 12 and most die in their early 20s 
the experiments tested an experimental therapy using immature 
muscle cells called myoblasts which normally help repair muscle 
fibers that have broken because of injury or strenuous exercise 
researchers injected myoblasts into mice that lacked dystrophin 
and found that the myoblasts fused with muscle fibers once inside a 
fiber the myoblast nucleus provided a gene that allowed the fiber to 
begin producing dystrophin 
the scientists could not demonstrate any impact on dystrophy 
symptoms because for reasons not well understood mice that lack 
dystrophin show no outward symptoms in the first place 
kunkels team which reported its results recently in the british 
journal nature found that mouse myoblasts fused to muscle fibers in 
39 of 70 mice that received injections in a leg muscle 
those fibers produced up to 30 percent to 40 percent of the 
normal amount of dystrophin which probably would be enough to ease 
muscular dystrophy symptoms greatly in humans kunkel said 
karpatis experiment involved injecting human myoblasts into the 
thighs of about two dozen mice some dystrophin appeared in every 
mouse karpati said 
segments of muscle fiber that began generating dystrophin 
resisted degeneration while other segments broke down karpati said 
im very optimistic about possible use in humans he said 
scientists still must determine whether the human body would 
reject transplanted myoblasts which probably would be taken from a 
patients brother or father karpati said 
injections would have to be spaced no more than about twofifths 
of an inch apart treating every muscle would be impractical so 
researchers would have to choose those that permit breathing arm 
motion and other key functions karpati said 
he and kunkel also said the injections probably could not treat 
heart damage caused by duchenne karpati said the heart damage 
rarely kills or causes severe disability now but if patients were 
allowed to live to ages 30 or 40 it may have to be addressed

a professors widow is donating his 
scientific papers to the university that fired him in 1953 for 
refusing to say whether he had been a member of the communist party 
alex b novikoffs personal and scientific papers will be 
presented tuesday to the university of vermont where the professor 
of biochemistry spent five years on the most important cancer 
research of his career 
alex didnt have any animosity about the people of the 
university of vermont said his widow dr phyllis novikoff 
alex never lived in the past if something happened you just 
forget it and go on 
some are calling it a final act of forgiveness on behalf of the 
professor one of many faculty members to be fired during that 
period in american history when the country was gripped by fear of 
communism 
mrs novikoff said her husband who died in 1987 at age 73 would 
have wanted the papers where he began his most important work 
including development of a model for studying cancerous liver tumors 
mrs novikoff an associate professor at albert einstein college 
of medicine in new york city where her husband also worked 
collaborated with him on many of the later papers 
on tuesday she will begin delivering shopping bags full of 
manuscripts photographs and personal correspondence dating to the 
early 1940s among the material are two films showing nobel 
prizewinning scientists repeating their most important experiments 
movies that novikoff made for the us army 
i think the papers belong there mrs novikoff said 
connell gallagher the universitys curator of manuscripts said 
novikoffs scientific papers will shed light on the development of 
the universitys medical school the personal and political papers 
also will document the events of the late 1940s and early 1950s 
including novikoffs dismissal 
these events should be studied by every generation of student 
so that they can ward against these kind of things happening in the 
future that will be the lesson of the manuscripts said gallagher 
as in many other cases during the anticommunist hearings of sen 
joseph mccarthy many prominent people stood silent when novikoff 
was called to washington to testify before congressional committees 
the hearings reached into campuses with more than 100 faculty 
members like novikoff being fired for refusing to snitch on 
colleagues said david r holmes a university of vermont professor 
who wrote a recently published book on novikoffs case 
holmes said novikoff and 25 of his colleagues at brooklyn college 
in new york city joined the community party in the 1930s when 
fascism was taking hold in europe and it was a matter of pride to 
be a member of the communist party 
the group focused on improving the working conditions at the 
school said holmes and by 1945 three years before he went to 
vermont novikoff had left the party 
but four years earlier novikoffs friend harry albaum whom he 
had met at brooklyn college told a new york state committee about 
novikoffs party membership novikoff was pegged as a security risk 
and was barred from service in world war ii 
another colleague named him at a hearing in 1951 triggering the 
proceedings that led the university of vermont to fire him two years 
later when he cited his fifth amendment right to refuse to answer 
questions about his political affiliation 
holmes said novikoff approached about the book in the early 
1980s was still reluctant to reveal whether he had been a member of 
the communist party 
that was the fundamental point of principle in 1953 he 
wouldnt answer the question when they asked are you a member of 
the communist party holmes said he felt that was a question 
that was inappropriate 
novikoff returned to university of vermont to address a 
conference at the medical school in 1973 the year holmes cites as 
the end of the inquisition for novikoff because he was cleared 
of being a security risk 
he returned again in 1983 to receive an honorary degree

blind employees at a workshop established 
to rehabilitate them say theyre being exploited and are demanding 
the same wages their sighted counterparts get for comparable work 
but the founder of the southwest lighthouse for the blind says 
the workshop trains blind people for work in the private sector and 
is not required to pay the minimum wage 
the us labor department is investigating the workshops wages 
and lighthouse officials are to appear next month before an 
administrative law judge to defend the separate wage scales for 
blind and sighted employees 
i think theyre trying to have more of a factory out there than 
to do something for the blind said david rocco a former 
lighthouse employee who led a workers strike in august and was laid 
off in january 
the dispute comes at a time when the blind are increasingly 
questioning their treatment at such organizations about 100 similar 
workshops employ 6000 visually impaired people nationwide 
employees at workshops in houston and cincinnati have formed 
unions in the wake of wage and labor disputes unionization efforts 
by workers in little rock ark were denied by an appeals court 
blind people have been exploited in workshops since workshops 
came into being said james gashel director of governmental 
affairs for the national federation of the blind in baltimore 
when youre paying 210 an hour youre going to have a lot of 
wage disputes added the federations president mark maurer 
its not enough money to live on 
in lubbock 14 blind workers carrying canes and wearing signs 
reading lighthouse wages are from the dark ages walked off 
their jobs in august to protest the 205 hourly wage and their 
65amonth health insurance fee 
they want the lighthouse to pay them the same 335 minimum wage 
other employees receive 
the workers returned to work two weeks later union cards were 
distributed and the national labor relations board has since ordered 
a union election negotiations have begun with the teamsters 
the issue stems in part from a clause in the fair labor standards 
act that allows sheltered workshops to pay subminimum wages 
the provision bases a subminimum wage on how much the worker 
produces compared with an experienced nonimpaired worker in the 
same job 
the national federation wants to change that provision 
in the ohio case blind workers at the cincinnati association of 
the blind sought to unionize in 1982 and went to the us supreme 
court the high court let stand a lowercourt ruling ordering the 
workshop to recognize the workers as a bargaining unit the workshop 
had contended the workers were clients receiving rehabilitation 
rather than private employees 
lighthouse officials used the same argument in a nlrb hearing 
were a rehabilitative facility said lighthouse founder bob 
crane we like to take people train them and place them in the 
private sector 
he said however that most people who come to work at the 
lighthouse remain there because they arent capable of working 
elsewhere 
the nonprofit lighthouse in lubbock started in a garage in 1955 
and now employs 55 workers about 40 of whom are blind and five 
staff members crane said 
it is under contract to the federal government to produce 
military items such as helmet chin straps and pads and supports 
itself with the government contracts and donations 
rocco and lighthouse worker joe morales dispute cranes figures 
on the number of employees saying only 25 are blind 
there are more sighted people there than blind said morales 
crane would not comment further 
maurer said that despite the workshops benevolent origins the 
operators underestimate the capabilities of the blind 
what they think is that if youre blind you cant really be 
expected to do anything much he said they think that if 
theyre giving you 2 an hour theyre being charitable to you its 
unreasonable to expect someone to produce and then not be paid for 
their production

a reseacher bitten by a deadly viper has 
stabilized and wont receive antivenins obtained from iran england 
and the soviet union with help from the white house unless his 
condition worsens doctors say 
william e haast 78 remained in serious but stable condition 
today at the university of utah health sciences center spokesman 
john dwan said sunday haast had been moved out of intensive care 
into a regular nursing unit 
his condition has not changed dwan said hes resting 
comfortably and hes had lots of friends visiting him 
haast likely would remain hospitalized for at least two to three 
more weeks dwan said he checked into the hospital wednesday 
haast director of the miami serpentarium laboratories at the 
universitys research park was bitten tuesday on the left hand by a 
pakistani pit viper also known as a sawscaled viper 
haast has been bitten 148 times by snakes and is immune to the 
venom of dozens but he had no immunity to the viper it is one of 
1000 poisonous snakes kept at his lab where venom is extracted for 
research and the manufacture of antivenins 
the serpentologists case drew the attention of stephen studdert 
special assistant to president bush who coordinated the acquisition 
of antivenins from the three countries and expedited their shipment 
to utah all the shipments had arrived by sunday 
none have been used because there are sometimes serious 
reactions to antivenins and doctors dont want to give them to him 
unless they have to dwan explained the reactions could include 
lung and kidney problems he said 
nevertheless dwan said we want to express our appreciation to 
everyone who has worked so hard in obtaining the antivenins 
the vipers venom attacks its victims ability to produce 
fibrinogen an element of blood that regulates coagulation a lack 
of fibrinogen can cause uncontrolled bleeding 
haasts fibrinogen level was near zero wednesday doctors were 
replacing it with transfusions and it appeared haasts body had 
begun to produce the substance 
his fibrinogen level improved to about onethird of normal by 
sunday still dangerously low dwan said 
haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from the san diego 
zoo and from a lab in los angeles but they did not work as well as 
expected 
studdert said the iranian government apparently did not interfere 
with the shipment of the antivenin despite the strained relations 
with the united states iranian leader ayatollah khomeini has often 
called the united states the great satan

their town 
the whole community is against me bush said but im 
staying right here and fighting for my rights they ran the indians 
off several hundred years ago but theyre not running me off

there that bush wants to stockpile more tires and begin shredding

police in suburban quezon city said 
today that they had already hauled into jail about 300 violators of 
a tough antismoking law that took effect a day earlier 
those arrested were locked in holding cells until charges could 
be prepared against them after a few hours they were released 
pending trial 
the dragnet snagged not only scofflaws but unwitting violators 
as well 
one 19yearold youth arrived today at the police station 
puffing on a cigarette carrying food for a friend arrested earlier 
for unauthorized smoking 
the teenager was thrown into the cell with his friend after 
police explained the smoking ban applies in police stations too 
the new ordinance bans smoking in most public places including 
buses restaurants government offices hospitals and theaters in 
the city of about 1 million part of metropolitan manila 
violators who smoke in public places that are not designated for 
smoking face a 10 dollar fine 10 days in jail or both 
no complaints so far said col rodolfo garcia police 
station commander and a reformed smoker speaking about the 
crackdown the people of the city are even pleased because we 
are protecting them 
city officials said they will put up signs along municipal 
boundaries warning people they are entering a nonsmoking city 
vendors selling cigarettes to drivers and passengers of jeeps 
the most common means of public transport warned their customers to 
stash the cigarettes if their vehicles enter quezon city 
but several people complained that they were unaware of the ban 
until they were hauled off public transportation or detained in 
public buildings 
i just arrived from cebu city and i did not know that there 
was an antismoking ordinance here in quezon city salesman 
cesario ong told the journal newspaper 
he was among 13 people arrested sunday during spot checks of 
passenger jeeps along the citys aurora boulevard 
the ordinance is part of a larger antismoking campaign which 
quezon city officials say will include a 10000 media campaign 
against cigarettes 
a private health organization the trichest societies on 
cigarette smoking and health said smoking causes about 85 percent 
of lung cancer deaths in the philippines 
but some radio commentators complained that if city officials are 
worried about public health they should first crack down on 
smokebelching jeeps and buses which clog traffic in metropolitan 
manila 
the philippine daily inquirer balked wondering if police should 
not spend more time protecting filipinos from more dangerous 
criminals in a country with one of east asias highest crime rates 
residents may take comfort in the knowledge that while they may 
fall into the hands of lawless elements at least they will not die 
of cancer the paper said

a concert billed as an aryan woodstock 
for skinheads and white supremacists turned out to be boring and 
uncomfortable because of rain a lack of food and a courtordered 
ban on music 
about 100 people representing half a dozen white supremacist 
groups gathered saturday at a private ranch about 40 miles north of 
san francisco but were far outnumbered by about 400 protesters and 
500 police officers 
they talked about girls they gropingly discussed white 
power they pranced about with nazi flags and insignia but they 
never discussed the ideology of fascism or of anything else wrote 
cherie seymour a former reporter who gained entrance to the event 
seymour who did not specify how she managed to attend the rally 
in the heart of californias wine country described the event in an 
article in todays editions of the san francisco chronicle 
it was simply boring and uncomfortable she said the 
great majority had brought neither rain gear nor food morale hit 
bottom when police refused to let the daughter of white supremacist 
tom metzger return with 100 worth of pizzas 
the event originally was touted as something to bring together 
thousands of white supremacist youths the skinhead bands midtown 
boot boys from oklahoma the hammerheads from wisconsin annd 
kakenkreuz from detroit were expected to perform 
but napa county superior judge w scott snowden ruled friday that 
rally organizers couldnt have music without a permit 
so participants spent most of the day glaring at reporters and 
protesters from a hill 
the gathering was held out of view of the public which was not 
allowed entrance to the ranch there were a few clashes between 
white supremacists and protesters but no arrests or major violence 
what you find is that the people of napa rallied against this 
group that has no purpose other than hate i was real proud of the 
way people stood up said mayor ed solomon 
early sunday the last five white supremacists left the property 
sheriff gary simpson estimated the cost of law enforcement at 
about 400000

the greens party has overcome 
factional feuding appears to have dislodged itself from the 
political periphery and is on a course aimed at attracting voters by 
projecting a more moderate image 
during a weekend congress in duisburg the greens elected a new 
and diverse slate of leaders to replace a leadership long dominated 
by radicals 
there were also signs of moves within the party to consider the 
prospects of a possible coalition government with the main 
opposition social democratic party if chancellor helmut kohls 
governing christian democrats lose next years federal elections 
more than 600 greens delegates came to duisburg to try to put the 
party of leftists antinuclear activists feminists and 
environmentalists back on its feet after its radical leadership was 
brought down in december 
on saturday night the greens elected new leaders who are less 
controversial and more moderate than their predecessors an 
important new change for parliaments most vocal party 
but otto schily a founder of the greens and a respected member 
of parliament says he fears the party that holds 41 of the 497 
seats in parliament could still face problems in improving its voter 
appeal 
there are still greens who insist on holding onto their 
ideological and dogmatic ideas who could hinder our access to 
citizens whose support we really need schily told the associated 
press 
for the first time in recent years a member of the greens 
moderate realos realists faction was elected as one of the top 
three leaders ruth hammerbacher a state lawmaker from lower 
saxony 
the two others are also completely new to the leadership verena 
krieger who comes from the partys radical ranks and ralf fuecks 
whose ideas fall somewhere between those of his two colleagues 
the greens tried to find a leadership that represents a wide 
range of party interests and to avoid giving all power to a single 
faction 
jutta ditfurth one of the radical leaders ousted in december 
stunned the congress by saying she plans to quit the party next 
year she blamed moderate greens for her decision 
but in an unusual show of party unity several other greens 
rejected ms ditfurths attacks 
the 39000member greens party which sprang from protest groups 
in the late 1970s has long been divided by ideological 
disagreements between radical and moderate elements 
the disputes have pitted party members willing to work within 
established political procedures against ms ditfurths radical 
wing the socalled fundis fundamentalists who see little 
value in pursuing a pragmatic legislative course 
after fundis took control of the party leadership in 1987 they 
began returning the party to its radical roots and a highly 
confrontational style of politics that course stalled any effective 
action by the party in parliament 
in december however moderate greens forced the fundis ouster 
from the party leadership with a noconfidence vote 
moderate greens have an added morale boost from the strong 
possibility that the alternative list the greens sister party in 
west berlin will join with the social democrats to run the citys 
government after the christian democrats were ousted from power in 
last months state elections

sixteen ku klux klan members marched 
for white power and a klan leader criticized the movie 
mississippi burning about the slayings of three civil rights 
workers here in the 1960s 
about 100 spectators watched the march and recruitment rally with 
a few people heckling the marchers about 20 law enforcement 
officers also kept watch 
no incidents were reported in the march or during another march 
by about 20 klan members later sunday in meridian about 40 miles to 
the east 
jordan gollub the grand dragon for mississippi said the march 
was held in philadelphia because of the movie which he said 
presented a negative hateful image of the klan 
hollywood is run by jews and integrationists said gollub a 
jew by birth 
the movie which has received seven oscar nominations is loosely 
based on the 1964 slayings of three civil rights workers whose 
bodies were found in an earthen dam near philadelphia a town of 
about 7500 in central mississippi 
james earl chaney 21 who was black and andrew goodman 20 and 
michael schwerner 24 who were white were shot to death the 
federal government eventually convicted eight people of violating 
the civil rights of the three men but no one was ever charged with 
murder 
the klan marchers included 10 men and six women with 10 wearing 
purple green gold and white robes 
police cars preceded and followed the marchers through 
philadelphias small downtown area and six patrolmen walked with the 
group 
philadelphia police chief arden gentry said his entire 16member 
police force was on duty along with neshoba county sheriff glen 
waddell one deputy and two county constables at least one fbi 
agent from meridian also was present 
we knew we were probably one of the best known cities for our 
size in the country and we didnt know what to expect gentry

the american academy of pediatrics today for the 
first time noted evidence of medical benefits of circumcisions for 
newborns but the 37000member organization stopped short of an 
allout endorsement 
the academy said the decision is best made by parents in 
consultation with their physicians 
in addition to the medical aspects other factors will affect 
the parents decisions including esthetics religion cultural 
attitudes social pressures and tradition the group said in a 
statement 
circumcision removal of a band of skin encircling the tip of the 
penis is the nations most commonly performed surgical procedure 
but it appears to be on the decline 
the practice is a controversial issue worldwide the first 
international symposium on circumcision was held last week in 
anaheim calif sponsored by the national organization of 
circumcision information resource centers and the institute for the 
advancement of human behavior 
the symposium concluded that the medical need for circumcision is 
very rare and that ordinarily it should not be done said billy 
boyd a participant and cofounder of the victims speak a group 
working against circumcision 
parents do not have the right to consent to unnecessary medical 
procedures on their children and physicians have an obligation to 
refuse to remove normal body parts the symposium said in a policy 
statement presented to the california medical association 
the right to an intact body supercedes religious or cultural 
practices that include circumcision said donna macris vice 
president of the board of directors of the circumcision information 
resource centers 
since 1971 when the pediatrics academy first took a stand on the 
issue it had maintained that no absolute medical necessity existed 
for routine circumcision of newborns 
but in its statement today it said the procedure has potential 
medical benefits and advantages 
it recommended that physicians explain and discuss the benefits 
and risks of circumcision with parents 
informed consent should be obtained before the procedure is done 
said the academy based in suburban elk grove village 
the group said it was influenced partly by studies at army 
hospitals in 1985 that concluded that among the 200000 males 
studied there was an 11fold increase in urinary tract infections 
in uncircumcised as compared with circumcised infants 
however the academy said allout endorsement was not merited in 
part because the study may have been flawed thus conclusions 
regarding the relationship of urinary tract infection to 
circumcision are tentative 
the academy also addressed the issue of pain caused by 
circumcision 
it said infants undergoing circumcision without anesthesia appear 
to experience pain 
but the academy said reported experience with local 
anesthesia in newborn circumcision is limited and the procedure 
anesthesia is not without risk 
more studies are needed before routine local anesthesia can be 
endorsed the group said

travelers snared in the eastern airlines strike winced at the 
sour taste of labor wars no matter if it was a honeymooning couple 
trapped at new yorks laguardia airport or an unhappy mother leaving 
her marriage behind 
eastern airlines severely underestimated the impact of organized 
labors effort to bring business to a halt and thousands of 
travelers paid the price acknowledged eastern president phil bakes 
whose apologies were little consolation on those caught in the labor 
unrest 
carlos and ileana rodriguez of fairlawn nj got married 
saturday night and had planned to take a sunday morning flight to 
puerto rico 
they spent the first day of their honeymoon in the laguardia 
terminal because there were no pilots to fly the plane 
this is ridiculous said an angry rodriguez im very 
disappointed and disgusted with the whole ordeal 
amid the chaos of miami international airport alana riley sat 
disconsolately on the carpet as her 3yearold son david played 
nearby she said she was in the process of moving from jamaica to 
new orleans 
i picked a hell of a time to move she said im divorcing 
on top of it all its just real hectic to be traveling with a 
3yearold 
the frustration and confusion was replayed at airports around the 
country on the second day of the machinists union strike supported 
by nearly 95 percent of pilots 
a few kept their sense of humor 
salomeja valukas of new haven conn was trying to depart 
laguardia for miami and came to the airport despite warnings it 
would be bad 
what can i do she wondered there are worse things in 
life i went through the war in europe 
lou garber vice president of garber travel in brookline mass 
said his agency had rerouted hundreds in recent days 
its becoming increasingly difficult to find alternative 
routings but weve been working on it for days and are 
accomplishing the task he said 
most airlines offered varying degrees of help except for twa 
said eastern spokesman jim ashlock 
twa is not helping at all american takes passengers on 
standby pan american takes passengers on standby united has been 
helping depending on availability of space either booking them on 
or placing them on standby delta usair and piedmont have the 
same policy he said 
eastern targeted some of its highprofile routes but was unable 
to muster the pilots to fly many planes continental planes made 
special trips to puerto rico to pick up stranded cruise tourists 
we are placing the emphasis on protecting the cruise 
passengers the caribbean routes and the northeast shuttle said 
eastern spokesman robin matell 
he admitted the airline was not finding lodging for all those 
left behind 
weve been able to put many in hotels but this is grand prix 
weekend and the hotels are totally booked said matell in miami 
other events this weekend during a peak of south florida tourist 
activity were the honda classic pga event in neighboring broward 
county the florida derby and baseball spring training 
at miami international airport the strike advanced the confusion 
to a new dimension with anxious travelers peppering harried eastern 
employees in spanish french english and haitian creole 
nobody knows nothing complained 33yearold charlie rink of 
philadelphia theres nobody walking around talking to people to 
explain things they need a trouble shooter 
bakes apologized at a news conference sunday 
we want to apologize for the inconvenience youve 
experienced he said its been a mess 
nobody had to tell alana riley plopped on the floor at miami 
international her efforts to move far away from jamaica quite 
stymied 
i feel for the employees at eastern she said but ive not 
cared for eastern airlines service for the last two years

a judge today ordered the release of 188 
sikhs jailed in a northern city since a 1984 army raid on the 
holiest sikh shrine during which 1200 people were killed a senior 
government official said 
among those to be freed is gurcharan singh tohra head of the 
sikh temple management committee the body which controls most sikh 
shrines and temple funds is considered the most powerful sikh 
organization 
the prisoners release is part of a package announced last week 
by prime minister rajiv gandhi to try to end ethnic violence that 
has wracked the northwestern state of punjab for seven years 
militants are fighting for an independent homeland 
in june 1984 then prime minister indira gandhi ordered the army 
to raid the golden temple in amritsar to rout sikh militants inside

the government declared it has regained 
control after the countrys bloodiest riots in decades and ordered 
elementary schools to reopen today it also gave a new lower death 
toll 
a nighttime curfew remained in effect in the capital and the 
country was still under martial law which allows soldiers to search 
houses without warrants and detain suspects indefinitely without 
charge 
isolated gunfire was heard in the capital early sunday but there

tuskegee mayor johnny ford enters 
tuesdays democratic primary runoff with a historic bid to become 
the states first black congressman this century and in a district 
that is threefourths white 
ford is considered the underdog in seeking to become the 25th 
black in the 435member us house and the first from a deep south 
district where whites are in the vast majority 
the members are watching it very closely said amelia parker 
executive director of the congressional black caucus in washington 
dc a ford victory she said would be an extraordinary message 
at this point in the history of our country 
despite the symbolism ford and his opponent secretary of state 
glen browder have sought to keep race out of the campaign for the 
3rd congressional district seat in mostly rural east alabama 
the runoff winner will face state sen john rice of opelika who 
was a democrat until he switched to republican ranks last year 
ford 46 worked for robert kennedys illfated 1968 presidential 
campaign but he later formed political ties to thenpresident nixon 
and former gov george wallace supporting wallace in his 1974 
gubernatorial bid ford has enlisted the aid of jesse jackson in 
seeking a strong black voter turnout but has said repeatedly that 
race is not an issue 
i am very confident we will win support from people of both 
races who are interested in the best qualified candidate regardless 
of the color of the candidates skin he said 
browder also 46 a former professor who narrowly led ford in a 
splintered democratic field feb 14 is considered the frontrunner 
he has the support of organized labor and has gained recognition for 
advocating campaign finance reform he has not targeted ford or made 
race a factor in the threeweek campaign 
both candidates realize that going into such a short timeframe 
there is no advantage in going after your opponent said browders 
campaign manager dave cooley race is certainly not an issue in 
our campaign 
race is not as much an issue as it has been in the past said 
state sen jim preuitt of talladega a conservative who ran a close 
third in the primary and has since blasted browder as a liberal who 
sold his soul to big labor bosses 
he doesnt want to be known as just a black candidate said 
robert anderson a white high school principal from notasulga who is 
cochairman of fords campaign but he understood that just to 
make the runoff was historic 
the last time a black reached a democratic runoff for a 
congressional seat in the state was in 1978 but chris mcnair lost 
to richard shelby in west alabamas 7th district shelby now sits in 
the us senate 
in the house reps ron dellums dcalif and alan wheat dmo 
are the only blacks to represent districts with majority white 
populations on the scale of alabamas 3rd district in the deep 
south rep mike espy won a mississippi district that was about 
evenly split racially in 1986 and won reelection easily last year 
with strong white support 
robert bush espys administrative assistant said ford entered 
the race with a proven track record with white politicians that 
mike espy didnt have 
ford has been mayor of tuskegee since 1972 and helped found state 
and national conferences of black mayors as well as a multiracial 
organization called the world conference of mayors 
the 3rd district seat was vacated by the death in december of 
rep bill nichols he had kept the seat democratic for 22 years with 
generally conservative defenseoriented politics 
rice 37 is expected to get support from white conservative 
voters who backed nichols but he is a relative newcomer in state 
politics

plo chairman yasser arafat has offered to revive a 
1981 ceasefire with the israelis in south lebanon and to visit 
israel if arab governments approve newspapers said today 
he said israel was negotiating with the palestine liberation 
organization through the united nations for a halt to guerrilla 
operations from south lebanon the papers reported 
israel has said it will not talk to the plo which it considers a 
terrorist organization 
arafat was quoted as saying that reviving the shortlived 1981 
ceasefire which was mediated by un peacekeepers should only 
take place according to our conditions 
in an interview with editors of several kuwaiti dailies he 
stressed that the plo would agree to a truce only if israel stops 
its raids in the region ends its deportation of palestinians and 
stops using arms against the uprising in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip 
under the 1981 accord the plo suspended operations across the 
lebanese border as diplomatic efforts were made to resolve the 
arabisraeli conflict the truce fell apart when the israelis 
invaded lebanon in 1982 
arafats reported offer came after israeli claims that recent 
guerrilla operations in israels selfdesignated security zone 
in south lebanon violated the renunciation of terrorism arafat made 
last december when he also recognized israels right to exist 
the united states lifted a 13yearold ban on direct talks with 
the plo following arafats declaration and has said guerrilla raids 
on israel could have a negative effect on the usplo dialogue that 
began three months ago 
the israelis regularly retaliate for the crossborder raids from 
lebanon with air strikes and ground assaults 
arafat was quoted today as saying i can go to israel only if 
my trip is endorsed by all arabs he was also quoted as predicting 
that an independent palestinian state will be set up within two 
years 
during the 15month rebellion against palestinian rule in the 
west bank and gaza strip israeli authorities have shot to death 
more the 380 palestinians and deported dozens more than 15 israelis 
have died 
arafat who arrived in kuwait saturday presided over the annual 
meeting of the palestinian national fund

nato today urged moscow to cut its tanks 
and artillery in eastern europe by twothirds to give impetus to new 
talks aimed at reducing congressional forces on the worlds most 
heavily armed continent 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze countered with 
demands for percentage reductions by east and west of troops 
tactical nuclear weapons and combat aircraft as well 
shevardnadze proposed that both military blocs reduce troops and 
the main categories of arms by 10 to 15 percent over the next 
two to three years 
in a second phase of two to three years further cuts of about 25 
percent or half a million men should be made by each side he said 
the north atlantic treaty organization will enter the 
negotiations which formally open thursday with a call for lopsided 
warsaw pact reductions of weaponry excluding missiles and combat 
aircraft 
the western military alliance maintains the warsaw pact has 
almost a 2to1 advantage in tanks and artillery 
along the eastwest divide in europe shevardnadze said the two 
blocs should agree on areas where they would reduce limit or 
withdraw the most dangerous destabilizing kinds of arms 
tactical nuclear arms would also be withdrawn from those 
zones he told foreign ministers gathered in viennas historic 
hofburg palace for a threeday 35nation meeting preceding the 
opening of negotiations 
shevardnadze also proposed separate talks on reducing and 
completely eliminating tactical nuclear arms in europe as soon as 
possible 
his speech ran counter to us aims to keep shortrange nuclear 
weapons in west germany which has asked nato to delay any decision 
on modernizing such forces for at least two years 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe of britain speaking after 
shevardnadze and outlining natos proposals for the new talks 
stressed the need to maintain a nuclear presence in europe 
he said shevardnadzes proposals while differing from the 
wests were worthy of serious study 
the vienna negotiations must not become a competition for who 
can put forward the more radical proposals howe said they are 
a serious quest for stability and security and not a competitive 
striptease 
howe proposed an overall ceiling of 40000 tanks 33000 
artillery and 56000 armored personnel carriers in europe those 
totals should be equally divided on each side the 16 nato nations 
and seven warsaw pact countries 
he also proposed a limit of 3200 tanks 1700 artillery pieces 
and 6000 armored troop carriers stationed outside national borders 
on each side 
that would significantly slice the soviet armored presence in 
eastern europe soviet president mikhail s gorbachev announced in 
december a unilateral withdrawal of six tanks divisions and 50000 
men from east germany czechoslovakia and hungary in the next two 
years 
but the soviet union currently has some 10000 tanks stationed 
outside its borders meaning further cuts would be needed to meet 
the nato proposals 
howe said nato is seeking a twothirds reduction in the massed 
ranks of soviet tanks and artillery in europe and by well over half 
in armored troop carriers 
this would not threaten soviet security he stressed because 
the soviet union will still have more tanks within the area than 
the united states and west germany combined 
shevardnadze by contrast said he was not proposing any concrete 
numbers arguing that the fixing of such ceilings should be left to 
experts 
the 35 foreign ministers meeting in vienna are from the nations 
that signed the 1975 helsinki final act the superpowers canada 
and all european nations bar albania 
those 35 nations agreed in midjanuary to launch two sets of arms 
control negotiations to enhance security in europe 
nato and the warsaw pact will discuss how to reduce the 
conventional forces and weapons massed from the atlantic to the ural 
mountains deep inside the soviet union all 35 nations will also 
hold separate talks on measures to build confidence and security 
across europe 
howe said nato would propose at that second forum an annual 
exchange of information about the size location and equipment of 
armed forces and urge random checking to verify that data 
shevardnadze said the new vienna talks should not become bogged 
down in sterile arguments about data a key factor in the failure 
of 15 years of vienna talks on reducing troops and tanks in central 
europe

every man of religion must see himself as hurt by a publication 
like this shapira was quoted as saying if there had been an 
attack for example on our forefather moses or on the prophets 
would we not be shocked 
here we are not talking about criticism but an attack on the 
honor of a religion he said 
shapira acknowledged he lacks the power to order an end to the 
books distribution in israel he also criticized the death threat 
of khomeini saying his fanaticism worries me 
shapira is one of israels two chief rabbis he leads the 
ashkenazi jews who are of european heritage and comprise almost 
half the countrys jewish population chief rabbi mordechai eliahu 
represents jews of middle eastern heritage he was unavailable for

between jews and moslems in this country are very tenuous and we 
shouldnt do anything that jeopardizes them 
the book causes conflicts between different communities and 
even threatens world peace shapira told maariv

officials investigating computer 
spies who passed information from western computers to the soviets 
believe the hackers did not make a major security breach a 
spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor said today 
interior minister friedrich zimmermann called last weeks breakup 
of the spy ring a major blow to the soviet kgb he said friday 
the hackers were an extremely dangerous new threat to security 
but that further inquiry would be needed to determine the extent of 
the damage 
alexander prechtel a spokesman for chief federal prosecutor kurt 
rebmann said today the information obtained by the hackers does 
not appear to be that sensitive 
prechtel made the comment when asked about news reports saying 
the hackers had mainly obtained access codewords for the computers 
he said eight west germans are still under investigation three 
men were arrested last week 
west germanys ard television network said the hackers tapped 
into information from the us defense department and computers 
handling sensitive research on nuclear weapons 
it said the computer networks infiltrated by the hackers included 
the defense departments general databank and a nasa and star 
wars research computer 
the television report said three hackers handed over information 
from the united states japan britain france italy switzerland 
and west germany at a 1985 meeting with two kgb agents in east 
berlin 
the report said authorities believe west german hackers were 
recruited by the soviet intelligence agency in 1985 and were paid 
with cash and drugs

service has been concentrating its efforts for the past week on

the man that detectives most want to bring to trial 
for allegedly killing one of their colleagues is free because police 
played fast and loose in getting a search warrant for a drug raid 
prosecutors say 
three detectives have been suspended while perjury charges are 
considered 
the case has focused attention on how easy and tempting it is 
for police officers to obtain search warrants by citing fictitious 
informants 
defense lawyers contend the practice though illegal is routine 
in boston and many other cities across the nation but prosecutors 
and police say if the use of confidential informants is curbed they 
will lose a key weapon in the war against drugs 
judge jack b weinstein who has spent 22 years on the us 
district court bench in new york city said judges have little 
choice but to trust police when they say they have an informant 
assuming that they were trying to trick me how would i know 
it weinstein said the informant isnt subject to cross 
examination i dont even see the informant i have to rely on the 
us attorney and the law enforcement agencies if they wanted to 
deceive me it would be easy to do so 
in the boston case a superior court judge dismissed all charges 
against albert lewin two weeks ago after police failed to produce a 
mysterious informant identified only as john who supposedly 
tipped them off to a cocaine dealer in the citys dorchester section 
on feb 17 1988 as four detectives prepared to break into the 
dealers apartment two shots were fired from inside the apartment 
one pierced the door and felled 36yearold detective sherman 
griffiths a veteran member of the elite antidrug task force 
when the detectives finally knocked down the steelreinforced 
doorthe apartment was empty they rushed down a back staircase and 
arrested lewin and three other people on a lower floor 
prosecutors later dropped charges against the other three in 
return for testimony against the 33yearold lewin who maintains he 
is innocent 
from the outset a weakness in the prosecutions case was that 
lewin did not match the informants description of the crack dealer 
who occupied the apartment and presumably fired the fatal shot 
according to the affidavit police submitted to obtain the search 
warrant john said the dealer was hispanic and about 5foot6 lewin 
is a 6foot jamaican 
in pretrial hearings last month lewins attorney said john was a 
vital defense witness and judge charles m grabau ordered 
detectives carlos luna hugo r amate and paul g schroeder to bring 
him into court 
when the detectives said they were unable to find the informant 
grabau threw out the charges and lambasted the detectives saying he 
believed they had willfully disobeyed his orders 
last week francis omeara assistant district attorney for 
suffolk county went back into court to make an extraordinary 
accusation he said the detectives had lied to him and the court 
about the informant either to strengthen the case against lewin or 
to protect the search warrant 
and omeara contended the charges against lewin should not be 
dropped he said the actual informant was not john who may or may 
not exist but another man identified in court as y 
lewins lawyer maintains that y is still not the right man 
the judge is scheduled to consider reinstating the charges this 
week in the interim the state attorney general is considering 
perjury charges against the suspended detectives 
none of the three officers could be reached for comment one is 
on vacation in south america and the other two did not respond to 
repeated messages asking them to call 
deputy superintendent james w wood supervisor of the three has 
repeatedly said he accepts full responsibility for the actions of 
the team

eva garcia was praised as a model student last 
december whose perserverance over innercity hardship won her a free 
college education that was to make her a teacher 
but police allege the 18yearold senior lived a secret life that 
came to a head just weeks before when she secretly married and then 
conspired to murder a man more than 20 years her elder 
she seemed to be the kind of kid we were meant to help said 
frank raispis a fellow of the foundation for excellence in 
teaching a private chicago institution that awarded ms garcia and 
14 other teenagers college scholarships 
she was overcoming all this adversity and putting on a bright 
face we said if we could only help one kid this has to be the 
one 
now ms garcia is in cook county jail facing charges of 
conspiracy and murder and a possible death sentence 
the young woman burst into tears last november when she learned 
she was named one of the academy of educators scholars whose 
members get a free college education good summer jobs and up to 
10000 after college in exchange for returning to teach in 
innercity schools 
but police suspect they were tears of frustration over her secret 
marriage just days earlier to 41yearold louie weber police say 
ms garcia feared her marriage was an impossible hurdle to her 
future as a scholarship student and teacher they say ms garcia 
also had a 19yearold boyfriend in mexico she was considering 
marrying

never lived went to dinner on nov 26 then investigators believe

handgun fired once and killed weber with a shot in the head police 
say 
paul rutherford 18 and richard rubalcava 25 have been charged

an aids patientadvocacy group plans to import 
prescription drugs that have not been approved by the us food and 
drug administration for treatment of aids patients according to a 
report published today 
the new yorkbased people with aids health group plans to get the 
drugs from sympathetic doctors in england west germany france and 
japan according to the report in the new york times 
the group will then distribute the drugs to any us patient with 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome who has a note or a prescription 
for the drug from a doctor in this country the newspaper said 
patients costs would be limited to the cost of the drug 
derek hodel executive director of people with aids estimated 
that hundreds of thousands of aids patients may take advantage of 
the program 
last year the fda announced a policy that allows people with 
lifethreatening illnesses to import personal supplies of unapproved 
drugs until now those taking advantage of the policy had to find 
doctors in other countries to prescribe the drugs or else import 
only overthecounter remedies the times said 
dr frank young commissioner of the fda told the times he could 
not say whether the fda would try to stop the people with aids 
effort 
aids patient advocates have criticized the fda saying it has 
been overly cautious about approving aids drugs aids patients say 
they do not have time to wait for more tests on drugs deemed 
controversial by the fda but the federal agency says it has a 
responsibility to protect americans from drugs that could be useless 
or harmful 
the health group said the drug that is most important to them is 
fluconazole a product of pfizer inc that is used to treat 
cryptococcal meningitis afflicting about 10 percent to 15 percent of 
aids patients the company is seeking fda approval of the drug 
which has been approved for sale in england france denmark and 
ireland

the supreme court today turned away an appeal 
by northeastern states seeking to force the federal government to 
crack downn on acid rain and other pollution they say is caused by 
smokestacks in other states 
the court without comment refused to order the federal 
environmental protection agency to take steps to limit interstate 
air pollution 
the us circuit court of appeals here said last july 22 that the 
epa acted properly in dismissing bids by pennsylvania and maine 
officials to force federal action against pollution originating in 
other states 
the appeals court ordered the federal agency to restudy a 
petition by new york officials in light of newly available data 
officials from connecticut vermont new hampshire and new jersey 
joined those from maine and pennsylvania in asking the supreme court 
to overturn the appeals court ruling new york officials did not 
join the appeal to the high court 
the case acted on today stems from petitions filed with the epa 
in 1980 and 1981 by maine new york and pennsylvania claiming that 
soot smoke and sulfur dioxide were blowing in from hundreds of 
miles away 
they argued that pollutants from coalburning utility plants and 
factories in seven other states made it impossible for them to meet 
federal air quality standards 
the seven states complained about are illinois indiana 
kentucky michigan ohio tennessee and west virginia 
the northeastern states said federal law requires the epa to 
force the other states to revise their air pollution control plans 
federal clean air laws give the epa broad power to enforce state 
air quality programs if a states program is inadequate federal 
officials can order industries to clean up or face stiff fines or 
closing down operations 
but in the case acted on today epa officials said there was 
insufficient evidence to prove that air pollution in the northeast 
originated hundreds of miles away the agency also argued that 
federal law is not designed to cover such longrange pollution 
the appeals court here gave deference to the agencys expertise 
this court is being asked to secondguess the scientific 
judgments of the epa the appeals court said we cannot say that 
the epas assessment of the scientific evidence was unreasonable 
the case is maine vs epa 88684

the supreme court today left unresolved whether 
public school students enjoy any constitutional protection against 
paddling or other corporal punishment by teachers and administrators 
the justices without comment let stand a texas law that allows 
the use of all necessary corporal punishment short of deadly force 
in the states public schools 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the texas law in 
dismissing a lawsuit filed in behalf of two kindergarten girls 
paddled severely for snickering 
other federal appeals courts have made it easier to win such 
suits for example the 10th us circuit court of appeals has ruled 
in a new mexico case that at some degree of excessiveness or 
cruelty such punishment violates constitutional rights 
the justices in 1977 ruled that public school disciplinary 
measures involving physical force never can amount to the cruel 
and unusual punishment banned by the constitutions eighth 
amendment 
the decision barred students from suing teachers and school 
administrators in federal court over alleged eighth amendment 
violations but left them free to sue in state courts under state 
laws 
in the 1977 decision however the court said it was leaving 
undecided whether corporal punishment ever may violate substantive 
rights under the 14th amendments due process clause 
the case acted on today came from jacksonville texas where on 
may 6 1987 crystal cunningham 5 and ashley johnson 6 were 
paddled twice once by their school principal and once by their 
teacher 
mary sue bruno the principal at westside kindergarten school 
saw the two girls snickering in the hall and gave each child two 
swats on the buttocks with a wooden paddle 
when the girls returned to the classroom teacher rosa cook saw 
them still snickering she took the girls into the hallway and gave 
each three more swats across the buttocks with a wooden paddle 
each girl missed six days of school the lawsuit filed in their 
behalf said the reason for their absence was severe pain and 
fear over returning to school 
according to court documents both girls were taken to a child 
welfare office where social workers who examined the paddling 
bruises said the two had been subjected to child abuse 
the federal lawsuit seeking monetary damages alleged that ms 
bruno ms cook and other school officials violated the girls 
constitutional rights with conduct excessive brutal 
disproportionate to the circumstances and shocking to the 
conscience 
the suit said the paddlings violated the girls dueprocess and 
equalprotection rights 
a federal trial judge threw out the suit relying on past 5th 
circuit court rulings that corporal punishment generally does not 
violate any constitutional rights 
the 5th circuit upheld the dismissal last oct 26 
in seeking supreme court review lawyers for the girls cited 
department of education studies indicating that 30000 american 
schoolchildren are physically injured each year because of the 
infliction of corporal punishment to a degree that requires medical 
treatment 
the appeal said those studies estimate at at least 100000 
children develop emotional and learning disabilities from excessive 
and inappropriate school punishment each year 
the girls appeal was supported in a friendofthecourt 
brief submitted jointly by the american medical association and the 
national committee for prevention of child abuse 
the case is oconnor vs beavers 881181

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether prison inmates are entitled to a court hearing and other 
safeguards before being forced to take antipsychotic drugs 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by washington state 
officials who say judges should not be allowed to interfere with the 
professional judgment of prison administrators and doctors 
the washington supreme court ruled last july that convicted 
robber walter harper must be given a court hearing before he is 
forced to take antipsychotic drugs 
the state court also said that prison officials must show a 
compelling state interest for giving harper the medication and show 
the drugs will be effective 
the states compelling interest can be demonstrated by a need to 
preserve life to protect other individuals who might be harmed by 
harper to prevent his suicide and to maintain the ethical 
integrity of the medical profession the state court said 
harper was imprisoned in 1976 and for the next four years was 
incarcerated primarily in a mental health unit where he agreed to 
take antipsychotic drugs 
he was paroled in 1980 on condition he agree to receive 
psychiatric treatment 
his parole was revoked after he attacked two nurses at saint 
cabrini hospital in seattle 
back in prison harper was placed in a unit for offenders with 
serious behavioral or mental disorders he agreed to take 
antipsychotic drugs until november 1982 when he refused to take 
the medication any longer 
a committee of prison officials decided harper should be given 
the drugs against his will and that decision was upheld by the 
prison superintendent 
harper filed a civil rights suit in 1985 seeking to block 
officials from giving him the medication and to win monetary damages 
for violations of his rights 
a state judge dismissed the suit but the state supreme court 
revived it ruling that competent adults have a right to determine 
what shall be done to their bodies 
the state court said treatment with antipsychotic drugs is no 
less intrusive than electroshock therapy 
while the drugs are beneficial to acutely ill patients they also 
can have serious side effects ranging from involuntary spasms to 
permanent brain damage the state court said 
it noted that a court hearing will ensure the prisoner the right 
to be represented by a lawyer to crossexamine witnesses and to 
examine the states files such a hearing also will guarantee other 
dueprocess protections the state court said 
state officials said the state courts ruling improperly will 
insert the state and federal judicial systems into medical and 
institutional administrative decisions 
the case is washington vs harper 88599

union an independent political party 
the central committee had spoken out against allowing the free 
access of informal groups to the television sokolov said

expressed alarm over rising tension in the republic saying even the 
party was feeling the effects of ethnic stratification 
of latvias 26 million inhabitants 54 percent are latvians and

authorities said today at least 130 people 
died and 151 were critically ill after hundreds of laborers drank an 
illegal homemade liquor in the only indian state where the sale of 
alcohol is banned 
doctors said hospitals were unable to cope with the rush of 
victims and that there was little chance the most seriously injured 
of the 251 hospitalized victims would surviveat least 25 people 
were blinded by the tainted brew 
the local government announced police arrested three people who 
supplied the liquor several policemen were suspended for failing to 
avert the tragedy the government said 
baroda is a major industrial center in gujarat the only indian 
state where it is illegal to sell alcohol the city 560 miles 
southwest of new delhi is home to 25 million people 
according to the united news of india the son of one supplier 
and the son of a prominent local politician were among those killed 
by the moonshine 
the bootleg liquor is normally a mixture of ethyl alcohol alum 
and natured spirits but this time industrial methyl alcohol was 
mixed to the brew known locally as lattha which is sold in 
plastic sacks for the equivalent of 10 cents methyl alcohol 
paralyzes the central nervous system 
most survivors were too ill to speak but one told the press 
trust of india news agency the only difference he noticed was that 
the liquor was sweeter than normal 
press trust said many of the victims became dizzy and complained 
of nausea and stomach aches before losing consciousness 
a doctor at the staterun sir siyaji general hospital which was 
treating most of the victims said conditions at the facility were 
precarious with groaning victims crowded against each other on the 
floor on stretchers and occasionally three to a bed 
we do not have enough bottles of glucose to even administer 
first aid to the victims the doctor said speaking on condition 
of anonymity there are no free stretchers to bring in more 
patients because people are already sleeping on them 
gujarats chief minister amarsinh chaudhary ordered an 
investigation and promised action against the police officials who 
failed to avert the disaster the times of india reported 
the newspaper said most of the victims were poor laborers who 
bought the liquor saturday morning after receiving their monthly 
wages the first deaths were reported about midnight saturday it 
said 
as news of the deaths emerged police fanned out across baroda 
with loudspeakers blaring warnings about the liquor 
about 300 people have died in seven illicit liquor cases in 
gujarat during the last decade united news said two of the 
previous cases occurred in baroda with others reported in ahmedabad

the supreme court today agreed to review the 
stiff fines imposed against four yonkers ny councilmen for 
defying a federal judges order to adopt a housing desegregation 
plan 
the justices said they will study arguments that the judge 
exceeded his power in imposing the contemptofcourt fines 
the case attracted national attention last summer as the defiant 
councilmen were threatened with jail as well as fines and the city 
faced possible bankruptcy for refusing to obey us district judge 
leonard sands order 
faced with massive layoffs of city workers the city council 
voted last sept 10 to comply with sands order to build 1000 
lowcost homes to desegregate middleclass areas of the city 
but yonkers located just north of new york city had to pay 
819000 in fines each of the four councilmen was ordered to pay 
3500 for being in contempt of a desegregation order issued the 
previous aug 2 
the case stemmed from a justice department lawsuit begun in the 
carter administrations waning days in 1980 
sand in 1985 ruled that yonkers officials intentionally and 
unlawfully promoted racial segregation through the citys housing 
and school policies 
he ordered the city to desegregate the school system and build 
subsidized housing in predominantly white sections of the city 
city officials agreed in january 1988 to build 200 units and make 
plans for 600 more they later sought to back out of the agreement 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last august said sand acted 
properly in holding the city and the four councilmen in contempt 
after the council voted 43 against a package of financial 
incentives designed to attract development of 800 low and 
moderateincome homes 
sand imposed fines against the city starting at 100 a day and 
doubling daily until officials lived up to their desegregation the 
appeals court put a cap of 1 million a day on the fines and upheld 
the judges 500aday fine for each councilman 
the councilmens jail terms were blocked temporarily by a supreme 
court order last september and the threat of imprisonment was 
lifted after the council relented and adopted the desegregation plan 
the four councilmen are nicholas v longo edward j fagan jr 
peter chema and vice mayor henry spallone 
the appeals court said the four are not protected by legislative 
immunity against the contempt order and fines because the city 
government previously consented to abide by a courtapproved 
agreement to desegregate 
no litigant least of all public officials sworn to uphold the 
constitution of the united states may be permitted to avoid 
compliance with solemn commitments they have made in a consent 
judgment entered by a federal district court to remedy 
constitutional violations the appeals court said 
the 2nd circuit court also rejected arguments that the 
freespeech rights of the councilmen were violated they remain 
free to express their views on all aspects of housing in yonkers 
but not to violate lawful court orders the appeals court said 
the appeals court also turned back the citys argument in 
effect one made in behalf of the city treasury and the taxpayers 
that it was powerless to compel the council members to adopt the 
housing desegregation plan 
the city cannot view itself as an entity separate from the city 
council for purposes of complying with the consent judgment to 
build the homes the appeals court said 
the justices today granted the appeals of the four councilmen but 
rejected an appeal filed in behalf of the city 
the cases are spallone vs us 88854 yonkers vs us 
88855 chema vs us 88856 and longo vs us 88870

the supreme court today barred a lawsuit 
against a former federal prosecutor who refused police protection to 
a witness gunned down before she could testify 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that the 
prosecutor was not legally responsible to protect the woman killed 
in new york city along with three cbs employees who tried to come to 
her aid 
former assistant us attorney stephen schlessinger was sued by 
the family of lena margaret barbera 
she was abducted from a rooftop parking area in manhattan on 
april 12 1982 and later was shot to death along with the cbs 
workers 
irwin margolies president of candor diamond corp was convicted 
of murder along with the hit man donald p nash 
the government had been investigating alleged fraud in margolies 
business ms barbera an accountant there agreed to cooperate in 
the investigation 
prosecutors agreed to allow her to plead guilty to one count of 
fraud and recommend she not serve any jail sentence 
in december 1981 schlessinger allegedly told margolies lawyer 
henry ostericher that barbera and another unnamed woman working at 
candor were cooperating with the government 
court papers suggested schlessinger was trying to put pressure on 
margolies to confess to fraud 
soon after the schlessingerostericher conversation another 
former candor employee jenny soo chin disappeared ms chin a 
close friend of ms barbera apparently was suspected by margolies 
of being the other witness cooperating with prosecutors 
ms chins body never was found but there was testimony that nash 
displayed a photograph of her corpse to margolies as proof he had 
killed her 
ms barbera then requested police protection for herself for the 
second time and schlessinger again denied it 
the suit against schlessinger accused him of violating her rights 
by negligetly and recklessly denying her protection that could have 
saved her life 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals threw out the suit in 
december 1987 
the appeals court said prosecutors have qualified immunity from 
suit when their conduct does not violate clearly established rights 
of individuals 
we cannot say that it was clearly established that the 
government had created or assumed a special relationship with 
barbera the appeals court said it would have been speculative 
at best to conclude that barbera was entitled to police protection 
or that the government was otherwise obliged to safeguard her from 
those against whom she was going to testify 
just last month the supreme court ruled in a wisconsin case that 
the government has no constitutional duty to protect individuals 
from private violence or abuse 
the new york case is barbera vs schlessinger 872034

the supreme court today left intact a 90000 
libel award won against six american newspapers serving 
koreanamerican readers 
the justices without comment turned away arguments that the 
newspapers should not have been legally liable for accurately 
reporting an announcement made by a south korean government agency 
at issue was the scope of the legal immunity a news organization 
enjoys when accurately and fairly reporting about government reports 
or public proceedings despite their defamatory nature 
in the case acted on today the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
ruled that the socalled fair report privilege does not apply to 
reporting about acts by foreign governments 
two intelligence agencies of the south korean government issued a 
62page press release on sept 9 1985 announcing the 
disruption of two north korean spy rings operating in the united 
states and west germany 
the government agencies said one of the spy rings was run by 
students at western illinois university and identified changsin 
lee as one north korean agent 
lee who emigrated to this country from south korea in 1975 and 
graduated from western illinois in 1984 now lives in new york city 
he recently became a us citizen 
lee sued six newspapers and a virginia television station in 
federal court in virginia alleging that their reports libeled him 
by reiterating the south korean governments announcement 
a federal trial judge threw out the suit noting that virginia 
law includes a fair report privilege the judge said that lee could 
not win his libel suit because he could not prove the newspapers and 
television station acted with malice 
the 4th circuit court reinstated lees suit last june 20 ruling 
that the fair report privilege should not have been invoked 
the appeals court by a 21 vote said the privilege never should 
apply to a news organizations reporting on information received 
from foreign governments 
because we find that foreign governments are not necessarily 
more reliable than domestic nonofficial sources we are not willing 
to enlarge the scope of the fair report privilege to include 
information from such governments the appeals court said 
it added some countries may take advantage of our liberal 
first amendment rights in order maliciously to defame or carelessly 
and without adequate inquiry excoriate private parties 
the ruling meant lee could win his libel suit against the news 
organizations by proving the government report about him was false 
and made negligently 
the ruling also cleared the way for a libel trial in which a 
jury earlier this year awarded a total of 90000 against the six 
newspapers the television station wnvctv was found not to have 
libeled lee 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the six newspapers 
argued that the fair report privilege for reporting on foreign 
goverments sometimes should be available 
the newspapers are the korea herald the donga iblo joongang 
ilbo the chosun ilbo the korea times and the sae gae shinbo 
the case is the donga ilbo v lee 881145

the supreme court today ordered more hearings 
in the case of three pennsylvania school officials sued by a former 
student who says she was sexually abused by her high school band 
instructor 
the justices said a federal appeals court should review its 
ruling that the school officials sued by kathleen stoneking a 
former student at bradford area high school are not entitled to 
qualified legal immunity 
the justices said the appeals court ruling should be restudied in 
light of their feb 22 decision in a wisconsin case that government 
has no constitutional duty to protect individuals from private abuse 
or violence 
whether that decision controls the pennsylvania case is not 
clear however since the lawsuit alleges that a state employee 
not a private citizen administered the abuse 
ms stoneking was graduated from high school in 1983 her 1987 
lawsuit contends that school principal frederick smith assistant 
principal richard miller and school district superintendent 
frederick shuey violated her rights by failing to protect her 
the suit alleges that beginning in ms stonekings sophomore 
year band instructor edward wright sexually harassed and abused 
her and forced her to engage in various sex acts with him 
the suit alleges that the school officials named as defendants 
knew of complaints against wright involving other female students 
it states that the school officials either knew or recklessly failed 
to discover that wright was sexually abusing female band members 
wright was suspended in 1986 and later resigned he pleaded 
guilty to criminal charges including indecent assault that same 
year 
the three officials sued by ms stoneking sought to have the case 
thrown out before reaching a trial they said they were entitled to 
qualified immunity a legal doctrine shielding public officials 
from liability when their conduct does not violate clearly 
established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable 
person would have known 
a federal judge refused to throw out the case and that ruling 
was upheld on a 21 vote by the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
last sept 12 
the school officials then sought help from the supreme court 
the case is smith vs stoneking 88802

police opened fire today on tibetan 
proindependence protesters and reportedly killed at least four in 
the second day of violence in the tibetan capital foreign travelers 
said 
the sound of automatic weapons fire and exploding tear gas 
canisters could be heard over the telephone late in the night 
the reports from lhasa were not immediately confirmed by official 
media which reported 11 people killed in street clashes and more 
than 100 wounded in the tibetan capital sunday efforts to reach 
government officials in lhasa were unsuccessful 
an american traveler said tibetans put sundays death toll at 
closer to 30 but that could not be confirmed 
the fighting was the fourth violent clash between tibetans and 
chinese in 18 months and occurred on the first anniversary sunday 
of one of the previous clashes 
tibet remains largely closed to journalists and the only 
independent reports came from travelers who spoke on condition of 
anonymity for fear of police reprisals 
police stationed on rooftops in lhasas main square fired down 
into crowds of tibetans at about 5 pm a traveler from new orleans 
said in a telephone interview 
he said he arrived on the scene shortly after the shooting and 
was told by tibetans that at least two people were killed 
other travelers confirmed hearing gunshots and seeing police on 
the roof 
another american also speaking on condition of anonymity for 
fear of police reprisal said he saw police open fire several hours 
later on about 40 tibetans who were marching toward the main square 
he said he did not see marchers fall but said tibetans told him 
two were killed 
chinas official xinhua news agency said earlier that one 
policeman and 10 tibetans were killed sunday in clashes in lhasa 
while 40 police and more than 60 tibetans were injured 
earlier today foreign travelers in lhasa said police showed 
restraint as thousands of tibetans marched through the streets 
chanting proindependence slogans and hurling goods looted from 
chineseowned stores onto bonfires 
protesters today stoned any chinese who tried to bicycle through 
the area and dragged some from their bikes the witnesses said 
at about 7 pm hundreds of police moved from the chinese sector 
into the tibetan part of lhasa on foot and in jeeps firing 
occasionally the witnesses said 
about 40 stonethrowing protesters shouting free tibet 
marched toward the citys central market soon afterward and were met 
by police gunfire said one american witness 
the american coughing from tear gas said he saw about 10 police 
beating three tibetans nearby 
sundays protest was begun by buddhist monks and nuns who 
apparently were marking the anniversary of a daylong battle in which 
24 people were killed at least 40 were killed in the earlier 
clashes in the remote southern region 
they paraded illegally through the market and were joined by 
several hundred people who stoned a nearby police station 
a swedish traveler who gave his name only as pontus said he ran 
to the roof of the jokhang temple for a better view 
there were six people to the left of us taking pictures of the 
crowd then they dropped their cameras and started firing with 
handguns into the crowd pontus said he said no warning was given 
he said he and four companions some of whom took pictures of the 
shooting had their cameras and passports confiscated 
at about 3 pm a group of tibetan youths carrying the banned 
precommunist tibetan flag began north of the market said travelers 
who watched from a hotel on the street 
hundreds of tibetans joined them but police fired tear gas and 
bullets the travelers said 
xinhua said the protesters fired at police and that police 
were forced to fire as no other means could stop the rioters it 
did not make clear which side began shooting first 
however none of the nearly one dozen travelers interviewed 
reported seeing tibetans with guns 
old people were picking up stones to give to the young people 
to throw said one of the americans 
china claims its sovereignty over tibet dates to the 13th century 
however many tibetans dispute the claim and demand independence 
under their former spiritual and temporal leader the dalai lama he 
fled to exile in india during a failed uprising in 1959 nine years 
after the region came under communist control

a judge who gave a rapist a 
lenient sentence because he said he didnt want to keep him from his 
goal of becoming a police officer has provoked outrage in this 
normally peaceful upper peninsula community 
two weeks ago visiting alger county circuit judge charles stark 
set aside his original verdict in the rape case and instead 
convicted david caballero under a youthful offenders act for 
attacking a fellow college student 
the move spared caballero jail time he was ordered to spend 
three years on probation and pay 975 in court costs and 200 
compensation to the victim if he complies with the terms his 
record will be expunged his court file has been suppressed 
stark said he took the action partly because caballero 21 was a 
criminal justice major and the conviction would have prevented him 
from achieving his goal of becoming a police officer 
the judge issued the original rape conviction jan 10 after a 
bench trial if the judge had not revised it caballero would have 
faced a minimum fiveyear prison sentence for two counts of 
firstdegree criminal sexual conduct 
chippewa county prosecutor patrick shannon said he will appeal 
the sentence 
starks action has prompted more irate calls to the sault ste 
marie evening news editorial offices than any story in recent 
memory said the newspapers editor ken fazzari 
i think they would lynch the judge if they had him right 
here fazzari said 
the victim was hospitalized for emotional stress after the 
incident and transferred from lake superior state university to a 
college out of state she said she was devastated by the lenient 
sentence 
the state holmes youthful trainee act allows for special 
treatment of a defendant whose crime occurred before age 20 
stark convicted caballero jan 10 of two counts of rape in the 
dec 18 1987 attack stark said he couldnt convince prosecutors 
to consider a lesser charge that would have allowed for reduced jail 
time he invoked the youthful offenders act even though caballero 
already was 20 years old when the rape occurred 
this was a very unhappy choice for us the judge said 
caballero has left lake superior state and is studying criminal 
justice at the university of michigan at dearborn said his 
attorney david goldenberg 
the victim said caballer followed her around at a small campus 
party and insisted on walking her back to her dormitory room at 3 
am 
when they arrived caballero placed himself so that as soon as 
i unlocked and opened the door he could get in 
i said i appreciate your walking me back here but youre not 
allowed in here the detroit free press quoted her as saying 
caballero then followed her into the room forced her onto her bed 
and tore off her clothing she said

state to clean up the crimeridden block with office towers arts 
facilities and a merchandise mart 
new york newsday said it learned that the board of the public 
development corp is scheduled to vote march 22 on a tentative 
agreement in which the city would pay about 2 million for leases on 
the theaters

but officials said that by buying out the leases the city will get 
control of the theaters sooner and be able to convert them to such 
uses as drama and dance rehearsal halls

the supreme court today ordered a federal 
appeals court to consider freeing a pennsylvania city and one of its 
police officers from paying a 66000 award over a 1981 beating 
death 
the justices said the appeals court should restudy the case in 
light of their feb 22 decision in a wisconsin case 
in that ruling the high court said government officials have no 
constitutional duty to protect individuals from private violence or 
abuse 
in the pennsylvania case a federal jury awarded 66000 to mamie 
horton whose son douglas powdrill was beaten to death at the cash 
club in new kensington pa on nov 10 1981 
the jury found that the city and police sergeant william dlubak 
violated powdrills right by failing to protect him 
the cash club a private social club was managed by charles 
pope flenory a retired new kensington policeman and a friend of 
dlubak 
flenory allegedly summoned dlubak to the club to frighten 
powdrill into confessing that powdrill stole some records from the 
clubs disc jockey 
powdrill tearfully pleaded with dlubak to take him out of the 
club but the officer refused according to court records 
dlubak allegedly told flenory i guess you can take care of 
this yourself 
after dlubak left powdrill and milton patrick who also was 
suspected in the theft of the records were beaten severely by club 
employees patrick survived but powdrill died 
while the beatings were going on friends of powdrill arrived at 
the club and then went to the police station a block away to ask for 
help 
the two officers who arrived at the club to investigate left 
within a few minutes after talking to flenory 
mrs horton alleged that the police department for years had 
failed to investigate beatings and other criminal activities at 
flenorys club 
she sued the city and dlubak under a federal civil rights law 
and the jury awarded 65899 to mrs horton 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals which upheld the award 
last august noted that new kensington had a handsoff policy 
toward complaints of drunkenness at the citys private clubs 
the policy said when a call is received from a private club 
where the complaint is intoxication the club should be tactfully 
encouraged to handle its own problem such a club is not a public 
place and arrests are invalid 
the 3rd circuit court said dlubaks handling of the case was in 
line with that policy and therefore the city can be held liable for 
violating powdrills rights 
the appeals court said city officials argued that although 
dlubak could reasonably foresee serious harm befalling powdrill he 
owed powdrill no duty we disagree 
the supreme court has ruled that cities may be sued successfully 
in such cases when someones rights are violated in accord with a 
municipal policy or custom 
in the appeal acted on today new kensington officials said 
dlubak did not create or exacerbate the allegedly dangerous 
condition at most he can be charged with failing to exercise due 
care in investigating a crime the burglary at the cash club 
the citys appeal said there was no evidence dlubak relied on the 
socalled handsoff policy toward private clubs when he left the 
matter in flenorys control 
in a criminal case stemming from the incident ronald devaughn a 
disc jockey at the club pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced 
to 15 to 20 years in prison 
the case is new kensington vs horton 88816

the trial of a retired librarian will hinge 
on whether a jury believes he was temporarily insane when he fired 
on children shoppers and police officers during a sevenhour siege 
killing six people 
lawyers for william b cruse 61 planned to argue that alcohol 
and psychiatric problems caused him to open fire with a 
semiautomatic rifle a shotgun and a revolver outside his home in 
the coastal community of palm bay and at two adjacent shopping 
centers 
jury selection began today with circuit judge john antoon 
convening a pool of more than 100 people from which to select a 
12member jury and several alternates 
the shooting spree april 23 1987 led to 36 felony charges that 
could send cruse to the electric chair six counts of firstdegree 
murder 28 of attempted murder and two of kidnapping 
the trial was moved 75 miles west to bartow after a telephone 
survey suggested that many people in central floridas brevard 
county believed cruse guilty 
in a videotaped interview after his arrest cruse calmly told 
police he believed neighbors strangers and supermarket employees 
were constantly spreading rumors that he was homosexual he said he 
had to stop it 
i just wanted people to leave me alone he said in the tape 
shown publicly for the first time thursday during a hearing i had 
to do something to stop them i know im not queer 
but he added i was drunk and crazy and i just dont remember 
hurting anyone 
seemingly meek cruse has a reputation as an arrogant demanding 
prisoner at brevard county jail where he has been held without bond 
since his arrest 
he quit eating at one point claiming that jailers were trying to 
poison him and he had to be forcefed through a tube in his nose 
for several days 
most of the time he was kept in the jails medical unit not ill 
or suicidal but because officers feared he might be killed by other 
inmates 
he is not a very likable person said sheriff jake miller 
a courtappointed attorney announced an insanity defense early 
on and lawyers for the public defenders office now handling the 
case have been proceeding along those lines cruse was found 
competent to stand trial 
under florida law a person can be found innocent by reason of 
insanity if they are unaware of their actions or unable to 
distinguish between right and wrong at the time 
investigators have said cruse confessed shortly after his arrest 
in the videotape of his interrogation cruse acknowledged firing his 
guns which he seaid he took to the shopping centers to make people 
stop talking about him 
i just suppose i wanted to scare some people he said i 
hope i made an impression on them 
prosecutors say that after cooking dinner for his wife malahat 
who suffers from parkinsons disease he left their modest home and 
fired on neighborhood children wounding a teenage boy playing 
basketball 
as investigators later reconstructed the crime the gunman then 
drove to the nearby palm bay shopping center and opened fire first 
with one weapon and then another leaving the parking lot of a 
supermarket littered with bodies 
three shoppers were killed and others wounded in the first 
outburst 
the gunman then drove across a busy highway to the sabal palm 
square shopping center left his car and killed the first police 
officer to arrive he wounded a second policeman reloaded his 
revolver and fatally shot that officer between the eyes 
the gunman then moved to the another supermarket blasted out the 
storefront glass and burst in spraying the store with bullets as 
some 100 customers and employees ran from the store or hid one 
customer was killed 
he found a clerk hiding in a store restroom and took her hostage 
police closed in and tried to persuade him to surrender after 
the clerk escaped police fired tear gas and stormed the store 
cruse stumbled out and was captured as he tried to flee authorities

president bush remains opposed to intervening 
in the eastern airlines strike his spokesman said today as a 
congressional committee made plans to hold a hearing on bushs 
refusal to head off the walkout 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater asked by reporters 
whether bush had second thoughts about refusing to invoke the 
railway labor act to stop the strike said we have no indication 
of any change 
but fitzwater also said bush was receiving daily briefings on 
the situation and said transportation secretary samuel skinner had 
met with the president on the situation sunday night 
skinner said today that he and bush were pleased that the strike 
by easterns machinists union had not spread to other airlines and 
to railroads the union called off plans for secondary picketing 
after a new york federal judge ordered employees of other airlines 
not to honor any machinists picket lines 
were encouraged by the fact that no secondary picketing has 
occurred skinner said on nbctvs today show thats an act 
of responsibility by the unions and the president and i are very 
appreciative 
fitzwater said bush still firmly believes that the labor dispute 
can best be resolved by the company and the union in negotiations 
rather than through direct government intervention 
but the eastern strike looms as the second major confrontation 
this week between bush and a democratic congress already battling 
over john towers nomination as defense secretary 
the aviation subcommittee of the house public works committee 
will hold a hearing tuesday on bushs refusal to intervene hours 
before 8500 striking machinists union members with support from 
pilots and flight attendants virtually shut down the nations 
seventh largest airline 
bush on friday rejected the recommendation of federal mediators 
and 33 senators to appoint an emergency board and order a 60day 
coolingoff period that would have forestalled the strike 
administration officials said bush would not allow unions to wage 
economic blackmail 
that decision which had been sought by the management of 
eastern and the head of its parent company texas air chairman frank 
lorenzo was the first time in the 63year history of the national 
mediation board that a president has rejected its advice 
anticipating bushs decision reps glenn anderson dcalif and 
james oberstar dminn respectively chairmen of the public works 
committee and its aviation subcommittee introduced a bill last 
thursday directing the president to empanel an emergency board and 
order the strikers back to work 
i think the president got bad advice and his organization just 
misjudged the circumstances oberstar said sunday some outside 
force needs to be brought to bear to resolve this the machinists 
would be constrained to accept the recommendation of even a george 
bush board 
instead bush and transportation secretary samuel skinner said 
the administration would ask congress to outlaw secondary boycotts 
in the transportation industry if machinists put up picket lines at 
other airlines and railroads to cripple them as well 
skinner said the administration is opposed to congressionally 
imposed contract settlements the last time congress did was two 
years ago when track maintenance workers threatened to expand a 
strike against the maine central railroad into a nationwide walkout 
president reagan twice asked congress to outlaw secondary labor 
boycotts at airlines and railroads they already are illegal in 
other industries under the 1947 tafthartley law but on both 
occasions the legislation was never even considered by the 
democraticcontrolled congress 
buoyed by their success in allowing fewer than 100 of easterns 
1000 scheduled flights to take place on the first day of the 
strike the machinists said they would not try to spread the walkout 
to railroads and other airlines on monday but they did not rule out 
secondary boycotts later 
meanwhile more than 37000 union pilots at other airlines have 
vowed to launch a worktotherule slowdown on tuesday in support of 
the eastern machinists skinner said that could inconvenience 
millions and millions of people 
oberstar said democratic congressional leaders have decided to 
let the house take the lead in opposing bushs stance in the eastern 
strike while the senate maintains a second battle front on tower 
the senate is really waiting to see what the house does 
theyre waiting for us to move he said 
tower on sunday repeated his pledge to stop drinking if confirmed 
by the senate as secretary of defense but said he saw no reason to 
do so otherwise and accused his detractors of hypocrisy 
he also said he would relish a chance to appear on the senate 
floor this week to defend himself as suggested by the senate 
republican leader sen bob dole of kansas senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine has not responded to doles suggestion 
appearing sunday on the abctv program this week with david 
brinkley dole promised a lot more debate indicating a final 
confirmation vote might not come for another week 
congress will continue hearings tuesday through friday on bushs 
proposal to bail out depositors in savings and loan associations who 
sought federally insured high interest rates under deregulation from 
now insolvent sampls 
the congressional budget office last week put the 10year cost to 
taxpayers of bushs sampl plan at 84 billion to 110 billion 
compared to the 15 billion government stake in bailing out the 
chrysler corp in 1980 
however unlike the federal loan guarantees that were repaid by 
chrysler when it again turned profitable no one ever expects the 
government to recoup the money that bush is asking taxpayers to 
shell out for the sampl depositors 
another skirmish between the administration and congress will 
occur wednesday when the senate labor committee is scheduled to 
write a new bill to raise the minimum wage from its current 335 an 
hour to 465 over three years 
the bill is identical to one proposed last year by the 
committees chairman sen edward m kennedy dmass that failed 
last summer in the face of a republican filibuster 
labor secretary elizabeth dole the wife of the senate 
republican leader said friday that bush would support annual 
raises of 30 cents an hour to a 425 minimum wage in three years 
but only if employers can keep paying new hires a subminimum 335 
the first six months they are on their payrolls

people accused of driving under the influence 
of alcohol generally are not entitled to jury trials a unanimous 
supreme court ruled today 
the court in a case from nevada said states are not required to 
hold jury trials for drunken driving when the maximum jail terms are 
six months and other penalties are not particularly severe 
the court left open the possibility the constitution might 
require a jury trial in the case of a repeat offender who could be 
sentenced to more than six months in jail if convicted of driving 
under the influence more than once 
in another case the court turned down an appeal by northeastern 
states seeking to force the federal government to crack down on acid 
rain and other pollution they say is caused by smokestacks in other 
states 
the court without comment refused to order the federal 
environmental protection agency to take steps to limit interstate 
air pollution 
the justices rejected an appeal by two nevada men melvin r 
blanton and mark d fraley who said the penalties for being 
convicted of driving under the influence dui are serious enough to 
warrant jury trials 
lawyers for the two said nevada is one of only five states that 
do not permit jury trials in such cases they listed the other 
states as louisiana mississippi new jersey and new mexico 
while there is mounting national concern over the seriousness of 
drunken driving justice thurgood marshall said for the court monday 
that nevada classifies driving under the influence as a petty crime 
the demarcation line for petty crimes is a maximum sentence of 
six month in jail marshall said the fact that nevada prescribes 
other penalties does not raise the offense to a serious crime he 
said 
nevada law provides that a firsttime dui offender can be 
sentenced to 48 hours of community work rather than jail the 
offender must be dressed as a dui offender while doing the work 
the state law also imposes a maximum fine of 1000 requires 
offenders to attend alcohol abuse edcuation courses and suspends 
their drivers licenses for 90 days 
also firsttime offenders face a minimum sentence of two days in 
jail 
marshall said primary emphasis must be placed on the maximum 
authorized period of incarceration generally he said a 
defendant is entitled to a jury trial whenever the offense for which 
he is charged carries a maximum authorized prison term of greater 
than six months 
blanton was arrested in north las vegas on july 18 1986 and 
fraley was arrested in the same town on june 29 1986 blanton has 
not been tried fraley was convicted and was sentenced to two days 
in jail and fined 310 
the nevada supreme court ruled in 1987 that they were not 
entitled to jury trials the state court said jury trials would 
place an expensive burden on the municipal court system 
in other action the court 
agreed to review the stiff fines imposed against four yonkers 
ny councilmen for defying a federal judges order to adopt a 
housing desegregation plan 
the justices said they will study arguments that the judge 
exceeded his power in imposing the contemptofcourt fines 
said federal workers do not have a right to sue in federal 
court when they accuse the union representing them of unfair 
treatment 
the justices voting 90 ruled that the only recourse for the 
employees in such cases is to file an unfair labor practice charge 
with the federal labor relations authority 
agreed to decide whether prison inmates are entitled to a court 
hearing and other safeguards before being forced to take 
antipsychotic drugs 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by washington state 
officials who say judges should not be allowed to interfere with the 
professional judgment of prison administrators and doctors 
barred a lawsuit against a former federal prosecutor who 
refused police protection to a witness gunned down before she could 
testify 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that the 
prosecutor was not legally responsible to protect the woman killed 
in new york city along with three cbs employees who tried to come to 
her aid 
turned down the freespeech arguments of a financial magazine 
accused of violating an antitouting provision of federal securities 
law 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that could force 
the stock market magazine to tell readers whether companies featured 
in its articles bought advertising space or paid the magazine for 
other services 
said a contract dispute between stanford university and a 
computer firm should be settled in state court not in arbitration 
the courts 62 decision is a victory for stanford and a setback 
for volt information sciences inc which had asked the justices to 
compel arbitration 
the drunkendriving case is blanton vs north las vegas 871437

channel one the widely criticized 
commercial television news program aimed at teenagers in schools 
debuted today in several high schools complete with ads for candy 
bars dandruff shampoo and blue jeans 
the 12minute daily program is being produced by whittle 
communications a knoxvillebased media company and is being tested 
over the next two months in six schools around the country the 
first program included coverage of the show itself and the 
controversy surrounding it 
before the first show was even aired a number of education groups 
objected to the idea of allowing advertisers to pitch their products 
to students in the classroom 
central high school on the north side of knoxville is one of the 
test schools and the 20 students in connie wilkes homeroom appeared 
to pay close attention to the program 
the program featured stories on students reaction to the 
continuing death threats against author salman rushdie and life for 
a teenager in the soviet union in addition to the one on the 
controversy involving the launch of channel one 
also included in the program were 30second television ads for 
snickers candy bars head and shoulders shampoo and levis 501 
jeans 
if the test proves successful and advertisers can be persuaded to 
make a longterm commitment whittle communications lp hopes to make 
the program available to 8000 or more schools in fall 1990 
the program is being produced by whittle a fastgrowing company 
that has specialized in creating magazines and sponsored posters 
that enable advertisers to reach narrowly defined audiences 
the audiences for its magazines for instance range from new 
mothers in doctors waiting rooms to travel agents to high school 
students its advertisersponsored posters hang in offices and 
school lobbies 
the channel one test is expected to cost about 5 million 
whittle estimates the hardware alone required to take the program 
nationwide will cost more than 100 million 
each of the test schools was given about 50000 worth of 
television monitors video recording equipment and a satellite dish 
that whittle promises to maintain 
the system will be used to receive and record the show which 
whittle is producing in los angeles and to televise it once during 
the school day included in each show are up to four 30second 
commercials 
in exchange for the equipment and the programming the schools 
agreed to run the show once each school day in every classroom 
the launching of channel one came amid growing criticism by 
childrens advocates and educators including the national 
association of secondary school principals and the national 
parentteachers association 
they say such programs inappropriately thrust paid advertising 
messages at a captive audience in the classroom 
but christopher whittle who heads the company bearing his name 
argued that someone has to pay the bill for the topical daily news 
program and the equipment needed to show it he said since most 
schools cannot afford to pick up the tab it is reasonable to get 
advertisers to pay it in exchange for two minutes of commercials 
each day 
whittle said that as of late last week eight advertisers had 
signed up for 80 percent of the available commercial time in the 
test 
one of the sponsors is jeans maker levi strauss amp co marketing 
manager dan chew said levi was monitoring the debate about 
advertising and would decide after the test whether to stay with it 
officials of the test schools said critics should wait until 
after the test is completed in late april 
this is a program that appears to have merit and absolutely 
should get a chance to be seen before people make up their minds 
about it said john katsoulis an assistant school superintendent 
in billerica mass 
billerica memorial high is one of the six test schools the 
others are central high school in knoxville tenn mumford high 
school in detroit withrow high school in cincinnati gahr high 
school in cerritos calif and eisenhower middle school in kanasa 
city kan

gordon humphrey one of the most vocal 
conservative voices in the us senate said today he will not seek 
a third term 
im here today to announce that two terms is plenty twelve 
years in the senate seems like a good place to round it off 
humphrey said at a crowded news conference at his office in concord 
humphrey 48 sat on the edge of his desk and held up a large no 
2 as he announced that he will return to private life at the end of 
his second term in january 1991 
i do not want to spend 18 years in congress the republican 
said it becomes a career at that point and i dont believe people 
should make a career in congress 
joking humphrey suggested a halfmile line of politicians would 
queue up at the secretary of states office to file candidacy papers 
for his job 
his wife patricia who attended the news conference with the 
couples two young sons said she had mixed feelings about the 
announcement 
ill be glad to have him home but i think he should have run 
again she said i think he was just hitting his stride 
before making the announcement humphrey phoned his supporters to 
confirm early signs that pointed to a retirement message 
humphrey had scheduled his announcement at his office not at a 
public rally where a reelection bid surely would have drawn a 
cheering crowd and his campaign coffers are fairly bare containing 
but 4108 according to the secretary of states office 
humphrey has maintained that no single reform would do more good 
than limiting senators and representatives to 12 years in either 
body but he said because that is not the rule now it was not 
reason enough to retire 
an outspoken conservative voice in the senate since upsetting 
democrat thomas mcintyre in 1978 humphrey has been a leader in the 
fights to aid afghan guerrillas fighting soviet troops and outlaw 
abortion 
at last summers republican national convention humphrey 
orchestrated a campaign to pressure thennominee george bush to name 
a conservative running mate

a temporary truce has been declared in 
americas trade war with europe but there is a gnawing worry for 
the us beef industry that all is not quiet on the home front 
the question is whether american consumers will alter their 
tastes as a result of the highly publicized dispute over the 
european communitys ban on imports of hormonetreated beef 
several consumer groups suggest that europes demand for beef 
free of growth hormones could give a greater sense of urgency to a 
similar movement in this country 
there has been a kind of slowmoving trend to meat that is free 
of any kind of chemical residues but it had kind of died down as a 
major national issue i think all this does is sort of add some 
momentum says rodney e leonard executive director of the 
community nutrition institute 
a similar view is held by ellen haas executive director of 
public voice for food and health policy 
i think it coincides with growing concern among consumers in 
the way that our food is produced she says 
the beef industry and the us government maintain there are no 
health or safety risks for humans from the hormones used on beef to 
make them gain weight quickly at a lower cost to producers 
the food and drug administration has approved the use of growth 
hormones in cattle the government tests and inspects meat and 
poultry for a variety of drugs including certain hormones fda also 
establishes standards requiring producers to stop administering 
drugs to animals for a specified period before slaughter 
however industry officials are keeping a close watch on the 
reaction of american consumers so far they see no signs that the 
european ban has planted seeds of anxiety among red meat eaters in 
the united states 
i really think that by and large the focus has been on the 
trade aspects of it there have been panels certifying to the safety 
of the hormones in question so i dont see that broadbased concern 
across the country says mike copps a spokesman for the us meat 
institute 
nevertheless the industry was relieved when the trade dispute 
moved out of the headlines two weeks ago us and european 
negotiators agreed to a 75day cooling off period to study the issue 
of hormone use and conduct more talks to find a permanent solution 
to the ban 
we are concerned that this ec directive and the hormone issue 
is somewhat of a complex trade issue that when you talk about it in 
simplistic terms it could be a problem and consumers could be 
concerned says tom cook of the national cattlemens association 
were very conscious of that possibility 
the united states contends the europeans have offered no 
scientific evidence casting doubt on the safety of growth hormones 
and have implemented the beef ban as a political tactic to protect 
their own livestock industry and appease vocal environmental 
movements in their countries 
we have the healthiest beef in the world says us trade 
representative carla hills we cannot let countries impose bans 
that have an exclusionary effect without a medical or scientific 
basis 
the european community represents a 100 million market for us 
beef mostly cuts such as heart tongue and kidneys which are not 
favored by american consumers but far more is at stake in the 
dispute 
mrs hills in a recent interview expressed concern that the 
european beef ban could encourage a new round of global 
protectionism nations could erect new barriers to their markets by 
imposing restrictions on us farm products for alleged health 
reasons such as pesticides on grain 
such actions abroad she concedes also could alarm american 
consumers 
you can drum up an awful lot of emotion among the consumers on 
those sorts of ground says mrs hills 
as haas and leonard point out there has been a simmering debate 
about the safety of residues in food from pesticides and from drugs 
administered to livestock to promote weight gain and treat disease 
for example antibiotics have been widely used as a food supplement 
for hogs to help them gain weight and prevent infections 
consumer demand for natural or organically grown products has 
already led some supermarkets to offer hormonefree beef as well as 
fruits and vegetables certified to be free of chemicals 
haas notes that the beef industry has responded to health 
concerns about fat and cholesterol by promoting lean cuts of meat 
she and leonard suggest that as a matter of consumer choice 
hormonefree beef could find its way on more shopping lists in the 
united states 
there is a much greater public sensitivity to health people 
are looking more carefully at their diet than they did 10 years ago 
or 20 years ago says leonard 
these questions of what we add to foods and the reason we need 
to add chemicals to foods need to be reevaluated and i think thats 
what is happening

two commuter trains collided today 
outside glasgow and scotrail said two people were killed and 44 
injured 
it was the second rail collision in britain in 48 hours a crash 
saturday on the outskirts of london killed five people and injured 
94 
willie caldwell a spokesman for stateowned scotrail said one 
person was believed trapped in the wreckage two hours after the 
accident and most injuries were believed minor 
scotrail said the two trains were traveling in opposite 
directions between the glasgow suburbs of springburn and milngavie 
when they collided just before 1 pm outside bellgrove station two 
miles from the center of glasgow 
we were all sitting down in the train and suddenly there was a 
large bang people were thrown about all over the place said 
colin smith a student who was on one train 
i helped drag one old woman out she was covered in blood and 
eventually taken to hospital said anthony mcvey who had been 
walking his dog near the tracks 
the two trains carrying about 70 passengers were going less 
than 30 mph scotrail said at least two cars derailed 
firefighters swarmed over the wreckage to free trapped 
passengers while ambulances stood by to evacuate casualties 
scotrail is a branch of stateowned british rail whose safety 
procedures are under severe criticism following two serious 
accidents in the london area in less than three months 
the scottish crash confirms that we have been putting 
insufficient resources into preventing these accidents said 
legislator john prescott the opposition labor partys transport 
spokesman the governments policy is clearly on trial he said 
transport secretary paul channon denied that government 
budgetcutting was a factor but told the house of commons the 
fact that there have been two serious accidents on british rail and 
now a third within three months is naturally a cause for concern 
after saturdays crash outside london investigators found signs 
the driver of one passenger train tried to stop at a red signal 
before his train struck another londonbound train 
gordon pettitt general manager of british rails southern 
region said sunday that driver david morgan made a severe brake 
application long before his train passed the red signal 
morgan was one of 94 people injured when his train traveling 
from littlehampton to london hit a train traveling from horsham to 
the capital police said today that 31 people remained hospitalized 
10 in serious condition 
six cars rolled down a 60foot embankment after the crash and 
several came to rest in the yards of homes 
authorities said the horsham train was crossing from a slow track 
onto the main line when it was struck from behind near purley 
station on londons southern outskirts 
morgan has told us that the signal at the end of the platform 
at purley station was red yet he went through it pettitt said 
he has not been able to offer any explanation for that 
morgan was hospitalized with two broken legs pettitt said 
the safety of our signaling system does obviously depend on 
drivers stopping at red lights he said 
we have quite a lot of evidence that a severe brake application 
was made prior to the collision and long before the signal 
pettitt said he did not detail the evidence 
the possibility of driver error is not uppermost in my mind at 
the moment though it is obviously a main area of inquiry he said 
pettitt said the trains braking system was being examined 
he said there was no evidence of sabotage and the signaling 
equipment at purley appeared to be working properly 
three trains crashed near a busy south london junction during 
rush hour dec 12 killing 35 people railway officials believe a 
malfunctioning signal caused that crash

in a memo which surfaced mysteriously while bryant was on vacation 
willard was hurt jane not mentioned in the memo stood by 
stoically 
on monday host bryant gumbel returned to nbcs today show 
and joked about the controversy that had engulfed the nations 
toprated breakfast show in his absence 
weatherman willard scott was not there he was starting his own 
oneweek vacation an attempt to ease tensions by telephoning scott 
on the air foundered embarrassingly when the connection was lost 
and gumbel and cohost jane pauley were forced to adlib through the 
shows final moments 
a very unusual monday in many ways best forgot said gumbel 
it all started last week when someone leaked to new york newsday 
a memo gumbel had written to today producer marty ryan in it 
gumbel criticized reviewer gene shalit consumer reporters david 
horowitz and betty furness and medical reporter dr art ulene the 
harshest words were reserved for scotts hokey homey shtick 
including his endless recitations of centenarians birthdays 
scott at first made light of the memo but later said gumbels 
comments were hurtful and hinted he might leave 
if its not real and if there isnt an honest genuine 
reconciliation i dont think i belong there scott said 
exit scott and shalit on vacation enter gumbel 
good to be back after what should have been a quiet vacation 
said gumbel at the top of mondays show the fact that it wasnt 
is something well get into a little bit later but first things 
first 
pauley welcomed him back you were never far from our 
thoughts she said wryly 
later on gumbel thanked callers for expressions of support 
saying jane willard gene and i are very grateful 
we do appreciate your concern and despite what you may have 
heard or read in recent days we are together and hopefully were 
going to be with you for many years to come said gumbel 
now that may come as sad news for those who have tried to 
capitalize on our differences but rest assured that today family 
is intact and still smiling albeit through some pain he 
continued 
well still be here long after the recent headlines are 
forgotten enough said 
of course it is not possible to say enough about the today 
imbroglio midway through the show gumbel managed a crack after a 
news story about secret government documents found in discarded safe 
youve got to be careful where you put documents these days 
said gumbel to peals of laughter 
then at the shows end came the phonecall fiasco gumbel said 
he intended to talk with scott about vacation plans and onto some 
other things he said he had talked to scott several times since 
saturday and before the show 
this was going to be our little surprise before going off 
gumbel said and he wished scott happy birthday 
tuesday is scotts birthday his 55th not his 100th

prisonrelease program after an inmate who was in prison for beating 
his exwife was charged with killing her while on an eighthour pass 
clearly mistakes were made theres no doubt about that and 
im good and mad about it bayh said 
i understand proper procedures were not followed and were 
going to find out why that happened discipline those who were 
involved reevaluate the whole program and see if it makes sense 
bayh said 
fred nation bayhs press secretary said no inmate involved in 
the furlough program will receive a pass for the next four weeks 
while corrections officials review the policy and report to the 
governor 
alan matheney 38 was charged with murdering his exwife lisa 
marie bianco 29 on saturday in this town near the michigan state 
line authorities said he was being held sunday at the st joseph 
county jail in south bend 
matheney who was serving an eightyear sentence for beating 
bianco two years ago had been in a workrelease prisoner at the 
camplike correctional industrial complex prison officials said he 
was released into his mothers custody saturday morning 
the pass was supposed to limit his travel to the indianapolis 
area 40 miles southwest of the prison but matheney instead went to 
mishawaka 120 miles north of indianapolis authorities said 
matheney was arrested saturday afternoon after neighbors reported 
seeing bianco bludgeoned in the head with the butt of a shotgun 
police capt ross deal said 
there were several witnesses said police cpl kevin 
lockhart its kind of the lowrent district so nobody probably 
wanted to get involved theres a lot of elderly people 
charles miller superintendent of the lightmediumsecurity 
correctional complex said matheney was eligible for a 48hour pass 
correction officials made his first pass shorter to gradually expose 
him to freedom and to ensure he could handle it miller said 
bayh said that as he understood the situation if proper 
procedures had been followed the victim would have been notified 
and in this particular instance that was not done 
state policy requires such notification only if the crime victims 
request it said christopher meloy supervisor of workrelease 
services for the indiana department of correction he said he did 
not know if bianco had made such a request 
nation said the furlough program one of three in which inmates 
are allowed limited freedom was in effect when bayh a democrat 
took office earlier this year inmates also can receive work release 
and special assignment to interfaith housing 
we are going to reevaluate this program because were not 
convinced that it is a program that serves the best interests of the 
department or the people of the state of indiana nation said 
president bush made prison furloughs allowed by gov michael 
dukakis the focus of a softoncrime attack on his democratic rival 
in the 1988 campaign bush cited the case of willie horton a 
massachusetts prisoner who bludgeoned a maryland couple raping the 
woman after escaping during a weekend furlough 
the federal government has a prison furlough program also but 
only for prisoners within two years of their release date

a group of scientists concerned about 
threatened changes in the earths climate called monday for more 
federal spending on research 
given the enormous momentum in the earths climate system we 
delay response actions at our peril said the report from the 
climate institute a private group which seeks to coordinate 
interests of public and private researchers and officials 
a committee convened by the institute recommended approval of 
president bushs proposed 1905 million request for global change 
research plus federal support totaling about 170 million for a 
series of additional efforts 
the panel cited the recent series of unusually warm years which 
some believe are a result of a greenhouse effect on earths 
environment 
if this strong warming trend is as some very credible 
scientists believe the beginning of a significant and rapid 
greenhouse warming humanity may soon be faced with some vexing 
challenges the committee concluded 
the greenhouse theory contends that increasing levels of carbon 
dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere are causing the planets 
climate to warm up by trapping the suns heat in somewhat the way a 
greenhouse traps heat inside 
scientists disagree over whether the recent warm years are the 
result of normal variations in climate or the first signs of a 
greenhouse effect 
if the warming turns out to be a trend it could pose such 
problems as changes in the regions where agriculture succeeds 
relocation of forests melting of polar ice and raising sea levels 
stronger hurricanes and other weather and climate changes 
unfortunately the nations of the world are woefully short of a 
clear understanding of fundamental processes at work in the 
atmosphere oceans and biosphere reported the committee headed by 
gordon j macdonald of the mitre corp 
among the projects that the committee urged in addition to the 
bush budget recommendations for climate research were 
a 14 million program to accelerate the phaseout of 
chlorofluorocarbons chemicals blamed for damaging the protective 
ozone layer and which also add to the greenhouse warming 
studies of the impact of sealevel rise totaling 25 million 
some 15 million for health impact studies 
upgrading the volunteer weather network and setting up regional 
climate centers 122 million 
a 14 million national greenhouse gas monitoring system 
forest service research on global change totaling 17 million 
some 21 million for international studies of climate warming 
impact 
a 20 million united nations program for climate research in the 
third world

the clock in the congregational church has 
sounded the hours day and night for most of two centuries now a 
couple new in town has asked selectmen to turn it off at night so 
they can sleep 
this little farming town of 3000 people is not so sure it wants 
to give up the tradition 
richard carnall said monday that he and his wife moved from 
northampton to a home next door to the church this summer while the 
clock was broken and the chimes didnt sound 
its not just loud at midnight it rings 12 times and at five 
in the morning it rings five times carnall said were about 40 
feet away and its as loud as a car pulling into the driveway 
but carnall said before a monday night public hearing that he has 
gotten mixed reactions to his proposal to silence the bells between 
midnight and 6 am 
those bells have been ringing for about 200 years and i dont 
think too many people want them changed said selectman thomas 
hurley adding that town officials got an earful from residents 
during the months the bells didnt ring although the clock is in 
the church built in 1668 the town has been maintaining it for more 
than a century 
you get used to it said selectman george zgrodnik jr who 
has lived across the street from the clock for most of his 47 years 
for years he said it was the only way his father and other farmers 
had of knowing the time when they were working in the fields 
i remember my folks would tell me to be home at a certain time 
and like most kids running like hell when i heard the clock in 
hopes id get home before the chimes stopped zgrodnik said 
its sort of comforting to hear said his wife marion 
most people in town that ive talked to feel its no different 
from moving in next door to big ben in london and asking that it be 
shut off at night and they dont much like people coming in and 
upsetting their applecart zgrodnik said one fellow told me 
that if we do agree to shut down the clock wed better be prepared 
to move the town dump because he doesnt like having that near his 
house

le crocodile restaurant in strasbourg was promoted 
monday to threestar status in the michelin guide giving ownerchef 
emile jung the ultimate accolade in french gastronomy 
his was the only restaurant to be raised to the highest level in 
the michelin galaxy which this year lists only 19 threestar 
restaurants in france 
the red michelin known to gourmets the world over as the bible 
of gastronomy awards three stars only to those restaurants with 
exceptional cuisine worth a special journey 
four twostar restaurants lost one or both stars this time 
including the beau rivage in condrieu near lyon which went from two 
stars to one the chantecler at the negresco hotel in nice which 
dropped a star the cote dor at nuits st georges in burgundy which 
lost both its stars and point in vienne which disappeared from the 
guidebook 
twelve famous paris restaurants lost their sole star including 
chez les anges la flamberge and olympe 
i was suprised and thrilled said le crocodiles 47yearold 
chef in a telephone interview from his restaurant in alsace of 
course ive been aiming for the highest quality for years im 
constantly giving myself grades not always awfully high 
his food is superbly creative with a strong basis in the local 
produce and traditions said michelin director bernard naegellen 
outstanding dishes include fresh sandre a kind of pike 
cooked with juniper berries with a delicate stuffing of sauerkraut 
an alsatian specialty the first course jellied consomme with foie 
gras dice another alsatian specialty is presented in a crown shape 
with a puree of leeks and potatoes in the center 
jungs cellar is fabulous not only in alsatian wines but in 
wines from all over france and the whole world which is very 
rare said naegellen 
celebrating its 80th anniversary it did not publish for nine 
years during the two world wars the 1989 michelin guide is 
accompanied by a quaint facsimile of the original 1900 little red 
book in those days the book was aimed not at gastronomes but at 
pioneers whose tin lizzies were subject to frequent breakdowns 
today the guide bases its choices on good food on the many 
visits by anonymous inspectors and it is considered the most 
serious hotel and restaurant guide in a country obsessed with food 
and wine last year 720000 copies were snapped up by drivers and 
epicures 
the little free booklet was offered to buyers of michelin tires 
and was aimed at helping drivers change a tire repair their cars or 
find garages said naegellen 
there were no restaurants listed then only hotels with 
restaurants in cities other than paris 
the guide was aimed at drivers going from paris to the 
provinces said naegellen 
the top grade of three stars signaled the most expensive hotels 
offering rooms with relative luxury such as electricity including 
all meals with wine it also indicated the eventual presence of a 
doctor or pharmacy in every town no matter how small 
this information was vital in days when drivers needed more than 
a week to get from paris to the south of france 
the legendary michelin stars which look like rosettes were 
first awarded for gastronomy in 1926 they now are the ultimate in 
prestige for restaurants and the 1989 guide lists 619 starred 
establishments 
among this years demotions olympes fall from onestar grace is 
particularly disappointing to those who root for women chefs 
olympes owner dominique nahmias is popular among gastronomes she 
still retains her three toques and rating of 18 out of 20 in 
another popular guidebook the gaultmillau guide 
we have nothing against professional women cooks said 
naegellen noting that several women have stars and the chef of the 
twostarred le restaurant in lille is ghislaine arabian wife of the 
owner jeanpaul arabian 
naegellen said that for the first time a special listing is 
provided for restaurants with menus of 25 or less 
michelin has consistently enlarged its scope with the times and 
now travelers can note which establishments dont allow pets honor 
credit cards have views and beach facilities or offer terrace or 
garden dining 
the guide still covers the driving essentials including distance 
between towns repair garages dealers and night breakdown 
facilities

the communist party newspaper pravda monday joined 
other soviets criticizing the ministry in charge of agriculture 
reprinting citizen comment that it is ineffective and useless 
commonly known as gosagroprom the governmental committee 
that oversees the agencies that run the nations stateowned and 
collective farms has recently been broadly criticized in the press 
rumors swept moscow last week that the kremlin leadership is 
planning to abolish the committee which was formed under soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev in 1985 when five agricultural 
ministries and some other state agencies were merged 
the partys policymaking central committee will meet this month 
and is expected to make reforms in agriculture to remedy chronic 
food shortages 
an article published in pravda on monday said the paperwork 
produced by gosagroprom indicates the ministry isnt overlooking 
serious problems but that a closer look reveals its possible to 
say it did not solve any big problems 
people attending a party conference in kharkov a ukrainian city 
400 miles south of moscow wrote a letter to the supreme soviet 
parliament calling for the dismantling of this monopolistic 
ineffective bureaucratic organization that hinders effective 
forms of farming the article said 
pravda said gosagroprom has made certain the farmers dream of 
living as well as nonfarmers who work in food processing remains 
just a dream the most common words to gosagroprom from farmers are 
give us resourses and dont bother our work pravda said 
the government daily izvestia also printed an article monday by a 
doctor of economic sciences i buzdalov that indicated there is 
consensus at least on the need to drastically cut back the size of 
gosagroprom starting with the regional organizations responsible 
for agriculture known to the soviets by the russianlanguage 
acronym of rapos 
the judgment on whether gosagroprom starting with rapo is 
necessary in its present form is no longer subject to debate it 
seems the economist wrote 
the politburo published a report saturday saying it supported the 
creation of various types of farms to help alleviate the soviet 
unions food shortage 
the 12member ruling body made no direct reference to abolishing 
gosagroprom but said new forms and methods of management were 
needed in the countrys agricultural management 
the central committee has announced it will hold a plenum march 
1516

an air force retiree who helped fly weapons to 
the contras described today how an associate of oliver norths 
pulled him into the iran arms initiative 
north codefendant richard secord asked me to assist in the 
transportation of arms to iran said richard gadd a retired air 
force lieutenant colonel 
in january 1986 gadd said i was told they desired to move 
classified cargo from the united states to iran secord he said 
asked if i could arrange that 
you must figure this out gadd said secord told him you 
must convince southern air transport to do the job this could lead 
to the release of the hostages 
gadd handled the covert program to ship arms to the contras in 
early 1986 when that was illegal and ran flights with humanitarian 
aid when that became legal 
gadd also testified how north and secord decided that one of 
secords companies should get title to the aircraft being used to 
secretly supply the contras 
gadd testified at norths trial that i objected somewhat 
strenuously when secord one of norths codefendants in the 
irancontra case summoned him to a meeting in january 1986 at a 
mclean va restaurant secord announced that he had changed his 
mind and that one of secords companies would get title to the 
aircraft rather than a company gadd controlled 
after gadd complained secord called north aside the two spoke 
briefly returned to the table and secord told me that is how it 
would be colonel north seemed to agree gadd testified 
the c7 caribou aircraft had been purchased with funds generated 
by secords secret resupply operation to the contras 
eventually the contra leadership felt the planes belonged to 
them related gadd who described how secord and north held 
another discussion about ownership during a plane trip to central 
america 
north agreed once again that the planes belonged to one of 
secords companies udall corp and that the contras did not 
exercise total control gadd said 
gadd who retired from the air force in 1982 as a lieutenant 
colonel also described norths involvement in other details of the 
contra resuply operation gadd said a crewmen ian crawford 
described what went wrong and what went right with an airdrop of 
military supplies to the contras in southern nicaraguan near the 
costa rican border in april 1986 
gadd also said that he billed one of secords companies lake 
resources 392000 for construction of an airstrip in costa rica 
that was designed to help supply the contras on the southern front 
in nicaragua 
gadd said north enlisted him to help build the airstrip for 
secret military supply missions to the nicaraguan contras while 
congress had banned us aid to the rebels 
among the 12 criminal charges against north are four counts of 
lying to congress by denying his involvement in the contra resupply 
operation 
gadd testified thursday that north enlisted him to help build a 
secret airstrip in costa rica to support a southern front for 
the contras in their guerrilla war against the nicaraguan government 
gadd described how he was summoned on a sunday by secord to a 
meeting with the white house aide who pointed on a map to a remote 
section of the countrys west coast 
secord and north asked if i could build the airstrip 
recalled gadd 
not being in the business of building airfields gadd said 
he retained some consultants and eventually the runway was built 
north at one point accompanied gadd to a meeting with ambassador 
robert duemling and urged him to award gadd an air delivery contract 
to help distribute 27 million in humanitarian aid to the contras 
gadd said adding that duemling agreed to the request 
one of the governments key witnesses against north former 
national security adviser robert mcfarlane was sentenced friday for 
his role in the irancontra affair and is to be called later by the 
prosecution

a progovernment newspaper 
known for its staunch support of president pw botha joined other 
leading publications that called monday for the resignation of the 
ailing leader 
botha 73 is recovering from a stroke suffered jan 18 but he 
announced last week that he will return to office in april and plans 
to remain at least until his term expires in september 
botha who has been head of government for more than 10 years 
left open the possibility he may seek another fiveyear term as 
president 
there is a time to come and there is a time to go said the 
progovernment daily beeld in an editorial quoting the words of 
df malan a prime minister in the 1940s and 1950s and bothas 
political mentor 
may we suggest that botha again reads these words 
attentively the editorial said malans voice from the far 
past still has much to say to us all 
there had been speculation botha would return to office only long 
enough to step down with dignity and ceremony making way for 
education minister fw de klerk the heir apparent as president 
de klerk was elected leader of the governing national party last 
month after botha resigned from that post traditionally the party 
leader has been head of government and de klerk has found himself 
in an awkward position because he has no formal power over 
government decisionmaking 
the governmentrun south african broadcasting corp said monday 
the country had been reinvigorated by de klerks initial 
speeches since becoming head of the national party 
the lengthy editorial made no mention of botha but said de 
klerks calls for race reform had drawn an enthusiastic response 
from opposition groups that have refused previously to negotiate 
with the government 
de klerk has yet to declare any major policy differences with 
botha but he is widely depicted as more flexible and pragmatic and 
thus more capable of breaking south africas political stalemate he 
has made vague proposals to soften the impact of existing 
segregation laws 
several leading newspaper in recent days have predicted a power 
struggle in the governing national party if botha attempts to remain 
in charge 
there is now a strong possibility that after the meetings of 
national party organizations this week a delegation could be 
sent to mr botha to ask him to stand down the independent star 
newspaper the countrys largest selling daily said in a frontpage 
story 
calls from bothas resignation have come from liberal and 
farright opposition parties as well as from some national party 
members 
botha unable to relinquish high office gracefully has put 
himself into an untenable position said business day the leading 
financial daily nobody in his personal entourage is likely to 
tell him he is the most disliked leader the national party has 
ever had 
botha has spent most of the time since his stroke recuperating at 
his coastal vacation home while being replaced by an acting

an attorney for the federal reserve board said 
monday that bank lawenforcement efforts could suffer because a 
federal appeals court vacated a board order that had barred a former 
chairman of michigan national corp from the banking business 
it creates a certain problem when someone can resign and 
therefore elude jurisdiction said douglas jordan an attorney for 
the board 
in january 1988 the federal reserve board removed stanford 
stoddard as officer and director of the detroitarea bankholding 
company and barred him from engaging in banking activities 
however in july 1984 stoddard had resigned as head of the bank 
leaving the company nearly a year before the comptroller of the 
currency began steps toward removing him the comptroller 
recommending action against stoddard said the bank officer used 
some of the institutions funds for improper purposes 
saying one cannot remove what isnt there a federal appeals 
court here in a ruling friday vacated the boards order and agreed 
to review the case 
the board had argued that congress intended the removal provision 
as a way of barring people who engaged in midconduct from returning 
to the banking business 
it is not an uncommon occurrence for someone who has been 
suspected or accused of misconduct to resign voluntarily or to 
resign as a result of pressure from his institution jordan said 
stoddards attorney keith fisher said his client seriously 
wants to get back into the banking business 
in the current climate of troubled institutions all over the 
country someone of his enormous experience and talents would be 
quite useful to any number of institutions fisher said

secretary of state james a baker iii 
today called on the soviet union to abandon the socalled brezhnev 
doctrine used to justify military intervention to block reforms in 
communist countries 
in his first speech to an international forum baker also 
announced that president bush is exploring ways to accelerate the 
removal of us chemical weapons from west germany 
he said the soviet union had enormous stocks of such weapons 
threatening europe and called on moscow to join the united states 
in mutual destruction of these frightening weapons 
baker called west german chancellor helmut kohl sunday night to 
advise him of bushs plans on chemical weapons west german 
government spokesman friedhelm ost told reporters in bonn 
ost said today that the united states has decided to withdraw the 
weapons ahead of the 1992 deadline agreed to previously but kohl 
made no mention of such a reported decision in a later statement 
kohl applauded what he called a us pledge to explore 
possibilities for the early removal of chemical weapons from west 
germany 
a spokesman for the government press office said the discrepancy 
between kohls and osts statements could not be immediately 
explained 
baker spoke at a meeting of 35 foreign ministers gathered in 
viennas hofburg palace to launch talks on reducing conventional 
weapons across europe 
in a largely conciliatory speech he urged the soviet union to 
put into practical use the new thinking guiding soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs foreign and domestic policies 
new thinking and the brezhnev doctrine are in fundamental 
conflict he said 
we call today upon general secretary gorbachev to renounce the 
brezhnev doctrine beyond any shadow of a doubt he said 
baker told his fellow ministers that all europeans should have 
the freedom to have a say in decisions which affect their lives 
and to express their political differences as well as the freedom 
to be safe from military intimidation or attack 
those in the east he said should be free of the fear that 
armed soviet intervention justified by the brezhnev doctrine would 
be used again to deny them choice 
the doctrine named for the late soviet president leonid i 
brezhnev was invoked by moscow to justify the 1968 sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia to crush the liberal communist reforms of 
then party leader alexander dubcek 
bakers speech made favorable references to the change gorbachev 
has instituted the rhetoric of soviet foreign policy is being 
reshaped with less emphasis on the use of force he said 
at another point he said that as europe approaches the end of 
the decade new horizons are beckoning and that realism has 
begun to triumph in the soviet union 
baker began his threeday visit to the austrian capital on sunday 
with meetings with the foreign ministers of hungary and poland 
setting a signal that the bush administration wants to encourage 
those countries increasing political and economic reform 
baker said in his speech that people want freedom freedom of 
the mind freedom in the home behind what has become a rusting 
iron curtain 
he said while the east should be free of the prospect of soviet 
intervention those in the west should be free of the fear of warsaw 
pact forces pointed in their direction 
we shall never be able to set eastwest relations on an 
irreversible course toward enduring improvement unless we deal with 
the huge conventional military imbalance in europe he said 
baker called gorbachevs offer in december to withdraw six tank 
divisions and 50000 men from eastern europe a very good start 
but even after such a pullout he said the warsaw pact would 
retain a 2to1 edge in tanks and artillery 
baker said the north atlantic treaty organization would propose 
once the negotiations begin thursday an overall limit of 40000 
tanks among the 16 nato and seven warsaw pact countries 
however he said change in the military balance is only one 
part of the process only when the causes of the historic division 
of europe have been removed will it be possible to eliminate the 
military confrontation

president bush declared today that he is sick 
and tired of the rumors and innuendos blocking john towers 
confirmation by the senate as defense secretary 
using the beginning of a speech to a veterans of foreign wars 
audience to get something off my chest bush demanded that 
members of the senate put aside partisanship and approve towers 
nomination 
ive asked them to use their own experience with john tower as 
an expert on defense issues as a former colleague and as a tough 
hardnosed negotiator to guide them as they move towards a vote on 
this nomination the president said 
with the senate preparing to resume debate at midday bush called 
the former texas senator a fellow veteran a lifelong public 
servant and a fighter tower was not present for the speech 
although the white house had said he would be officials said later 
that tower had had a previous commitment 
i stand by this man bush told his wildly cheering audience 
today i stand by him because he is uniquely qualified as the 
right man to take charge of the pentagon 
enough for that now the president said going to get it 
off my chest im getting sick and tired of some of the rumors and 
the innuendo that are used against this decent man 
as debate resumed on the senate floor republican whip sen alan 
simpson of wyoming labeled the accusations against tower as so 
obviously flimsy and urged his colleagues not to base their 
decision on such information 
john tower is a scrapper simpson said i would never walk 
away from innuendo and petty people and goofy witnesses trying to 
bring me down 
earlier today white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
reiterated that administration officials are not searching for a 
substitute nominee and plan to carry the tower fight all the way to 
a senate floor vote 
we arent thinking of fallback positions he told reporters 
were supporting the candidacy of senator tower 
tower said sunday that his excessive drinking in the past 
does not indicate any longterm problem and he would welcome the 
chance to defend his nomination on the senate floor 
appearing on the cbstv program face the nation tower said 
he would not to ask that his nomination be withdrawn arguing that 
the dispute over his selection has escalated beyond consideration of 
his qualifications 
the former senator repeated his pledge to stop drinking if 
confirmed as defense secretary and he accused his detractors of 
hypocrisy 
tower sought to deflect the most common criticism against him by 
drawing a distinction between the past heavy drinking he has 
acknowledged and an alcohol abuse problem that would disqualify 
him from sensitive military positions 
i still have sip of wine now and again tower responded when 
asked whether he had stopped drinking since pledging a week ago to 
do so if confirmed by the senate once confirmed i will give it 
up altogether 
the chairman of the senate armed services committee sen sam 
nunn dga has said tower would fail to qualify for a sensitive 
military position because of his history of drinking 
tower denied that and said i would be disqualified if you 
could prove alcohol dependency or chronic alcoholism in the 
final analysis it is a decision to be made by the commanding 
officer that should be based on hard evidence in my particular 
instance the president of the united states is the commanding 
officer 
the fact is i am not alcoholdependent tower said there 
is no conclusive proof to the effect as a matter of fact the 
weight of proof seems to indicate otherwise 
ive admitted to excessive drinking in the 1970s tower said 
ive said excessive drinking not alcohol abuse theres a 
difference 
tower said he would relish a chance to appear on the senate floor 
to defend himself as suggested by senate republican leader bob dole 
of kansas 
the full senate must approve before a nonmember can address the 
chamber majority leader george mitchell dmaine has not said how 
he would react to such a move 
dole appearing on the abctv program this week with david 
brinkley vowed to fight this to the end 
john tower is the bestsuited man in america president bush 
has said so and he has the right to make the nomination because he 
won the election dole said 
the tower nomination has threatened to undermine relations 
between the white house and congress at the outset of the bush 
administration the senate armed services committee voted 119 
against tower on feb 23 splitting on partisan lines with democrats 
in favor and republicans against 
democrats led by nunn say they are troubled by reports of 
towers excessive drinking extramarital affairs and his ties to 
defense and aerospace contractors 
one democrat sen dennis deconcini of arizona said on cnn that 
although many of the accusations against tower had proved untrue he 
decided to vote against the nomination because its risky to have 
someone with his background and the problems he has had in that 
office 
tower said that the real issue is politics not his personalit 
senators are quite capable of changing their minds i think 
there is an imminent possibility that minds will be changed as this 
situation plays out and as the arguments against me appear to be 
more thin said tower who served 24 years in the senate 
including a 198184 stint as chairman of the armed services 
committee 
tower discounted the results of a public opinion poll released 
sunday by the los angeles times showing that 44 percent thought the 
senate should reject tower 35 percent thought he should be 
confirmed and 21 percent were unsure the survey of 1046 adults 
last wednesday and thursday had a margin of error of 4 percentage 
points 
a time magazinecnn poll released sunday found similarly weak 
public support for tower with just 31 percent favoring 
confirmation the poll of 504 adults on thursday had a sampling 
error of plus or minus 45 percentage points 
while bush is publicly refusing to discuss possible successors 
should tower be rejected administration aides and congressional 
sources said the president was mindful of the odds against the 
nomination they said some republicans in congress have been 
pressing bush to give the job to his national security adviser 
brent scowcroft 
others mentioned as possible successors have included sen john 
warner of virginia former defense secretary donald rumsfeld former 
transportation secretary drew lewis former rep jack edwards of 
alabama and norman augustine chief executive officer of 
martinmarietta corp

tokyo ap authorities on monday arrested two former senior 
officials of japans largest corporation on suspicion of bribery in 
a spreading stock scandal that has prompted calls for prime minister 
noboru takeshita to resign 
prosecutors said they arrested hisashi shinto former chairman of 
nippon telegraph and telephone corp and a senior aide kozo murata 
investigators alleged the two officals were bribed with 10000 
shares of unlisted stock that murata was offered by recruit co an 
information conglomerate murata 63 reportedly made 170000 in 
profits when the stock was publicly traded and rose quickly in value 
shinto 78 was known as an advocate of clean government and 
business until he resigned from ntt in december after acknowledging 
that 70000 of the profits had ended up in his personal bank 
account 
the remaining 100000 allegedly was used for illegal political 
lobbying 
the arrests followed the bribery indictments saturday of four 
other businessmen the founder of recruit hiromasa ezoe another 
recruit executive and two former ntt officials 
justice ministry officials said prosecutors added another count 
monday to the charges against ezoe offering bribes to shinto and 
murata 
ten people have been arrested in the scandal of whom five have 
been indicted three cabinet members also have resigned because of 
recruit links 
takeshita who acknowledged an aide bought 2000 shares of 
recruit stock has denied any personal involvement and pledged 
sunday to restore public confidence in his government by pursuing 
political reform 
takeshita told parliament monday he was willing to turn over 
documents related to his aides purchase of the shares but it 
affects third parties and banks used by my secretary so i feel i 
need to consult with them 
opposition parties have demanded officials implicated in the 
scandal testify in parliament under oath 
the three largest opposition parties have united in demanding a 
full parliamentary investigation into the scandal the opposition 
socialists and communists have demanded that takeshita resign or 
dissolve the lower house 
newspapers reported members of the governing party have begun 
considering a caretaker government should additional arrests or 
public pressure force takeshita to resign 
some party leaders also are discussing the possibility of a 
dissolution of the lower house requiring new elections if 
takeshita does not resign soon news reports said 
public support for the takeshita cabinet has dropped steadily in 
the past five months due to the scandal as well as government plans 
to levy a 3 percent tax on all services and goods in commercial 
transactions according to media polls 
party members want to hold off elections as long as possible 
said seisaburo sato professor of politics at tokyo university 
an election loss for the party could force takeshita to step down 
as governing party president and prime minister before his twoyear 
term ends this fall 
rei shiratori dean of the department of political science and 
economics at tokai university said if you look at opinions of 
voters things are changing but that only has an effect if theres 
an election so if takeshita is able to hold off having an election 
there wont be much direct effect on politics

medicine that could save hundreds of thousands of lives un

they said about 625000 of the 2 million to 3 million people 
displaced by the sixyear war in the south may die of startvation 
during the aprildecember rainy season unles something is done the 
pledge of a month of tranquility will be sought during a twoday 
conference that begins wednesday in khartoum

south by plane train and nile river barge to create stockpiles 
against famine and disease said the officials all of whom demanded 
anonymity under orders from their agencies 
we want to preposition food and medicine and clothes so people 
wont be caught between the conflict and the famine one official 
said they need a massive operation 
both the government and the sudan peoples liberation army of 
former army col john garang have used food as a weapon western 
relief officials estimate that in 1988 alone more than 560000 
people died of starvation or while fleeing the fighting 
un and aid officials said they would use the conference to 
pressure both sides to accept the temporary ceasefire but rebel 
claims of victory and political uncertanity in khartoum could upset 
their plans 
a un official said the conference would set goals and initiate 
plans for stockpiling food and medicine it is to be attended by 
un representatives western donors and the government 
rebel radio broadcasting from neighboring ethiopia said 
garangs forces had overrun two garrison towns nimule and parajok 
in the equatoria region along the border with ugandait warned 
foreigners to leave juba the regional capita where 15000 rebels 
have 5000 soldiers beseiged 
officials of the un high commissioner for refugees office said 
20000 civilians and army soldiers fled into northern uganda in the 
past two days and emergency help was being flown to them up to 
5000 other sudanese have crossed into uganda 
garangs rebel army began fighting in 1983 for autonomy and more 
favorable economic treatment in the south whose people are 
predominantly black christians and animists the government is 
dominated by the northern sudanese most of whom are moslem arabs 
several rebel military victories have been reported in the past 
few months western military sources say the insurgents have better 
arms than government troops and now have about 5500057000 
fighters facing a sudanese army of 65000 men

the rainy season when the rebels usually have the battlefield 
advantage

a crisis caused by pressure from the military politicians and the 
public to end the war consulted with other parties monday about 
forming a broadbased government

tuesday despite the delicate political situation the western 
military sources said libya had offered its southern neighbor 280 
million worth of weapons

anonymity said the intention was to send up to 100000 tons of 
supplies to the three southern regions of africas largest country 
there is no problem with the food we have it one source 
said it is transportion which is a problem 
ideally we would have liked both the government and the rebels 
to be at this conference but the united states and the donors are 
holding contacts with spla rebels and hope to put enough pressure 
on it and the government to reach an agreement he said 
the united states has put pressure on mahdis government for 
peace talks and has urged other doners to do the same

the parliament of uzbekistan fired the central 
asian republics president after charges surfaced that he promoted 
relatives of former government and party leaders tass said 
it was the latest blow against officials accused of corruption in 
the republic which has been the focus of sensational articles in 
the soviet press 
the uzbek supreme soviet meeting in the capital of tashkent in 
an emergency session relieved pulat khabibullaev from his duties as 
chairman of the parliaments executive body the presidium the 
official news agency said 
khabibullaev had been in his post for less than a year but 
recently new information was revealed about previous jobs he held 
tass said 
when occupying executive posts at the republican academy of 
sciences tass said khabibullaev promoted by illegal means the 
careers of relatives of the former republican party and government 
leaders who have compromised themselves 
the dispatch did not say whether khabibullaev faces criminal 
charges 
the news agency listed the former leaders with ties to 
khabibullaev as sharaf rashidov inamzhon usmankhodzhaev and 
normakhamandi khudaiberdyev 
rashidov uzbek party chief for 22 years died in 1983 and has 
been criticized harshly for allowing rampant corruption 
usmankhodzhaev succeeded rashidov and carried out an extensive 
anticorruption campaign but was retired ostensibly for health 
reasons in january 1988 
no identification was available for kudaiberdyev 
at mondays supreme soviet meeting deputies chose as the

the supreme court ruled monday that people 
accused of drunken driving usually have no right to a jury trial if 
they face a jail term of no more than six months 
despite mounting national concern over the seriousness of 
intoxicated motorists the court said unanimously in a nevada case 
that states do not violate fairtrial rights by treating drunken 
driving as a petty offense not warranting trial by jury 
the court said imposing other penalties such as suspending 
driving privileges or requiring community service generally does 
not require a jury trial as long as six months remains the maximum 
jail term 
in other action the court 
left intact a texas law that allows public school officials to 
use all necessary corporal punishment short of deadly force the 
court turned down the appeal of two kindergarten girls who were 
severely paddled for snickering 
rejected an appeal by northeastern states seeking to force the 
federal government to crack down on acid rain and other pollution 
they say is caused by smokestacks in other states 
agreed to review the fines imposed against four yonkers ny 
councilmen for defying a federal judges order to adopt a housing 
desegregation plan 
in its drunkendriving decision the court left open the 
possibility it might be unconstitutional to deny jury trials if a 
repeat offender could be sentenced to more than six months in jail 
when convicted more than once 
the justices rejected an appeal by two nevada men melvin r 
blanton and mark d fraley who said the penalties for being 
convicted of driving under the influence are serious enough to 
warrant jury trials 
blanton was arrested in north las vegas on july 18 1986 and 
fraley was arrested in the same town on june 29 1986 blanton has 
not been tried fraley was convicted and sentenced to two days in 
jail and fined 310 
nevada is believed to be one of five states that do not permit 
jury trials in such cases the others are louisiana mississippi 
new jersey and new mexico 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the court said the nevada 
legislature classifies firsttime drunken drivers as petty offenders 
by limiting the jail term to six months other possible penalties do 
not raise the offense to a serious crime he said 
nevada law provides that a firsttime offender can be sentenced 
to 48 hours of community work rather than jail while doing the 
work the offender must wear a black and white striped shirt that 
has the word offender written on it along with a picture of a 
liquor bottle bearing a skull and crossbones on the label 
even assuming the outfit is the source of some embarrassment 
such a penalty will be less embarrassing and less onerous than 
six months in jail marshall said 
the state law also imposes a maximum fine of 1000 requires 
offenders to attend alcohol abuse education courses and suspends 
their drivers licenses for 90 days 
firsttime offenders face a minimum sentence of two days in jail 
state officials said jury trials in all drunkendriving cases 
would place an expensive burden on the municipal court system 
in other action the court 
ruled unanimously in a kansas case that states may regulate 
natural gas production by imposing useitorloseit rules 
designed to stimulate production 
took steps against two affirmative action programs citing its 
ruling last month that invalidated a system of racial preferences in 
the award of public works contracts in richmond va 
the justices told a federal appeals court to consider dismantling 
a miami plan requiring 5 percent participation of businesses owned 
by women or minorities in the construction of a rail transit system 
and the court declared unconstitutional a michigan law requiring 
that 7 percent of all state contracts be awarded to minorityowned 
businesses and 5 percent to businesses owned by women 
agreed to decide in a case from washington state whether a 
prison inmate is entitled to a court hearing and other 
constitutional safeguards before being forced to take antipsychotic 
drugs 
left intact a 90000 libel award against six american 
newspapers serving koreanamerican readers for accurately reporting 
an announcement made by a south korean government agency

officially called the anheuserbusch world wapiti elk calling 
championships 
many of the callers or buglers heaved their shoulders and 
gyrated as they blew through twofoot long sections of rubber pipe 
that directed their screeching calls to all parts of the room in the 
convention center 
one bugler brought a small tree and an armful of brush that he 
ripped apart to simulate the sound of an animal tramping through the 
woods all but two of the callers had small rubber diaphragms in 
their mouths that they blew on to create the wide range of noises an 
elk makes 
wayne carlton who has 25 years experience calling everything 
from alligators to turkeys said most of the people who call elk do 
it so they can hunt them but others are photographers or those who 
want excitement he said 
imagine standing by a tree or just being out in the woods and 
if you can imitate that out walks a 700800 pound bull elk looking 
for you to run you away he said the excitement builds up when 
you see the antlers walking through the trees at you

burlington voters on tuesday will replace 
socialist mayor bernard sanders who is stepping down after eight 
years in hopes of seeing his movement broadened with the election of 
a likeminded candidate 
im no bernie sanders progressive coalition candidate peter 
clavelle has said our backgrounds are different our styles are 
different but our political visions are the same 
mayoral elections in burlington and other vermont cities are part 
of the yearly town meeting day when residents of all 247 
municipalities debate civic issues and have their say about how 
their towns and schools will run in at least 35 towns residents 
will be voting on a nonbinding resolution asking the state 
legislature to reinstate the death penalty 
the mayors race is expected to draw a large number of 
burlingtons 25000 registered voters to the polls 
i think turnout is going to be high higher than normal jo 
lamarche secretary to city clerk james rader said monday she said 
her office has already received more than the usual amount of 
absentee ballots for a mayors race 
clavelle 39 is the former community development director in 
this city of 38000 people and a former city manager in nearby 
winooski he lacks sanders rhetorical flair and national reputation 
for bashing corporate capitalism but has support from the local 
chapter of the national organization for women 
clavelles main competition is alderman nancy chioffi 46 a 
democrat and clothing store owner who has support from both 
democrats and republicans the gop didnt field a candidate 
an antidevelopment candidate sandra baird 48 is running on 
the vermont greens ticket claiming clavelle and chioffi both have 
sold out to business interests 
the move to put the death penalty question to voters came from 
four republican legislators who say there is strong support for 
putting capital punishment back on the books for the first time 
since the 1960s 
two years ago about 30 towns took up the question and 
twothirds voted for reinstatement rep nancy sheltra said 
at least nine towns will decide whether to form environmental 
conservation commissions nine communities already have such boards 
which are volunteer groups created to protect a towns natural 
resources 
proponents say the commissions help towns preserve and protect 
wetlands streams and other natural resources at a time when 
overburdened town planning commissions are struggling to manage 
growth 
it makes people aware of whats going on in their town they 
begin to spark each other its amazing what an educational process

vermont natural resources council 
in several other communities voters may authorize selectmen to 
create funds with local taxes to protect land resources such as 
farmland waterfront property and scenic areas

a judge freed 188 sikh political detainees 
monday but police immediately rearrested 84 of them to face charges 
related to militancy that prompted a 1984 army raid on the holiest 
sikh shrine 
witnesses said those released from more than four years jail 
without trial arrived under heavy guard monday at the scene of their 
arrests northern amritsar city and its golden temple 
their freedom is part of a reconciliation drive prime minister 
rajiv gandhi announced last week to try to end ethnic violence that 
has wracked the prosperous northwestern state of punjab for seven 
years 
the 104 men are free to go where they want punjabi police 
chief kps gill said at amritsar as 300 police guards released the 
detainees

when former prime minister indira gandhi ordered the army to raid 
the golden temple and rout sikh militants who had taken sanctuary 
inside

are discriminated against by the hindu majority who comprise 82 
percent of the population they have waged a bloody secessionist 
insurgency since 1982

and brought punjab under direct federal rule in an effort to curb 
the violence 
but killings of hindus and moderate sikhs escalated at least 
2400 were killed by sikh militants last year more than double the 
number killed in 1987 more than 340 people have died this year

jury selection began slowly monday in the 
murder trial of william b cruse who contends he was drunk and 
crazy during a 1987 shooting rampage that killed six people and 
wounded 12 in palm bay 
the trial was moved from the atlantic coast town to central 
florida after a courtordered survey indicated that mostresidents of 
the county where the shootings occurred believe cruse is guilty 
the first prospective juror called for questioning on pretrial 
publicity offered a similar assessment when asked if she believed 
she could deliver an impartial verdict 
i truthfully do not think so she responded she said she had 
a firm belief about the defendants guilt based on newspaper 
stories and television news reports which she did not think she 
could put aside 
circuit judge john antoon dismissed her 
another of the six potential jurors questioned by noon monday was 
former sheriff louie mims who said he had formed an opinion about 
the case but could put it aside to consider the facts as presented 
in court 
state attorney norm wolfinger and assistant public defender 
marlene alva said they hoped to seat a jury by the end of tuesday 
the longhaired and bearded defendant is charged with six counts 
of firstdegree murder 28 counts of attempted murder and two counts 
of kidnapping 
public defenders for the 61yearold former librarian are 
prepared to argue that he was temporarily insane when he shot 
students shoppers motorists and two police officers in two 
shopping centers on april 23 1987 
cruse kept his eyes closed much of the time the gauntlooking 
former librarian sat quietly at the defense table at times he 
seemed to doze 
cruse told police shortly after his capture following a 
sevenhour standoff in a supermarket that he believed neighbors 
store employees and strangers were spreading rumors that he was 
homosexual 
i just wanted people to leave me alone he told investigators 
the morning after the shootout i had to do something to stop 
them 
however he said he didnt remember hurting anyone

the federal government is considering helping 
pay the costs of programs that assist government workers in their 
efforts to quit smoking officials said monday 
if the rule takes effect the government will be following in the 
footsteps of many businesses which have combined antismoking 
programs with workplace rules banning tobacco according to the 
american cancer society 
the federal office of personnel management is circulating the 
proposal which would allow agencies use available funds for such 
programs officials announced 
smoking cessation programs particularly for federal employees 
are long overdue this is a positive step opm director constance 
horner said in a statement ms horner is a former smoker 
the plan would require that employees get advance approval for 
reimbursement in the antismoking programs 
the regulation is being prepared in the wake of a ruling by the 
comptroller general that funding could be approved because smoking 
is a major contributing cause of illnesses such as cancer heart 
disease and emphysema 
the growth of both government and business rules banning smoking 
in many workplaces has spurred many companies to contribute to 
programs to help workers quit said joann schellenbech assistant 
vice president for media relations at the cancer society in new york 
we think its an excellent idea our surveys show that most 
smokers want to quit and need something to help them do that the 
incentive of having program paid for may make a difference she 
said 
costs for the programs range widely she said from free clinics 
conducted by nonprofit groups to 200 and more for morestructured 
systems 
the expense of the antismoking efforts can be justified by the 
savings in insurance costs cuts in sick time and reductions in lost 
productivity she said 
brennan dawson of the tobacco institute said that organization 
would have no immediate comment on the proposal

the supreme court agreed monday to decide 
whether state officials can be sued for damages in federal court by 
people involuntarily held at state mental hospitals without hearings 
required by state law 
the justices voted to review a ruling that would allow such a 
federal lawsuit by a man held in a florida state hospital for five 
months without a hearing that state law said he should have had 
within 48 hours 
florida authorities contend the man should be limited to suing in 
state court 
darrell burch was found wandering along a florida highway on dec 
7 1981 he was taken to a tallahassee community health services 
center where he was held for three days 
during that time burch was hallucinating he said he believed he 
was in heaven 
after his stay at the center burch was transferred to the 
florida state hospital where he remained until may 7 1982 
despite a state law that entitled him to a hearing within 48 
hours to challenge his detention and treatment burch did not 
receive a hearing 
his federal suit alleged that various officials and employees of 
the florida state hospital acted with willful wanton and reckless 
disregard of and indifference to his dueprocess rights 
the suit invoked a muchused federal civil rights law 
a federal judge threw out the suit ruling that burch was barred 
from filing it because he could win adequate relief including 
monetary damages by suing under personalinjury law in state court 
a threejudge panel of the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
upheld the dismissal but the entire appeals court voted 85 last 
march 18 to reinstate the suit 
the trial judge and threejudge appellate panel had relied on a 
1981 supreme court decision in which the justices limited federal 
civil rights lawsuits when certain state court remedies exist 
but the full 11th circuit court ruled that the 1981 decision 
does not apply to procedural dueprocess violations when the state 
is in the position to provide predeprivation process 
because burch could have been given a hearing before his right to 
liberty was deprived the appeals court said postdeprivation 
remedies cannot provide due process 
the 1981 ruling also dealt with prison inmates who alleged they 
wrongly had been deprived of their property rights not their right 
of liberty 
the case is zinmermon vs burch 871965

fcc commissioner james h quello on monday said 
exorbitantly paid television journalists and entertainers 
carried out an unconscionable campaign against the recent attempt in 
congress to raise the pay of highlevel federal officials by 51 
percent 
quello who as a member of the federal communications commission 
would have gotten the pay hike had it cleared congress said it was 
the ultimate in unconscionable selfappreciation for tv and cable 
personalities news anchors and talk show hosts many of whom make 
10 to 25 times more than a senator or congressman to indulge in a 
messianic binge against a salary adjustment to keep pace with 
inflation for congressmen key government officials and judges 
are exorbitantly paid personalities and anchors who utilize 
government licensed airwaves to accommodate their perpetual quest 
for ratings money and power really performing more valuable service 
than those that grant and manage communications licenses pass laws 
and govern the nation i think not quello said in a speech for 
the new york chapter of the federal communications bar association 
a copy of the speech was released in washington 
quello said the pay plan which would have raised congressional 
salaries to 135000 had been proposed by an impartial 
wellqualified nonpolitical commission of civic leaders and had 
been supported by president bush and thenpresident reagan he said 
congress and the news media failed to emphasize enough that this 
was a catchup increment recommended by the panel to keep 
government pay abreast of inflation 
quellos salary is 80700 and he said that with a moderate 
lifestyle i have no problem living well on my government salary 
but the salary level simply does not reflect the complexity or 
importance of commission responsibilities 
he said that killing the salary proposal did not serve the public 
interest because it doomed muchneeded reforms on eliminating 
congressional honoraria limiting outside income and changing 
campaign fund laws 
on another issue quello also repeated his view that it is 
essential that free overtheair television survive in any future 
scenario in which telephone companies are allowed to carry tv 
signals on fiberoptic networks 
only broadcasting not cable or phone fiber has a government 
licensed obligation to provide tv service to the public quello 
said adding that broadcasting is the principal source of local 
news and government affairs of vital local services like traffic 
road weather school closing reports and emergency bulletins and 
only broadcasting has a programissues public file requirement for 
license renewal and for public inspection 
he said it may be necessary for the fcc to require telephone 
companies to provide a basic antenna service to transmit local 
broadcast signals at no charge 
the fcc is considering proposing that congress lift 
crossownership restrictions that prevent telephone companies from 
competing with cable tv systems in the phone company service area

roman catholics responding to a statewide newspaper 
poll gave cardinal bernard f law a favorable rating but disagreed 
with a papal warning that dissenters should not be considered good 
catholics 
sixtyone percent of the respondents to a boston herald poll of 
massachusetts catholics held a favorable opinion of the boston 
archbishop who supports the vaticans position on social and moral 
issues 
but 71 percent of the poll respondents said they should be able 
to dissent from official teachings and be considered good catholics 
the herald reported sunday 
twenty percent disagreed and 9 percent said they did not know 
whether dissent meant one could not be a good catholic 
during the popes us visit in 1987 he told the nations 
bishops it is sometimes claimed that dissent from the magisterium 
is totally compatible with being a good catholic and poses no 
obstacle to the reception of the sacraments this is a grave error 
archbishop rembert g weakland of milwaukee warned the pope then 
that an authoritarian style is counterproductive in the united 
states the faithful are more inclined to look at the intrinsic 
worth of an argument proposed by the teachers in the church than to 
accept it on the basis of the authority itself he said 
the poll of 302 catholics around the state was conducted thursday 
and friday for the paper by opinion dynamics corp of cambridge the 
herald said it had a margin of error of 56 percent 
nothing is going to change because of a poll cardinal 
bernard f law said friday 
his the popes teaching authority doesnt rest on whether or 
not people agree with him therefore whatever a poll might show has 
no relevance as far as his teaching responsibility and the message 
that he teaches

a conservative group is mounting a lastditch 
effort to drum up support for defense secretarydesignate john tower 
with a public relations campaign in several states a spokesman said 
monday 
brent bozell iii chairman of the conservative victory committee 
said the organization raised 100000 from supporters to take out 
newspaper advertisements and conduct television interviews by 
satellite 
bozell said the groups lobbying campaign came after president 
bush last week urged conservatives to generate political heat for 
tower whose nomination has so far failed to garner much enthusiasm 
around the nation 
the momentum has clearly swung bozell said bush meanwhile 
said monday he was sick and tired of the rumors and innuendos 
blocking towers confirmation 
bozell said his group plans to take out advertisements in 
newspapers in washington and in dallas 
it will also arrange for towers daughter penny tower cook to 
appear on televised questionandanswer sessions with reporters in 
texas louisiana alabama connecticut rhode island and virginia 
those are states with democratic senators who conservatives think 
might be persuaded to vote for tower on the senate floor bozell 
said 
one conservative who has criticized tower paul weyrich says he 
thinks the senate has not treated tower fairly in not allowing him 
to confront his accusers 
weyrich president of the free congress foundation has publicly 
criticized towers drinking habits and personal conduct 
as much as i want to see him defeated i dont want to see him 
ruined weyrich told the new york times in an interview over the 
weekend 
as for support for the nomination a los angeles times poll taken 
last wednesday and thursday said 44 percent of those questioned said 
the senate should reject tower 35 percent thought he should be 
confirmed and 21 percent were unsure the survey of 1046 adults had 
a margin of error of 4 percentage points 
but bozell said he believed there is a growing disgust with 
sen sam nunns shenanigans nunn dga chairman of the senate 
armed services committee has spearheaded the campaign against tower 
in the senate where democrats hold a 5545 majority a vote could 
come this week

an index measuring the ability of a typical 
american family to buy a home dropped in january reflecting 
increases in housing prices and mortgage interest rates a real 
estate trade group said monday 
the national association of realtors said its affordability index 
was at 108 in january down from 1112 in december it was the 
largest monthtomonth drop since a similar decline in january 1988 
the new january number means that a family earning the median 
income of 32207 annually had 8 percent more income than needed to 
qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of 
a medianpriced home 
the median price for an existing home in january was 91500 
meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less januarys 
median was up 2800 from the previous month 
the mortgage rate used to calculate the index rose to 961 
percent in january from 959 percent representing a composite of 
fixed and adjustable rates 
john a tuccillo chief economist for the real estate group said 
rising interest rates are likely to dampen home buying for much of 
the spring particularly for firsttime buyers 
when rates are up the first people shut out are borderline 
buyers said the groups president ira gribin having to spend 
even a few dollars more a month for mortgage payments can keep them 
out of the market altogether 
the affordability index has been above 100 since june 1986

policy of seizing boats from drug possessors a congressman on 
monday called for seizure of vessels owned by convicted ocean 
dumpers 
under current law it is almost worth the risk to dump 
illegally because the fines and penalties are small compared to the 
cost of compliance said rep sam gejdenson dconn 
the ocean dumping of municipal solid waste or hazardous waste 
carries a maximum 50000 fine congress enacted legislation last 
year that makes the dumping of medical waste a felony with fines up 
to 250000 
gejdenson said his legislation introduced in the house on 
monday would give the federal government additional muscle by 
allowing the environmental protection agency and the justice 
department to recommend permanent seizure of vessels used to 
illegally dump waste in the oceans or the long island sound 
under the bill the coast guard would seize the ship if the 
dumper is convicted and the judge in the case approves seizure as a 
sentencing option 
unlike the controversial zero tolerance policy a 
dumpingconnected seizure could only take place following a 
conviction gejdenson said the administrations antidrug policy 
allows the coast guard to seize most recreational vessels 
immediately if any amount of drugs is found on board 
this bill would protect the rights of boaters while sending a 
strong message to illegal dumpers that their actions will no longer 
be tolerated gejdenson said 
the connecticut democrat said while east coast beach closures 
triggered by the illegal dumping of medical waste captured the 
publics attention last summer ocean dumping has much broader 
economic and environmental effects he pointed to the impact on 
shellfish and commercial fishing 
the administration has not announced a position on the 
legislation although president bush vowed during the campaign to 
push for stronger antidumping measures

two commuter trains collided monday and 
killed two people in the second british rail accident in 48 hours 
and the government came under pressure to investigate safety on its 
stateowned tracks 
more than 40 people suffered mostly minor injuries in the 1 pm 
accident when the two trains drove into each other two miles east of 
glasgow center said scotrail 
the last two injured a train driver and a passenger were 
taken from the wreckage about four hours after the accident said 
billy caldwell a spokesman for the stateowned company killed were 
the other driver and a passenger 
the 44 injured were taken to hospitals where five were admitted 
for the night caldwell said 
on saturday five people died and 94 were injured in a collision 
of two british rail trains near purley station on londons southern 
outskirts the preliminary conclusion of an investigation into 
that crash said human error was the cause the company said 
scotrail is a division of british rail whose safety records have 
been under assault since december when a threetrain crash killed 35 
people at clapham junction near london 
in the house of commons the opposition labor partys transport 
spokesman and other lawmakers attacked the government transport 
secretary paul channon on the railroads safety record 
the scottish crash confirms that we have been putting 
insufficient resources into preventing these accidents said 
lawmaker john prescott labors transport spokesman 
the governments policy is clearly on trial he said 
scottish national party lawmaker jim sillars said it is time 
we did not have single inquiries into accidents of this kind but a 
comprehensive review of the standing of br british rail in 
relation to government policy as it relates to safety he said 
channon acknowledged concern but denied government budgetcutting 
was a factor 
the fact that there have been two serious accidents on british 
rail and now a third within three months is naturally a cause for 
concern channon said 
he said inquiry boards into the latest two accidents will be 
ordered to report quickly and he added i agree there is public 
concern about british rail and about safety on the railways 
he said investment in the staterun railway is at a record 963 
million this year due to rise to an average 129 billion annually 
for the next four years 
in the glasgow accident the two short trains carrying about 70 
passengers were traveling between the suburbs of springburn and 
milngavie when they collided each was going about 30 mph he said 
a warning explosive went off on the track before the accident 
apparently triggered by a signalman in a box at the side of the 
track but it was too late said caldwell 
that section of the track had been converted several years ago 
from a double to a single track to save money said scotrail but it 
insisted it should have been safe 
we were all sitting down in the train and suddenly there was a 
large bang people were thrown about all over the place said 
colin smith a student who was on one train 
after saturdays crash investigators found signs the driver of 
one passenger train tried to stop at a red signal before his train 
struck another londonbound train 
british rail said monday a technical examination supported a 
preliminary conclusion that the accident was caused by human error 
on the part of the driver 
the driver was one of 94 people injured when his train traveling 
from littlehampton to london hit a train traveling from horsham to 
the capital police said monday that 31 people remained 
hospitalized 10 in serious condition 
six cars rolled down a 60foot embankment after the crash and 
several came to rest in the yards of homes 
on dec 12 three trains crashed near busy clapham junction 
during rush hour killing 35 people railway officials believe a 
malfunctioning signal caused that crash 
queen elizabeth ii sent a message to channon saying she was 
greatly distressed to learn of the third accident monday 
princess diana wife of prince charles visited survivors of the 
purley crash at a london hospital

state rep david duke apologized to the 
louisiana house on monday for newspaper photos of him shaking hands 
with a nazi saying it was an attempt to discredit him 
because of my controversial background the media saw it as an 
opportunity to discredit me duke told the house saying he found 
the ideology of nazis abhorrent 
duke shook hands with art jones vice chairman of the american 
nazi party after he spoke saturday at the chicago convention of the 
rightwing populist party of america 
about 200 people attended the convention some of whom identified 
themselves as klansmen and neonazis 
duke elected as a republican last month told his colleagues 
that he did not know jones and had no idea he was affiliated with a 
nazi movement

by a narrow margin feb 18 his opponents noted that his 1988 
presidential campaign in which he ran as the populist partys 
candidate was managed by a former nazi leader 
only after shaking hands with jones did the lawmaker discover 
that the man was a nazi kook duke told the house 
my politics in this house will be on a high plane i call for 
equal rights for nondiscrimination im deeply sorry for the 
embarrassment this may have caused you he said

president bush voicing skepticism about 
changes in the soviet union said monday he supports lower levels 
of armaments in europe but with a continued backup by nuclear 
weapons 
for america and its allies a survivable nuclear force will 
remain the ultimate deterrent of aggression bush told a 
conference of the veterans of foreign wars 
he made the comments as the soviet union proposed heavy 
reductions in troops and armor in europe and urged negotiations to 
eliminate all battlefield nuclear weapons from the continent 
the president also used his appearance before the veterans group 
to reiterate support for his embattled nominee for secretary of 
defense calling john tower a fellow veteran and a fighter 
and now he and i are fighting for what i think are some very 
important principles principles that the american people 
understand like fairness and truth bush said 
he also told the vfw which boasts a national membership of 23 
million that he wanted to enlist its help to fight a threat no 
less real than the adversaries you have battled drug abuse 
your nation needs you again bush said meet with other 
leaders in your community church clergy law enforcement 
officers tell them the vfw volunteers are ready to help 
standing before a giant american flag bush told his audience 
you have my word as long as i am president america will stand 
fast on the front line in defense of freedom 
on the key issue of change within the soviet union bush 
said there are still far more questions than answers 
he suggested that there remains great uncertainty on the 
ultimate outcome of the events unfolding in the ussr 
america and her allies must recognize that even in light of 
the military cuts proposed by president gorbachev the soviet union 
remains the most formidable military power facing the free world 
in vienna soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze called 
monday for percentage reductions of troops tactical nuclear weapons 
and combat aircraft in europe by both the east and the west 
shevardnadze proposed that both military blocs reduce troops and 
the main categories of arms by 10 to 15 percent over the next 
two to three years and by larger amounts thereafter 
the soviet proposal went far beyond the reductions nato plans to 
suggest at conventional arms talks beginning thursday bush did not 
specifically address shevardnadzes comments in the speech to the 
vfw 
bush called for an active effort in arms control to strive for 
increased stability at lower levels lower levels of armaments 
but he said he would oppose any attempt by congress to withdraw 
us troops from europe unilaterally 
imprudent unilateral reductions are not the path to peace and 
security and freedom he said

an army warrant officer pleaded guilty to 10 
espionage charges at the opening of his courtmartial monday under 
an agreement that prohibits the government from seeking the death 
penalty 
warrant officer james w hall iii 30 of new york city admitted 
that he participated from 1983 to 1988 in a conspiracy to deliver 
classified military information to representatives of east germany 
and the soviet union 
halls civilian attorney vaughn e taylor said hall is truly 
sorry for whatever damage he may have done to national security 
will throw himself on the mercy of the military judge 
col howard c eggers the military judge presiding at the 
courtmartial at fort mcnair in southwest washington did not 
immediately accept halls guilty plea 
under army regulations eggers will hear the prosecutions case 
against hall and defense witnesses before deciding guilt and 
punishment court officials said the final verdict and sentence 
probably will not come before friday 
hall an intelligence analyst with a topsecret security 
clearance was arrested dec 21 near savannah ga and accused of 
delivering exposed film and documents dealing with communications 
intelligence and war plans to warsaw pact nations 
at the time of his arrest hall was assigned to the 24th infantry 
division and worked as an intelligence analyst in the armys g2 
intelligence section he joined the army in 1976 and spent most of 
his career in europe working as an analyst of intercepted radio and 
telephone traffic and coded messages 
under the plea agreement hall waived his right to a grand 
jurytype hearing to determine if a courtmartial was warranted he 
also agreed to be tried by a single military judge rather than a 
panel of officers 
hall also agreed to submit to unlimited debriefing and 
polygraph examination by government officials and to testify if 
called at grand jury proceedings against huseyin yildirim a 
turkishborn naturalized citizen to whom hall allegedly passed the 
classified information 
taylor said through a military spokesman that the defense would 
have no comment on halls motivation for passing classified 
information until after he has been questioned by eggers during the 
closed part of the courtmartial 
the maximum punishment hall could receive since the army agreed 
not to seek the death penalty is life in prison forefeiture of all 
pay and allowances dishonorable discharge and a fine 
the plea agreement however outlines the sentence that hall will 
receive unless the presiding judge who is not permitted to see the 
sentencing agreement imposes a lighter sentence if the judge 
imposes a sentence that is harsher than the one in the agreement 
the agreement will prevail 
taylor said hall will not comment at any time now or in the 
future on the espionage case or his involvement with classified 
materials while in the army part of the plea agreement requires 
that hall sign away any profits that might accrue to him in the 
future from any publication based on his involvement in the 
espionage case 
a statement of the facts in the espionage case which hall told 
eggers was mostly written by myself was included in the plea 
agreement but it was not made public 
halls father james w hall sr his wife and one of his 
children were in the military courtroom when the courtmartial 
began they are expected to testify later in the week in halls 
behalf 
his family was totally uninvolved and unaware of his 
activities taylor said and hall will spend the remainder of 
his life working to prove that he eventually deserves to be reunited 
with his wife and children

president bush wont push yet for a bill 
banning secondary picketing but is ready to move quickly if the 
strike against eastern airlines spreads a white house spokesman 
said monday 
meanwhile the chairman of a house aviation subcommittee 
scheduled a hearing for tuesday and said he hoped for quick action 
on separate legislation to force bush to appoint an emergency board 
and end the strike for 60 days 
rep james oberstar dminn suggested his legislation might 
give cover to the administration for the emergency action bush 
refused to take on friday before the strike began 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday that as long 
as easterns striking members of the machinists union refrain from 
picketing other airlines or railways we wouldnt find it 
necessary to send up the legislation barring such secondary action 
but fitzwater said the administration is prepared to move 
rapidly to submit the legislation if the secondary boycott occurs 
the millionmember international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers has said it would picket other airlines and 
railways but called off the secondary actions at least temporarily 
after a new york court ruled that other workers mustnt honor such 
picket lines the union is appealing 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said he and bush were 
pleased that the strike by easterns machinists had not spread 
were encouraged by the fact that no secondary picketing has 
occurred skinner said on nbctvs today show thats an act 
of responsibility by the unions and the president and i are very 
appreciative 
skinner met with bush in the white house sunday night fitzwater 
said 
asked if the president had second thoughts about refusing to 
invoke the railway labor act to stop the strike the spokesman said 
we have no indication of any change 
fitzwater said bush was receiving daily briefings on the 
situation and still believes the dispute can best be resolved by the 
company and the union in negotiations rather than through government 
intervention 
in congress the aviation subcommittee of the house public works 
committee announced a hearing tuesday on bushs decision against 
intervening before 8500 machinists union members walked off the job 
at eastern most pilots and flight attendants refused to cross the 
picket lines and eastern was reduced to a relatively few flights 
during the weekend 
bush on friday rejected the recommendation of federal mediators 
and 33 senators to appoint an emergency board which would have 
delayed a strike for at least 60 days 
union president william winpisinger on abctvs good morning 
america said it was incomprehensible to me that bush did not 
step in and stop the strike 
winpisinger said bushs action supported frank lorenzo head of 
easterns parent company texas air corp whom the union accuses of 
wanting to shut down and sell off moneylosing eastern 
the union president said the administration threat to go to 
congress in an effort to end secondary picketing rights is 
absolutely prolorenzo procompany and promanagement and its a 
continuation of the reagan administration attitude thats union 
busting 
at a capitol hill news conference rep oberstar said tuesdays 
hearing would look into both sides in the strike and he promised 
quick action on his bill to force a resolution by a presidentially 
appointed mediation board 
oberstar did not contend that the strike has reached 
emergency proportions but he called it part of a longterm 
problem with broad implications for the airline industry if not an 
emergency this is a matter of great public interest 
skinner and aflcio president lane kirkland are to appear at the 
hearing

the government on monday said 
switzerlands prosecutor general has resigned effective sept 1 the 
second top official to step down in a political scandal involving 
allegations of wrongdoing in drug investigations 
prosecutor general rudolf gerber also was granted an immediate 
leave of absence as authorities investigated whether he slowed a 
drug inquiry that led to the resignation of former justice minister 
elisabeth kopp 
justice minister arnold koller announced the decision based on a 
preliminary report by a special investigator former supreme court 
chief justice arthur haefliger 
the investigator was appointed shortly after mrs kopps jan 11 
resignation mrs kopp was accused of tipping her lawyer husband 
about a drug investigation involving the company of which he was 
vice president 
the scandal led to speculation that drug traffickers and certain 
companies were protected by government officials 
the report found swiss efforts to fight illegal drug trafficking 
were 10 to 15 years behind those of its neighbors and cited 
shortcomings in the justice ministry gerber was accused of several 
mistakes including an apparent slowness in the kopp affair 
but haefliger said there was insufficient evidence to suggest 
gerber toned down internal reports on the involvement of mrs kopps 
husband in the affair apparently responding to media allegations 
haefliger said nothing pointed to punishable or scandalous deeds 
in the justice ministry 
gerber 61 has denied any wrongdoing and asked for the 
investigation to clear his name koller said

eastern airlines laid off 5000 workers and shut 
down nearly all its operations today saying it couldnt continue to 
fly while pilots honored a 3dayold machinists walkout 
we cannot run an airline with unpredictability eastern 
spokesman robin matell said in miami we cannot continue to 
inconvenience passengers we cannot afford the steady financial 
drain 
he said eastern would concentrate on operating its most 
profitable routes its northeast shuttle and flights between miami 
buenos aires and santiago chile 
earlier eastern asked a federal judge to bar pilots from taking 
part in the machinists strike and order them back to work 
eastern filed the request with us district judge edward b 
davis who did not immediately schedule a hearing the strike has 
nearly shut down the airline which says it had expected more pilots 
to stay on the job 
the airline asked that the judge order the air line pilots 
association to cease any strike any concerted refusal to report 
to work or disruptive behavior in any manner interfering with 
easterns normal operations 
eastern said the pilots under the railway labor act must 
continue negotiating a contract and may not strike until after an 
official 30day coolingoff period as the 8500member machinists 
union had 
we knew that was coming pilots spokesman rick chapman said 
he said the pilots union attorneys would study the motion 
the pilots union contends its not on strike but is merely 
honoring machinists picket lines 
the walkout crippled the airlines toppriority northeast shuttle 
this morning as the work week got under way but a court order 
prevented rushhour chaos for a halfmillion rail commuters on 
weekdays the lucrative and highly competitive hourly shuttle serves 
primarily business travelers 
on sunday the airline told the pilots they were committing 
economic suicide by honoring the machinists strike which began 
saturday 
you cant fly without pilots eastern spokesman robin matell 
said at a morning news briefing before the lawsuit was filed 
its an hourbyhour evaluation snow in new york city delayed 
the few flights that were ready 
most of easterns 3500 pilots and 5900 flight attendants 
honored the strike by the airlines 8500 mechanics baggage 
handlers and ground crew the strike began over easterns demand for 
contract concessions and escalated a 17month battle at the nations 
seventhlargest airline 
the effects of the strike could spread tuesday if the nations 
pilots followed their unions request to strictly observe aviation 
rules starting that day 
only 92 of easterns 1000 daily flights took off sunday said 
matell the pilots union put the figure at 68 
the sharp cuts in operations have stranded thousands of easterns 
usual 100000 daily passengers at airports around the country 
eastern is aiming at getting about 100 flights into the air 
today focusing special attention on its hourly northeast shuttle 
service matell said eastern is awaiting federal approval to sell 
the lucrative shuttle to developer donald trump 
as of 10 am today six out of the normal 16 shuttle flights had 
gone out matell said 
terrible weather has not helped matell said 
a morning snowfall in new york forced cancellation of several 
eastern flights on the shuttle between boston new york and 
washington before the snow began pan am had announced it was 
doubling service on the same routes but eastern said it could not 
immediately report the impact on its boardings 
tim cook an eastern spokesman in new york said the man who 
usually tracked such figures was out throwing bags as airline 
managers were pressed into airport duty 
the strike had threatened to spill over into a sympathy action 
today against 12 commuter railroads around the country the 
machinists called off their plans sunday after a judge in new york 
with its 320000 railway commuters issued a temporary order banning 
railroad workers from honoring eastern picket lines there 
the same judge signed an temporary order monday barring unionized 
amtrak workers from staging a sympathy walkout until at least 3 pm 
wednesday when he will consider a longerterm stay 
no commuting problems were reported during the morning rush hour 
at new york or other cities that faced possible rail labor problems 
but the union held out the possibility it would ask the railroad 
workers to walk out if a planned appeal upheld the legality of such 
a sympathy strikes 
in public appearances sunday eastern president phil bakes 
admitted that the carrier had miscalculated when it had assured 
travelers there would be no major disruptions 
charles bryan negotiator for the machinists also apologized 
for the inconvenience to travelers but added this is probably 
the purest classic case of evil vs good thats been seen in the 
history of organized labor these people were not workers who 
were greedy or doing anything wrong 
by honoring the pickets and virtually shutting down the carrier 
pilots threatened easterns very existence matell said sunday 
by continuing to stay out the pilots are committing economic 
suicide he said 
the company late sunday sent pilots a letter telling them to 
return to work before noon tuesday or be classified as being on 
strike pilots who are placed in that classification and later go 
back to work will be required to sign a preferential recall 
list according to the letter from frank causey easterns chief 
of pilot operations 
the wording appears to refer to last weeks us supreme court 
ruling that allowed trans world airways inc to reward flight 
attendants who crossed picket lines during a strike by moving them 
up the seniority list over attendants who refused to work 
thousands of anxious passengers holding tickets on canceled 
eastern flights spent hours in lines that snaked around airport 
terminals hoping to find seats on other airlines or get refunds 
im not flying this stinking airline again yelled john 
vannua of new yorks long island who had been waiting three hours 
at miami international airport to have his ticket validated for 
another carrier 
pickets chanted and baggage piled up at airports from san juan 
puerto rico to los angeles and from miami to new york some eastern 
planes were stranded on caribbean islands without crews the company 
said 
jesse jackson joined pickets at hartsfield atlanta international 
airport today and told them they should be allowed to take control 
of the airline in an effort to save it if lorenzo cant fly it 
let the workers buy it jackson told cheering strikers and 
supporters 
in washington air line pilots association president henry duffy 
said his union was asking all pilots nationwide to strictly follow 
aviation rules starting tuesday to ensure the safety of the air 
traffic system which he said had been weakened by the eastern 
disruptions 
duffy said the action would slow air traffic but insisted that 
was not the intent 
battered by years of labor tension and growing competition in the 
deregulated airline business eastern has racked up nearly 25 
billion in debt and claims daily losses of more than 1 million it 
wants 150 million in concessions from the international association 
of machinists over four years the union wants 50 million in raises 
matell said his tough remarks were not a threat that pilots could 
be laid off but eastern may retaliate with firings frank lorenzo 
who controls eastern through his giant texas air corp holding 
company sacked striking continental airlines employees in 1983 and 
put the carrier into bankruptcy 
lorenzo is the main target of the strikers anger he is widely 
mistrusted by eastern workers because of what they call his 
triumphant unioncrushing campaign at sister carrier continental 
many accuse him of provoking the strike to do the same at eastern

the bush administration will seek an extra 300 
million from congress for veterans administration medical care this 
year sen frank murkowski ralaska said monday 
edward derwinski the new head of the va had sought additional 
money for the vas medical services branch which agency officials 
have said for months is 600 million to 1 billion short of what it 
needs this year 
derwinski who joins the cabinet as veterans affairs secretary on 
march 15 said last week he doubted that the office of management 
and budget would approve a request for more money this year 
murkowskis announcement came at a hearing of the senate veterans 
affairs committee on the vas budget for the next fiscal year which 
begins oct 1 
barbara clay spokeswoman for the office of management and 
budget said she was unable to confirm what murkowski had announced 
about the current year the issue has been the timing of such a 
request she said 
former president reagan had requested 2996 billion for the va 
in the coming fiscal year not much above the 2977 billion in the 
current year of those totals 1099 billion would be devoted to 
medical care in the new year up from 108 billion this year 
the house veterans affairs committee has asked the budget 
committee to add 13 billion to the agencys budget for next year 
of which 11 billion would be for medical care 
derwinski has sought an additional 607 million for next year of 
which 512 million would be for medical care ms clay said it was 
premature to discuss final figures for next year which will depend 
on the administrations negotiations with congress on the overall 
budget 
agency officials have complained to congress they have been 
forced to raid equipment and supplies accounts to keep paying 
salaries 
as an example of this process the vas medical director dr 
john gronvall told sen dennis deconcini dariz that a new 
nursing care installation at prescott ariz wouldnt open for now 
even though complete 
at the insistence of congressional appropriations committees the 
va had borrowed 46 million in funds earmarked for equipping new 
facilities to maintain a higher level of staff than would 
otherwise be the case gronvall said 
if we get a supplemental appropriation well pay that back 
and the prescott unit should be able to open later in this fiscal 
year gronvall said

a court extended the custody monday for 
a man suspected of the 1986 murder of prime minister olof palme amid 
charges that his continued detention was aimed at winning a 
confession 
it was the sixth time that stockholms district court granted 
prosecutors requests to hold christer pettersson who was arrested 
dec 14 
pettersson 41 who has a history of violent crime and mental 
problems is suspected of shooting the fourterm prime minister in 
downtown stockholm prosecutors have said they have circumstantial 
evidence against him but they need further evidence to file charges 
astrid holgersson an expert in witness psychology at stockholm 
university charged that petterssons detention in solitary 
confinement for nearly three months was a psychological assault 
that could lead to a false confession 
holgersson wrote in the dagens nyheter newspaper that such 
treatment can after a few days lead to serious psychological 
disorders and a confession aimed at getting out of a 
psychologically unbearable situation 
she said it appeared to be an example of malpractice against an 
individual by the swedish judicial system 
petterssons lawyer arne liljeros who objected to previous 
detention orders raised no protest against the latest court 
decision 
the conditions for my client are ok he told swedens tt news 
agency he is not subjected to any psychological assault 
we must accept that he is forced to be in jail for a while 
after all there are circumstances against him liljeros was 
quoted as saying 
the search for palmes killer produced the largest manhunt in 
swedish criminal history centered at first on a suspected 
international conspiracy an 8 million reward offer produced no 
breakthroughs 
pressure to solve the case prompted senior officials to sidestep 
swedish laws the former head of the investigation hans holmer was 
dismissed in 1987 amid a dispute with prosecutors over who was in 
charge of the case 
former justice minister annagreta leijon quit in june when it 
was revealed she had supported a private investigation into the 
case which included illegal wiretapping and unauthorized access to 
classified documents

first lady barbara bush began her own literacy 
foundation monday saying its goal is to break the generational 
cycle of illiteracy by involving parents as well as children in 
learning 
its become very clear to me that we must attack the problem of 
a more literate america through the family mrs bush told guests 
at a white house luncheon to launch the barbara bush foundation for 
family literacy 
mrs bush has been a leading advocate of reading and literacy 
programs for many years she will serve as honorary chairman of the 
foundation but will not be involved in raising or spending funds 
the premise of the new foundation is that since parents who cant 
read often raise children who cant read both generations need help 
to break the cycle 
joan abrahamson chairman of the foundation board said the group 
hopes to add an intergenerational dimension to existing 
successful literacy programs provide seed money for family literacy

successful volunteers teachers and students the foundation also 
plans to publish a book highlighting successful family literacy 
programs 
president bush made a cameo appearance at the luncheon calling 
himself a fly on the wall regarding his wifes project 
bush said the foundation fits with the concept of outreach the 
concept of 1000 points of light the concept of one american 
helping another that he has tried to stress in his administration

an italian human rights worker said 
monday he was kidnapped and tortured with lighted cigarettes by 
three men who identified themselves as members of a death squad 
luis tenderini head of the justice and peace commission of the 
roman catholic archdiocese of recife and olinda 1500 miles 
northeast of rio said he was driving home saturday night when a car 
with three men forced him to stop 
tenderini 46 said the men took him to an isolated area and for 
two hours burned him with cigarettes on the chest and forehead and 
threatened to kill him 
tenderini who has lived in brazil for 20 years said he believed 
he was targeted because the commission has been pressing the state 
government to investigate the death squads activities 
the death squads made up of offduty and retired policemen 
first appeared in brazil during the 196485 rightwing military 
government they summarily executed known or suspected criminals and 
political opponents of the regime 
since 1987 death squads have executed about 500 people in 
recife according to church estimates

the soviet union on monday proposed huge 
reductions in troops and armor and recommended that the warsaw pact 
and nato negotiate to eliminate all battlefield nuclear weapons from 
europe 
foreign minister eduard a shevarndadzes proposals went far 
beyond the reductions nato plans to suggest at conventional arms 
talks that begin thursday 
a us official briefing reporters on condition of anonymity 
said shevardnadzes purpose in proposing the missile talks was to 
see whether possible fissures in the alliance could be developed 
i wouldnt characterize it as one of the most positive 
characteristics of shevardnadzes speech the official said 
secretary of state james a baker iii told 35 foreign ministers 
gathered in a baroque palace that the wests goal at least 
initially is to reduce the warsaw pacts current advantage in 
conventional forces 
estimates vary but give the sovietled alliance at least a 21 
advantage in tanks 
the warsaw pacts conventional military preponderance 
especially in the spearheads of attack is what makes an invasion 
possible baker said 
he urged soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to implement the 
new thinking that guides economic and political reform in the 
soviet union by renouncing the brezhnev doctrine beyond any shadow 
of a doubt 
that doctrine permits military intervention in a soviet bloc 
country in the event of a liberal insurrection the late president 
leonid i brezhnev introduced it after the red army crushed the 
liberal prague spring of 1968 in czechoslovakia 
those in the east should be free of the fear that armed soviet 
intervention justified by the brezhnev doctrine would be used 
again to deny them choice baker said 
he also said australia would organize a conference to prevent the 
spread of chemical weapons and the bush administration was exploring 
ways to speed the removal of us chemical weapons from west germany 
baker added however unilateral action is not enough the 
soviet union has enormous stocks of chemical weapons threatening 
europe we therefore call on the soviets to join us to accelerate 
the destruction of their enormous stockpile of these frightening 
weapons 
in bonn chancellor helmut kohl said i welcome this intention 
to explore ways for the early removal of chemical weapons from the 
federal republic 
kohls chief spokesman friedhelm ost said earlier baker 
telephoned the chancellor saturday night and told him the aging us 
chemical weapons would be withdrawn by 1992 
shevardnadze countered a nato proposal to retire at least 25000 
warsaw pact tanks then reduce armor artillery and personnel 
carriers on both sides by 510 percent with a threephase plan for 
radical cuts 
the foreign ministers arms reduction program went far beyond 
natos by adding missiles combat aircraft and soldiers 
let me ask what kind of reductions are these if they do not 
affect the main component of armed forces their personnel he 
said and surely airplanes and helicopters can be used for a 
surprise attack 
in the soviet second phase 500000 men on each side would be 
demobilized 
according to the union of concerned scientists a private us 
research group the warsaw pact has 309 million soldiers and nato 
more than 213 million nato spends about 300 billion a year to 
defend western europe where 326000 americans are stationed 
as shevardnadze explained it the soviet plans progression would 
be 
first phase two to three years eliminate the imbalance in 
troops and arms cutting 10 percent to 15 percent from the current 
lowest numbers 
second also two to three years reduce forces by another 25 
percent and withdraw battlefield nuclear weapons to a safe distance 
from the line of contact between the military alliances that 
would make much of west germany along with east germany and 
czechoslovakia a nuclearfree zone 
third convert remaining forces to a strictly defensive 
character 
while the reductions are made shevardnadze said negotiations 
should be conducted on eliminating tactical nuclear weapons in 
europe 
his proposal conflicts with the 40yearold us policy of 
deterring the soviets with with a mix of weaponry incuding 
battlefield nuclear arms which have a maximum range of 300 miles 
kohl wants to delay modernizing us lance missiles in west 
germany for up to three years with the support of norway and 
officials of other west european governments baker is trying to 
change the chancellors mind 
in december gorbachev announced a unilateral withdrawal of six 
soviet tank divisions and 50000 men from eastern europe and said 
soviet forces in europe and asia would be reduced by 500000 
how shevardnadzes threephase reduction fits into that is not 
clear the foreign minister provided few details of an obviously 
complicated proposition 
baker said in his speech the warsaw pact has 31 advantages in 
tanks and artillery and more than 21 in armored troop carriers 
he said gorbachevs offer was a good start but the warsaw 
pact would retain a 21 edge in tanks and artillery even after the 
soviet leaders reductions

the us government said monday it regrets a 
laotian decision to postpone a joint excavation of the site of the 
crash of an american plane that went down during the indochina war 
state department spokesman charles redman said he understood the 
delay was related to a us government report last week which 
criticized laos performance in international efforts to curb drug 
abuse 
i dont have the exact text of what they said but i think 
thats the sense he said 
a team of us experts had been scheduled to fly to laos over the 
weekend for the excavation but laotian officials delayed the 
project which was part of the us effort to locate the remains of 
missing us military personnel 
we regret that the lao government has temporarily postponed 
plans for a joint crashsite excavation which had been scheduled to 
start march 4th redman said 
the us and laos have been working together closely to 
accelerate cooperation to resolve the issue of americans still 
missing or otherwise unaccounted for in laos he added 
redman noted that four excavations have already been conducted 
going back to february 1985 
we hope that the delay of this fifth excavation will be brief 
and are prepared to send our team of technical experts to laos 
immediately once the lao reschedule this important humanitarian 
effort he said we also look forward to expanding our dialogue 
and cooperation on narcotics matters 
the annual us international narcotics control report said there 
had been no reduction in opium production in laos in the previous 
year and that heroin refining continues 
and there continues to be information that the extensive 
involvement of military and civilian government officials in the 
narcotics trade suggests this is a matter of de facto government 
policy the report said

roman catholic missionaries say 3500 
people have starved to death this year in the remote northeastern 
part of wartorn mozambique the national news agency aim reported 
monday 
it was the first indication of mass starvation in the isolated 
coastal district of memba aim quoted the missionaries as saying all 
the deaths occurred in memba 240 miles south of the border with 
tanzania 
widespread food shortages affect mozambique and an estimated 6 
million of the countrys 15 million people need food aid 
aims report of starvation deaths could not be confirmed 
independently an aim reporter who visited the region last week 
wrote that he witnessed five deaths from starvation in one town on a 
single day 
the region has been hard hit by the countrys 12yearold civil 
war and a yearlong drought 
threats of attacks by rightist rebels combined with poor roads 
and transportation have made it difficult for the government and 
relief agencies to provide regular supplies to the remote region 
aim said 
the agency also reported an estimated 600000 people most 
children have died as a result of the war 
citing a report produced jointly by unicef and the mozambican 
government aim said the overall casualty figure includes deaths of 
494000 children from causes directly attributable to malnutrition 
associated with the war 
mozambique is one of the worlds poorest countries two of every 
10 babies born here die before their first birthday according to 
the unicef report as many as 375 children out of 1000 die before 
the age of five among the highest rates in the world the report 
said 
the war pits the marxist government against guerrillas of the 
mozambique national resistance whose hitandrun attacks on 
civilian and military targets have severely disrupted the countrys 
economy 
south africa backed the rebels in the early 1980s but says it 
has ceased assistance despite mozambican claims that pretorias 
support continues 
rebel attacks shut down 822 health clinics between 1982 and 1987 
only 567 of those have been rebuilt the report said 
some preventive activities such as vaccination campaigns have 
to be organized almost clandestinely in order to prevent them from 
becoming a target the report added 
a us state department report last year estimated that 100000 
people were killed in the war from 1985 to 1987

government and opposition negotiators had a 
stormy session monday over a solidarity proposal to reduce 60 
percent inflation by tying wages to the cost of living opposition 
economists said 
the round table talks on economic and political reform 
entered their fifth week with delegates from both sides under 
pressure from their leaders to reach agreement by late this month 
lech walesa who founded solidarity in 1980 and is trying to get 
the union made legal again said he probably will have his second 
meeting with interior minister czeslaw kiszczak in less than a week 
about problems in the talks 
members of the communist party central committee and leaders of 
provincial party organizations convened to hear reports on progress 
the meeting was called a consultation not a formal party 
session but was expected to produce advice for the government 
negotiators 
walesa has said he expects new political decisions intended 
to move the talks forward 
about the indexing question opposition economist andrzej 
wielowieyski said we had the impression today the government side 
blocked itself we are going to face a very difficult situation 
tomorrow i think the situation is very difficult and very 
dangerous 
wielowieyski a member of the working group on economic issues 
said officials feared indexing would limit the authority of managers 
who control pay decisions 
he said solidarity leaders decided sunday the government must 
agree to a form of indexation if it expects union agreement to a 
package of reforms that includes opposition membership in parliament 
our demand for indexing is the indispensable condition 
wielowieyski said 
solidarity believes wages must be indexed to inflation at least 
temporarily to give workers some sense of security while economic 
reforms are introduced 
deputy premier ireneusz sekula said on state television the 
government believes some indexing is needed but it has to be 
introduced in a prudent manner so it does not disturb the 
motivating function of pay 
walesa came to warsaw by train monday from gdansk where he works 
as a shipyard electrician and he met with opposition delegates to 
the talks said piotr konopka a spokesman for the union leader he 
would not give details 
working groups on trade union problems and youth issues also 
reported no progress monday 
although the union has resolved the issue of how to legalize 
solidarity and other unions it is stalled on the mechanics of 
organizing 
the youth subgroup had no problems with a proposal to make the 
independent students association legal again but government 
negotiators said they want a broader agreement under which the 
opposition would endorse a statement on values in rearing children 
todays discussion of the youth table resembled a mental 
hospital rather than negotiations said andrzej celinski leader 
of the opposition team 
slawomir wiatr a government delegate said it was possible no 
agreement would be reached in the youth talks but added that the 
decision to legalize the student association might be made at a 
higher level 
walesa has expressed optimism in recent days about the 
unprecedented talks between communist authorities and the opposition 
movement led by solidarity 
the talks are aimed at producing a compromise under which the 
government would legalize solidarity and other banned groups in 
exchange for their help with a reform program 
solidarity the first independent union movement in the soviet 
bloc was banned after martial law was imposed in december 1981

a texas democrat said monday that republican 
propaganda terrorists are trying to intimidate gop members of 
the house ethics committee into voting against house speaker jim 
wright and ought to be punished 
rep ron coleman of el paso said the righteous right is 
operating its lobbying effort from within the house and is behind 
a mailing insisting republicans have to be unified and anything 
short of censure or expulsion would be a whitewash he said it 
sounds like a vigilante group out of the last century with a 
hang him regardless of the evidence mentality 
the ethics committee has been meeting behind closed doors over a 
series of ethics charges against wright including allegations he 
used his office for personal financial gain an independent counsel 
has spent nine months investigating the charges 
wright has denied violating any law or rule of the house 
although he has conceded he might have done some things differently 
if given the chance to do them over 
the panel evenly split with republican and democratic members 
met to consider the independent counsels findings last week and 
the outcome of the investigation may be known sometime this week 
speaking on the house floor thursday coleman decried the actions 
of a number of wrights republican opponents including rep newt 
gingrich of georgia 
recent news accounts make it clear this small band of 
propaganda terrorists has been plotting all along on a series of 
conspiracies to discredit speaker wright and other democrats 
coleman said moreover they are cynically trying to intimidate 
republican members of the ethics committee into finding some 
complaint against the speaker to be valid 
coleman said the groups efforts are tantamount to jury 
tampering and its criminal he is proposing the house adopt 
sanctions such as censure or expulsion for members found to have 
improperly influenced members of the ethics committee 
gingrich did not respond immediately to requests to his office

helicopter gunships and navy gunboats of 
the armys christian command patrolled lebanons territorial waters 
under druze rocket fire monday to prevent foreign merchant ships 
from using illegal port facilities operated by feuding militias 
the move aimed at choking off the main revenues of christian and 
moslem private armies has triggered a political crisis in the 
moslem camp 
police said neither of the armys two frenchbuilt gazelle 
gunships was hit when militiamen of druze warlord walid jumblatt 
fired rocket launchers near the port of jiye 15 miles south of 
beirut 
to underscore moslem objections to the christian patrols the 
moslem army command ordered the closing of a green line crossing 
point linking the capitals christian and moslem sectors only one 
week after rival military forces reopened it 
a communique issued by the command of maj gen sami khatib who 
heads moslem army units in west beirut said the decision to close 
the crossing at beirut port was made on orders from acting prime 
minister salim hoss moslem cabinet 
the communique said the christians sea and air patrols were 
provocative acts 
the makeshift harbor at jiye has been the main sea outlet for the 
druze community a moslem sect based mainly in the chouf mountains 
since they captured it from the christians in 1985 
a defense ministry communique said foreign ships heading for 
lebanon have been warned not to enter any of the militiacontrolled 
harbors along the mediterranean countrys 110mile coastline 
the ban was ordered sunday by gen michel aoun who heads the 
christian military cabinet vying for power with hoss syrianbacked 
government 
it was part of aouns campaign to restore state authority eroded 
by 14 years of civil war in which christian and moslem militias took 
over many government functions 
the militias use the ports to bring in arms and supplies as well 
as imported goods sold in the areas they control depriving the 
state treasury of an estimated 100 million a year in customs duties 
were not forcibly shutting militia harbors or blockading them 
we are merely blocking foreign ships from going there a 
defense ministry spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
if a ship insists on violating the ban it will be seized and 
forced to sail into beirut port to question its captain before 
beginning legal procedures said the spokesman 
he listed five legal ports beirut jounieh and tripoli north of 
the capital and sidon and tyre to the south 
to supervise the new ban aoun revived a maritime authority made 
up of representatives from the public works ministry the navy air 
force police and the customs department 
hoss said monday that the ban could undermine the positive mood 
that has lately emerged about a possible end to lebanons plight 
he was referring to mediation efforts by an arab league committee 
set up in january to help resolve a constitutional crisis that has 
left the country without a president for 162 days and threatens to 
formalize its de facto partition into christian and moslem cantons 
president amin gemayel appointed aoun to head an interim cabinet 
when his 6yearterm expired sept 22 without a successor being 
elected 
moslems refused to accept aouns appointment and pledged 
allegiance to hoss who governed during the amin presidency 
in another development monday an associate of roger tamraz a 
lebanese international banker said tamraz was kidnapped feb 19 and 
is being held for ransom 
but some beirut newspapers say the 48yearold tamraz fled after 
a run on his bank and after accusations he embezzled 200 million 
police said they know nothing about his reported disappearance 
tamrazs spokesman in west beirut could not be contacted by 
telephone 
until recently tamraz was chairman of bank almashrek lebanons 
second largest bank which is involved in a liquidity crisis with 
several subsidiaries including banks in switzerland france jordan 
and qatar

more than 100 coal miners ended a fiveday strike 
monday after the government agreed to correct their pay system a 
dissident reported 
sergei grigoryants a moscowbased journalist said sources in 
the ural mountain city of vorkuta reported that 115 miners had been 
striking while underground since thursday and began a hunger strike 
two days ago 
vorkuta with a population of 90000 is 1200 miles northeast of 
moscow it is in the pechora basin one of the soviet unions major 
coal mining regions that in 1985 produced 28 million metric tons of 
bituminous coal 
workers in the northern mine began the strike to protest 
increased work orders to demand replacement of the facilitys 
director and chief economist and a reduction of the management 
staff according to grigoryants he said the strikers also demanded 
changes in the salary disbursement system 
a group of supporters who called their organization solidarity 
after the independent union movement in poland pressed the miners 
case with authorities while the strikers remained underground 
according to grigoryants 
he said soviet coal minister mikhail i shchadov arrived in 
vorkuta saturday negotiated with the strikers and promised to 
partially meet their demands including paying them 158000 rubles 
254800 to compensate for problems in the salary system 
grigoryants said the miners announced the end of the strike on 
monday 
the soviet government has traditionally claimed that strikes are 
inconsistent with the communist system that places priority on the 
interests of workers but last year there were strikes of an 
unprecedented scale and length in armenia and azerbaijan in the 
dispute over control of the nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan

sen howard metzenbaum urged the justice 
department to review the antitrust implication of the timewarner 
merger because he said cable television customers could be big 
losers in the merger between the media giants 
metzenbaum dohio said there were strong indications that 
the 18 billion merger between time inc and warner communications 
could substantially reduce competition and diversity in the 
communications and entertainment field particularly in the cable 
television industry 
such a development is especially disturbing in light of a 
continuing trend toward further concentration and reduced 
possibilities for meaningful competition in cable television 
metzenbaum said in a letter to charles rule the assistant attorney 
general in charge of the justice departments antitrust division 
iurge you to undertake a careful and thorough review of this 
proposal said metzenbaum chairman of the senate judiciary 
subcommittee on antitrust monopolies and business rights 
vickie togans a staff assistant in rules office said the 
letter had not been received there monday 
metzenbaum said the merger which was announced saturday would 
link two of the worlds leading media and entertainment 
conglomerates creating a company worth 18 billion 
time publishes time people sports illustrated and fortune 
magazines and owns home box office the nations largest pay cable 
service along with hbos sister cable service cinemax time also 
owns american television and communications corp the nations 
second largest cable system 
warner communications owns the warner bros movie and television 
studios warner records and lorimar telepictures corp along with 
warner cable communications the fifth largest cable system in the 
nation 
metzenbaum said less than 1 percent of the 8000 communities 
nationwide served by cable have more than one cable system cable 
is an unregulated monopoly throughout the entire country he said 
he said a timewarner merger could extend the dominance of the 
larger multisystem cable operators over small cable companies 
with the acquisition of warner cable systems there is an even 
greater incentive for time to deny competing technologies its 
existing programming and the new programming which timewarner is 
expected to create 
it is this ability to control both the conduit for programming 
the cable wire and the content of the programming through mso 
equity interest in programming ventures that poses the greatest 
threat to consumers metzenbaum said 
the absence of competition in the delivery of cable programming 
means that consumers have no protection against unrestrained rate 
hikes the de facto editorial control which msos can exercise over 
new programming threatens diversity of information and entertainment 
sources available to cable viewers he said

two air force retirees who helped supply the 
nicaraguan contras testified monday they also got involved in the 
iran arms deals through an oliver north associate the first mention 
of iran in norths monthold trial 
the testimony by richard b gadd and later by robert dutton 
brought a quick reaction from us district judge gerhard a gesell 
who reminded lawyers in the case i asked you not to go into the 
hostage situation 
charges involving diversion to the contras of profits from the 
iran arms deals were dropped earlier after the administration 
complained that too much damaging classified material would have to 
be disclosed in connection with those counts 
gesell called lawyers to the bench monday and said bringing up 
iran and the hostages will extend the trial unnecessarily 
however defense attorney brendan sullivan continued to dwell on 
the iran issue in his questioning 
with the jury out of the courtroom he told gesell that the 
armstoiran initiative is mentioned in four of the 12 counts 
remaining against north and that prosecutor john keker repeatedly 
referred to iran in his opening statement to the jury 
said the 78yearold gesell im simply trying to limit proof 
so we could end this trial while im still alive 
gadd testified he was brought into the iran deals by former maj 
gen richard secord who told him this could lead to the release 
of the hostages in lebanon 
general secord asked me to assist in the transportation of arms 
to iran gadd testified 
dutton who followed gadd to the stand said he went to work for 
secord the day after he retired after 20 years in the air force on 
may 1 1986 and was put to work on the contra supply operation 
which was suffering from disorganization 
he said he had worked with secord in the 1980 attempt to rescue 
the 52 american hostages held in iran and was called by the retired 
general again to help in 1986 
dutton was asked monday if he believed the new effort was to be 
under the authority of the president 
yes he said 
when dutton first joined the contra resupply operation he said 
none of the airdrops had been successful signal fires that pilots 
expected werent there radio communications didnt happen by 
september he said things had been whipped into shape and there had 
been 15 successful missions 
dutton was so proud of the progress that he put together an album 
of pictures and showed them to north 
he said he would like to take it with him and show it to his 
top boss said dutton 
who did you understand he was talking about asked michael 
bromwich one of the prosecution lawyers 
the president of the united states said dutton 
he said north told him i know i cat get you a medal but some 
day the president will shake your hand and thank you but that 
never happened dutton said 
dutton said the supply flights stopped after oct 5 1986 when 
one of the planes was shot down the pilot copilot and a contra 
were killed and the loadmaster eugene hasenfus bailed out and was 
captured 
at days end monday conservative fundraiser carl spitz 
channel had begun testimony that was to be resumed tuesday 
gadd a retired air force lieutenant colonel helped handle the 
covert effort to ship arms to the contras in early 1986 when 
official us military aid was barred and ran flights with 
humanitarian aid when that was legal 
in january 1986 gadd said i was told they desired to move 
classified cargo from the united states to iran secord he said 
asked if i could arrange that 
secord told him gadd said that flights must leave from the 
united states no one must know the cargo and no one must know the 
ultimate destination it could not land in europe and could not go 
through customs and he said it was possible the aircraft and crew 
could be detained in iran and not released 
gadd testified secord became impatient while he was trying to 
figure a way to meet the requirements he quoted the former general 
as saying once you must figure this out you must convince 
southern air transport to do the job this could lead to the release 
of the hostages 
southern air transport which once was ciaowned by that time 
had been turned over to private ownership and had been used to fly 
aid to the contras 
the company did become involved in iran arms flights but gadd 
was not asked that specific question 
gadd said secord also asked him in 1986 to make the arrangements 
to fly north and his boss national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane to iran 
mcfarlane earlier pleaded guilty to charges in connection with 
the irancontra affair and was sentenced friday in a separate 
federal court to a 20000 fine and probation but no prison term 
after congress in october 1985 authorized 27 million to be spent 
for humanitarian aid to the contras gadd said he contracted with 
the state department to haul supplies to central america 
once lethal weapons were added to the supplies by contra 
officials when a plane stopped in el salvador to refuel on the way 
to hondurs gadd said 
later at a meeting at the state department gadd said they put 
it to me this should never have been donethe mix should not 
exceed 10 percent arms and ammunition 
among the 12 criminal charges against north are four counts of 
lying to congress by denying his involvement in the contra resupply 
operation

in becoming the first democrat to support john 
tower president bushs nominee for secretary of defense alabama 
sen howell heflin followed the rule he always applies to 
presidential appointments 
my general approach is that the president is entitled to have 
his appointments unless it can be proved that the person is 
flawed or that he would be a detriment to the country heflin said 
last week after meeting with bush to discuss the tower nomination 
in the case of tower heflin said he was not convinced after 
reading the fbi reports that the former texas senator has a drinking 
problem that would disqualify him from serving in the nations top 
defense post 
had tower been nominated for a lifetime judgeship heflin might 
well have voted against confirmation but he said the fact that the 
secretary of defense serves at the pleasure of the president makes 
bush responsible and accountable for towers conduct 
it is the presidents cabinet heflin said not congress 
cabinet 
being at the center of a partisan battle over a presidential 
appointee is nothing new for heflin a 67yearold exmarine and 
former alabama chief justice who was former president reagans most 
consistent democratic support in the senate 
as a member of the senate judiciary committee heflin frequently 
found himself holding the balance of power when controversial reagan 
appointments divided the panel along partisan lines 
his vote in committee against reagans nomination of robert h 
bork to the supreme court in 1987 helped persuade other southern 
democrats to oppose bork who eventually was rejected by the full 
senate 
heflin also cast the deciding vote on the only other reagan 
appointees rejected by the judiciary committee the nomination of 
william bradford reynolds to the thirdranking post in the justice 
department and the nomination of jefferson b sessions iii to a 
federal judgeship in south alabama 
heflin was widely criticized in his home state for opposing both 
bork and sessions but his popularity does not appear to have waned 
in alabama despite the increasingly tendency in recent years of the 
states voters to support republican candidates 
during his first senate campaign in 1978 heflin was so popular 
that thengov george c wallace decided not to challenge him 
heflin carried all but five of alabamas 69 counties in the 
democratic primary and won move than 90 percent of the general 
election vote 
he was reelected in 1984 with 63 percent of the vote over a 
conservative republican congressman his only announced challenger 
in 1990 is state sen bill cabiness of birmingham a businessman who 
chaired the states delegation to the republican convention that 
nominated bush for president

an iranian trade fair has successfully 
introduced merchandise from the islamic state to the lebanese 
market drawing 100000 visitors and selling 60000 worth of goods 
a day 
many deals have been struck between iranian companies and 
lebanese businessmen both christian and moslem said abbas 
zaferian director of the second trade exhibition of the islamic 
republic of iran 
i cannot give you a final figure but i can assure you that the 
number is large he added 
zaferian said 70 companies are participating in the fair that 
opened feb 20 at a hotel in a syriancontrolled district of west 
beirut it ends tuesday 
he refused to say whether the fair had political motives such as 
supporting the 1 million shiite moslems who make up lebanons 
largest single sect i only answer questions related to the 
commercial aspect zaferian said 
iran and its mainly shiite moslem population back the hezbollah 
or party of god militia which seeks to set up an islamic state 
modeled on iran in southern lebanon 
hezbollah intermittently fought fierce battles from april until 
january against amal its syrianbacked rival after 500 people were 
killed iran and syria brokered a truce that currently is holding 
at the entrance to the fair iranian flags and huge portraits of 
revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini contrast sharply 
with other events at the seaside hotel a cheese and wine party and 
a greek night 
cheap prices make the iranian goods attractive not only to 
shiites but also to other lowincome and middleincome groups 
people flock to the exhibition where an air conditioner is 
priced at 90 a gas stove at 39 and a pair of tennis shoes costs 
2 
the fair may mark a breakthrough for iranianmade products in 
lebanon despite their mediocre quality 
nobody seemed to mind the long wait to park in the hotels 
spacious grounds or meticulous security checks 
its worth it i cannot afford to pay 40 for a pair of jeans 
here its only 7 said a woman who identified herself as soha a 
sunni moslem the quality may not be the same as french designer 
ones but were living through hard days and jeans are jeans 
a fair salesman said irans first trade exhibition in lebanon 
last year provided an opportunity to assess the market 
that was just an exhibition people could not purchase any of 
the products but it helped make this years exhibition 
successful said the salesman who refused to give his name 
cars assembled in iran were popular with prices ranging from 
4200 for a renault 5 to 13000 for a range rover 
a government education stand was one of the fairs biggest 
boasting a bookshop a childrens corner and a video room playing an 
iranian film the eagles the film showed iranian jets mounting 
an attack against bases in iraq jubilant crowds watching the movie 
shouted allaho akbar god is great as the jets unleashed 
their bombs 
wealthier people also attended the fair but for different goods 
i came here to look at the silk carpets and buy some caviar and 
pistachio nuts said a woman whose hand glittered with diamond 
rings these luxuries are the only iranian goods imported to lebanon 
regularly although the trade is minimal 
a silk carpet runner measuring a bit more than 5 feet by 3 feet 
cost 1827 and two pounds of caviar sold for 200 
the caviar shelves were wiped clean during the first few 
days said zaferian people would buy it here for 200 and sell 
it outside for at least double the price

prince charles appealed monday for a ban on 
ozonedepleting chemicals and said it is up to developed countries 
to help repair the damage those chemicals have caused to the earths 
environment 
the heir to the british throne said people around the world are 
looking to their leaders to take bold decisions to save the 
environment and not to put off those critical decisions that will 
ultimately cause our grandchildren to curse us 
he welcomed decisions by the united states and the european 
economic community to try to ban chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs by 
the end of the century but said i fear even that will be 10 years 
too late 
earlier monday the soviet union said it needed more scientific 
evidence that cfcs destroy the ozone layer before it would agree to 
speed up its phaseout of such chemicals 
we think that any decisions taken should be wellgrounded 
and should have a firm scientific basis said vladimir zhakarov 
head of the soviet delegation at a 120nation conference on the 
ozone layer 
if we take a decision which is not wellgrounded we can 
interfere and destroy the economies of the eveloping countries he 
said 
sherwood rowland an atmospheric chemist from the university of 
california at irvine said they the soviets sound very much 
like people from the european community a year ago and from the 
united states two years ago before they became aware of the 
problem 
most western scientists agree that chlorofluorocarbons commonly 
used in refrigerators aerosols and fastfood packaging are 
gradually depleting the ozone shield that protects the earth from 
the suns cancercausing ultraviolet rays 
the compounds also trap heat warming the earths surface and 
causing potentially major climate changes a process known as the 
greenhouse effect 
scientific expeditions to the antarctic have pinpointed the 
compounds as the cause of an ozone hole about the size of the 
continental united states 
preliminary soviet data suggests an ozone depletion of about 25 
percent over parts of europe and as far into the soviet union as 
siberia said zhakarov chairman of the soviet committee on ozone 
protection 
the soviet delegation could not provide a map showing the 
boundaries of this area which it said was caused by cyclones not 
the compounds zhakarov said the area could not be described as an 
ozone hole 
the soviet union is among the 31 nations that have signed the 
1987 montreal protocol agreeing to halve the compounds by 1999 
the united states and the 12nation european economic community 
have said they will try for a total ban by that time 
if there is proved scientific data that we should phase out 
these substances we will support this idea zhakarov said we 
dont have such proof yet 
however zhakarovs interpreter said the soviet delegate 
personally favors quicker action 
the soviet union now produces 130000 tons of the compounds a 
year he said about 10 percent of total world production 
his country remains committed to halving that by 1999 zhakarov 
said acknowledging it will cost a lot of money 
liz cook ozone campaign chairman for the friends of the 
earthusa environmental group said the soviets were trying to buy 
themselves a little time before they have to commit to a policy 
the science is clearly there its not certain to me how they 
dont have a clear picture when the rest of the world seems to be 
quite convinced that we need to go for a phaseout 
both china and india called for the industrialized countries 
which use the vast majority of the compounds to establish a fund to 
help developing nations acquire the technology to replace the 
compounds 
zr ansari indias environment minister said the fund should 
not cut into aid to fight poverty 
any reduction in these resources for whatever reason would mean 
that the poor of these countries will have to wait longer for the 
promised freedom from hunger and poverty he said today the 
poor are no more prepared to wait and there will be social upheaval 
if they are asked to wait any longer

an environmental group charged monday that 
spent nuclear fuel from japanese research reactors is en route to 
the savannah river nuclear weapons plant in violation of a us 
moratorium on such shipments 
but the department of energy said the waste fuel shipment was 
authorized while the agency still had a policy of accepting the 
shipments 
the group greenpeace said the secret radioactive shipment 
violates a sixmonth moratorium on reactor fuel shipments to the 
united states imposed by doe on jan 1 to assess environmental 
risks 
if it was too dangerous on jan 1 it is too dangerous on march 
1 greenpeace spokesman damon moglen said in a statement from the 
organization at a time when the roof is falling in on the doe 
weapons facilities it should not bring more waste into the united 
states through the back door 
the united states supplies japan and several western european 
countries with highly enriched uranium for civilian research 
reactors until dec 31 in order to prevent weapons proliferation 
it required that the waste fuel be returned 
doe spokeswoman chris sankey said the department let that policy 
expire so we could expand on an environmental assessment of our 
fuel receipt policy at the savannah river complex she said the 
spent fuel left japan on nov 26 
we will have no further shipments approved after dec 31 
anything not authorized before dec 31 will not proceed until we 
have a new policy in effect she said she said she did not know 
how long the moratorium would last 
according to greenpeace the spent fuel is on board the 
britishowned pacific sandpiper and is due in hampton roads va 
after a twoweek voyage from britain the waste ultimately is bound 
for does savannah river nuclear weapons plant in aiken sc where 
it will be reprocessed 
moglen said greenpeace will track the shipment to its destination 
to let the communities along the route know what the doe wont 
tell them 
safety and environmental problems at savannah river last spring 
led to the shutdown of the nations only reactors that produce 
tritium and plutonium safety and management at all 17 nuclear 
weapons facilities in the country have drawn severe criticism and 
the general accounting office has estimated it will take 155 
billion over three decades to clean up and modernize does weapons 
complexes

vienna where both are attending eastwest talks on reducing 
conventional forces in europe 
i left mr shevardnadze no doubt of our view that the 
principles involved in that problem are of universal application 
howe told a news conference 
howe said he told shevardnadze there can be no justification 
for irans incitement to murder and no justification for 
seeking to impair the freedom of speech in a country like ours 
howe said he also told shevardnadze that that view was a view 
which should commend itself to both halves of a common european 
house 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has used the term common 
european house to portray western europe and the east bloc as 
having common interests because of their geographical proximity 
howe said there was no question of any mediation discussion on 
either side indicating the question of a possible soviet 
gobetween role did not come up 
the 12 european community nations angered by irans threats 
have recalled their ambassadors from tehran 
rushdie is a british citizen many moslems charge that his novel 
the satanic verses blasphemes their faith khomeini irans 
revolutionary and religious patriarch urged moslems to hunt down 
and kill rushdie 
howe did not say how shevardnadze responded at their talks on 
monday 
however his remarks indicated he is not satisfied with the 
kremlins stance on the threats against rushdie 
moscow has said western countries are justified in their 
indignation over the matter but soviet officials while not 
condoning the death decree also said khomeini may have felt he had 
to denounce rushdie under islamic teachings 
shevardnadze last week met with iranian officials in tehran and 
later the soviets offered to help cool the strife between iran and 
western nations 
in a midday speech on monday shevardnadze mentioned the dispute 
and said no nation should try to gain an advantage from the rift 
he said in calling for international cooperation to improve 
conditions in the middle east there should be no playing on any 
contradictions whether it is israels conflict with the arabs or 
the difficulties in the wests relations with iran 
swedens ambassador to iran hakan granqvist said after 
returning to tehran that rushdies novel was a serious insult to 
moslem beliefs staterun tehran radio monitored in cyprus 
reported monday 
granqvist was recalled for consultations after khomeinis death 
threat against rushdie 
the radio quoted granqvist as saying at a meeting with deputy 
foreign minister mohammad javad larijani in the west the 
consciousness is gradually arising that the publication is a serious 
insult to moslem beliefs and many western writers and politicians 
now realize this 
the swedish embassy also represents british interests in iran 
iran is due to announce tuesday whether it will break off 
relations with britain over the rushdie affair 
irans official islamic republic news agency also monitored in 
cyprus quoted larijani as telling granqvist the only solution to 
this crisis is respect in the west for moslems and their belief 
in jerusalem in an interview published in the newspaper maariv 
on monday israels chief ashkenazi rabbi avraham shapira asked 
for a national ban on rushdies book saying it threatens 
moslemjewish relations and world peace 
ashkenazi jews are of european heritage and comprise almost half 
of israels jewish population chief rabbi mordechai eliahu 
represents jews of middle eastern heritage he was unavailable for 
comment 
on sunday palestinian extremist ahmed jibril vowed in damascus 
syria to make every effort to kill rushdie in defense of 
religion god and his prophet mohammed he said he would use 
his popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command to 
carry out the threat

the supreme court issued extradition 
orders monday for two argentine couples accused of taking four 
children from parents who were arrested and presumed executed by 
security forces a decade ago 
during nearly two years of house arrest in asuncion the couples 
appealed lower court rulings and argued they were victims of 
persecution by the argentine government of president raul alfonsin 
the court ruling said it was not proven that both couples are 
persecuted politically and in accordance with the extradition 
treaty signed by paraguay in 1889 in montevideo the appeals are 
rejected 
after two years this is very good news said raul quijano 
argentinas ambassador 
in a domestic political development paraguays main opposition 
party filed documents monday seeking recognition that would allow it 
to enter national elections set for may 1 
domingo laino president of the authentic radical liberal party 
indicated it still might boycott the elections unless the 
provisional government of gen andres rodriguez changes voting laws 
and procedures rodriguez overthrew president alfredo stroessner a 
general who had ruled since 1954 in a coup feb 3 
the kidnapping case strained relations between the neighboring 
south america countries ambassador quijano was recalled for for 
several months last year after attorney general clotildo jimenez 
benitez urged the supreme court to deny extradition 
jimenez was dismissed friday a month after the coup against 
stroessner 
argentine justice and human rights officials accused maj 
norberto bianco and retired police official samuel miara and their 
wives of taking children of alleged subversives who were imprisoned 
at the campo de mayo army base outside buenos aires in the late 
1970s 
many children disappeared in similar fashion during the socalled 
dirty war against leftist subversion conducted by the military 
dictatorship of 197683 
bianco was a doctor at the army base and miara was a police 
intelligence officer both fled to paraguay in april 1986 claiming 
they would not receive a fair trial in argentina 
neither couple was required to appear in court monday bianco 
told the associated press by telephone he learned about the decision 
from a television newscast 
we know the extradition ruling is for me and my wife and that 
the situation of the kids still must be resolved said bianco who 
like miara claims he is his childrens natural father we dont 
know anything for sure yet 
bianco said he assumed his son pablo 11 and daughter carolina 
12 would be allowed to accompany him and his wife susana to 
argentina ambassador quijano said he expected the order to be 
carried out within within two weeks 
the kids are resigned very crestfallen but they have a great 
strength of spirit and they think that in argentina they will be 
able to put things right bianco said 
grandmothers of the plaza de mayo an argentine human rights 
group claims miaras 11yearold twin sons gonzalo javier and 
matias angel are gustavo and martin rosetti ross whose parents were 
arrested during the dirty war 
their mother was never seen again but the father gustavo 
rosetti survived was released and now is a lawyer in buenos aires 
no one answered the telephone monday at the office of miaras 
lawyer 
asked for comment monday a spokeswoman for the grandmothers said 
they expected the decision but had no formal notification of it she 
would not identify the supposed biological parents of the bianco 
children 
the group was set up in 1977 to trace the children who 
disappeared and were presumed killed in the antileftist campaign 
investigators for alfonsins civilian government say at least 8960 
people were killed but human rights groups put the toll nearer 
30000 
according to the grandmothers about 300 babies were born in 
captivity or taken with their mothers to clandestine detention 
centers the group has helped reunite about 50 children with their 
biological families since alfonsin took office in december 1983

the mood in milan is relaxed as italian 
fashion enters the 1990s 
milanese designers presenting readytowear collections for 
fallwinter 19891990 this week are not forcing outlandish ideas on 
a reluctant public for the sake of creativity rather they are 
content to tailor beautiful clothes in colors and styles which are 
attuned to the needs of the modern woman 
italys most flamboyant designer gianni versace said that as 
fashion embarks on a new decade there is a need for looks more in 
keeping with the times 
he thinks women should be free to choose between skirts and pants 
and to decide for themselves the length of a hemline provided the 
fit is easy truly comfortable practically a home away from home 
for the most part the collections seen thus far on the milan 
runway are helping women to do just that 
styles are mainly soft and sporty with pants overshadowing 
skirts cozy sweaters replacing fussy blouses and myriads of 
generously cut jackets big comfortable coats and flattering capes 
to face up to the rigors of the winter season 
hemlines play to the needs and tastes of all from a few short 
versions to the allpurpose knee length to the calf length 
championed by the young 
when it comes to skirts versace who presented his new 
collection sunday night does not practice what he preaches his new 
skirt in clinging jersey is so short and tight that anyone wearing 
it risks being arrested for indecent exposure for nighttime the 
skirt demurely descends to the ankle in black chiffon only to be 
ripped up the side straight to the hip bone 
milan has always felt most at home with sombre shades of black 
gray and brown in keeping with the grim smoggy skies of this 
northern industrial city 
but no italian can live without color and designers have always 
perked up their collections with bright shades this season is 
particularly vivid with the favorite palette a fall scheme of 
pumpkin and tangerine plum and grape crimson and fuchsia apple 
and moss green a wide variety of yellows and blues also turn up as 
well as gaily colored prints 
never one to go along with the pack krizia who usually favors 
glitzy clothes in shimmery fabrics showed the most somber 
collection seen thus far on the runway 
not only were the colors almost exclusively in milan fog shades 
but the style was uncharacteristically puritanical with long wool 
jersey dresses or mohair skirts worn under straight threequarter 
length jackets by day and demure gray evening gowns with lace 
bodice and bunched tafetta skirt 
in general there is much more wool than silk in next winters 
fashion another concession to a sporty practical wardrobe 
best at this woolly look was queen of cashmere laura biagiotti 
who had her show late sunday for the past decade biagiotti has 
been holding the working womans banner high with soft and elegant 
cashmere fashion easy to wear and easy to pack 
the novelty of her collection this season is in the intricate 
ruffled workmanship in capes sweaters and gowns to look like flower 
arrangements her favorite shades are rose and fuchsia as well as 
her trademark white 
the new casual look was no trouble for britains keith varty the 
designer behind the byblos label popular for its young sporty 
style varty also showed monday the second day of the fiveday 
milan readytowear collections 
next winter the byblos woman will wear cozy jackets in bright 
shades of purple blue and chartreuse with shawl collar and 
extrawide sleeves in warm shearling or bulky wool gaily printed 
dirndl skirts and heavyknit sweaters with cheery floral motifs

sen howell heflin of alabama on monday became 
the first democrat to swing behind john towers confirmation as 
defense secretary delivering a major boost to the troubled 
nomination a few hours after president bush urged lawmakers to put 
aside partisanship in the struggle 
i will rely on his pledge and give him a chance to prove 
himself heflin said in a speech on the senate floor referring to 
towers promise to swear off drinking if he is confirmed to head the 
pentagon 
republican sen john warner of virginia who has helped spearhead 
the gop effort to salvage the nomination said heflins remarks 
would stand out as a jewel in the senate debate 
but moments after heflins surprise announcement another 
southern democrat sen david pryor of arkansas said he would vote 
against confirmation because tower would create more problems 
than he will solve 
sen warren rudman rnh emerging from an afternoon meeting 
with republican leaders and white house chief of staff john sununu 
said we have a better chance but its still a fight 
the latest associated press survey found 47 democrats and sen 
larry pressler rsd either solidly opposed or leaning against 
confirmation and 40 republicans and one democrat either leaning for 
or supporting confirmation 
the democrats hold a 5545 edge in the senate 
heflin who had been courted by the bush administration cited 
towers qualifications the uncertain state of the evidence 
against the nominee specifically the allegations included in an fbi 
report on the nominee and the alcohol promise as the reasons for 
his decision 
heflin spoke a few hours after bush gave tower a ringing 
endorsement 
i stand by this man bush told a veterans of foreign wars 
audience i stand by him because he is uniquely qualified as the 
right man to take charge of the pentagon 
in addition to heflin the bush administration has courted sen 
bennett johnston dla who labeled the fbi report on tower as 
unreliable but said he has not made a decision on the nomination 
frankly i think this particular fbi report is basically 
unreliable johnston said sunday during a stop in alexandria la 
i think there needs to be more fairness put into this process 
heflin said the fbi report was not conclusive as to whether he 
had a drinking problem in the 1980s that impaired his judgment on 
issues in his official capacities 
heflin noted towers nodrinking pledge and said the primary 
safeguard against abuse or the breaking of his pledge is the 
president himself i dont believe that president george bush would 
allow a person to serve as secretary of defense whose conduct is a 
threat to national security 
as for towers knowledge of defense issues heflin said i 
dont believe ive heard anyone question his qualifications 
tower in a statement said he was grateful to senator heflin 
for his objectivity and for the clear and lucid way in which he 
stated the arguments for my confirmation he has put the issue in 
its proper perspective 
pryor said he hadnt read the lengthy fbi report into towers 
personal life and didnt intend to he said his own decision was 
based on a judgment about whether tower would create problems or 
solve problems and said on balance he believed the nominee would 
create more than he would solve 
he also cited several remarks made by tower dole and republican 
leader strom thurmond of south carolina about the senates 
prerogative to consent on presidential appointments those comments 
were made a decade ago during a partisan struggle that erupted when 
jimmy carter named paul warnke as an arms negotiator 
in his own speech to an enthusiastic veterans of foreign wars 
audience bush again spoke of towers qualifications 
he asked senators to put partisanship aside and to use 
their own experience with john tower as an expert on defense issues 
as a former colleague and as a tough hardnosed negotiator to guide 
them 
there remains the possibility tower will be allowed onto the 
senate floor to answer the allegations against him which include 
excessive drinkin indiscreet behavior toward women and his 
lucrative consulting contracts with defense contractors 
but a majority of the chamber would have to approve the 
appearance and a vote is unlikely before tuesday at the earliest 
republican senators including dole warner rudman william 
cohen of maine and arlen specter of pennsylvania huddled with 
sununu to discuss the option of allowing tower on the senate floor 
and other gop strategy to save the nomination 
we wanted to make sure were not missing anything or anybody 
rudman said 
as he began his speech to the vfw bush said he wanted to get 
something off my chest 
im getting sick and tired of the rumors and the innuendo that 
are used against this decent man bush said 
you know john tower is a fellow veteran he told the vfw 
meanwhile a conservative group said it had raised 100000 to 
finance an advertising campaign on towers behalf in states with 
democratic senators who conservatives think might be persuaded to 
vote for tower 
brent bozell iii chairman of the conservative victory committee 
said the groups lobbying campaign came after bush last week urged 
conservatives to generate political heat for tower 
the tower nomination has threatened to undermine relations 
between the white house and congress at the outset of the bush 
administration the senate armed services committee voted 119 along 
party lines to recommend that the full senate reject the nomination

the government will allow an american movie 
producer to make a film in poland about solidarity founder lech 
walesa the polish news agency pap reported monday 
a brief announcement said a stateowned studio would provide 
technical help for producer stanley kramer 
pap said the wroclaw film studio would work with kramer on the 
movie polonaise especially on creating crowd scenes including 
ones requiring 25000 extras portraying solidaritys birth as an 
independent trade union at the lenin shipyard in gdansk in august 
1980 
it was not clear from the announcement if filming would take 
place in the lenin shipyard where walesa is still employed as an 
electrician or at some other shipyard 
kramer said monday in hollywood he had not received word that 
filming in gdansk was approved he said he was approached last month 
at a los angeles gathering by represenatives of polands official 
film agency and they offered to let him shoot portions of the movie 
at the lenin yard 
they came and had read the script and realized what its about 
and they were interested whether because of the new government or 
the whole glasnost thing or whatever kramer said 
he referred to soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or greater openness in certain areas which is being 
copied by some of the kremlins allies and recent changes in 
polands government 
filming is expected to begin in several months on the movie 
tracing the life of walesa who won the 1983 nobel peace prize as a 
founder of the first free union movement in the soviet bloc 
solidarity was suspended in december 1981 and later outlawed by 
parliament 
kramer said the film should be released in spring 1990 
he said he visited walesa in poland last year but never sought 
permission to shoot the movie in this communist country because he 
assumed he would be turned down 
after all it was about walesa kramer said he was at 
loggerheads with the government at the time 
solidarity is still banned but after years of trying to 
eradicate the movment the government reversed its stand and is 
conducting talks with the opposition that could lead to a 
restoration of solidaritys legal status and other reforms 
kramer said the film is expected to cost up to 15 million he 
said it would be historically accurate but will dramatize some 
details such as weddingnight conversations between walesa and his 
wife 
it isnt political its a story a drama of a hero a hero who 
had certain shortcomings and realized them kramer said winning 
the nobel prize is a symbol one man can make a difference and thats 
the message of the film not politics 
polonaise named for one of the works of the polish composer 
chopin follows other films on social issues by the 74yearold 
kramer they include judgment at nuremberg and guess whos 
coming to dinner 
while solidaritys story is mainly one of struggle against the 
communist government kramer said the film does not portray the 
authorities as villains 
they dont look too bad for the simple reason that they didnt 
look too bad during the real thing he said even though he 
walesa was taken into custody a number of times they couldnt do 
anything to him because he was untouchable 
the screenplay was written by daniel taradash who won an academy 
award in 1953 for the screenplay of from here to eternity 
film polski the official agency will be paid to arrange for the 
filming in gdansk but will not have a role in writing or producing 
the move and will not share in the profits kramer said

a drug buyers club announced plans monday to 
provide american aids patients with prescription drugs from abroad 
that have not been approved for use in the united states 
the people with aids health group said it would rely on foreign 
doctors to obtain the prescription drugs then pass them along at 
cost to aids patients 
to get a threemonth supply of a drug an aids patient must 
present a physicians prescription or note group officials said at 
a news conference 
although they described the plan as unprecedented they said it 
would not violate food and drug administration rules 
last year the fda said it would allow people with 
lifethreatening illnesses to import personal supplies of unapproved 
drugs 
but until now the new york group and other buyers clubs have only 
imported drugs that do nt require a prescription in the foreign 
country anyone wishing to legally obtain such drugs had to travel 
abroad and get a prescription from a physician there 
were saving people the trip and the importation expenses 
said michael callen a founder of the group 
dr frank young commissioner of the fda has declined to say if 
his agency would try to stop the drug importation effort but said 
any action probably would depend on what drugs the group imports and 
how it does so 
one will be fluconazole which has been approved by several 
european nations as an antifungal medication for use against 
meningitis and aids 
it is seen by some physicians and aids patients as an effective 
yet mild alternative to amphotericin b a drug which must be taken 
intravenously once a week and whose harsh side effects include 
shakes and fever 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer according to the centers for disease control 
in atlanta there have been 49976 deaths from aids since june 1981 
callen said his group would decide which other drugs to import 
based on criteria such as toxicity cost effectiveness and 
availability it is unclear how many patients might use the service 
he said 
although callen said the group would try to keep drug costs as 
low as possible some aids remedies are relatively expensive mark 
mutchnik an aids patient whom the group supplied with fluconazole 
said a daily dosage cost about 23 and was not covered by insurance 
because it was not fdaapproved 
the new york times on monday quoted group officials as saying 
they would obtain the drugs through foreign doctors but callen said 
at the news conference that they had decided not to be fully 
forthcoming about our precise means of importation one 
possibility he said would be to put a patient directly in touch 
with a foreign physician who would send the drug 
aids patient advocates have criticized the fda for being overly 
cautious about approving aids drugs arguing that they do not have 
time to wait for more tests on drugs deemed controversial by the 
agency 
the fda says it has a responsibility to protect americans from 
drugs that could be useless or harmful but something is wrong 
when doctors feel compelled to send patients overseas to obtain 
drugs said dr peter seitzman a physician with a large aids 
practice he said several of his patients have gone to england to 
obtain fluconazole 
the people with aids health group has been supplying about 2000 
aids patients with nonprescription drugs from abroad which have not 
been approved for use in this country

more than 40 prominent scientists have joined the 
movement among chinese intellectuals for greater democracy and the 
release of political prisoners a spokesman for the group said 
monday 
xu liangying a scientific historian at the academy of sciences 
said 42 people signed a letter urging chinas top leaders to 
guarantee freedom of speech publication and information 
this is the only reliable guarantee of unity and stability 
the letter said referring to government fears that democracy could 
bring instability 
world history and chinas experience shows that political 
democratization including a legal system is necessary to guarantee 
economic reform and the whole modernization program the 
scientists said 
xu said he mailed copies last week to communist party chief zhao 
ziyang premier li peng and the heads of the national peoples 
congress and chinese peoples political consultative committee an 
advisory body of intellectuals 
it was the third letter of its kind sent to the leadership this 
year chinas bestknown dissident astrophysicist fang lizhi first 
proposed amnesty in a letter to senior leader deng xiaoping in 
january 
thirtythree intellectuals including some of chinas most famous 
writers and philosphers signed a letter with the same message in 
february hundreds of people in hong kong and taiwan as well as 
chinese living in the united states have signed petitions and 
letters of support for an amnesty 
specific requests were made in the first two letters for the 
release of wei jingsheng who was convicted of counterrevolutionary 
activities in 1979 and is said to have become mentally ill 
no names were mentioned in the scientists letter which appealed 
for the release of all young people who were convicted and 
sentenced to labor reform because of ideological problems 
it said that would open a new era in the political history of 
our country 
xu said he helped write the letter and the signers believed china 
shouldnt arrest people because they have different political 
views 
last month the justice ministry said calls for amnesty amounted 
to interfering in the administration of justice 
no other direct government response has been forthcoming but 
mondays beijing daily defended the imprisonment of wei 
freedom of speech in any country cannot be held to be above the 
countrys basic interests it declared people have the freedom 
of speech but not the freedom of agitating for counterrevolution by 
taking advantage of socialist democracy 
among signers of the latest letter were wang ganchang a former 
vice minister of nuclear industry and physicist qian lingjiao 
many intellectuals have learned caution from four decades of 
alternating thaws and freezes on freedom of expression but 
increasing numbers now are speaking out on political and economic 
issues 
they say they are disillusioned by chinas continued backwardness 
and poverty and believe a free exchange of ideas is necessary to 
modernizaton 
fang lizhi who last week was barred from a dinner given by

a senior british official on monday sharply 
criticized israeli leaders and suggested that un security council 
members help prepare for arabisraeli peace talks a proposal made 
recently by soviet officials 
we think that there may be preparatory work that can be done 
among the five permanent members of the security council said 
william waldegrave britains minister of state for foreign affairs 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze last month suggested 
that the five permanent members should meet to discuss how to 
arrange a unsponsored peace conference that has been endorsed by 
the arab states the european economic community and other nations 
waldegrave arrived in jordan monday after six days in israel and 
the west bank and gaza strip occupied by israel after the 1967 
middle east war 
in his speech to the jordanbritish society waldegrave did not 
refer explicitly to the soviet proposal he repeatedly criticized 
the hardline stands taken by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
the arabs favor a conference attended by the five permanent 
members as well as all the parties to the conflict 
us officials have warily endorsed the idea of an international 
conference but only if it leads to direct talks between israel and 
its arab foes shamir rejects such a conference 
waldegrave stressed that the eec is now an economic superpower 
greater than the united states and has deep interests in the region 
he indicated europeans should be represented in peace efforts 
saying the best way forward was through a conference involving 
powers with legitimate interests in the region a reference both to 
the security council members and european states 
waldegrave said shamirs description of the occupied territories 
as liberated was simply bizarre to use a british 
understatement 
my visit to nablus on the west bank under curfew brought home 
to me forcibly that the territories are indeed under complete and 
thorough military occupation 
he quoted british prime minister margaret thatcher as saying that 
the occupation can only be temporary and cited the palestinian 
uprising in which more than 380 palestinians and at least 17 
israelis have died 
if the way to peace is not found soon a worse conflagration 
will ignite waldegrave said 
the palestinians have made their painful concession he said 
that is why the world community is saying to israel must say to 
israel the time has now come for you to respond 
in vienna us secretary of state james a baker iii told three 
highranking west european officials on monday that now is not the 
right time for washington to launch a new initiative in the middle 
east or for a peace conference on the arabisraeli conflict 
baker met with foreign ministers roland dumas of france 
francisco fernandezordonez of spain and karolos papoulias of greece 
the threeman group representing the 12nation european economic 
community has spearheaded a drive for middle east peace 
negotiations on the theory the palestinians have taken a more 
moderate stance toward israel 
but baker told them there is a need to proceed carefully and 
that the time is not right to push for a conference according to a 
us official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity

europes 29th ariane rocket lifted 
off successfully monday from this south american launch center and 
put a japanese and a european satellite into orbit 
the launch had been scheduled for feb 28 but was postponed 
because of a strike by technicians it was rescheduled for saturday 
but delayed again when high winds caused two umbilical cables to 
disconnect as the gantry was being pulled away 
seventeen minutes 41 seconds after liftoff at 829 pm the 
ariane 4 attained orbit and after seven more minutes it had 
released the two satellites ariane 4 is the most powerful launcher 
in the ariane series 
put into orbit were jcsat1 a japanese commercial communication 
satellite and mop1 a european meteorological satellite 
the jdsat1 built by hughes aircraft co of los angeles for the 
japanese communication satellite co is japans first commercial 
communication satellite 
mop1 is the fourth weather satellite for the european space 
agency it will send weather pictures every half hour to stations on 
earth 
it was the agencys second launch this year and the 11th straight 
successful operation 
the first ariane rocket an ariane 1 was launched a decade ago 
the agency has had four failed flights since its rocket became 
operational 
the last failure was in 1986 and resulted in a delay in the 
program of more than a yearlaunches resumed in september 1987

plans by pilots for nearly all us airlines to 
strictly fly by the rule book starting tuesday could cause lengthy 
flight delays especially where there is heavy traffic and bad 
weather according to aviation experts and pilots 
the air line pilots association announced the action by its 
40000 members as a show of support for 8500 striking eastern 
airlines machinists union members and the eastern pilots and flight 
stewardesses who have refused to cross the picket lines 
pilots in announcing the action said it would not amount to a 
slowdown because they would simply be following procedures 
taking the longer option when there are two or more safe options 
available 
the primary impact could come if pilots rely on instrument 
landing procedures when they could use visual procedures said faa 
spokesman john leyden 
but leyden said it was impossible to tell how much the pilots 
action would affect overall air travel he said in some instances 
the impact might be minimal and in areas where weather is bad and 
traffic heavy it could be greater 
pilot john sheehy who has been flying for eastern for 19 years 
said he viewed the action as a morale booster from eastern 
pilots who are honoring the pickets but doubted it would cause 
significant tie ups 
wayne dolan spokesman for picketing eastern pilots at 
washingtons national airport said the action could enhance safety 
in a time when several airlines have beefed up routes normally flown 
by eastern using pilots unfamiliar with the routes 
what you want to do is be sure the public is protected we want 
to be sure the crews know where theyre going so the approaches 
are made safely said dolan 
one thing pilots might do is require air traffic controllers to 
read back flight plans for verification rather than simply giving 
an acknowledgement that they have heard the pilots intentions 
theyll make sure every t is crossed and every i dotted 
said a government official who is a pilot the official who asked 
not to be identified said pilots likely would be taking the most 
conservative and timeconsuming way whenever possible 
the official said this might not necessarily enhance safety 
because tieups at crowded airports could lead to increased 
frustration 
its a matter of a few seconds here and a few seconds there 
and it could really cascade the official said

the presidential election 
scheduled this month cannot be postponed as suggested by leftist 
rebels the president of the legislature said monday 
just like they the guerrillas do not accept the march 19 date 
for whatever reasons we do not accept any change in the date 
because constitutionally the date cannot be changed ricardo 
alvarenga told journalists at the national assembly 
his remarks appeared to quash any prospect that an election delay 
could be a first step toward ending the 9yearold civil war 
on jan 24 the rebels farabundo marti national liberation front 
offered to take part in the presidential election and respect its 
outcome if it were postponed until september and if security and 
antifraud conditions were met 
the guerrillas had rejected all previous elections this decade as 
sham 
the government of president jose napoleon duarte a christian 
democrat suggested the election be delayed by six weeks rather than 
six months the rebels said that was insufficient 
the singlechamber legislature has virtual veto power over any 
postponement and is controlled by the opposition rightist republican 
nationalist alliance the alliance known as arena is favored to 
win the presidential election and has rejected any postponement of 
the vote 
the constitution says the election must be held at least two 
months before a new government takes office duartes term ends on 
june 1 
the christian democrats have said elections could be legally 
postponed and an interim president named by the legislature if a 
political consensus to do so exists 
the farabundo marti on saturday said direct talks with the 
government on their proposal must be held tuesday and wednesday in 
san salvador the capital 
it repeated its accusation that the government was 
procrastinating 
the civil war has killed an estimated 70000 people most of them 
civilians

a program that allowed convicts time away 
from prison was suspended monday by gov evan bayh after an inmate 
out on an eighthour pass allegedly bludgeoned his former wife to 
death while neighbors watched 
bayh said two corrections officers were suspended in connection 
with the furlough of alan matheney 38 from the correctional 
industrial complex near the indiana state reformatory at pendleton 
clearly mistakes were made theres no doubt about that and 
im good and mad about it bayh said 
matheney was being held monday on a preliminary charge of murder 
in saturdays death of his exwife lisa marie bianco 29 in 
mishawaka near the michigan state line officers said she was beaten 
to death with the butt of a shotgun 
he had been serving an eightyear sentence for beating bianco two 
years ago the two were divorced in 1985 police said monday 
prison officials said matheney was released from the lightmedium 
security cic to the custody of his mother martha matheney saturday 
morning and his freedom was supposed to be limited to the 
indianapolis area 
i understand proper procedures were not followed and were 
going to find out why that happened discipline those who were 
involved reevaluate the whole program and see if it makes sense 
bayh said 
at a statehouse news conference later monday he announced the 
suspension of the two corrections officers pending an investigation 
into their approval of a pass for matheny correction department 
spokesman vaughn overstreet said he would not identify the workers 
because they had not yet been notified 
the governor said former us attorney virginia dill mccarty 
would head a correction department internal investigation a report 
is due friday 
bayh said earlier he thought that proper procedure was for a 
victim to be notified that his or her attacker was being released 
but christopher meloy supervisor of work release services for 
the department of correction said policy calls for victims such as 
bianco to be notified of a release only if they had previously 
requested such notification meloy did not know if bianco had made 
such a request 
some victims are not that concerned about it some victims move 
and are very difficult to get in touch with and sometimes we dont 
even have an easily identifiable victim he said 
meloy also defended the programs 
we for the most part have been enjoying a successful track 
record meloy said 
succeeding in either program means the offender has not been 
returned to the institution after his full release meloy said 
bayh spokesman fred nation said no inmates involved in the 
special assignment program will receive a pass for the next four 
weeks while the policy is reviewed 
bayh said the review would determine whether the program 
deserves to be continued or whether we should eliminate it 
entirely 
matheney got the pass under a program that sends inmates at state 
expense to work for interfaith housing a notforprofit 
organization that refurbishes hoouses and sells them to low and 
middleincome families meloy said 
bayh said he was aware of indianas regulated community 
assignment program and workrelease program but he was unaware of 
the special release program that allowed matheney an eighthour pass 
in fact i have some serious doubts about this program because 
it does not help significantly with the overcrowding situtation in 
the prison it is not related to workrelease activities which 
prepare inmates for meeting full employment in the private sector 
this is used as i understand it as a tool to promote good 
behavior in the prison walls and it seems to me that there may be 
some other less risky methods to make that possible bayh said

police on monday denied allegations that 
they beat a diabetic man who went into insulin shock while driving 
his car and was arrested for drunken driving 
the police probably should have checked a little closer 
police chief charles johnston said but they had a lot of other 
concerns at the time mainly that this guy didnt fall down and hurt 
himself 
phillip sanchez 63 sustained bruises to his face hip and arms 
he said he doesnt remember much of what happened in the incident 
friday because of his condition but remembers being roughed up 
pretty good and telling police he needed insulin 
he said police should have diagnosed his problem sooner and that 
they mistreated him by handcuffing him and putting him in a holding 
cell 
at a news conference johnston defended his officers actions and 
said a preliminary investigation showed no evidence of brutality or 
excessive force 
he said the bruises to sanchezs arms and wrists were caused when 
officers tried to handcuff him he added that sanchez bruises easily 
because of medication he takes for a heart condition 
johnston said sanchez may have contributed to discoloration 
around his eyes by rubbing them a lot but added that he also fell 
and hit his eye on a file cabinet in the police station 
the incident began when sanchez allegedly made an improper turn 
at an intersection and his pickup was hit by a car he drove away 
and police were notified of a hitandrun accident 
officers later found sanchez and his car in a strangers driveway 
police said they did not notice a necklace sanchez wore under his 
shirt identifying him as a diabetic or a similar identification card 
in his wallet they noticed a medical bracelet he wore which said he 
suffered from a heart ailment but mentioned nothing about diabetes 
sanchez refused to take a sobriety test but later tests showed 
he had no alcohol in his blood officers said they asked sanchez on 
the way to the station if he needed medical attention and he said no 
police reports say sanchez was uncooperative at the police 
station exhibited mood swings and was handcuffed to a bench in a 
holding cell 
an officer found him unconscious in that cell some 80 minutes 
later and he was rushed to a hospital where glucose injections 
revived him 
johnston said sanchez probably would not be charged in the 
traffic accident because he was unaware of what he was doing at the 
time

takeover 
while dealing with the haitians from the madrid the coast guard

protest the governments 10 percent cut in the salaries of 65000 
public workers part of the belttightening measures brought on by 
the conditions of an imf standby loan agreement 
the strike has affected us but it is much better than going

80 percent of the union members stayed off the job he said the only 
exception was at the refinery where we did not want to interrupt 
the complex operations there 
workers also struck the countrys major sugar factory

intensive talks on reunifying the island 
the talks held under united nations auspices lasted three hours 
at the home of the un special representative to cyprus oscar 
camilion a un statement said 
vassiliou and denktash are to hold 10 sessions of closeddoor 
talks over the next three weeks in preparation for a review april 
56 in new york with un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
un officials have said the current intensive talks are intended 
to examine a wide range of options on a nonbinding basis 
the two leaders started regular weekly meetings last september 
but have failed to make progress on a formula for establishing a 
twostate federation 
the greek side reportedly is pushing for a strong federal 
government while the turkish side supports a looser federation

turkish troops and the right of greek cypriots to return to 
property they fled after the 1974 turkish invasion

turkey invaded the northern part of cyprus saying it was protecting 
the minority turkish cypriot community and sent thousands of turks

customs officials recently stopped more 
than 3000 poles who were seeking to smuggle food into western 
europe where they could sell it for a profit the official pap news 
agency reported monday 
it attributed its report to zygmunt janczyk spokesman for the 
main customs office 
pap did not say during what period of time the offenders were 
turned back it quoted janczyk as reporting the crackdown and 
saying we will fight this negative phenomenon until it vanishes 
completely 
communist authorities on jan 1 eased procedures to obtain 
passports and thousands of poles have headed west to trade mainly 
to west berlin or austria where visas are not required 
janczyk said poles were allowed to take enough food for their 
journey but a 300 percent customs duty is charged on any excessive 
amount 
he said some polish passengers on a train en route to west berlin 
threw food away when they saw customs officers approach 
janczyk told pap that in one case a pole tried to smuggle a goat 
and a baby pig into west berlin 
meat has been rationed in poland since december 1980 although 
consumers must wait in line to buy at state stores meat also can be 
bought privatedly from farmers at higher prices 
trading in the west is tempting to poles because they can buy 
goods in poland for zlotys sell them for hard currency in the west 
and then convert that money back into zlotys at the blackmarket 
rate for a profit

more than 30 mild earthquakes rocked the 
imperial valley on monday apparently causing no damage or injuries 
but raising concern among scientists because the jolts were centered 
near the san andreas fault 
a temblor at 216 pm that measured 47 on the richter scale was 
followed by 32 aftershocks over magnitude 2 by 5 pm including a 
magnitude40 jolt said california institute of technology 
spokesman robert finn 
the two largest quakes were centered six miles westsouthwest of 
niland in the imperial valley one of the states major agricultural 
areas and located north of the mexican border finn said quakes in 
the valley typically occur in swarms of dozens or hundreds 
hardly anyone has called and we have no reports of damage 
imperial county sheriffs department dispatcher pam skipper said 
after the main shock 
it was one of those quakes that were fun just enough to 
jiggle you around but not strong enough to scare you it didnt 
shake things off the wall said harry jensen city manager of 
brawley about 20 miles south of here 
the quake was the largest of a swarm of jolts that started 
several months ago in the brawley seismic zone it was centered 12 
miles from the southern end of the san andreas and roughly three to 
six miles from an extension of that fault said tom heaton 
scientist in charge of the us geological surveys pasadena office 
its not far from the san andreas fault so of course its a 
concern to us any time there are earthquakes down there heaton 
said theres definitely communications back and forth among the 
scientists and the state of california office of emergency 
services 
scientists are concerned about quakes in the imperial valley 
because of the slight possibility they might trigger larger quakes 
on the san andreas 
however heaton emphasized the quake was not on another fault 
called the extra fault but well south of it that fault intersects 
the san andreas 
a recent study by columbia universitys lamontdoherty geological 
observatory raised the possibility that southern californias next 
great or magnitude8 earthquake on the san andreas might be 
triggered hours after an extra fault quake of magnitude 55 or more 
the imperial valley is californias most active seismic region 
its not uncommon to have earthquakes in the brawley seismic 
zone heaton said there have been many earthquakes in the 
brawley seismic zone and the big earthquake has not occurred 
until mondays quake the largest quake in the swarm was a mild 
one of magnitude 36 heaton said 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause 
slight damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable 
damage 6 severe damage

former president reagan confessed monday 
that hes finding some frustrations in life outside the white house 
including writers block and a home filled with cardboard packing 
cartons

retiree after his speech to pepperdine university students when he 
exited stage right with an eightfootlong yellow surfboard under 
his arm it was a gift from the school 
reagan who has signed a deal that will earn him a reported 5 
million to 7 million for a pair of books spoke about the rigors of 
writing to about 3500 students and guests at the seaside christian 
campus 
i tell you i sit there looking at those blank pages but i 
want to give readers an idea what its like in that house they drive 
by he said referring to the white house 
reagan also told students that his move from washington to 
california on jan 20 was a crosscountry move much like anyone else 
might make 
im getting rid of those cardboard cartons they dont tell you 
on the outside whats in em reagan said were still looking 
for a heating pad 
reagans talk marked his second nofee college appearance since 
leaving office he telephoned pepperdine on feb 27 and offered to 
address the students waiving what has been reported to be a 50000 
perspeech fee

about his approach to the presidency so far 
they are setting up their administration so i am kind of 
waiting to hear his declaration on programs there is still some 
reorganization some journeys hes making and he has not set a 
course reagan said i havent heard him say anything i disagree 
with 
ten pepperdine students were allowed to ask reagan questions and 
they ranged from policies in the middle east to his transition into 
private life 
reagan said it was still difficult getting used to passing a 
television and hearing the voice of a newscaster saying today 
the president and i say what did i do 
responding to one question reagan said he and bush agreed on 
economic policy it would be economic disaster to raise taxes 
the expresident said to rousing applause

a group of biblical scholars agreed that 
jesus christ never promised to return and usher in a new age and 
would have been appalled about becoming a cult figure in a new 
religion the groups founder said monday 
about 100 scholars theologians and historians discussed the 
teachings of the historical jesus in a threeday seminar that ended 
sunday they agreed with some dissensions that jesus did not 
promise a second coming in which he would bring a new age 
gospel writers and later followers of jesus were the ones who 
predicted a second coming of jesus most scholars participating in 
the jesus seminar said the seminar was held in sonoma in the wine 
country about 40 miles north of san francisco 
robert funk 50 a new testament expert and the seminar founder 
said most of its members believe that jesus was a wandering sage and 
did not think he was divine although he felt very close to god 
funk said the seminars stand does not contradict the faith in 
god expressed in the apostles creed but is at odds with many 
traditional christian beliefs 
a fundamentalist pastor who attended the meeting called the 
seminars stance heretical 
theyre robbing the church of its blessed hope said the rev 
marion h reynolds of los osos he said the impact of the groups 
statements cant be dismissed because our society tends to place 
scholars on a very high level 
in one vote of 30 scholars 26 said they strongly disagreed that 
jesus expected to return and usher in a new age the scholars almost 
unanimously agreed though that jesus spoke the words attributed to 
him in which he said the kingdom of god already was present in his 
day 
the group also voted overwhelmingly that the language used to 
describe the future kingdom of god in the new testament is mythic 
and symbolic and recommended that people should not believe in or 
look forward to the second coming and new age 
although there was no vote taken on the issue of whether jesus 
intended to start a new religion and be its central figure the 
subject is key to the seminars debates and has come up in virtually 
all of its nine meetings over the past four years 
the overwhelming answer among the seminars scholars is jesus 
had no intention of starting a new religion said funk most of 
the fellows think jesus led some kind of reform movement in judaism 
im quite certain he had no idea that a new religion would transpire 
or that he would become a cult figure in it he would have been 
appalled by it 
he said the scholars are almost unanimous that jesus didnt 
think of himself as divine 
the seminars findings reflect what is being taught in most major 
universities and seminaries said the rev edward f beutner a 
jesuit and campus minister at santa clara university and a seminar 
member 
these are not maverick scholars beutner said they take a 
very careful approach to how sayings of jesus were transmitted and 
to the evolution of the bible texts 
the jesus seminar is sponsored by the westar institute in sonoma 
a private secular research group that explores topics in the 
humanitites

the state assembly approved legislation 
monday to restore the death penalty in new york as the bills chief 
sponsor predicted the chamber would for the first time override a 
promised veto by gov mario cuomo 
a successful override later this year in the 
democraticcontrolled assembly would clear the way for the electric 
chair to be put back into use in the nations second largest state 
california already has the death penalty 
the assembly approved the deathpenalty measure 9748 after an 
emotionally charged debate lasting more than five hours 
the senate which passed the legislation last month is expected 
to override the veto as it has several times in the past a 
successful override in the assembly would restore the death penalty 
new yorks electric chair last used in 1963 has been sitting 
unused at greenhaven state prison in stormville since capital 
punishment in the state was eliminated by a series of court rulings 
the chair the first in the world has already been used to execute 
695 people since its introduction in 1890 
two death penalty supporters were absent from the assembly on 
monday had they been present there would have been 99 yes 
votes in the 150member assembly a veto override requires 100 votes 
cuomo has promised to veto the bill making it the seventh year 
in a row the democratic governor has quashed capital punishment 
legislation 
assemblyman vincent graber the bills chief assembly sponsor 
predicted he would have the extra vote required by the time the 
override attempt comes later this year 
state lawmakers have approved death penalty legislation in the 
last 12 years but cuomo and former gov hugh carey repeatedly 
vetoed it 
graber a buffalo area democrat closed in on the 100vote 
override margin when longtime death penalty opponent edward abramson 
of new york city also a democrat announced he would vote for 
grabers bill 
abramson citing the highly publicized assassination last year in 
his district of police officer edward bryne by associates of a drug 
dealer said a poll of his constituents found that 73 percent 
supported the death penalty 
the vote came less than a week after a federal narcotics agent 
and a city policeman were shot to death in separate incidents in new 
york city 
before the debate about 150 antideath penalty demonstrators 
many from a hutterite religious community near kingston gathered 
outside the assembly chamber and sang such traditional protest songs 
as we shall overcome 
no person is allowed to take the life of another person for 
whatever reason said kathy waldner a member of the hutterite 
community in rifton only god can do that we feel god should be 
the judge 
during the debate graber noted that the number of murders in the 
state last year rose to 2225 an increase of 213 from 1987 
pointing out that most of the 1988 killings occurred in new york 
city he read off a list of the 20 most dangerous assembly district 
in the state including abramsons 
all were in the city and all but one were represented by 
legislators who had voted against the death penalty bill previously 
under the bill the most coldblooded murderers paid hitmen 
killers of police officers those murdering witnesses and the like 
would be subject to the death penalty once a murder verdict was 
delivered a second jury would be asked to decide whether the death 
penalty should be imposed

the first federal desegregation lawsuit ever 
filed against an entire state university system heads back into 
court tuesday 15 years after the justice department first sued 
louisiana 
a special master appointed by a panel of federal judges is 
convening hearings on desegregation plans proposed by the state the 
justice department southern university and the grambling state 
university alumni association 
the panel of federal judges ruled in december that a 1981 consent 
decree aimed at improving southern and grambling in order to bring 
more whites to them had failed miserably 
settlement talks were held monday but the hearings will go 
ahead said the states attorney 
some progress was made there has not been total consensus in 
the form of a settlement said john kennedy attorney for gov 
buddy roemer and as a practical matter even if everyone agreed 
on everything we couldnt get it all drawn up and written out in 
time to stop the hearings 
alumni from southern the nations largest predominantly black 
university system and grambling also mostly black are fighting to 
keep their schools distinct from other state universities while 
making them equal 
separate but equal has another connotation so i wouldnt 
describe it in those words said dolores spikes president of 
southern 
i think what southern is asking for is the same thing that the 
justice department is asking for a desegregated system but one 
that still allows for access and a chance for reasonable success for 
minority students poor students and disadvantaged students she 
said thats part of the mission of southern university were 
asking that remain intact 
the problem that must be corrected supporters say is that 
southern and grambling never got the money and programs needed to 
catch up academically to other schools 
paul verkuil president of the college of william and mary in 
virginia was appointed special master in the case to draw up a 
desegregation plan because attorneys for 13 universities four 
governing boards the state and the justice department were unable 
to agree on one 
the first day of hearings comes one week before the suits 15th 
anniversary verkuil has said they must end by march 15 the day 
after that anniversary 
louisiana state university and the shreveport and new orleans 
campuses of the lsu system remain almost all white while southerns 
campuses in those cities remain nearly all black the same is true 
of grambling and louisiana tech about eight miles down interstate 
20 
southern contends that louisiana not the agreement failed 
miserably 
the state says it spent more than 200 million to upgrade the 
black schools southern contends the total spent on black schools 
was closer to 75 million 
grambling and tech are among nine schools run by the board of 
trustees for state colleges and universities and the states 
proposal includes grambling however the grambling university 
alumni association has proposed its own plan 
although the lsu southern and trustees systems all are 
controlled by the louisiana board of regents they often fight over 
the limited money in a state budget hit hard by the oil industry 
bust 
roemer wants to scrap the current fourboard system and set up 
one board to run all of the schools and end the turf wars 
southern which lost 56 million when 11 million in state money 
was cut from all colleges would probably lose even more if this 
happens supporters say 
just as important they say thousands of blacks left unprepared 
by louisianas woeful public schools might lose their chance at a 
college education 
plans submitted by southern and by the grambling alumni depend 
heavily on moving programs from predominantly white schools to the 
black schools to make them more attractive to whites 
the justice department plan also leans heavily on transferring 
programs to southern and grambling and calls for southern to open 
new graduate schools in new orleans and shreveport 
the states proposal calls for varying admission standards for 
seven of louisianas 13 fouryear universities for cooperation 
among schools in the same part of the state and for a separate 
system of community colleges to take over the most basic courses 
verkuil already has statements from all the witnesses plus 
depositions they gave to opposing lawyers 
rather than listen to arguments hes already read he plans to 
jump directly from an introductory statement by state attorney john 
kennedy into crossexamination of the states 32 witnesses 
attorneys for the justice southern and the grambling alumni 
association each may question each state witness after that each 
must defend its own alternative to the state plan

sixteen members of the christian 
knights of the ku klux klan chanted white power for america as 
they marched sunday afternoon through the town portrayed in the 
movie mississippi burning 
about 100 people lined the streets of the northcentral 
mississipi town of 7500 to watch the klan demonstration only a 
handful of hecklers some of them white shouted at the white 
supremacists 
about 20 klansmen marched later in the day in meridian about 40 
miles to the east about 10 counterdemonstrators and 100 spectators 
turned out 
philadelphia was chosen for what was billed as a klan recruitment 
rally because of its portrayal in mississippi burning said the 
grand dragon for mississippi jordan gollub of picayune 
the fictional movie which received seven oscar nominations is 
loosely based on the 1964 slayings of three civil rights workers 
whose bodies were found in an earthen dam near philadelphia 
james earl chaney 21 who was black and andrew goodman 20 and 
michael schwerner 24 who were white were shot to death the 
federal government eventually convicted eight people of violating 
the civil rights of the three men but no one was ever charged with 
murder 
the klan group that rallied sunday included men and women with 
10 wearing robes 
gollubs group has marched in several mississippi towns in the 
past few months with philadelphias crowd drawing by far the 
largest number of spectators the klan planned another rally later 
sunday in meridian 
several black leaders had asked opponents of the klan to stay at 
home during sundays march saying the less attention the white 
supremacists received the better 
the klan members declared during their rally on the neshoba 
county courthouse grounds that they plan to march in every 
mississippi county in efforts to attract new members 
however only a handful of people at philadelphia took membership 
applications offered by the klan members 
the klan marchers were accompanied by two police cars and six 
patrolmen on foot

the italian readytowear collections for 
fall and winter got off to a lively start sunday with fashion 
darling giorgio armanis sporty emporio line and spoof specialist 
franco moschinos gagfilled winter wardrobe 
pants in all shapes and sizes prevailed in both collections 
with only a spattering of skirts 
in the early 1980s armani the leader in italian readytowear 
decided to court the younger set by creating a fresh sporty line at 
more accessible prices he started with designer jeans but the 
label dubbed emporio soon was manufacturing armanis trade mark 
blazer suits coats and even evening wear 
today emporio shops designed to appeal to the young with their 
bright lights trendy posters and hip music are scattered throughout 
italy and the rest of europe an emporio armani shop is due to open 
in new york later this month 
for this years chillier season armani who showed his 
collection sunday morning in the modern theater of his downtown 
milan headquarters plays heavily on casual with a series of wool 
knit sweat pants worn under tweed blazers or matching jackets other 
trousers are super wide and cropped at the ankle with or without 
cuff 
armanis new winter jacket is cut off above the waist at times 
it has a long loose back at others it is trimmed in demure 
piecrust ruffles his blazer is single breasted with huge breast 
and side pockets a look he introduced in his more exclusive armani 
label several seasons ago 
there are plenty of beautiful coats to pick from for next winter 
from the classic polo to cape coats and fun furs armani who has 
joined the chorus of voices calling for a ban on the use of real 
skins in fashion introduced fake sables minks and bear to prove 
his point he even dotted his leather wear from shoes to purses with 
precious leopard spots 
evening at emporio is very 1930ish with long clinging black 
jersey velvet dresses enhanced by small velvet hats complete with 
feather and feather cuffed gloves he also favors the tuxedo look 
from silk lapel to studs and black tie 
armani has never been a bright light on the milan runway where 
color is concerned and his new emporio collection is no exception 
browns grays and blacks plus the traditional fall shades are his 
favorite palette with a spatter of bright red and green for future 
christmas cheer 
franco moschino who also showed sunday was putting everything 
but the kitchen sink on hats as a joke before christian lacroix 
turned potpourri hats into a multimillion dollar business 
for the winter season he gets his biggest laugh out of the label 
racket by flaunting labels and price tags throughout the 
collection thus a simple striped silk stole has a super visible 
huge white label with the designers name and the word couture 
written on it 
a jacket bears the inscription embroidered in gold this is 
very expensive and a blouse states its price also in gold 
other fashion gags at moschino include tape measure belts dinner 
jackets decorated with real forks knives and spoons and an irish 
knit sweater with a ball of yarn and knitting needles still attached 
around the collar 
but dont be fooled by moschinos sense of humor behind the 
chuckles is a very serious designer with lots of superbly designed 
clothes 
for next season moschino prefers pants with wide bell bottoms to 
skirts and favors long jackets with large cloth buttons 
like armani he prefers to let the animals keep their skins opting 
for opulent fuzzy coats and stoles in harmless synthetic fabric

prime minister noboru takeshita took responsibility 
sunday for a major political scandal that his eroded his public 
support but he pledged to restore confidence by pursuing political 
reform a published report said 
the recruit case surfaced during my term as prime minister 
so there is no way for me to escape responsibility takeshita was 
quoted as saying monday in the asahi shimbun newspaper 
the prime minister however ruled out opposition party demands 
for the resignation of his entire cabinet 
i feel strongly that it is my responsibility now to tackle 
reform of the public election law and the political funds 
regulations law in order to accurately abide with political 
ethics he was quoted as saying during a visit to shizuoka 95 
miles west of tokyo 
the prime ministers remarks came one day after the tokyo 
district public prosecutors office indicted four people on bribery 
charges in connection to the recruit co stockprofiteering scandal 
hiromasa ezoe founder and former chairman of recruit co an 
informationemployment conglomerate was among the four arrested on 
feb 13 on charges of bribery or violation of the nations 
securities exchange law four others have also been apprehended by 
authorities but have yet to be charged 
recruit officials reportedly sold about 687000 unlisted shares 
of the real estate subsidiary recruitcosmos co at bargain prices 
to politicians their aides and other prominent figures up until 
september 1986 
although he has repeatedly denied direct involvement takeshita 
is among 17 politicians four of them from the opposition 
implicated in the stock trading scandal 
an estimated 160 select individuals purchased the prelisted 
shares and were then able to reap large taxfree profits shortly 
after they were offered for overthecounter trading in october 1986 
opposition party leaders and critics say the stock deals 
represent influencebuying and have stepped up demands that 
takeshita resign or clarify his role in the scandal they have also 
called on yasuhiro nakasone who served as prime minister during the 
span of the recruit stock transactions to appear before the 
japanese parliament to answer questions regarding his part in the 
affair 
takeshita on sunday said nakasone had already made clear his 
involvment in a recent press conference but added it was up to 
parliament to decide whether to summon the former leader for 
questioning 
public support for the takeshita cabinet has dropped steadily 
over the past five months due to the scandal as well as government 
plans to levy a 3percent tax on all services and goods in 
commercial transactions according to media polls

newspapers reported sunday 
there had been speculation that the 73yearold president who 
suffered a stroke jan 18 would return to office only long enough 
to step down with dignity and ceremony making way for education 
minister fw de klerk 
however botha indicated in an interview last week that he will 
come back to work in april and stay in office at least until his 
term expires in september 
de klerk was elected by national party members of parliament on 
feb 2 to become the partys new leader after botha resigned from 
that post traditionally the party leader has been head of 
government and de klerk has found himself in an awkward position 
because he has no formal power over government decisionmaking 
de klerk was quoted in sunday newspapers as saying he would raise 
the issue this week in an effort to clarify who the party wants as 
its top policymaker 
showdown over pw looms said a frontpage headline in the 
sunday star of johannesburg 
pw and fw set to clash said a headline in the nationally 
circulated sunday times the countrys largestselling newspaper 
both newspapers said many national party officials hoped botha 
would step aside after 10 years in power but the reports said an 
overt move to oust botha was seen as an unlikely last resort 
botha has spent most of the time since his stroke recuperating at 
his coastal vacation home while being replaced by an acting 
president constitutional development minister chris heunis 
calls for bothas resignation have come from liberal and 
farright opposition parties as well as from some national party 
members 
de klerk has yet to declare any major policy differences with 
botha but he is widely depicted as more flexible and pragmatic and 
thus more capable of breaking south africas political stalemate he 
and heunis have both made vague proposals to soften the impact of 
existing segregation laws 
a national opinion poll reported sunday in newspapers of the 
argus group found that 47 percent of the 1098 respondents wanted 
botha to step down while 33 percent wanted him to stay in office 
and 20 percent were undecided 
the telephone poll conducted by marketing and media research 
involved randomly selected residents in six major cities nationwide 
the polling firm said the margin of error for the survey was 2 
percent and noted that it was not representative of the country as a 
whole because it was limited to people with telephones

government authorities thought they 
had the drug problem under control in west germany but new 
statistics indicate they havent 
in the past year the number of new users of hard drugs such 
as heroin and cocaine has increased dramatically and drugrelated 
deaths have risen 52 percent to 673 according to the interior 
ministry 
government officials say about 80000 people use hard drugs and 
that more than 100000 drugrelated crimes were committed last year 
west germanys drug dealers are linked to an international 
network stretching from the far east to north america law officials 
say 
from frankfurt to west berlin from munich to hamburg drug 
dealers operate on city streets while keeping an eye out for 
undercover police officers 
finding a fix of heroin these days is as easy as buying 
candy said a 37yearold hamburg addict who asked to remain 
anonymous 
i cant survive without drugs my whole life is bad because of 
drugs but knowing that makes me need a fix even more so i can feel 
better for at least a little while 
sometimes youths who havent even reached adolescence are caught 
selling drugs as deadly as heroin according to health and law 
officials 
international health experts say they fear the situation will 
only worsen in west germany 
im very much afraid this could be the beginning of a new 
wave dr cees goos a specialist for the world health 
organization based in copenhagen denmark said in a telephone 
interview 
west german law officials say breakins by drug addicts as well 
as drugrelated shootings are on the rise 
drug abuse is also tearing up relations within west german 
families as parents find themselves unable to bear the stress of 
dealing with an addicted offspring 
experts say a major reason for these problems is a worldwide 
decrease in street prices of hard drugs making it more affordable 
for youths and others to go from marijuana or hashish to heroin or 
cocaine 
you can get a gram of heroin for 120 to 200 marks 65 to 
110 or a onefix street bag for 30 marks 16 said 
kurtjuergen lange a specialist at the hamburg health department 
and one of the countrys bestknown experts in his field 
west germanys relatively lax immigration policies have also 
aggravated the countrys drug woes experts say 
hundreds of thousands of newcomers stream into west germany every 
year some of them take to drugdealing to support themselves 
the big dealers take advantage of the financial situation of 
the asylumseekers and get them to sell drugs said bernd 
metterhausen a hamburg police spokesman and expert on the drug 
scene 
drug abuse in west germany appeared to be leveling off after the 
end of the 1970s but experts say it has made a frightening rebound 
according to the interior ministry the number of known people 
who took hard drugs for the first time last year increased by 38 
percent reaching 6997 
last years 673 deaths surpassed the previous high of 623 in 1979 
no comparable figures for 1988 are available for the united 
states the national institute on drug abuse in washington doesnt 
record all drugrelated deaths in the united states but statistics 
it has compiled from 75 medical examiners in 27 us metropolitan 
areas showed 4678 drugrelated deaths in 1987 
the united states has a population of about 242 million people 
and west germany about 62 million 
west german authorities use a combination of drugeducation in 
schools law enforcement and therapy in its battle against the use 
of illegal substances 
newly launched methadone treatment programs in some west german 
cities reflect the countrys everincreasing concern about heroin 
addiction west german authorities resisted such programs in 
previous years saying there is no evidence it works 
methadone a synthetic drug has been used in the united states 
to wean addicts away from heroin 
law enforcement officials have also been stepping up their 
efforts in the past year hoping at least to put a dent in drug 
trafficking 
west german authorities seized a total of 1181 pounds of heroin 
last year up 64 percent from the year before the interior ministry 
says the amount of confiscated cocaine increased by 66 percent to 
1091 pounds while 200 pounds of amphetamines were seized up 42 
percent from 1987 according to the ministry 
in one of the more recent drug hauls west berlin police on feb 
21 found 19 million worth of heroin hidden in the cellar of a pub 
it was the largest single confiscation of heroin ever made in the 
city 
metterhausen says dangerous drugs enter west germany by any means 
available to a smuggler from a container vessel with illegal 
substances hidden behind legal goods to private cars with drugs 
cleverly stashed in hardtoinspect places

president saddam hussein who has proclaimed 
iraq the victor in the war with iran now seeks a dominant role for 
himself in the arab world 
but saddam the name he goes by in iraq faces growing resentment 
at home because promised economic good times are slow in coming 
after eight years of wartime hardship and sacrifice by his 16 
million people 
salaries are low and prices are high 
i want to get married but i need 10000 dinars 30000 for 
an apartment furniture gold said ahmed a 27yearold soldier 
referring to the three items required of any perspective middle 
eastern groom 
he earns just 100 dinars 300 a month in the army 
i want to open an auto supply store but i have to get out of 
the army first he said 
nevertheless iraqis still regard saddam as a hero and according 
to diplomats in baghdad visiting arab leaders praise his strategies 
that led iran to sue for peace last summer 
a western military analyst said saddams wellequipped 
1millionman army has made iraq a major player in the region 
iraqs new economic alliance with north yemen egypt and jordan 
all of whom lent men and materiel to baghdads war effort may 
prove the first indication of how saddam will fare as a panarab 
leader 
other arab countries will also be watching the extent of 
political and social reforms inside iraq 
iraqis accepted many economic and political limitations as a 
necessary price for the war but now that its over the 
restrictions chafe 
wherever you go you feel that the secret police are on your 
back said ali 51 who works for a retail company even the 
traffic police can beat you theres no personal freedom here 
said another iraqi there is some personal freedom but not as 
much as people want 
restrictions like banning foreign travel limiting imports of 
videos and barring foreign publications are widely resented he said 
iraqis are forbidden to allow foreigners into their homes and 
even talking to them is viewed with suspicion so iraqis interviewed 
by visiting reporters usually give their first names or none at all 
certain subjects like the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of iran 
are taboo 
iraqi government officials say many of the restrictions were 
necessary because of the war and will be lifted gradually 
the trend has been approved that there be more openness in the 
political system including this matter of elections and other steps 
to improve the political and social system said deputy foreign 
minister nizar hamdoon people should expect lots of changes over 
the next few months 
elections postponed since august are now set for april with the 
delay attributed to the governing revolutionary command council 
working out laws for new political parties saddam is permitting to 
operate 
but iraqi officials said the plans date back to the 1968 
revolution that brought the arab baath socialist party to power 
they can now be implemented because iraq came out of the war a more 
cohesive nation 
difficult conditions existed even before the war said salah 
mukhtar director general of the information ministry 
but any citizen who lived through the war is qualified to 
practice freedom in political life no one who went through the war 
is a threat to our government why should we exclude them 
the strongest opposition groups the communists the 
fundamentalist shiite moslem islamic call and separatist kurdish 
factions are excluded all were driven underground in bloody 
purges 
information minister latif nayyif jasim said all were 
treacherous and treasonous for aiding iran during the war 
iraqs image was tarnished by its alleged use of chemical weapons 
against the kurdish rebels last fall in a major offensive to crush 
the guerrillas campaign for an autonomous homeland 
saddam has declared an amnesty for many prisoners and dissidents 
but kurdish officials described it as little more than cosmetic 
the us state department recently singled out iraq for its 
abysmal human rights record mainly because of the assault on 
the kurds in the northern mountains 
diplomats said easing restrictions on personal freedom will help 
saddam deflect the heat from economic problems expected to last at 
least five years 
iraq has an estimated 60 billion to 70 billion in war debts and 
moves to expand the private business sector and secure arab 
investment have yet to make headway 
prices skyrocketed as private firms took over agriculture and 
importing consumer goods leaving iraqis feeling empty handed 
despite promises of postwar prosperity 
long lines form outside government meat stores when the monthly 
ration is distributed volkswagen passat cars imported from brazil 
are the only autos widely available 
one boutique owner said she spent hours scouring the market for 
decent buttons 
anything electric is very expensive i cant afford them 
said abdel hamid 34 a veteran who was wounded seven times and lost 
a kidney 
blistering attacks have appeared in the press economist human 
alshumaa wrote in alqadissiya that the private sector was 
soaking the sweat of the people and grabbing their daily bread

layer by layer the senates courtly veneer is 
peeling away as john g towers former colleagues sit in judgment of 
our distinguished friend 
thats the way senators talk about senators and former senators 
even when the political cutlery is out 
in this instance sen ernest g hollings dsc was speaking 
and right after he called tower distinguished he called him mr 
alcohol abuse saying he would not vote to confirm such a man to 
be secretary of defense 
senatorial courtesy is taking a beating the niceties of senate 
address notwithstanding the words of esteem are demonstrably 
hollow amid the flowery salutations come accusations of hypocrisy 
of judgment by standards that are at least double and maybe more 
republicans are making a target list of democrats who have taken 
campaign contributions speechmaking fees and trip expenses from 
defense interests all to counter the criticism of towers lucrative 
consulting contracts with the defense industry 
that may not accomplish much because the numbers are public 
information anyhow and the practice involves senators of both 
parties hollings said the tactic is part of a republican scorched 
earth policy 
but so far neither side has escalated past anonymity on the 
central issue of the tower debate the argument about excessive 
drinking there have been repeated suggestions of problem drinking 
by others in the senate but never with names to make them more than 
rumor 
sen john warner of virginia senior republican on the armed 
services committee says he never saw tower impaired by alcohol 
warner pointedly declined to answer when asked whether he ever saw 
any other senator drunk 
towers drinking habits are described in a secret fbi report 
open only to senators and offlimits in floor debate republicans 
call it anonymous hearsay and innuendo towers opponents say it 
provides clear evidence of a persistent drinking problem 
but no one claims personal knowledge no senator has said he saw 
john tower drunk or even tipsy i challenge any member of the 
senate to come in and tell me that he has seen john tower 
inebriated said sen ted stevens ralaska 
none has 
we all heard of it hollings said i thought hed 
outgrown it 
sen sam nunn chairman of the armed services committee and the 
leading opponent of confirmation said he never saw tower drunk he 
was senior democrat on the committee when tower was its chairman 
nunn said he had fully expected to vote for tower until evidence of 
problem drinking and the question of defense consultant contracts 
came up in the confirmation investigation 
in 1984 when tower left the senate after 24 years more than 40 
members took the occasion to praise his performance especially on 
national defense nunn said his talents were national assets 
in debate on the nomination the georgia democrat said he 
respects towers knowledge but that questions of personal conduct 
discretion and judgment are at issue now 
not that sincerity ever has been one of the tests of senate 
oratory especially on occasions of ceremony much of the farewell 
praise for tower came from democrats who are opposing him now 
sen edward m kennedy of massachusetts called him a 
magnificent champion of the armed forces sen james exon of 
nebraska praised his strong leadership and sound head sen 
bennett johnston of louisiana uncommitted now said tower was one 
of the leading defense authorities not just in the country but in 
the world 
it is sort of nice to be able to hear these nice things said 
about ones self in the senate tower said of the farewell 
speeches it is almost like having the privilege of reading your 
own obituary 
another version is being written in senate debate now 
i think part of towers problem is a lot of people dont like 
him personally said sen trent lott rmiss but thats no 
reason to vote against him 
john tower was never a member of the club said sen william 
cohen rmaine who supports the nomination 
but these are not clubby times anyhow

caterina cornaro was a pawn in superpower 
intrigues five centuries ago but she ruled as queen of cyprus for 
almost 16 years and won a lasting reputation as a fascinating 
renaissance personality 
caterina a venetian aristocrat inspired dozens of portraits as 
a darkeyed beauty a string of biographies and five operas 
including one by the italian composer gaetano donizetti 
her life story reads like a pulp romance starting with a 
shortlived marriage at 18 to james the bastard king of cyprus and 
ending with retirement near venice presiding over a glittering salon 
of poets painters and musicians 
but a new book published to mark the 500th anniversary of 
caterinas enforced abdication in 1489 avoids depicting her as a 
tragic heroine 
instead she comes across as a tough survivor maneuvering to 
stay alive in an maelstrom of violence and political treachery 
between greeks and italians on this east mediterranean island 
according to one of the three contributors to caterina cornaro 
queen of cyprus the chroniclers references to her as la bella 
donna the beautiful lady probably were inaccurate 
she must have had what we would call charisma but i dont 
think she could be considered beautiful more a woman of 
character terence mullaly a british art critic and renaissance 
specialist said in an interview 
she was certainly hardheaded and realistic and not the sad 
deposed queen of the sentimental legend 
mullaly said that none of the portraits of caterina as a young 
woman were definitely contemporary the only one that dates from her 
lifetime by the renowned venetian painter gentile bellini shows a 
plump matron with shrewd eyes and a capable air he said 
caterina rose to fame when she sailed to cyprus in september 1472 
to marry james a ruthless but popular king who seized the throne 
from his halfsister charlotte the legitimate heir 
but james died suddenly nine months later apparently of 
dysentery and so did caterinas infant son both in suspicious 
circumstances according to joachim g joachim a cypriot historian 
who also contributed to the book 
im convinced that both james and his son were poisoned and 
the venetians are the prime suspects joachim said in an interview 
the historian who researched caterinas life in libraries around 
europe added it was their favored method of assassination they 
had professional poisoners on the state payroll and they 
benefited most from james death 
cyprus had been ruled for centuries by frenchspeaking kings 
descended from the crusaders who fought in the holy land the island 
was coveted by egypt turkey and venice as an important trading post 
for merchants dealing in silks and spices from the orient 
caterina succeeded to the throne but she was hemmed in by her 
venetian relatives and advisers who accused her of spending 
extravagantly they also blocked her plans to marry prince alonzo of 
naples when she was 34 and he was 22 
caterina fought back writing letters to venice complaining that 
her counsellors spoke to her rudely and failed to consult her on 
financial and judicial issues 
in one letter she begged the doge of venice to strictly enforce 
legislation protecting cypriot peasants from being kidnapped and 
forced to row venetian galleys 
she also complained she was not allowed to dine royally in public 
attended by young noblemen but was permitted only a small table and 
two maids to serve her 
but in the face of a growing threat from ottoman turkey caterina 
was finally persuaded to abdicate in 1489 and make a gift of cyprus 
to the venetian republic 
in return she got a pension of 8000 ducats a year for life and 
sovereignty over the small hill town of asolo 33 miles from venice 
histories say 8000 ducats was a comfortable royal stipend for that 
time according to calculations based on the amount of gold in a 
ducat the stipend would be worth around 450000 today 
the venetians were the alltime masters of diplomacy joachim 
said they knew when to act and caterina knew when she had to 
give in 
in asolo and her three other homes in the veneto caterina 
sponsored theatrical performances and concerts and entertained the 
leading intellectuals of the day 
but her practical streak emerged too she rebuilt much of asolo 
organized a lending bank and tax reforms and even imported grain 
from cyprus during a famine 
caterina died in 1510 and was buried in venice the venetians 
held on to cyprus until 1570 when it was captured by the turks 
caterina was an extraordinary person she deserves to be 
known for the character she really was not the legend said iro 
hunt who coedited the book with her husband a former british high 
commissioner to cyprus

in a muddy field near the berlin wall a young pole 
looks furtively about and pulls a bottle of vodka out of a plastic 
bag 
five marks you can have he says 
he motions to a fox fur coat on a hanger clipped to button on his 
shirt a bargain for 30 marks 17 he says 
if he sells four bottles of vodka at five marks 270 each or 
the fur coat he will have earned himself the equivalent of about a 
months salary in poland 
across town in the fashionable zehlendorf district three poles 
are painting the interior of a handsome turnofthecentury villa 
for the unbeatable price of 400 marks 220 
you couldnt get a union painter to even look at the place for 
that price said the homeowner speaking only on condition of 
anonymity 
city officials estimate that as many as 4000 poles sell goods or 
their labor illegally in west berlin now that entry into the city 
has been eased for them many advertize in the citys newspapers 
offering to do home repair work and odd jobs at prices many west 
berliners find hard to resist 
thousands of poles are also turning up on weekends at a 
fleamarket to sell everything from baby clothes to superbly crafted 
amber necklaces for hard currency such as marks and dollars 
with the polish economy in shambles the vendors say hard 
currency has become the only means to acquire quality goods and food 
items in short supply it also offers the opportunity for staggering 
profits on the black market currency exchange at home 
without hard currency you cant get anything thats any good 
said a 30yearold man from gdansk who drove through the night to 
be at the market when it opened at 5 am 
he was among a record 8000 poles who jammed a field in the 
kreuzberg district of the city on a recent weekend 
thousands of west berliners jostled through the mud to inspect 
shoes clothing household goods and food the grocery goods 
displayed in open suitcases and car trunks ranged from heaps of 
polish sausage to tins of russian caviar at dumping prices 
many poles at the market earn enough west german marks in a 
weekend to support them for several months 
ten marks on the black market in poland will get you up to 
20000 zloty or almost as much as a pension said a middleaged 
man from krakow who was selling crystal goblets from the trunk of 
his car 
a companion who said he came from warsaw added i buy goods 
in poland for 1000 zloty that i can sell here for 200 marks with 
those 200 marks i can get 400000 zloty on the black market in 
poland we can live for six months on that 
a polish house painter who asked not to be named said he could 
earn a years wages from three months work in west berlin 
under new regulations that went into effect jan 1 poles do not 
need visas to enter west berlin and are allowed to stay as long as 
three months 
however they come as tourists and are prohibited from engaging 
in commercial enterprises 
so far west berlin police have cracked down only on vendors 
illegally selling heavily taxed items such as cigarettes furs 
jewelry and alcohol 
west berlin police said that on one day alone authorities seized 
11 liters of vodka 28000 cigarettes 360 grams about 12 ounces 
of caviar and two fur coats fourteen polish vendors were charged 
with violations of import tax laws 
six poles were arrested in february and expelled after they were 
caught working illegally in the city 
customs checks have also been stepped up and the west berlin 
senate has ordered that poles caught smuggling goods be immediately 
expelled and the offense noted in their passports 
but customs officials say tourists are allowed to bring in goods 
worth up to 100 marks 54 for personal use and it is often 
impossible to prove that the goods are intended for sale 
there are too many of them and too few of us said an 
exasperated customs officer as as he made his way down a row of 
sputtering polish fiats and vans at checkpoint charley at the berlin 
wall 
around the corner where 45 cars packed to the roofs with goods 
waited for custom inspectection deals were already flourishing 
a west berliner walked away with a porcelain tea set for 50 marks 
27 three times less than the department store price

cape town south africas oldest 
city wants to be the countrys first completely desegregated 
municipality 
we are striving toward prize no 1 that the whole city is a 
free settlement area but the government is hardly likely to do 
that said mayor peter muller he meant the national government 
national apartheid laws allow municipalities to decide whether to 
open public amenities such as parks beaches and buses cape town is 
the only major city with no segregated public facilities 
but the national government holds the power to segregate 
residential areas schools and hospitals 
the cape town city council has petitioned repeatedly for the 
right to declare its whole area or sections of it open to free 
settlement the law prohibited multiracial neighborhoods although 
parts of cape town and other cities are mixed with nonwhites 
living illegally in designated white areas 
on march 2 a new law took effect that will allow multiracial 
neighborhoods on a limited basis muller believes that a section of 
cape town will be the first area where all races can live together 
legally since the governing national party legislated residential 
segregation in 1950 
its common cause that district six will be the first free 
settlement area said muller he referred to a hillside near the 
center of town where a squalid but lively multiracial neighborhood 
was bulldozed in the 1960s and declared whites only 
district six is now bordered by allwhite apartment blocks and a 
white technical school but grasscovered lots intersected by empty 
streets and dotted with mosques and churches lie vacant because 
most capetonians felt the demolition had stigmatized the area 
nobody with any kind of sensitivity would have taken it upon 
themselves to in any way develop district six said muller 
before cities were granted the right to open public amenities to 
all races the cape town city council refused to enforce the 
separate amenities act instead of signs demarcating swimming pools 
and toilets for whites or nonwhites muller said the 
council put up notices warning disallowed people that they could 
be prosecuted if they broke the law 
but we didnt prosecute he said 
right through the 1960s we fought the removal of the colored 
mixedrace people from the voters roll and as representatives on 
the council recalled the city councils executive committee 
chairman dick friedlander he was mayor in 1972 when national law 
forced the city council to become allwhite 
we held protest meetings we passed resolutions we did all we 
could friedlander said six of the 34 councilors were 
legislated out of office 
some of the colored councilors were elected from predominantly 
white areas and viceversa muller said we had gotten away 
from racial stigma 
the people of mixedrace indonesian malaysian or indian 
ancestry whose religions customs language and architecture 
contributed to cape towns historic and cultural attraction now have 
no direct voice in how the city is run they can elect neighborhood 
management committees which appoint delegates to a regional council 
south africas parliament sits in cape town the legislative 
capital the first whites to settle in south africa were merchants 
from the dutch east india company who established a trading post in 
cape town in 1652 
the 1985 census put the population of greater cape town 
including suburbs at 154 million 433000 whites 839000 
coloreds 18000 asiatics and 254000 blacks city spokesman ted 
doman said the blacks are grossly undercounted 
officially no blacks live in cape town the adjacent townships 
of langa nyanga and crossroads were taken from the city councils 
control although the city provides most of the water sewerage and 
fire protection services that exist in those areas 
we feel a moral if not a strategic obligation to make sure 
those places have the highest quality of life they can expect 
bearing in mind the shanty type of existence there said muller

thats something any man who has moved into a new skyscraper

former therefore to return among the latter is not to degrade them 
but to promote them 
now there are four former presidents back among the people 
reagan jimmy carter gerald r ford and richard m nixon the most 
alive at one time since martin van buren died in 1862 while abraham 
lincoln was in office for them the promotion was sometimes 
hard to swallow 
it was deeply discouraging for me to contemplate the 
unpredictable years ahead said carter back in plains ga after 
his defeat by reagan in 1980 
ford recalling his own flight to california as a defeated 
president four years earlier said that halfway across the 
country it was as if an invisible force had entered the plane 
the merriment ceased 
reagan stepping down after completing the two terms to which the 
constitution limits him said his leavetaking was a bittersweet 
experience 
it is going to take a little while for the dust to settle 
says william french smith reagans longtime friend and lawyer who 
returned to california in 1985 after more than four years as 
attorney general 
hes getting along fine outwardly inwardly theres got be a 
real transition adjustmentthere is no way to avoid that 
the transition has been going on since even before president bush 
took the oath of office 
i was prepared for that reagan said it had been on my 
mind for quite some time 
reagan has spoken little of his return to private life but there 
have been revealing glimpses in public and more private moments are 
etched in the memories of associates some of whom spoke only on the 
condition that they not be identified 
on the helicopter flight from the capitol to andrews air force 
base the departing former president remarked on how quickly the 
inaugural crowd had dispersed 
then flying over the white house with two long moving vans 
drawn up in the south driveway he asked his wife of 36 years 
nancy to look down theres our little bungalow dear he said 
mrs reagan smiled through her tears actually there were few 
tears but there was no joking either 
there wasnt any sense of the door closing and no one said 
well its all over or anything like that says james hooley 
director of the presidents advance team i think everybody just 
had their own thoughts 
at andrews ronald reagan was treated one last time as though 
there were no george bush the marine corps band from quantico 
marine corps base va belted out a fanfare as the reagans went to 
the reviewing stand the departing commander in chief trooped the 
line as honor guard units representing each of the services stood at 
attention a salute gun platoon from the 3rd us infantry sounded a 
21gun salute 
a little more than an hour after bush was sworn in the reagans 
took off for los angeles aboard the plane they had flown so often as 
air force one now it was sam 27000 the correct radio designation 
since no sitting president was aboard 
stuart spencer a california political consultant associated with 
reagan since before he won the california governorship in 1966 was 
on the flight 
we talked about things clear back from 65 on various high 
points spencer recalls a lot about his governors races of 
course nostalgia is the word i would use not sadness 
hooley adds it was the same old ronald reagan to the end i 
dont know whether when he gets home and closes the door he lets 
out whatever emotion he wants to but there wasnt anything really 
measurable there on that flight 
the welcome for the reagans in the balmy air of los angeles was 
fit for two troupers returning to the movie capital 
comedian rich little kidded reagan about having to find a job 
the outofwork president joked that hed been asked to do a remake 
of his 1951 movie bedtime for bonzo this time playing the title 
role of the meantempered chimpanzee members of the university of 
southern california marching band offered him their helmets to wear 
it had been a trip far different from richard nixons 15 years 
earlier as recalled by frank gannon a nixon speech writer now 
working in television in new york 
nixon forced from office by the watergate scandals flew west in 
an atmosphere of emotional turmoil after walking through the staff 
cabin trying to cheer people up he retired to his own cabin and 
ordered a noontime martini unusually early in the day for him just 
as gerald ford was taking the oath in washington 
shortly after he arrived at casa pacifica his home at san 
clemente calif nixon received a telephone call from ronald 
reagan then governor of california welcoming him back to his home 
state 
we were all very moved because it was at the lowest ebb of all 
our emotional tides gannon recalls 
for ford too the situation was different 
reagan knew he was leaving office and had been preparing for it 
for a long time nobody ever thinks they are going to lose an 
election and then you have a much more hasty transition and 
departure said robert e barrett a military aide and executive 
assistant who accompanied ford to california and is now his 
spokesman

carters departure from office was colored by the dramatic 
announcement moments after reagan was sworn in that the hostages 
he had labored to free were out of iran and on their way home 
the atmosphere on the plane was one of celebration recalls 
carter aide anne wexler now in public relations in washington 
on his arrival in plains carter was visibly weary and had a 
growth of stubble after two nights in the oval office with little 
sleep then he was whisked back to washington for a flight to 
frankfurt west germany to greet the freed hostages 
so in a way it was a more phased withdrawal ms wexler 
says also she adds because of all the tension with the 
hostages it wasnt so innerdirected as the reagan departure was 
for families too the departure from the white house can be 
wrenching 
amy carter 13 at the time told her parents i dont want to 
go back to plains to live you may be from the country but im not 
ive been raised in the city 
after a few unhappy months at home amy did go off to boarding 
school in atlanta rosalynn carter recalled in everything to 
gain the book she and her husband wrote about their postwhite 
house years 
susan ford vance now married and raising a family in suburban 
washington was a 17yearold college student registering for 
classes at the university of kansas on the day jimmy carter was 
sworn in to replace her father in the white house 
i had left about two weeks before my parents moved out so i 
just sort of left like i was going away on a trip she recalls 
a television tape was made however of her parents walking down 
the capitol steps getting in the helicopter and making the farewell 
flight around the city where ford had served 25 years in congress 
and the white house a musician dubbed one of mrs fords favorite 
songs what i did for love as background music 
to this day we still cant watch it fords daughter says 
its still a very emotional thing 
emotional or not reagan says he is looking to the future not 
the past 
on his 78th birthday on feb 6 he told students at the 
university of southern california for two weeks i tried to 
adjust to private life and growing old gracefully but thats not my 
style 
he repeated his pledge to campaign for repeal of the twoterm 
limit on presidential terms saying two times isnt necessarily 
enough time to get all you want done done i still had things to do 
when i left 
reagan is one of only 11 american presidents who have lived past 
their 78th birthdays john adams and herbert hoover lived the 
longest both dying at 90 
reagan has signed a book deal worth up to 7 million and lined up 
a 50000perspeech lecture contract although he had the help of a 
ghostwriter on his earlier book of memoirs wheres the rest of 
me reagan told the los angeles herald examiner he will write this 
one himself 
reagan spends six hours a day at his penthouse office which is 
decorated with many of the same items he had in the oval office a 
miniature saddle for instance and pictures of his family one 
visitor noticed a painting still to be hung of the reagans ranch 
north of santa barbara aides have denied rumors that the reagans 
plan to sell the 688acre hideaway 
his office has a view of the ocean on a clear day but he cant 
see their pink brick house in belair from the window the 
expresident had to go into his wifes office down the hall to do 
that 
mrs reagan is working on her memoirs scheduled for publication 
this fall and making appearances for the antidrug campaign she 
began in the white house a drug treatment center bearing her name 
is planned for the san fernando valley 
there is really no such thing as an average day for either of 
us reagan told the herald examiner lunch is soup or a sandwich 
at my desk and then back to work 
instead of getting daily briefings from his chief of staff and 
national security adviser he now gets his news by reading the 
newspaper and watching television friends say he also talks to 
former washington associates to get filled in on what is going on in 
the capital 
on jan 26 he got a telephone call from president bush it 
began whats for lunch it was thursday the day the two men 
regularly had lunch in the oval office 
the reagans have had friends in for dinner and they go out 
frequently celebrating his birthday for instance at the bistro 
gardens in beverly hills where guests ranged from actresssocialite 
eva gabor to secretary of state george shultz 
theyve received lots of flowers from neighbors says 
spokesman mark weinberg theyve received a firstaid kit from 
neighbors they have received cookies from neighborhood children 
the reagans often attend bel air presbyterian church where they 
also worshiped when he was governor they arrive in a limousine 
with a secret service car following other secret service agents 
arrive an hour ahead of time 
they sit near the back of the church to the left of the center 
aisle the seats are selected by the secret service 
in washington it had been decided our going to church 
represented a threat to too many people in these times of 
terrorism reagan has said 
the first week at bel air presbyterian the rev donn moomaw 
greeted the reagans as a large crowd lined up outside to welcome 
them each week the crowd grows smaller 
they are going to ease back into the family and be just 
routine says shirley brown moomaws administrative assistant 
thats what they want 
meanwhile back in washington another transition has been going 
on one summed up in the washington post by writer charles paul 
freund as damning with tainted praise 
reagan left office as a popular and muchpraised man freund 
wrote in a jan 30 article but he lacks one thing today that he 
still had 10 days ago power the result is that his reputation here 
is being dismantled through a revealing rhetorical process faster 
than are the inaugural reviewing stands for his successor 
the process works this way bush is praised for his 
governmental expertise for his experience for his 
spontaneity and every word said freund suggests an 
equivalent term of opprobrium for his by implication detached and 
lackadaisical predecessor 
its kind of like youre the good guy until you leave town and 
then they can jump all over you says mrs vance i dont think 
my father had that problem

editors note edward pembroke oversees a most unusual 
performance in a most unlikely setting hes been doing it for 48 
years and spectators still wonder why they find it so amusing he 
knows why 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a few days before his 9th birthday edward 
pembroke dared to try every boys ultimate adventure he ran away 
and joined the circus 
his purpose he says was to escape violin lessons not to become 
a performer 
yet today a few days before his 80th birthday on march 22 
edward pembroke is still going strong as the raucous ringmaster of 
the oldest established permanent floating animal act in memphis 
perhaps in america and certainly one of the most charming 
hes the peabody duck man 
i swear he was saying the other day scratching his gray 
head i still dont understand why people like it so much 
you saw em saw how they behave they laugh and clap and cheer 
and take pictures theyve been doing that for the 48 years since 
ive been here and were doing it before that so im told i dont 
understand it i just do it twice a day 
edward pembroke understands more than he lets on the applause 
recognizes the unlikely setting for the performance and edward 
pembrokes sense of showmanship makes the most of it 
picture this 
at midmorning the grand and gilded lobby of the peabody hotel 
begins to fill the bar opens and the tinkle of ice in thin glasses 
mingles with the chatter of expectant guests 
at 1045 am the bell captain rolls a red carpet from the 
elevators brass door 50 feet to the base of the fountain in the 
center of the lobby beneath handpainted beams and wroughtiron 
chandeliers he places a threestep redcarpeted staircase up to the 
lip of the fountain 
the fountain is of carved travertine marble four marble cherubs 
support a huge marble bowl of fresh water overflowing into an 
octagonal marble pool above the bowl a marble pot overflows with 
fresh flowers when it comes to gilt and grandeur the peabody is 
not known to stint 
at the stroke of 11 a loudspeaker announces solemnly your 
attention please ladies and gentlemen the peabody ducks 
spectators crowd into position along both sides of the red 
carpet the loudspeaker strikes up stars and stripes forever 
all eyes turn to the polished brass elevator doors 
they open with a flourish and edward pembroke in a voice like a 
trumpet cries lets go ducks 
out they come a mallard drake leading a fourhen harem pembroke 
swaggers behind them in a burgundy and black uniform carrying a 
stick like a field marshal 
down the red carpet they waddle up the red stairs over the 
marble ledge flapping and quacking into their elegant pond 
cheers laughter flashbulbs 
edward pembroke has devoted more than half his long life to this 
twicedaily task the duck parade will be repeated in reverse 
precisely at 5 pm when they return to their penthouse palace and 
he appears more than content in his role 
ive done lots of other things in my life he said some 
ill tell you about some i wont but the ducks are important to 
the peabody and im proud to be the one to see after them i never 
saw any reason to change jobs 
indeed edward pembroke has done other things chatting with him 
you get the impression that the ones he wont tell you about 
outnumber the ones he will 
when he fled his home in reading pa in 1918 and the circus 
people adopted him they gave him a job delivering the mail for 
428 a week 
that way i got to know all of them about half of them couldnt 
read or write both black and white people i did that for them 
sometimes wed get a notice that a sheriff was waiting for one of 
them in the next town so of course id warn them about that i 
never turned in anybody

he stayed with the circus 13 years until he was 22 moving on to 
more responsible jobs of every sort including animal handling 
ducks would prove to be a pushover 
i left the circus because the train was in a wreck coming out 
of florida i was hurt pretty bad and had to stay behind 
when he recovered pembroke found jobs where he could a period 
in his life he recalls with a grin but few specifics 
by inclination he drifted toward the company of entertainers in 
chicago he drove the bus for the count basie band in memphis he 
palled around with blues man wc handy and other beale street 
denizens and in 1940 landed a job at the peabody two blocks off 
beale as bell captain 
the peabody with various face lifts over the years has been a 
southern institution since 1869 and is listed on the national 
register of historic places the saying is that the mississippi 
delta begins in the lobby of the peabody hotel and ends on catfish 
row in vicksburg miss 
by the time edward pembroke arrived the ducks were an established 
peabody trademark 
the story is that back in 1932 the hotels general manager 
returned from a duck hunting trip with three live decoys which were 
legal then as a prank he put them in the fountain theyve been 
there ever since 
now duck imprints show up on everything imprintable the hotels 
soap ash urns swizzle sticks chocolates that appear on 
turneddown beds one of its dining rooms is named dux another 
mallards the only place ducks do not appear is on the menu 
thats forbidden 
the ducks were here when i came pembroke recalls but they 
didnt do the march then that started with me the duck palace is 
new too 
thats where the ducks live in regal splendor on the roof where 
people party and dance in the summertime 
the palace is a large carpeted cage with a bed chamber 
painted purple and gold trays of cracked corn are handy so is a 
6footwide pool sweetened daily with fresh lettuce from the 
kitchen a flower garden a 24foot mural of trees and waterfowl 
and a magnificent view of the mississippi river 
it is a duck camelot and must look inviting to less privileged 
ducks migrating along the mississippi flyway 
oh it does says pembroke every spring and fall some of 
them land on the roof i shoo em off 
he also shoos off the peabody ducks every four months 
all that high living makes them so fat they wobble not waddle 
wobble so we replace them they dont get much exercise swimming 
around in the fountain and they cant fly 
they cant 
i clip one wing otherwise theyd be flying all around the 
lobby 
how long does it take to train a new batch to march down the red 
carpet 
one day people are all lined up along the carpet their legs 
are like fence posts the ducks havent got anyplace else to go 
except to the fountain and back to the elevator 
they might be a little confused on the first day after that 
they do just what i want them to do 
they get to know my voice they know im the one who feeds 
them they also know im the one with the stick

editors note changes in federal tax laws have put a chill on 
the rehabilitation of historic buildings investment in such 
projects dropped from 24 billion in fiscal 1985 to 866 million in 
fiscal 1988 according to the national park service which must 
certify properties as historic for tax purposes heres a look at 
one giant renovating firm that has fallen on hard times as a result 
</TEXT>

a developer with a reputation for saving 
historic buildings threw a party last april to celebrate completion 
of its most ambitious project a 40 million refurbishing of a 
19thcentury railroad station in pittsburgh 
we believe it will be a grand slam home run carl e dranoff 
thenpresident and chief executive officer of historic landmarks for 
living said as the station reopened with 242 luxury apartments a 
restaurant and office space 
less than a year later hes in trouble hitting just one more 
long fly since the pittsburgh opening a 105unit apartment building 
in a former cosmetics factory in milwaukee wis 
the philadelphiabased company is struggling to save itself 
largely because of an inability to recover from the taxlaw changes 
that have slashed the nations investment in historic rehabilitation 
by twothirds in the past three years 
preservationists say the companys predicament symbolizes their 
concern about the future of efforts to recycle old factories 
warehouses hospitals and other threads of the nations urban fabric 
there already is a chill says ian spatz of the 
washingtonbased national trust for historic preservation thats 
not speculative the numbers are very clear the interest in 
renovating historical buildings has crashed since the tax reform act 
of 1986 
word of historic landmarks troubles surfaced when first fidelity 
bancorp of newark nj said in middecember that it expected heavy 
fourthquarter losses in part because of troubled realestate loans 
historic landmarks which had completed or planned 66 renovations 
in 15 cities soon announced the resignation of dranoff and the 
suspension of projects in minneapolis and st paul minn atlantic 
city nj providence ri ellicott city md and philadelphia 
company officials trying to renegotiate a 46million line of 
credit and 40 million in construction loans with the bank agreed 
to an interview but then backed out 
on jan 31 the company filed for bankruptcy court protection on 
three partnerships set up to renovate buildings in philadelphia 
lancaster and marietta pa and warned in a statement the 
protection may be sought for other partnerships 
analysts say historic landmarks problems were exacerbated by 
softening demand for apartment rentals in philadelphia where the 
company has its greatest concentration of buildings 
in addition the company was stymied in an effort to go public in 
1987 and its projects have been under scrutiny by the internal 
revenue service dranoff has said a city condominiumconversion tax 
added to the anticipated costs of selling apartment buildings after 
tax credits expired 
historic landmarks was one of a number of companies that sprouted 
after congress in 1976 authorized major tax incentives for 
preserving historically certified incomeproducing properties 
before that our tax laws favored destruction of existing 
building stock because they reimbursed the developer the cost of 
the demolition and then gave him preferential depreciation rates on 
his new building says william j murtaugh the first keeper of 
the national register of historic places 
in his 1988 book keeping time the history and theory of 
preservation in america murtaugh said the public and private 
sector were forced to act together on preservation after world war 
ii because of the impact of interstate highways and urban renewal 
programs 
these wellfunded government programs were causing major social 
displacement and widespread obliteration of visual landmarks in most 
parts of the country especially in cities he wrote 
developers took even greater interest in preservation after the 
economic recovery tax act of 1981 allowed investors a 25 percent tax 
credit on certified historic rehabilitations 
but the 1986 tax law cut the historicrehab credit to 20 percent 
limited it to 7000 for most taxpayers and eliminated it for people 
with more than 250000 in income similar cuts were exacted on 
lowincome housing credits and nonhistoric restorations 
thus instead of being able to raise millions of dollars from a 
few wealthy investors developers had to raise money in smaller 
parcels from people with relatively moderate income 
while some companies successfully set up partnerships that put 
investors money in a portfolio of renovations many just switched 
to other types of development 
investment in historic rehabilitation nationwide fell 64 percent 
to 866 million in fiscal 1988 from 24 billion in fiscal 1985 
according to the national park service which must certify 
properties as historic for tax purposes

i didnt go out and restore 300 historic buildings because im 
a frustrated curator said d thomas mistick president of tom 
mistick amp sons a pittsburgh firm that has worked on three projects 
for historic landmarks 
i did it because there were incentives in the tax code to work 
in historic districts and it was fun too 
other companies say they are still making a good profit by 
limiting their involvement to raising the money and hiring out the 
work 
we generally dont act as developer unless we have to says 
ellen warren of dover historic properties inc in philadelphia 
the people here are bankers and lawyers first 
historic landmarks not only has raised the money but acted as 
developer managed the buildings after restoration and set up a 
realty subsidiary to sell the buildings as condominiums 
they took the approach of doing large single projects as 
opposed to a portfolio of projects says kenneth e banwart of 
boston bay capital inc a boston company whose portfolio includes 
eight properties this year i dont want to knock them both 
approaches can be successful but theres a big difference 
stephen e solms chairman and cofounder of historic landmarks 
told the philadelphia inquirer in a 1983 interview he got into 
preservation because he abhorred modern highrise apartments and 
lookalike developments 
theyre nothing but concrete boxes he said every 
apartment looks just like the one next door to it 
he also said he found satisfaction in converting old buildings 
into housing that could attract wellpaid professionals as renters 
without displacing lowincome residents 
i buy rundown abandoned industrial properties he said 
were not supplanting the poor we go into neighborhoods or areas 
of the city that are languishing 
for years historic landmarks seemed to have the midas touch 
turning buildings covered with pigeon droppings into gleaming 
desirable apartments complete with concierges and limo service 
not that everything always went smoothly with the company 
in november 1986 45000 demonstrators by police estimate 
marched in pittsburgh against conversion of the pennsylvania 
railroad station because mistick acting as contractor was using 
nonunion labor 
some 1500 union demonstrators kept gov robert p casey and 
other dignitaries away from the 40 million projects comingout 
party last may 
this demonstration is an embarrassment to everyone dranoff 
said contending onethird to onehalf the project was done by union 
workers 
it was an open shop with bids from union and nonunion he 
said 
the labor troubles were nothing compared to the firestorm that 
greeted historic landmarks plan in mid1987 to sell up to 25 
million of common stock and 50 million in debt certificates in a 
subsidiary landmarks for living inc 
jonathan butcher chairman and chief executive officer of the 
butcher amp co investment firm filed suit in us district court 
alleging solms and his partners were trying to defraud him of his 
share in several historic landmarks projects 
butchers attorneys argued that solms and his partners are 
transplanting the heart and brain of the organization which has 
taken years to build and are leaving butcher with a lifeless corpse 
without any compensation whatsoever 
solms attorneys contended butcher and a company he formed 
deilwydd historic properties had bargained away their interest in 
the future of historic landmarks or its subsidiaries 
although butcher never tried to stop the stock offering just to 
share in the proceeds it was never completed an unidentified 
spokesman for historic landmarks told the wall street journal in 
december the plan was halted by the 1987 stock market crash not 
butchers lawsuit 
for preservationists the work historic landmarks and similar 
companies have done is ample testimony for the need to restore some 
aspects of the tax credits taken away in 1986 
i think the whole purpose of the tax incentive program was to 
connect the historic buildings to investors said spatz of the 
national trust in 1986 that connection was broken 
a bill introduced on feb 2 by reps barbara b kennelly 
dconn and richard t schulze rpa and by sens john c 
danforth rmo and george j mitchell dmaine would raise the 
historicrehab credit to the first 20000 of a taxpayers net 
liability plus 20 percent of anything over 20000 
it also removes the credits from rules restricting the type of 
income against which they can be applied and contains safeguards to 
prevent abuse of the credits by people trying to avoid any tax 
the tax code has always been a tool of social policy said 
mistick the pittsburgh developer so we can say look we need 
the urban investment and we can direct that investment through the 
tax code or we can address the problem head on and provide hard 
money for such investment

editors note ann montgomery works in what used to be a mans 
world getting spacecraft ready for flight like the dozens of other 
spacewomen from project engineers to astronauts she brings a 
special attentiveness and care to the job

ann montgomerys baby stands 
suspended 10 feet off the ground like a beached whale its black 
underbelly its most visible feature 
a gang of men and women work on it night and day under anns 
direction with all the attention a wealthy dowager would get at an 
expensive spa 
its just a good old orbiter she says staring up at the 
fuselage of columbia one of americas three space shuttles im 
kind of fond of it 
for the last 2 years she has been in charge of getting it ready 
for flight as the first woman ever named by nasa to be a flow 
director for a manned space vehicle 
as such this sprightly 42yearold engineermanager with closely 
cropped hair directs the flow of work that sweeps over the 
spacecraft from the moment it arrives at the kennedy space center 
until it is launched for columbia launch is scheduled in july and 
when it returns to earth montgomery will start all over again 
clusters of technicians patch in the thousands of black thermal 
tiles that protect its belly from blazing heat of reentry into the 
atmosphere as the spacecraft makes its long shallow dive back to 
earth 
others work on the landing gear a fuel line valve up above in 
higher scaffolds on this day they are removing a radiator from the 
open cargo bay and making modifications to the crew cabin 
montgomery has about 180 technicians men and women working on 
the vehicle more than half assigned to the timeconsuming job of 
replacing tiles 
columbia has made seven trips into space the last just two weeks 
before challenger exploded on jan 28 1986 killing the crew of 
seven 
at the time of the accident montgomery was site manager at one 
of the two orbiter processing facilities responsible for everything 
from the complex equipment and technical facilities to the 
janitorial services and the vending machines 
six months later nasa asked her to take over as columbias flow 
director 
i had applied for the job and i was really pleased because it 
was something id always wanted to do she says i thought boy 
this is going to be fun 
its the kind of fun that keeps her busy at least 50 hours a 
week she tries to hold it to that so she has some time for her 
computer analyst husband and their children keith 10 and sally 9 
we knew the orbiters would be grounded for some time as a 
result of the accident she says they expected a lot of changes 
and in fact the space agency ordered more than 200 modifications to 
each of the shuttles to enhance safety 
in addition columbia the oldest of the vehicles was to undergo 
extensive tile overhaul and thus would be the last to return to 
flight after discovery and atlantis each had flown two missions 
i was assigned to columbia because i was new and it would give 
me time to train montgomery says 
shes at her office in the launch control center building about 
630 every morning to review what went on overnight notify other 
officials at the cape and at houston every day is replanned again 
two or three times a day she slips over to the processing 
facility a block away to check on columbia 
shes a veteran spacewoman beginning as a crew systems engineer 
with the apollo moon landing program and then with the skylab space 
station project and the joint ussoviet manned flight 
women are no longer rare in a once maledominated field 
things have changed too much she says for a long time i 
was one of the few women here and for the first six months to two 
years male resentment bothered me a little bit but after that i 
tended not to notice it 
more and more women were added and suddenly i found myself 
going to meetings with other women she says on one of our 
other orbiters the lead project engineer is a woman and of 
course a lot of women are astronauts now so you go to meetings 
and there are a lot of young women there and you say gee were 
really good and its nice 
one of the most rewarding moments came last september when they 
powered up columbia for the first time we were working with a 
very small crew at the time and all of them really cared about what 
they were doing montgomery says many people were saying wow 
are you really going to do it it really was satisfying it was a 
milestone 
the most frustrating moments occur when nasa orders additional 
changes and the workload gets heavier and deadlines get tougher to 
meet 
montgomery has worked here for nasa since 1968 just out of 
college after earning a bachelors degree in math and a masters in 
industrial engineering at the university of florida her husband 
brian whom she married soon after she began work also is involved 
in the shuttle program they try to design the other part of their 
lives around the children 
but tough times are coming as columbia gets closer to launch 
maybe in july that will be quite a day the end of a long road 
she says

editors note in the year of its centennial the future of our 
lady of the rosary roman catholic church is in doubt it has one 
year to show the detroit diocese why it should not be closed along 
with many others that have already been shut down rosary is no 
textbook parish but it serves a clientele with special needs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on coming home sunday the rev thomas j mcanoy 
turns to the visitors in the back of his church and apologizes 
were notoriously late the priest confesses as children hop 
from a bus outside and bound into the red sandstone roman catholic 
church once occupied by episcopalians 
mcanoys church our lady of the rosary is less than a textbook 
parish in many ways the priest explains 
as the organ strikes up mcanoy who is crippled moves to the 
lectern to begin his service he opens with a discussion of jesus 
and penthouse magazine 
mcanoy is referring to a sketch hanging at the rear of the 
sanctuary a picture of christ in an obvious expression of mirth 
the sketch seems appropriate for the themeless decor at our lady of 
the rosary a parish celebrating its centennial this year with its 
future in question 
that picture first appeared in penthouse magazine and the 
official church was the priest pauses chagrined to say the 
least 
but the picture is a favorite of the 59yearold priest whose 
defiance dates to his days in the seminary when he let a woman his 
younger sister ride with him in the front seat of the car 
i look at it whenever i get down in the dumps mcanoy says 
there have been reasons for mcanoy to get down in the dumps of 
late on jan 8 cardinal edmund szoka labeled rosary questionably 
viable along with 24 other city churches szoka also announced 
that 30 of the 112 catholic churches in detroit would be closed in 
an unprecedented retrenchment 
szoka said questionably viable churches would have one year 
to prove their viability or also face closing 
mcanoy a priest for 35 years is known as mac to rosarys 
eclectic parishioners most of whom live in the blighted 
neighborhood that lies in the shadow of the general motors corp 
world headquarters 
the golden statue atop the building is visible from interstate 94 
just south of the church which now shares a block with service 
station and is the emergency shelter for a corrections center across 
the street 
once attended almost exclusively by workingclass european 
immigrant families rosarys congregation is about 60 percent white 
25 percent black and 15 percent asian they include professionals 
laborers and recovering alcoholics along with handicapped people 
rosarys handicapped members live in 44 group homes in the 
neighborhood every year they are treated to a party at the church 
the celebration starts as the handicapped people are collected in a 
caravan weaving behind businesses on woodward avenue near the 
campus of wayne state university and the detroit headquarters of 
unisys corp 
parishioner patrick gossman a suburbanite who works at wayne 
state says about 40 of the churchs 477 members live in the group 
homes which have proliferated in the neighborhood because of the 
trend toward moving handicapped people out of institutions and 
because real estate is cheap 
i dont know if these people would be accepted anywhere else 
gossman says 
this years party was another activity on coming home sunday the 
270 guests included an unshaven man who wandered around the church 
pant legs dragging the floor and a man who lipsynced a spirited 
conversation with someone who wasnt there another mistook a 
baptismal font for an offertory bowl and dropped a nickel into the 
empty stone 
many are physically handicapped and find the pewless church 
comfortable if they want to meander rock in their chairs or pray 
as if god were hard of hearing no one bothers them 
the best thing is the subtle way the developmentally disabled 
are accepted especially those who are regular says norbert kidd 
president of the church council and an english teacher at detroits 
spain middle school its authentic its not put on 
mac knows the problems of the handicapped 
a recovering alcoholic the priest had one of his legs amputated 
2 years ago because of poor circulation caused in part by alcohol 
something he has lived without for 11 years he gets around in a 
wheelchair except during mass when he stands to preach with the aid 
of a prosthesis 
one of the things you hear in father macs sermons is if 
youre not perfect thats ok look at me gossman says 
the churchs work with handicapped people however wont be 
enough to see it through its period of probation szoka says he 
wants the parish to build a larger presence at wayne state 
university and to devote more effort to promoting the rosary 
that the cardinal has challenged us to do the evangelization is 
no problem says bob van cleef a member of rosary and a lawyer 
helping some of the 30 closing churches appeal the decision to the 
vatican but on the other hand theres a bit of cynicism about 
the evangelization because the archbishop has never guided us 
church members also are optimistic because money isnt a pressing 
problem a large part of rosarys 85000 budget last year came from 
interest on an investment of about 110000 
we have no bills no mortgage and the property is basically in 
good repair kidd says 
still financing will be a question when the church is asked to 
prove itself next december 
kidd says the church will have to collect more than the 26000 
that came from offerings last year but he says people have begun 
dropping more in the collection plate since the crisis 
kidd thinks the churchs location in an area he said is destined 
to be a center of urban growth and development helped it win a 
reprieve 
the diocese he says just didnt realize how much activity was 
planned for the area when it proposed closing rosary because of 
stagnation 
the citys community and economic development department says new 
housing is slated for a wide expanse of land two blocks from the 
church and the veterans administration has announced plans to build 
a hospital inside the parishs boundary 
kidd says its ironic the church must turn its attention to 
survival at the same time it prepares for its centennial aug 24 on 
that day 100 years ago the parish held its first mass in the dining 
room of a home off a muddy path that was woodward avenue 
the oneyear reprieve and the hope it brings for continued life 
at rosary is cause for celebrating early

gregory peck rushes into his living room late 
and apologetic wearing a white warmup suit hed had to take his 
60yearold azalea bonsai to a japanese tree surgeon 
im not a great gardener confesses the 72yearold actor who 
will be honored tuesday on the american film institute salute to 
gregory peck on nbc i just try to follow instructions and keep 
things from dying 
peck who has reached the twilight of his acting career finds 
plenty of time for gardening 
id like to keep working he says but if i dont work 
again thats ok with me 
in the nbc special such former costars as lauren bacall 
designing woman audrey hepburn roman holiday charlton 
heston big country jennifer jones duel in the sun and 
jimmy smits and jane fonda old gringo will pay tribute to the 
star whose film career goes back to 1943 
his latest film is old gringo in which he plays 
authorjournalist ambrose bierce in a fictional account of his 
disappearance during the mexican revolution in 1913 the movie in 
which jane fonda plays a spinster american schoolteacher and smits 
is a fiery mexican general will be released later this year 
things are slowing down but i expected that peck says 
im getting on in age there was a time i was champing at the bit 
if i didnt make three pictures a year for all i know i may never 
make another picture 
but somebody may be at a typewriter writing a new picture and 
thinking of greg peck for one of the roles most of the good 
pictures ive done have been dropped into my lap 
peck says his own favorites from among the 51 pictures hes made 
are to kill a mockingbird the film that brought him an academy 
award as best actor in 1962 roman holiday the gunfighter 
captain horatio hornblower and the guns of navarone 
hornblower was based on the books about the british naval 
hero created by cs forester peck says hed always hoped to do a 
sequel 
peck describes the guns of navarone as good allout 
entertainment but says its really a comedy 
its a puton he says five or six guys take on the whole 
nazi army and beat them every time we turned one way the nazis 
went the other way it was the keystone kops it was a puton of a 
great war picture 
he refers to duel in the sun as a parody of a western that 
they called lust in the dust when they were making it 
jennifer jones had just played a saint in song of bernadette 
and i had played a saintly priest in keys of the kingdom he 
says david o selznick took great delight in casting us as lewt 
and pearl i was the renegade son and she was the wild halfbreed 
in recent years peck has also appeared on television he played 
abraham lincoln in the 1982 miniseries the blue and the gray and 
was a priest in the scarlet and the black in 1983 
ive been offered series he says im not snobbish about 
television you want to make it as good as possible but on 
television you never have enough time id rather wait for something 
good to come along or not work at all 
when you reach 70 it limits peoples perceptions they begin to 
think of you as too old for roles but thats ok i dont blame 
them and i do want to play parts my own age 
unlike some actors peck admits that he occasionally watches his 
old films on television 
i saw shootout recently for the first time since we made it 
in 1971 he says it was directed by henry hathaway who also 
directed me in how the west was won 
he was a director from the old school who tried to tell a story 
visually shootout was somewhat similar to true grit which 
hathaway had also directed he always had something going an 
energy a drive and a way of linking the scenes together 
seeing my films years later ive come to appreciate the 
director much more at the time youre wrapped up in your role and 
youre trying to do it as well as you can you cant see the forest 
for the trees but after time has gone by i can appreciate the 
directors style

the quiet ivycovered campus at duke 
university seems a long way from times square but it has become a 
hot spot for producers testing shows on their way to broadway 
what you have is a new havenbostonphiladelphiawashington 
tryout in durham says emanuel azenberg the new york producer who 
first started the migration south in 1986 
the 55yearold azenberg is a pragmatic plainspoken veteran of 
the broadway theater he has presented every neil simon play on 
broadway since 1972 hes also a coproducer of jerome robbins 
broadway this seasons newest hit and the biggest boxoffice 
bonanza since the phantom of the opera 
azenberg discovered duke through his family his daughter went to 
school there during a visit azenberg saw a theater in the student 
union building and fell in love with it 
this is what all of new york should have beautiful 640seat 
theaters to do plays he says through the efforts of thendrama 
head john clum and a handshake agreement with joel fleishman a 
senior vice president at the university the producer brought eugene 
oneills long days journey into night starring jack lemmon to 
north carolina 
when azenberg takes a show to duke everybody from actors to 
stagehands works for minimum salary and authors forego royalties 
students get to work behind the scenes with professionals on 
everything from props to sets to publicity 
since long days journey azenberg has done neil simons 
broadway bound and jason robards in a month of sundays at 
duke now other producers have noticed the campus too 
they have picked up on the idea that it makes sense 
artistically financially theatrically azenberg says youre 
bringing something to a new area and the audiences respond 
lucille lortel took a walk in the woods lee blessings 
twocharacter play about american and soviet arms control 
negotiators to duke in february dance superstar mikhail 
baryshnikov played three soldout weeks in an adaptation of franz 
kakfas metamorphosis before coming to new york 
producers can do their thing in a very relaxed nonpressure 
situation says ron kumin administrative director of the duke 
drama program 
and they get intelligent aware and responsive audiences 
according to kumin durham is one point in the research triangle an 
area that also includes raleigh and chapel hill and its large number 
of schools and universities the triangle has the highest per capita 
population of phd engineers and scientists in the country 
duke is a wealthy conservative school built on the tobacco 
fortune of james buchanan duke the school according to one college 
guide likes to think of itself as the harvard of the south and 
its academic credentials are impressive with firstrate engineering 
business and medical schools 
now the drama program it isnt a department yet has decided 
to try for a higher visibility the program is headed by david ball 
formerly of carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh 
ball who arrived in 1985 currently supervises 35 students and a 
faculty of 12 instructors including azenberg who teaches a theater 
appreciation course his reading list includes tom stoppards the 
real thing simons brighton beach memoirs and athol fugards 
master haroldand the boys all of them not coincidentally 
produced on broadway by azenberg 
because of the broadway tryout situation students and 
professionals learn from each other ball says 
we had a session with four actresses who were in the cast and 
understudied roles in a month of sundays he recalls they 
talked to our senior students which that year included seven women 
and one guy what was supposed to be a 45minute discussion about 
the roles of women in theater went on for five hours 
ball also decided to take the tryout program one step further 
besides serving as a testing ground for new broadway shows duke 
would be used as an incubator for new plays by unknown authors and 
starring unknown actors 
the first new play produced under this program was moonlight 
and valentino by ellen simon daughter of neil simon it had its 
world premiere in february in a tiny performance space in the 
basement of the student union building 
the fact that its neil simons daughter has something to do 
with it and nothing to do with it azenberg says it is a good 
play now weve taken the money generated out of certain endowments 
that weve helped arrange and are using it for new playwrights 
money for those endowment funds is being raised through benefit 
performances for duke alumni of jerome robbins broadway in new 
york les miserables in chicago and the phantom of the opera 
in los angeles 
more than 40 students worked on metamorphosis and moonlight 
and valentino during their performances at duke moonlight 
according to azenberg will have another life somewhere in regional 
theater before he decides whether to bring it to new york 
the play already has made its mark on the duke students who were 
involved in its production and students were more involved in it 
than metamorphosis which arrived with a complete new york 
production team 
the stage manager of moonlight and valentino is in the last 
semester of her senior year ball says she has now to her 
credit two or three broadway shows on which she has been assistant 
stage manager and has her equity card thats the kind of experience 
you cant buy 
ball has even more plans for duke drama including the startup 
late this spring of a professional theater company in durham with 
kumin and other investors he has privately funded duke street films 
to make lowbudget movies the profits will be go back to duke drama 
as well as help finance the new play program with azenberg 
manny is one of these producers whos really in the business 
because he loves the theater ball says so am i but its 
easier for me i dont have to worry about selling tickets too 
often

still looming over scotlands capital 
city today is edinburgh castle a turreted ancient fortress on a 
hill that has succumbed to english invasions since the 7th century 
its symbolic of how scotland nearly 300 years after its union 
with england feels dominated by its southern neighbor which sets 
the direction for its economy not always many scots feel the 
most desirable one 
scotlands lack of control over its own economic affairs is a big 
issue north of the border particularly now that a sharp rise in 
interest rates is threatening a slow belated recovery in the 
scottish economy 
the feeling that scotland has fallen behind england that its 
economy has been battered by nearly a decade of prime minister 
margaret thatchers policies makes for some potent antigovernment 
and antienglish sentiment in scotland 
mrs thatcher has pushed interest rates up 55 percentage points 
to 13 percent in five months to curb inflation which has 
accelerated to a 75percent annual rate this among other things 
could raise the value of the british pound and hurt exports on 
which the country depends heavily 
the harmful effects of dampening could be worse on the scottish 
economy just because youre cutting the recovery off just at the 
point where it should continue to be growing said jim walker an 
economist at the royal bank of scotland 
the backlash also fueled by strong opposition to the 
governments property tax reform has revived scottish nationalist 
sentiment and a heated debate over whether scotland should keep the 
status quo or seek selfgovernment 
the tax reform known as the poll tax takes effect in scotland 
in april and is based on the number of people in a home rather than 
the value of the property property values tend to be lower in 
scotland 
there is a great struggle of minds in the people of scotland 
said jim sillars a scottish national party member who won a 
stunning election victory in govan in november ousting a labor 
party member and reviving his partys fortunes 
opinion polls consistently find 80 percent of scots would prefer 
a moderate degree of selfgovernment but the scottish national 
partys call for outright independence attracts only minority 
support 
now the nationalists have come up with a new formula 
independence within europe whereby scotland would become 
independent but retain an association with england by joining the 
european economic community 
a recent opinion poll put support for the scottish national party 
at 28 percent double its strength in the june 1987 general 
election it stands in second place after the labor party which has 
a 41percent approval rating conservatives are third at 20 percent 
of scotlands 72 seats in the 650member house of commons in 
london 49 are labor 10 are conservative four are nationalist and 
the rest are held by centrist parties 
a referendum in 1979 failed to win the necessary majority for 
devolution or selfgovernment within the united kingdom scotland 
has always had its own church presbyterian as opposed to anglican 
in england its own currency and its own legal and educational 
systems but critical decisions such as interest rate increases are 
usually taken in whitehall the seat of government in london 400 
miles south 
most scots are staunch socialists mrs thatcher a fervent 
capitalist has been fighting to eradicate socialism from britain 
she is also a firm believer in maintaining the union between 
england and scotland 
this government remains committed to the union as committed as 
ever she said in a recent speech in scotland and it is in the 
union that we have flourished and found strength 
nationalists have long accused the english of fostering 
scotlands kiltandbagpipe identity as a diversion from the real 
issues of nationhood 
now they talk of scotland being englished as more and more 
positions of power in the scottish cultural bureaucracy fall to 
english appointees 
the governments scottish secretary malcolm rifkind says scots 
have benefited greatly from the government which spent 2676 pounds 
4683 per capita in scotland compared with 2162 pounds 3784 
overall in the last fiscal year 
scottishborn rifkind a cabinet minister says government policy 
is not to put more pounds into peoples pockets but to make them 
take the initiative 
in a speech he urged scots search out the opportunities do 
not just respond to those put on the plate before you

scotland was united with england in 1707 its 51 million people 
are about onetenth of britains population and its 30000 square 
miles represent about onethird of the kingdom 
its economy now depends on services and high technology rather 
than basic industries largely because it has managed to attract 
outside investment principally american investors in the 
electronics industry who have created a silicon glen in central 
scotland 
the north sea oil industry has been recovering from a sharp 
downturn in 1986 scotlands huge financial services sector is 
growing a bit 
the historic industries of whisky salmon fishing and woolens 
have modernized and are thriving partly by targeting the upscale 
market 
unemployment at 103 percent is finally falling and scottish 
businessmen are looking confident 
generally the scene is quite good said john davidson 
scottish director of the confederation of british industry 
the scottish economy grew an estimated 35 percent last year 
compared with 45 percent in britain overall it should grow as much 
as 3 percent this year faster for a change than britain said 
gordon hughes a university of edinburgh professor 
but not everybodys assessment is sunny and many problems 
remain sillars the nationalist said theres a lot of economic 
anxiety around in scotland 
scotland has been painfully wrenched from its dependence on its 
declining heavy industries and its job losses which have been 
exacerbated by mrs thatchers refusal to use taxpayers money to 
rescue ailing industries 
scotlands unemployment rate remains 33 percentage points higher 
than the british average of 7 percent 
the number of people employed in steel shipbuilding coal and 
the heavy engineering industries has fallen in 30 years from 300000 
to about 50000 davidson said 
there is an incredibly strong attachment to what represents 
scottish industrial heritage hughes said there is an enormous 
reluctance to come to terms with that and change that 
critics complain that inward investment is creating a branch 
economy based on lowskilled assembly jobs 
the problem with scotland is that we dont have new 
indigenous industry said martin gregson a scottish entrepreneur 
many of the jobs created by the inward investment go to women 
davidson said 
i think it has a very distinct effect on the way scotland 
lives were a very chauvinistic society he said 
strongly presbyterian scotland prides itself on its respect for 
authority its moral standards work ethic and collective spirit 
scotland also is concerned about outside takeovers of its 
relatively small number of public companies many scots lay the 
blame for this on mrs thatchers freemarket policies there also 
is lingering resentment that scotland doesnt benefit more from 
north sea oil revenue 
the long list of complaints underscores that scotland has got a 
very big chip on its shoulder said hughes the professor there 
is an enormous sense of oppression everything is the sense of the 
english against scotland 
theres a need to step back from that kind of pattern

democracy gorbachev style went to 
work aboard a soviet fishing vessel off south america its 50 
officers and sailors met during a storm to nominate a candidate for 
a new national assembly back home 
slicing through 40foot foamflecked waves the 18000ton kola 
bay covered 400 nautical miles before its crew could agree on who 
they thought should represent them in the halls of power in moscow 
said first mate konstantin s atroshnikov 
democracy gorbachev style preempted the movie king kong in 
the palace of culture of this port city 1000 miles north of moscow 
famed as the destination of the world war ii allied convoys carrying 
guns and spam to the embattled soviets 
in snowcoated kirov palace where on other days the great ape 
had roared on the screen more than 700 delegates from city 
workplaces and neighborhoods gathered to whittle down the list of 
candidates to be proposed to voters it took them nine hours to pare 
the list of six names to three 
with passion and skepticism a modest measure of ballyhoo and a 
big dose of confusion this city of 440000 and the soviet union at 
large are experiencing their first nationwide election campaign 
where voters will be allowed a choice instead of having a single 
candidate put up by the communist party 
im running because the law now gives me that right and i want 
to state my positions said one murmansk candidate andrei a 
zolotkov an engineer who has worked on nuclearpowered icebreakers 
thats my only goal 
said the chief of murmansks communist party apparatus vladimir 
p khachenko in the past we used to gather in committee and say 
how many women candidates do we need here or how many workers 
there this time not a single candidate has been endorsed by the 
city party committee 
president mikhail s gorbachev who championed the 
multicandidate elections calls the exercise a school of 
democracy he says soviet political life must be opened to greater 
citizen participation if his program for perestroika social and 
economic change is to succeed 
thats the theory 
in practice there are clear signs of pressure from the party in 
some sections of the country like the conservative ukraine to have 
a partybacked candidate become the voters sole option in the 
elections march 26 for the newly created council of peoples 
deputies 
the electoral changes approved in december by the soviet 
parliament also create what some soviets call filters at 
several levels to block candidates who cant garner majority support 
on nominating panels 
one famous victim of the filters was andrei d sakharov the 
dissident and nobel peace prize laureate whose candidacy was not 
backed by the academy of sciences the choice of the kola bays 
crew the captain of another fishing boat never made it through a 
subsequent nominating meeting held by representatives of sevriba 
the enterprise that runs the kola bay and more than 70 other 
murmanskbased fishing vessels 
as a result of the meeting in late february at the culture 
palace voters in murmansks territorial election district no 224 
will choose on march 26 from among a doctor the chief of a fishing 
trawler fleet and the 37yearold zolotkov 
whats emerging in their fledgling campaigns is a pronounced 
accent on local issues such as the lack of housing thats keeping 
50000 murmansk residents waiting for better apartments the 
rationing of sugar sausage and other staples the lack of 
polyclinics in new neighborhoods and the fouling of the environment 
by industry in this once pristine region north of the arctic circle 
zolotkovs nineminute speech at the kirov palace never mentioned 
gorbachev but detailed the problems of his fellow city dwellers and 
had a distinct lets send a message to moscow tone 
when youre talking about peoples lives you must make 
demands he declared 
according to khachenko theres little if any difference in the 
candidates platforms what people want is a deputy with courage 
who will fight for what he believes in 
whats also becoming apparent in murmansk is a clannishness or 
splitting along professional lines 
the citys doctors are campaigning for the doctor and are in 
the street passing out leaflets khachenko said the captain 
meanwhile has surrounded himself with other captains 
a local editor viktor v prostikhin is trying to shake off 
attempts by murmansks electoral commission to force his arctic star 
newspaper run by the murmansk shipping company to give equal space 
to other candidates besides zolotkov a shipping company employee 
thats pressure on the press prostikhin maintained 
if gorbachevs new electoral system is a school zolotkov is a 
budding star pupil 
the lanky murmansk native with graystreaked black hair wears a 
burgandy tie and light blue shirt because allies advised him to 
however the engineer drew the line at loosening his collar and 
tie while campaigning as his advisers suggested 
somebody told me thats what american senators do but it 
wouldnt look proper here zolotkov said in an interview between 
puffs on an imported pall mall cigarette 
before the kirov palace meeting zolotkov bought time on an 
electric sign that shines down on murmansks main square 
vote for andrei alekseyeich zolotkov it said 
he wanted to rent a sound truck but relented when told that the 
move might offend other candidates 
his character became a campaign issue when one participant in the 
kirov palace meeting asked him if he would have the courage to 
publicly oppose a decision by gorbachev 
yes he responded 
i already have disagreements with the election law zolotkov 
said why should a member of the party central committee have 
more votes than i do 
the gorbachevbacked law gives the communist party the right to 
directly fill 100 of the assemblys 2250 seats 
whether a candidate like zolotkov can win march 26 is a subject 
of keen debate in murmansk 
perestroika so far here is more slogans that deeds said yura 
verbitsk 24 who works at a plant that burns garbage to generate 
electricity there are a lot of people still around from the era 
of leonid i brezhnev the late soviet president 
but the fact zolotkov even made it to the ballot is a sign of 
changing times to become the candidate proposed by the murmansk 
shipping co he beat out a man who would have been an easy winner 
in past elections an icebreaker captain awarded the coveted title 
of hero of socialist labor 
zolotkov a candidate for membership in the communist party says 
he is no expert on economics or legal matters but wants to go to 
moscow to make gorbachevs vision of soviet democracy work 
if one party is directing things thats exactly why we need a 
stronger legislature he said by my activities i want to 
demonstrate that there can be controls on power

the american judicial system that great theater of the absurd 
seems to inspire more movies than any subject except love 
the newest addition to the pantheon is true believer the 
saga of one burnedout lawyer and the murder case which offers him 
redemption 
in the capable hands of director joseph ruben and actor james 
woods the imaginative story of lawyer eddie dodd becomes a genuine 
edgeofyourseat thriller with an ending that for once is not 
telegraphed in advance 
believable well one cant ask for everything suspension of 
disblief is the name of the game in wesley stricks cleverly crafted 
script 
we meet dodd at the nadir of his brilliant legal career once a 
champion of the underdog a fighter for unpopular causes this aging 
radical with the graying pony tail has been reduced to defending 
drug dealers he says hes fighting for the constitution but 
neither he nor we believe that 
with the arrival of his freshfaced hero worshipping new law 
clerk robert downey jr dodd is reminded of his past glories but 
gives the apprentice defense lawyer his most cynical assessment of 
the accused theyre all guilty 
that pronouncement quickly is followed by the arrival at dodds 
office of a tearful mother seeking help for her imprisoned son she 
claims the son a koreanamerican was wrongly convicted of a 
chinatown murder 
dodd takes the case and with that begins piecing together a 
puzzle so complicated we arent quite sure where it leads when the 
revelations pile up toward the end they are stunning 
the pace of true believer is so fast that we have little time 
to question its realworld underpinnings it will be hours before we 
begin to wonder why eddie dodd hated by law enforcement would 
tempt fate by openly smoking pot in his law office or why the most 
simple fact involving the location of the coroners office eludes 
everyone on this case for years 
but the plot is complex enough to distract us from such concerns 
and the peformances particularly woods make it all seem 
plausible 
downey is appealing as the wideeyed young law clerk who helps 
crack the case charles hallahan is memorable as the key prosecution 
witness and kurtwood smith gives a cool malevolence to the district 
attorney yuji okumoto as the accused murderer and miguel fernandes 
as one of several villains give strong supporting performances 
production designer lawrence miller adds insight into eddie 
dodds character with his cluttered office and the lower manhattan 
world he inhabits 
woods puts his stamp so strongly on eddie dodd that its hard to 
imagine anyone else playing this offbeat character with such 
successful casting could there be a sequel in the works 
true believer is rated r for violence

spike of bensonhurst virgin vision vhsbeta 8995 rated 
r 
 
i fell asleep midway through this thoroughly confused and 
confusing movie woke up dutifully rewound and watched again and i 
still dont understand what happens in spike of bensonhurst or 
why or how and it didnt make me care 
spike sasha mitchell is your basic notalent club fighter who 
gets involved with angel the amusing maria pitillo daughter of 
the local don ernest borgnine and gets her pregnant as a kind of 
career move 
of course the don wants no part of spike who is exiled from 
bensonhurst in brooklyn and he impregnates a pals sister the 
achingly lovely talisa soto whose luminous beauty is utterly wasted 
here 
i swear i dont know why any of this movie happens the way it 
does none of the characters are real the actors are pretending 
they are real but its really easy to see they are not all except 
talisa soto who wisely says little 
spike of bensonhurst is a disquieting thing to see its not 
like real life its not like a movie fantasy its not funny its 
not scary its not anything

new york sire lou reed 
 
you cant beat 2 guitars bass drum lou reed states this in 
the liner notes and proves it in each of the 14 songs on this album 
his fourpiece band turns out essential rock n roll lean and 
muscular and this closetothebone playing is the only proper 
accompaniment for the downtothemarrow lyrics of reeds bleak look 
at his city 
the wild side of city life that reed once glorified has turned 
brutal in the age of crack and aids druggedout parents beat their 
kids love and sex are just a brief escape from the crack wars the 
ghosts of aids victims haunt the halloween parade and about all 
you can depend on is the worst always happening 
the album title might as well include a date sometime in late 
1988 references to specific crime cases and to morton downey jr 
jimmy swaggart and rudy giuliani threaten to turn the album into the 
audio equivalent of one days issue of a tabloid newspaper lacking 
in the timelessness or universality that can touch people years 
later or miles away 
but just as a human interest feature story in a newspaper can be 
more gripping than the latest shock headline new york is most 
successful when reed focuses on individuals in romeo had 
juliette romeo rodriguez comes in from the crackridden streets 
for a few moments escape in bed with his juliette in dirty 
blvd young pedro finds a book on magic in a garbage can and sits 
in his welfare hotel room wishing he could make himself disappear 
the albums lyrical strengths and shortcomings are highlighted by 
a mix in which reeds unvarnished vocal is featured prominently but 
if new york proves to have staying power credit the two 
guitars bass drum

money for nothing warner bros dire straits 
 
this greatesthits collection coming as it does in the midst of 
mark knopflers public nonchalance about the future of dire straits 
if any has an air of finality to it 
but this is no crossroadsstyle retrospective rather its 
the obligatory singledisc collection with the obligatory live 
track not previously available in this case the gentle 
portobello belle 
much of the material is then dire straits hits but the 
band has had few real hit singles they are an album group and most 
fans will already have many of these songs one notable omission is 
skateaway from making movies which became a semivideohit 
in the early days of mtv 
money for nothing this album not the single which is 
indeed included also has one major fault an unfortunate remixing 
of the fine dance track twisting by the pool this time the 
sound is thinner and some of knopflers vocals about the closest 
his singing ever came to a rock n roll raveup have actually 
been deleted 
still many of these songs remain certifiably brilliant mark 
knopfler was fond of introducing his group in concert as the dire 
straits rock n roll band and it has been that milieu not his 
session work or his film scores that stands as his highest 
testament

concerto no 2 op 18 in c minor etudestableaux op 39 by 
sergei rachmaninoff evgeny kissin and the london symphony 
orchestra conducted by valery gergiev rca victor 
 
for an 18yearold russian pianist who played his first recital 
seven years ago why not debut on disc with rachmaninoffs virtuosic 
and most recorded of his four piano concerti evgeny kissin who 
looks about 14 in his picture gives a sure reading of this lush 
difficult work he has plenty of technique and plays without 
affectation 
whats missing is a more vivid sense of mood and character 
changes in contrasting sections the different flavors shown by 
gary graffman say with leonard bernstein and the new york 
philharmonic on an older cbs recording then theres always 
sviatoslav richters performance on dg and of course the composers 
own 1929 version with the philadelphia orchestra 
the sound of the rca recording is clear though sometimes the 
piano is a bit mushy perhaps the result of a little too much pedal 
valery gergiev music director of the kirov opera and the lso 
provide solid support particularly with some gorgeous wind solos in 
the second movement 
rachmaninoff wrote the work after being treated for a paralyzing 
depression brought on by the failure of his first symphony in 1897 
he dedicated the concerto to dr nicolai dahl who helped his 
depression with hypnosis repeating as racn to write your concerto 
you will work with great 
facility the concerto will be of an excellent quality he 
did he did it is kissins performance is excellent but not 
hypnotic 
its nice to see the infrequently recorded etudestableaux 
coupled with the concerto they have a chopinesque flavor to them 
varying in moods kissin is more successful in the more intimate 
quieter moments by the way why include only six of the nine etudes 
in op 39 at only 5953 the disc has plenty of room to include the 
other three

director terry gilliam doesnt make 
boxoffice ticket machines sing his movies arent stuffed with car 
chases naked women or automatic weaponry he prefers strange 
characters weird settings and unusual endings 
most of what gilliam does rubs corporate hollywood the wrong way 
and thats why the arrival of his new film the adventures of 
baron munchausen is such a minor miracle 
while many other hollywood filmmakers produce predictable mass 
appeal fare gilliam grinds out ruminations on fantasy idealism 
history and death 
im desperately trying to make popular films because they speak 
to a large audience gilliam said on a recent visit from his home 
in london but i also want to turn people a little bit off the 
path they are charging down 
gilliams past films have been praised by critics as much for 
what the movies do as for what they dont do both 1981s time 
bandits about a schoolboys exotic travels through the past and 
1985s brazil a bleak scrutiny of a nonsensical future refused 
to surrender their inventive premises 
i had a very early talk with producer arnon milchan when we 
started brazil gilliam said i said arnon we have to 
approach this film in a very specific way we have to think of it as 
the most spectacular failure the world has ever seen because the 
minute we start to think of it as a great film or a good film or a 
popular film any of those things we then start compromising 
four years in the making baron munchausen fits no mold 
either in visually overwhelming style the movie chronicles the 
fantastic travels of a 10yearold girl sarah polley and the 
legendary german calvary officer baron karl friedrich hieronymus von 
munchausen john neville who was known for his exaggerated tales 
his exploits were chronicled by the german writer rudolf erich 
raspe 
the two trapped in an 18thcentury european city surrounded by 
threatening armies set out in an improvised hot air balloon to save 
their compatriots the couples odyssey takes them to the moon the 
center of the earth and the stomach of a giant sea monster 
while gilliam says the film should appeal to a broad audience 
its lack of stars and british flavor will present a marketing 
challenge to columbia pictures and gilliam already having survived 
the films difficult production knows hes not yet out of the woods 
there are a lot of people here he said with a sweep of his 
hand toward hollywood who have worked very hard at training an 
audience i think america is the most brainwashed country in the 
world brainwashed gilliam said into thinking that everything is 
safe and nothing unusual is worth experiencing 
mcdonalds hamburgers are safe theyre not good or bad 
theyre safe you know exactly what youre going to get 
everything here is so infantile there is no future there is 
no past and the present is reduced to a nanosecond people are just 
seeing the same thing over and over again theyre being pandered to 
all the time and their vision of the world gets smaller and 
smaller 
only a few moviegoers these days now want to be challenged he 
said 
it terrifies me what happens is that the handful of people who 
are doing really interesting things end up only speaking to a very 
small audience and thats what i dont want to do 
whether us audiences love or hate baron munchausen isnt 
exactly the point what gilliam is after is shaking the seats in 
which they so casually slump 
when my kids were younger i would read fairy tales to them 
red riding hood and its bowdlerized suddenly the wolf doesnt 
really eat granny granny actually has been somehow hiding shed 
run and hide in the cupboard 
and the woodsman has been turned into daddy who chases the 
wolf away the whole point is just gone and those fairy tales are 
meant to be frightening theyre meant to scare the kids children 
should know the world is not just a jolly place 
and we just sit here and tell the kids its all sesame street 
time everything is wonderful i dont mind that but i think the 
balance is gone people dont want to see depressing endings 
but most of the great works of art tended to be tragedies 
unlike brazil a movie so terrifying that universal pictures 
originally refused to release it baron munchausen celebrates 
the triumph of whimsy 
i wanted to make an upbeat movie gilliam said i wanted 
fantasy to win i was making a film primarily for my daughters ages 
eight and 12 and to tell this fairy tale not another fairy 
tale 
gilliam 38 a graduate of los angeles occidental college and a 
frequent collaborator with the british comedy troupe monty python 
said that as pleased as he is with baron munchausen hed never 
want to repeat the experience 
you begin to wonder whether it is worth four years of your 
life i wouldnt do it again i hated the thing and i actually 
wanted to quit 
it was the worst nightmare ive ever been involved in by week 
two i wanted out it was like punishment for something id done i 
actually felt like job 
out of such anguish though do wonderful endings sometimes 
follow

a clanking pin ball machine six bicycles and a 
projector showing white light are among 100 pieces of antiart 
objects on display at the georges pompidou center in a retrospective 
of situationist art it is said to be the first such exhibit of its 
kind 
on the passage of a few people through a rather brief moment in 
time the situationists 19571972 features comic strips 
cartoons pamphlets posters paintings sculpture and books 
documenting the growth of the international situationist 
the international situationist was an underground avantgarde 
movement of the 1960s and 70s which attempted to tear down the 
barriers between art and everyday life 
situationists worked to combat what they saw as the oppression of 
the individual by advertising and other elements of a capitalist 
society 
their basic idea was that the mediated image controls us 
said elisabeth sussman chief curator at the institute of 
contemporary art in boston which coproduced the show with the 
pompidou center 
advertising is so dominant people only know what theyre told 
to desire theres no room for their own desires to surface 
the show will run in paris through april 9 go to londons 
institute of contemporary art from june 21 to aug 13 and move to 
the institute of contemporary art of boston from oct 21 to jan7 
1990 
among works on display are a giant collagemural by britains 
jamie reid who designed posters and record covers for the 
nowdefunct sex pistols punk rock group and paintings by italys 
giuseppe pinotgallizio wrapped around an industrial spool 
most notable in his absence is guy debord the french filmmaker 
who was the movements leading theoretician and author of the 
situationist bible the society of the spectacle the reclusive 
debord has not allowed screenings of his films since 1982 but they 
were evoked in the show by a whirring projector showing only a beam 
of light 
the exhibition would probably horrify diehard situationists who 
were opposed to both showing or selling art 
born in europe as an offshoot of surrealism the movement 
gathering no more than 100 members at any given time expelled 
followers who became too commercial 
painting is finished it might as well be killed off 
proclaimed one poster 
this early philosophy rose to a climax during the 1968 student 
revolts in paris made its way to the univerisity of california at 
berkeley and contributed ultimately to the rise of punk culture 
in britain in the 70s 
for the international situationist there is no separation 
between art and nonart said peter wollen the shows curator 
art became a total environment not a canvas on the wall 
wollen said he spent three years tracking down the documents 
which had been scattered throughout europe everything had vanished 
many items turned up in basements and garages and a few were taken 
out of museum storage rooms 
the international situationist argued that society was turning 
into an allembracing spectacle under the pressure of everexpanding 
western capitalism 
most of the situationists would have liked to dynamite a place 
like the pompidou center so its really ironic that theyre being 
consecrated here said marc higonnet an antique dealer and 
longtime aficionado of the international situationist movement 
the show has not gone unnoticed by antiart buffs nostalgic for 
the situationists heyday they have showered the pompidou center 
with more than a dozen tracts denouncing the exhibition as a 
sellout to the establishment 
the show even managed to capture the revolutionary spirit as 
france celebrates its bicentennial 
an oversized coupon from the marieantoinnette bakeries reads 
good for one cake

it seems that todays most prominent blues hero 
robert cray has become a real close friend of the grammys 
this year his dont be afraid of the dark single won a 
grammy as best contemporary blues recording its the title cut from 
his fifth lp last year his popular strong persuader album won 
the best contemporary blues recording grammy it also has sold more 
than any blues album in history 
the year before that showdown an album by cray albert 
collins cray and johnny copeland won the best traditional blues 
recording grammy proving that cray can be a traditional blues man 
when he wants to be he and robert cray band bassist richard cousins 
recently played on a john lee hooker recording 
but these are the 1980s not the heyday of collins and hooker 
and cray has found his own voice for his own time 
a lot of people say its not blues enough he said it does 
incorporate a lot of rhythm n blues 
his band doesnt always use the blues traditional threechord 
progressions i guess the best way to say what the difference 
would be is that ours is more funky more danceable more current 
more in tune with whats going on he said 
he also isnt figuring just how much rhythm n blues influence 
to use or calculating music toward sales or black radio 
we dont think about anything like that he said we go in 
to make a good album were not trying to make anything else out of 
it the more uptempo dance things are rhythm n blues the sadder 
songs are blues top 40 singles those arent the intentions 
we dont get too much play on black radio stations we dont 
fit their format which is more dance and a lot of rap the music 
were doing is too thick too serious 
we get a lot of play on albumoriented rock stations the 
singles are sometimes on contemporary hits stations weve been 
heard on jazz stations a lot of older jazz stuff is basically blues 
riffs 
for cray a blues is a sad or lonely song and somebody in it is 
blue when you go in to record its kind of embarrassing its 
spilling your guts 
he wrote three of the 10 songs on dont be afraid of the dark 
and collaborated on two more producers bruce bromberg and dennis 
walker do some of the songwriting walker wrote dont be afraid of 
the dark band members cousins drummer david olson and 
keyboardist peter boe also write 
cray was recently in new york for a soldout engagement at radio 
city music hall but the veteran of 15 years on the road doesnt get 
caught up in praise though fame has allowed him to be freer on 
stage 
the excitement level is way up theyre familiar with a lot of 
songs youre going to do a lot of people are in your corner youre 
free to do pretty much what you want it does make it just a step 
more comfortable 
his current tour started last may though his lp was released 
until august the band played in brazil canada japan australia 
new zealand europe and the united states the tour ends here in 
june and runs in europe until next august 
thinking back cray recalled i was taken with albert collins 
the first time i heard him in 1969 at an outdoor festival in 
southern washington state he got my attention playing guitar behind 
his back and walking out into the audience with a long guitar cable 
i was 15 or 16 i was pretty impressed i was playing guitar at the 
time 
cray who is less of an extrovert hasnt appropriated collins 
tricks thats not my personality i guess im just not that 
kind of guy 
in 1971 collins played at crays high school graduation the 
class voted for him he had done a lot of work in the area he 
said i met him at the party during his break i asked him about 
his band and his music the next time i saw him was 1976 he 
remembered talking to me 
cray and cousins both sons of career servicemen met near 
tacoma in january 1974 they moved to eugene ore to start a 
blues band 
we decided to get out of tacoma and go down there and start 
working with drummer tom murphy who had gone to school in salem 
ore richard worked well with him we were a trio for awhile we 
had a succession of different players he said 
we played rhythm n blues and blues in the bars in eugene and 
portland did an occasional gig in seattle through 1974 and 1975 
in 1976 we started traveling to vancouver and san francisco backing 
albert collins and doing some gigs on our own 
personnel changed in 1979 we started to work montana idaho 
utah occasionally arizona and more into california it wasnt until 
1983 we were able to go across the country 
they made their first recording in 1978 after meeting producer 
bruce bromberg at a blues festival in san francisco but whos 
been talkin wasnt released until 1980 because the label they 
were on tomato had problems cray currently records for mercury 
cray remembers that festival it was a lot of fun we were the 
last act on sunday afternoon albert joined us we were the 
highlight of the show it was a big thing for us we got our picture 
in the paper 
tomato folded about six months later he said we continued 
to work up and down the west coast in 1982 we ran into bromberg 
again he and a friend of his started hightone records we were the 
first on it bad influence was released in 1983 thats what 
enabled us to go across country 
false accusations was released in 1985 but it was strong 
persuader the first cray album distributed by a major record 
company which shot him to prominence 
cray who has too busy to look has friends searching for a house 
for him to buy in southern california 
i like washington state a whole lot he says its gorgeous 
in the summertime but we got spoiled after we finished touring in 
japan in november 1987 we took a couple of months off in los 
angeles to get material together and from january to april we made 
the latest record the sun was shining all the time

warren moore knew the dirt roads and 
outhouses of the great smoky and blue ridge mountains but her 
travels and talks with the people of the region fueled a passion to 
have those voices heard 
this is the nuts and bolts of social history so much of what 
they had to say is lost said moore who put her photographs and 
portraits of the hundreds of people she interviewed in the area in a 
new book called mountain voices 
she took a leave of absence from her teaching job at a private 
school in new york leased an apartment in her hometown of 
greensboro and taught a few days a week so she could spend more time 
in the mountains 
i spent most of my time on the dirt roads where the blacktop 
had ended she said i wanted to see what they had to say i 
found out how little i did know about these people i became caught 
up in it i wanted their voices to be heard 
the stereotype is theyre lazy barefooted hillbillies said 
moore now an educational consultant in new york i had gone to 
the mountains of north carolina all my life as a summer person and 
this wasnt the view i had at all 
the 38yearold author found herself going back to the southern 
appalachians every chance she got then she would bring back her 
taperecorded interviews and sit up all night and listen 
i realized i needed to capture it before it was gone she 
said 
she gained the confidence of people who do not typically give 
interviews farmers homemakers raccoon hunters mountain 
musicians craftsmen and cherokee indians 
i found the people are very different from one area to 
another she said theres lots of different kinds of people 
you dont get that from any stereotype 
these people are very private individuals they need to get to 
know you before they open up 
moore would begin her conversations by saying that her intention 
was to portray the mountain residents on their own terms i wanted 
their views their opinions she said i wanted them to talk 
about themselves 
the book comes as oral history as the words of the people 
themselves 
these people make quite good philosophers moore said they 
realize what is important if something is difficult they make a 
joke about it and go on with their life 
people like bea hensley a blacksmith from spruce pine my 
theory is that you were born to live and not make a living he 
says in the book making a living comes secondary anyone can make 
a living not everybody can live and your monetary value doesnt 
have anything to do with it 
moore believes the book should help clear up some of the 
misconceptions about the people who inhabit the mountains of western 
north carolina 
they are portrayed as people who didnt go to school and who 
dont send their kids to school she said 
instead the offspring of some of those she interviewed had 
graduated from college and some had even gone on to graduate school 
this isnt my book its theirs she said every one of 
them is special in their own way these people are my best friends 
and i care about them

as country music performer louise 
mandrell left her dressing room to entertain recently backup singer 
pedro tomas greeted her with the show business phrase break a 
leg 
i probably will she quipped 
the reason she fears for her lower extremities is that she has 
just added some fancy footwork to her las vegasstyle act inspired 
by the recent movie big she has purchased a walking piano 
like the one actor tom hanks played in the hit film 
the instrument is a flat long series of adjoining keys that sit 
on the ground they are played by stepping on them 
mandrell 34 whose sisters barbara and irlene also are country 
music performers is now using the unusual piano in her act 
its a novelty she said in an interview before playing the 
instrument on the nashville network on cable tv its a toy that 
will be interesting to people its fun weve been giggling half 
the day away when we practice 
the electronic piano which costs 15000 weighs 600 pounds and 
is 14 feet long it has 40 keys 24 white and 16 black which 
require 30 pounds of pressure to make a sound it came in two 
sections and her road crew put it together and made some technical 
adjustments to amplify the sound to make it better for settings such 
as showrooms 
she will place a mirror behind her so the audience will be able 
to watch the intricate foot work 
its a toy she said an expensive toy 
three other members of her act will join her on the keys they 
hop on and off and quickly move to different spots along the keys 
the performance looks something like a chinese fire drill where all 
four have hot feet 
she didnt have to hire a choreographer to take advantage of her 
costly new prop 
its not really dancing she said its playing an 
instrument with your feet 
in the movie hanks is a boy who suddenly physically becomes a 
man but responds at the level of a child he and his boss a toy 
company executive hop on the piano at the toy store and play a 
chopsticks duet 
i loved it mandrell said about the film movies usually 
bomb when i love them but not this one i love kids tom hanks was 
believable as a child im a big fan of his 
rc bannon her husband who is a country songwriter suggested 
they buy one and put it in her act they called a new york city toy 
store ordered one and it arrived crated up in nashville accompanied 
by a piece of paper with a telephone number to call with questions 
she began rehearsing on the piano in february she knows of no 
other performer who has incorporated the instrument into his or her 
act 
its not like the piano where you just sit and do your piece 
she said believe me its a lot of work 
i play the regular piano so its not like a whole new 
experience and i dance so the experience helped 
mandrell known to many tv viewers for her shampoo commercials 
said she wont be too worried about hitting a wrong key the fans 
like me because im not perfect she said 
the first two songs she learned on her new instrument are down 
yonder and the william tell overture 
down yonder is a standard country song she said the 
country music fans know the william tell overture but it reaches 
the noncountry fans too its challenging 
she doesnt plan to carry the new piano to the dusty fairs where 
nearly all country music stars perform in the summer 
its too big too fragile i dont think it could endure the 
road but people could set it up at home and it would last forever 
she and her sisters starred in the nbctv show barbara mandrell 
and the mandrell sisters for two seasons beginning in 1980 
louise whose specialty is playing the fiddle now performs in las 
vegas about 12 weeks a year plus makes records and does other 
appearances 
irlene whose talent runs more toward comedy is currently on the 
syndicated tv show hee haw barbara appears periodically on tv 
specials and has recently resumed her recording career 
louise recently has been the opening act for ageless george burns 
he watched every one of my shows and made all these cute 
comments hes really a lot of fun she said 
she said hes amusing even offstage and enjoys fostering his 
image as a ladies man he sent her candy one day with this note 
attached 
we were great together last night

the discovery of five ancient statues has 
transformed a tranquil courtyard of luxor temple into an 
archaeologists dream 
we want to discover who buried the statues why and when 
mohammed saghir the luxor areas director of antiquities said as 
diggers picks and shovels turn the silty earth in search of more 
statues 
since the jan 22 discovery of the wellpreserved statues 
experts have debated whether more lie near them beside towering 
columns on the north side of the courtyard of pharaoh amenophis iii 
who ruled egypt in 13911353 bc 
the courtyard just over 57 yards long by 50 yards wide is 
considered the glory of luxor temple a fabled remain altered and 
reworked by many of ancient egypts bestknown rulers 
on a recent sunday four of the statues covered in padded vinyl 
and tied so only their toes peeked out sat in their burial pit 
workers dug around them as small boys carted basketfuls of dirt to 
mounds near an outer temple wall on which ramses ii in a chariot 
smites the illfated enemies of egypt 
each digger hopes to be the next elrayees farouk chief of 
temple workers who was credited with finding the edge of a buried 
granite statue base that had shielded the figures from generations 
of footsteps 
farouk in a brown galabeya or robe his head swathed in the 
traditional scarf of southern egypt shouted orders to his men as 
they excavated 
theyve found no additional large statues but saghir said the 
dig had turned up a small bronze of the god osiris lord of the 
underworld part of a stela or commemorative plaque copper tools 
and other small artifacts 
some light has been shed on mysteries of the discovery one of a 
number of group burials by ancient egyptians 
we know this burial was not accidental saghir said these 
statues were placed lovingly in the earth their sides turned toward 
the west not only did the ancients protect the statues by putting a 
base over them but they took the care to seal the pit with a layer 
of gypsum and limestone chips they wanted to save them for 
eternity 
the base a granite slab with two niches carved in it apparently 
once held two of the statues found in january the general and 
later pharaoh haremhab knelt in a roundedoff rectangle with 
offerings before a seated creator god atum that fit in a 
rectangular niche according to measurements 
a third statue found in january is of the goddess hathor patron 
of beauty and womanhood and the fourth is a minor goddess yunet 
originally the base lay on the ground inside the temple at some 
time for reasons unknown the ancients decided to bury the statues 
they put them in a hole covered it with dirt gypsum and stone 
then put the base on top and covered it with dirt much like the 
layers in a sandwich 
saghir and others think the base may have provided protection or 
may have had some magical significance it only actually covers a 
quartzite statue of amenophis iii which saghir said was the most 
important find 
the statue depicts amenophis iii standing on a sledge to 
demonstrate his divinity tomb paintings and small wooden statues 
exist showing him in such a pose but the stone statue standing more 
than eight feet tall is unique 
over 34 centuries amenophis iii has remained among ancient 
egypts most fascinating personalities early in his reign he 
claimed to have killed 102 fierce lions he brags in heiroglyphs on 
the new statue that he controls land from nubia ranging from 
southern egypt through what is now northern sudan to the euphrates 
river to the east to the taurus mountains in southern turkey in 
later life amenophis iii preferred luxury to prowess a patron of 
the arts he demanded magnificent monuments and the finest works 
craftsmen could produce 
the five statues show the masters touch and conservation 
experts from cairo will have the job of ensuring their safety in the 
modern world they have been moved from the courtyard to a special 
storage area at luxor 
saghir said hes just beginning to have the time to think about 
whats been found finding something by surprise and discovering 
it in a regular excavation give different feelings he said 
the first night after these statues were found i couldnt 
sleep i went to luxor temple at 11 pm and walked in the 
moonlight i went home at 2 am i went again to the temple i was 
trying to decide what to do next i was so afraid something would 
happen to them i knew at first sight we had a cache 
the statues may have been put in hiding for safekeeping during 
the assyrian invasion he said that west asian empire conquered 
egypt in 671 bc and for years its soldiers ransacked and 
plundered monuments throughout the country 
however egypt suffered ups and downs as early as 100 years after 
amenophis built luxor temple when the pharaohs began to decline 
after the 66year reign of ramses ii and that may account for the 
statues burial 
in cairo rainer stadelmann director of the german 
archaeological institute and one of the professions most respected 
scholars said he believes the order in which the statues were 
buried gives history a hint 
the best choice for the time of burial would have been during 
the reign of ramses ii who expanded and redesigned luxor temple he 
said perhaps they bothered ramses in some way or interfered with 
his processions 
he reasons that the statues were grouped as they are for a reason 
to me they represent the west the setting sun stadelmann 
said if this is true then we can expect in the opposite 
courtyard to find another grouping this time representing the east 
the rising sun 
he characterized his ideas as fantasies because the discovery is 
so new but said he expects that the statues lined the sides of the 
festival courtyard in ancient times to produce a processional 
journey for the sun god 
we have these processions painted on walls but in this case it 
could have been done with statues to the ancients it wouldnt have 
mattered if the pharaoh were dead or if the statues later were 
buried 
the journey would continue

bridges buildings trains and planes that 
monitor their own structural wellbeing sound like science fiction 
but theyre results of new technology that lets scientists test 
things without destroying them 
our work is like reinventing the wheel and making it work 
better said physicist joseph s heyman who runs the 
nondestructive evaluation laboratory he started in 1971 at nasas 
langley research center 
the lab uses an array of measurement techniques thermal 
diffusion ultrasonics acoustics magnetism xrays lasers and 
holography to probe for internal defects in objects like space 
shuttle solid rocket motors satellites airplane wings train 
wheels and railroad tracks and even ordinary bolts 
then there are smart materials that take care of themselves 
were investigating how to incoporate sensors directly into 
materials heyman said its easy with fiberlike materials like 
composites a fiber optic line is buried in the structure an 
aircraft wing can be made the same way and the same applies to 
larger structure like the space station 
the technology is especially critical for the space station

as a plant grass is taken more or 
less for granted it grows it gets mowed watered and fertilized 
it grows more 
theres not just that much attention to it said milton 
engelke a turf researcher for texas aampm university but 
everybodys got grass to cut 
engelke who estimates hes one of just a dozen turf breeders in 
the united states would like to see the care given to grass become 
even easier he and a staff of 11 have 20 acres of grass in college 
station dallas and el paso 
one objective of their research is to give the homeowner a much 
higher quality plant with less input less care less maintenance 
he said and in the program were introducing grasses that wont 
have to be mowed as frequently or grasses that produce little or no 
clippings 
homeowners though arent the only people who stand to benefit 
from engelkes research most people believe turf is just there to 
look pretty but its main purpose is to stabilize and conserve the 
landscape 
engelke hopes to introduce two new grasses this year to the 
grassgrowing industry a 25 billion business nationwide one is a 
buffalo grass capable of growing from south texas to the northern 
united states the other is a zoysia grass adaptable along the 
southern tier of states from california to georgia 
the buffalo grass will be introduced to growers this year and 
available to the public in about three years it would grow to only 
about four inches need little or no fertilizer and pesticides and 
crowd out less desirable grasses 
engelke wants it to be called prairie buffalo grass because 
it reminds him of the rippling windblown grass crossed by prairie 
schooners

it took two years of negotiations before time 
inc and warner communications inc could agree to create the 
worlds biggest media and entertainment concern through an 18 
billion merger but the executives who will head the new company say 
their protracted talks have paved the way to a harmonious future 
i dont know of an item we didnt explore warner chairman 
steven j ross said sunday that is one of the things that makes 
me feel very secure in the future 
time and warner announced saturday they would join forces in a 
merger of equals that would value the combined company time warner 
inc at 18 billion and would rank it as the biggest media 
conglomerate in the world followed by bertlesmann ag of west 
germany time warner would have projected annual revenues of 10 
billion while bertlesmann recorded 1987 revenue of 6 billion 
the agreement between time and warner followed two years of 
onagain offagain talks between the two new yorkbased companies 
the mostrecent hiatus occurred as warner pursued a 12 billion 
buyout of lorimar telepictures corp but the negotiations picked up 
steam after warner completed that acquisition in january 
saturdays announcement also followed years of takeover 
speculation about time that sparked periodic surges in the companys 
stock price the company shored up its defenses from time to time 
most recently by extending its stock buyback plan and amending its 
shareholder rights plan in january 
time inc chairman j richard munro who will serve as 
cochairman and cochief executive officer of the new company along 
with ross said sunday of the merger this is an offensive move 
not a defensive move 
however it is impossible to ignore the fact that the combination 
of time and warner literally gives the two companies solidarity in 
the face of a trend toward consolidation in the media industry 
publishers including rupert murdoch and robert maxwell have gone on 
shopping sprees in recent years building media conglomerates that 
would have found either time or warner to be an attractive takeover 
candidate 
the deal calls for warner shareholders to receive 0465 share of 
time for each share of warner they own since there are potentially 
1772 million warner common shares and time closed friday at 
10912 a share that puts a value on warner of about 9 billion if 
the deal had closed friday 
in addition there are 566 million shares of time outstanding 
giving it a market value of a little more than 6 billion based on 
fridays close warner stock closed at 4587 on friday 
debt and preferred shares account for the balance of the 18 
billion market value of the proposed new company 
the deal is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies 
and by the federal government 
because the deal is a merger of equals rather than an 
acquisition it cannot be directly compared to such megadeals as the 
record 2453 billion leveraged buyout of rjr nabisco inc by 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co last month 
munro said in an interview there was no one factor that enabled 
the two sides to finally reach agreement 
im not sure anything happened he said i think there is a 
certain time when things really begin to come together 
the price of the merger was not a problem according to ross 
ninety percent of the discussions had to do with people logistics 
and future plans he said 
both executives said the congeniality of their contacts over the 
past two years cemented a relationship that will make it easy for 
them to work together as coceos 
it wont be the first ross has served as a coceo he and william 
frankel shared the top job at warner from 1967 until frankels death 
in 1971 
munro and ross will serve together until munro 58 retires and 
becomes chairman of the executive committee of the combined company 
munro will be succeeded as coceo by nj nicholas jr currently 
the president of time inc and who will hold that same post at time 
warner 
upon the eventual retirement of ross who is 61 nicholas is 
expected to be sole head of time warner 
few immediate changes are expected in the structure of the new 
company ross and munro said there were no plans to sell any parts 
of either warner or time and they did not expect any layoffs as a 
result of the combination 
ross was reluctant to discuss what time warners plans were but 
did say he expected the biggest impact of the merger to be on the 
companys overseas operations 
time is the nations leading magazine company with such titles 
as time people and sports illustrated along with timelife books 
and the bookofthemonth club 
warner has major movie and television production interests 
including warner brothers and warner brothers television and warner 
cable communications 
munro predicted the warner cable television operations would be 
merged with times creating the secondlargest cable operation in 
the country behind telecommunications inc of denver times cable 
holdings include home box office and cinemax 
munro also expected warners book division to become part of 
times larger publishing empire 
the merger announcement came nearly two months after warner 
completed its longdelayed acquisition of lorimar warner and 
lorimar agreed on a merger last may but the deal wasnt finalized 
until january because of stumbling blocks raised by chriscraft 
industries inc warners largest stockholder 
ross and chriscraft chairman herbert siegel have been at 
loggerheads for years quarreling not only about lorimar but about 
ross salary and the makeup of the warner board 
how much of a thorn siegel will be in the side of time warner 
remains to be seen ross said it was not yet known if siegel who 
sits on the warner board will also be a director of time warner 
siegels stake in the new company will decline to between 6 
percent and 7 percent from his current 11 percent warner share 
warner officials said 
chriscraft bought its stake of warner in 1984 to help warner 
fight a takeover attempt by murdochs news corp

here are some key questions in the 17month labor dispute between 
eastern airlines and its machinists union 
q who is on strike 
a the 8500 eastern workers who belong to the international 
association of machinists they are about equally divided between 
aircraft mechanics and ramp service workers who fuel planes handle 
baggage and drive motorized equipment on airport runways 
q how much do machinists make 
a mechanics at eastern earn a top wage of 1883 an hour that 
compares with 16 at nonunion continental airlines 1878 at 
american airlines 2005 at united and northwest airlines and 
2010 at delta air lines and usair 
ramp service workers earn a top hourly wage of 1560 comparable 
workers earn 1551 an hour at american 1593 at usair 1653 at 
northwest 1657 at united and 1747 at delta continental 
contracts for the work 
q what does each side want 
a eastern is seeking 150 million in wage and benefit 
concessions to help stem mounting losses at the airline the 
machinists want 50 million in raises but last week offered to delay 
increases for 15 months 
q how has the dispute evolved 
a the machinists have fought wage cuts since contract renewal 
talks began in october 1987 pilots and flight attendants a year 
earlier reached concessionary agreements with the airline that 
slashed pay 20 percent 
the national mediation board intervened in the dispute in january 
1988 but no progress was made during a year that included massive 
layoffs and costcutting the dispute reached loggerheads last month 
after eastern rejected binding arbitrtion and the mediation board 
declared a 30day coolingoff period before a strike 
more than 97 percent of the machinists on feb 15 authorized a 
strike president bush refused to intervene to delay the strike 
easterns last contract offer would have cut pay but kept it 13 
percent higher than workers who took the 20 percent reductions it 
was rejected friday and the strike began at 1201 am saturday 
q could the eastern strike affect other modes of transportation 
a yes the national railway labor act permits secondary boycotts 
in air and rail travel if rail union workers honor pickets traffic 
on the nations 12 commuter railroads and amtrak could be severely 
disrupted also other airlines could be picketed and the 14 
millionmember aflcio has asked its members to honor the machinists 
strike 
however the union decided sunday to appeal a judges order 
barring such secondary boycotts in the new york metropolitan area 
and said it would not picket any railroads monday 
q what is easterns financial condition 
a eastern says it has lost more than 1 billion this decade and 
is losing more than 1 million a day it also has 25 billion in 
debt the airline was bought by texas air in february 1986 and since 
then has undertaken a series of cutbacks in an attempt to restore 
profitability the carriers workforce since the takeover has shrunk 
to about 30000 from 42000 eastern also has sold planes cut 
profitable routes closed its kansas city mo hub and taken 
smaller savings measures such as eliminating hot food on some 
flights 
eastern has about 400 million in cash to help it meet its 
financial obligations during the strike in addition the pending 
sale of easterns northeast shuttle to developer donald trump will 
bring in about 365 million 
q why is eastern ailing 
a management blames union militancy and unrealistic demands and 
says it trimmed back operations elsewhere and needs labor to make 
sacrifices labor maintains eastern is suffering because it didnt 
react aggressively and competitively to airline deregulation in 
1978 in 1983 workers made wage concessions in return for future 
profits that never materialized and stock tey dont want further 
concessions without proof eastern is being managed with longterm 
commitment to its financial fitness the unions also claim texas air 
chairman frank lorenzo wants to strip the airline of assets or 
dissolve it 
q what are the strikes possible effects 
a the strike threatens to force the 60yearold airline into 
bankruptcy to forestall its demise eastern could lay off striking 
workers and sell other assets such as planes airport gates or 
international routes to raise cash texas air could sell the 
airline and trans world airways owner carl icahn has been among 
potential buyers who recently have expressed interest a separate 
settlement with pilots who are honoring the strike could allow the 
airline to keep more planes airborne and bush could change his mind 
and appoint an emergency panel that would force the machinists to 
return to work for 60 days

authorities today arrested the former chairman of 
nippon telegraph and telephone corp on suspicion of bribery in a 
stockprofiteering scandal that has shaken japans political and 
business elite 
the tokyo district prosecutors office said hisashi shinto 78 
was arrested with his 63yearold secretary kozo murata on 
suspicion of receiving bribes in the form of bargainprice shares in 
a subsidiary of the recruit co a conglomerate with business links 
to the giant telecommunications utility 
authorities also said they searched shintos home 
shinto was known as an advocate of clean government and business 
until december when he was forced to resign from the chairmanship 
of ntt as a result of the scandal 
todays arrests follow the announcement saturday that prosecutors 
in the case had indicted four people on bribery charges including 
the founder of the recruit co another recruit executive and two 
former ntt officials 
the recruit figures were indicted on charges of offering bribes 
and the former ntt officials were accused of accepting bribes 
prosecutors suspect that in exchange for bribes ntt gave recruit 
special favors in the resale of usmade cray supercomputers and 
reduced rates on leased communications circuits news reports say 
the recruit scandal has shaken confidence in the government of 
prime minister noboru takeshita three members of his cabinet have 
resigned under fire for links to the recruit company 
a total of 10 people have now been arrested in the case on 
charges of bribery or violating securities and exchange laws five

of the real estate subsidiary recruitcosmos co at bargain prices 
to politicians their aides and other prominent figures through 
september 1986 
an estimated 160 people purchased the prelisted shares and were 
then able to reap large taxfree profits shortly after they were 
offered for overthecounter trading in october 1986 
shintos secretary reportedly made about 157000 and shinto 
earned about 71000 when the transaction was revealed in detail in 
december shinto said he had not known of it and that his secretary 
had controlled the account 
shinto had headed ntt since 1981 and oversaw its conversion to a 
private company during the administration of former prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone who was among politicians whose aides or 
relatives profited from transactions in the stocks

forget plastics the glow is off computers 
hazardous waste disposal is the hightech growth industry of the 
1990s 
so say some of the 500 environmental entrepreneurs executives 
and consultants who attended a twoday conference on how to profit 
from americas toxic waste problem 
two or three years ago if youd said youre having a hazardous 
waste business conference youd get very few people showing up 
said stephen l irish whose company extracts heavy metals from 
contaminated wastewater 
but it was standing room only at a session last week in the 
copley plaza hotels ornate ballroom 
the subject identifying market opportunities in the hazardous 
waste industry or as one person attending put it given that 
companies dont publicize their hazardous waste problems how do we 
identify potential customers 
other sessions covered how to comply with environmental 
regulations how to minimize legal liability surviving 
hypergrowth and preventing your employees from becoming your 
archrivals or how to protect toxic trade secrets 
the beverage served everywhere was mineral water 
hazardous waste processing will be a 5 billion industry this 
year and could hit 12 billion by 1994 said conference organizer 
richard s golob publisher of the weekly newsletter harzardous 
materials intelligence report 
theres no shortage of stuff to clean up the environmental 
protection agency has identified 30000 potentially hazardous sites 
of which 1000 qualify for superfund cleanup money according to 
golob other surveys have estimated that up to 430000 us 
manufacturing plants may have some kind of contamination 
and the department of energy has estimated that of managing 
disposing and cleaning up radioactive and hazardous contamination at 
its facilities could cost from 53 billion to 92 billion doe 
spokesman will callicott said 
the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals consumer products and even 
decaffeinated coffee produces hazardous waste 
as environmental regulations get stiffer companies that can deal 
with infectious waste radioactive contamination and dirty drinking 
water are in special demand 
irishs enterprise was born in 1988 from tougher state and 
federal groundwater regulations electroplating plants produce 
rinsewater that includes heavy metals including nickel lead and a 
carcinogenic chromium compound said irish director of marketing 
for unc reclamation a mulberry fla subsidiary of unc inc 
unc reclamation installs equipment that extracts metals from 
rinsewater irish said the residue is turned into metal salts that 
can be sold back to the electroplaters he said 
the service costs electroplaters less than disposing their 
metallic sludge in landfills and it eliminates their longterm 
legal liability irish said the process also ensures that no 
contaminants will leak from a landfill into groundwater 
clearly its the intent of congress to keep anything from going 
into the ground irish said reclamation is what they want 
unc reclamation generated a slight profit last year and sales are 
expected to hit 12 million this year he said the company plans to 
expand into cleaning up toxic sludge from batteries that have been 
dumped into some gainesville fla lagoons 
the environmental boom already has produced some hazardous waste 
millionaires golob said one hightech entrepreneur is alan s 
mckim who founded clean harbors inc of boston in 1980 at age 25 
the company said it now has nearly 1000 employees and had sales of 
73 million last year 
but the industry has to cope with more than its share of 
regulation and red tape said thomas moran vice president of 
dartamerica of freehold nj 
dartamerica transports toxic lowlevel nuclear and solid waste 
to approved disposal sites it is regulated by the epa the federal 
department of transportation and has an array of permits that allow 
it to truck waste in 48 states it takes three fulltime employees 
just to handle shipping permits moran said 
in new york pcbs are regulated and waste oil isnt in new 
jersey oil is regulated but pcbs arent moran said youre 
like a slave to 48 masters

the price of leaded gasoline jumped more than 
a penny per gallon during the past two weeks an analyst said 
the increase may signal a longexpected decision by dealers to 
pass on losses sustained by higher wholesale costs trilby lundberg 
said sunday 
its taken years but the differential is finally shrinking 
she said 
a march 3 nationwide survey of gasoline stations found the 
average cost of gasoline for all grades with taxes was 9922 cents 
per gallon up about a halfcent from feb 17 ms lundberg said 
for the same period leaded gasoline at selfservice stations 
rose 111 cents per gallon ms lundberg said 
the cost of making leaded gas has risen as environmental laws cut 
the amount of lead allowed forcing producers to use costlier 
substitutes and as older leaded gasusing cars were taken off the 
road she said 
selfservice prices on march 3 were 8887 cents per gallon for 
regular unleaded 10806 for premium unleaded and 8625 for regular 
leaded 
fullservice prices were 11857 for regular unleaded 13008 
for premium unleaded and 11479 for regular leaded

the soviet union said today it requires more 
scientific evidence that chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons are 
destroying the ozone layer before agreeing to a ban 
any decision should be wellgrounded and should have a firm 
scientific basis said vladimir zhakarov soviet delegate to a 
120nation conference on the ozone layer 
if any fears which some scientists have now are proved the 
soviet union will back any initiative or will initiate itself the 
reduction of cfcs he told reporters 
western scientists agree that the compounds used in 
refrigeration air conditioning aerosols and fastfood packaging 
are destroying the ozone shield that protects the earth from the 
suns cancercausing ultraviolet rays 
they say the compounds are responsible for creating an ozone hole 
roughly the size of the continental united states over the antarctic 
every winter 
an international team of scientists this winter also found 
evidence of ozone depletion over the arctic but said it couldnt 
yet prove a link in the region with the compounds 
zhakarov chairman of the soviet committee on ozone protection 
said soviet scientists have found evidence of a 25 percent ozone 
depletion over parts of europe and the western soviet union but he 
said it was due primarily to naturally occurring cyclones 
this process is cyclical and this cycle is 1015 days and it 
was observed in february and in january of this year he said 
the soviet union is one of 31 signatories to the 1987 montreal 
protocol which calls for halving production of the compounds by the 
end of the century six more agreed sunday to abide by its terms 
austria hungary malaysia athe philippines trinidad and zambia 
the united states and the european economic community have said 
they want to ban the chemicals by that time 
zhakarov said if there is proved scientific date that we should 
phase out those substances we will support this idea not all 
the countries support the appeal of the eec we must be very 
cautious here if we take a decision which is not well grounded we 
can interfere and destroy the economies of the developing 
countries 
liz cook ozone campaign chairman of the environmental group 
friends of the earthusa said the soviets have presented a fairly 
confusing position i think what theyd like to do is just buy 
themselves a little time before they have to commit to a policy 
the science is clearly there 
chinas delegate called for the establishment of an international 
fund to protect the ozone layer to be supported mainly by the 
industrialized countries 
liu ming pu chinas environmental commissioner said the 
industrialized countries had done most of the damage he said the 
developed world produced 80 percent of all the compounds while 
china produced less than 2 percent 
he also proposed that substitutes for the compounds be provided 
at no cost to developing countries 
no substitutes the compounds are available for sale but industry 
officials say they hope to have some on the market by the mid1990s 
the compounds can last 100 years but when they reach the 
stratosphere about 1525 miles above the earths surface they 
break apart and their chlorine atoms destroy ozone 
the compounds also trap heat and warm the earths surface a 
process known as the greenhouse effect which could cause major 
climate changes

the supreme court in a case stemming from 
delta air lines takeover of western air lines today refused to let 
delta force the retirement of a group of flight engineers over age 
60 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that delta is 
bound by an agebias lawsuit the flight engineers won against 
western 
a federal judge in california ordered western in 1981 to abandon 
its mandatory retirement age of 60 for flight engineers the judge 
also permitted pilots to bid for flight engineer jobs when they 
approached 60 the retirement age for pilots 
that ruling stemmed from a suit by 15 flight engineers who 
accused western of violating the federal age discrimination in 
employment act aimed at protecting older workers 
their victory was upheld in 1985 by the supreme court in a ruling 
that set guidelines for enforcing the federal law 
when delta merged with western in 1987 it sought to force the 
retirement of the 15 unless they agreed to take onground jobs 
delta said its offer was in line with its policy barring captains 
and copilots over 60 from becoming flight engineers 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled last october that 
delta is bound by the 1981 court order enforcing the flight 
engineers victory against western 
delta may be free to execute its own policies to other 
employees but it is not free to abrogate westerns obligations 
to the former western employees the appeals court said there 
is a continuity of operations between the merged airlines delta had 
notice of westerns obligations and delta has the ability to provide 
relief 
some of the 15 have retired voluntarily 
the case is delta vs criswell 881138

the supreme court today turned down the 
freespeech arguments of a financial magazine accused of violating 
an antitouting provision of federal securities law 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that could force 
the stock market magazine to tell readers whether companies featured 
in its articles bought advertising space or paid the magazine for 
other services 
the magazine aimed primarily at small investors is published 10 
times a year in yonkers ny by angelo martinelli that citys 
former mayor each issue contains general financial news and seven 
or eight articles on specific companies as investment prospects 
according to the us circuit court of appeals here the articles 
describe the featured companies in unabashedly glowing terms and 
never contain a negative report or even mild skepticism 
the securities and exchange commission sued the magazine in 1982 
alleging that it violated securities law by failing to disclose 
consideration received from those companies described in its 
feature articles 
the suit said such considerations included the purchase of 
advertising space in the magazine and the purchase from the 
publisher of article reprints the commission sought a court order 
forcing the magazine to tell readers about considerations received 
in connection with all future articles 
us district judge aubrey robinson jr of washington threw out 
the civil suit in 1986 he said any order forcing such disclosure 
would be a prior restraint on publication violating the 
magazines freepress rights 
the judge said however the sec was free to criminally prosecute 
the magazine for alleged willful violations of the antitouting 
provisions 
the commission appealed and the appeals court last june 21 
reinstated the civil suit 
the prior restraint doctrine is not precisely applicable to the 
requested relief in this case the appeals court ruled orders 
that are carefully focused address a continuing course of speech 
and are imposed after an opportunity for full merits consideration 
are not properly analyzed as prior restraints 
the appeals court sent the case back to the trial court for a 
determination whether the antitouting provision was violated 
the magazine then sought supreme court review it said the 
appeals court ruling wrongly would allow the sec to dictate a 
significant element of the content of the articles it publishes 
under threat of contempt 
justice department lawyers urged the high court to reject the 
magazines appeal as premature 
the decision of the court of appeals does not determine 
that the magazine has or has not violated the antitouting 
provision or establish what the terms of any injunction prohibiting 
future violations of that provision may be the government said 
the case is wall street publishing institute vs sec 88982

airlines and bus companies braced for a heavierthanusual 
passenger load today as the eastern airlines strike continued into 
its third day with no signs of a settlement 
meanwhile worried commuters nationwide breathed sighs of relief 
after a federal judge blocked sympathy walkouts by railroad workers 
and striking eastern machinists called off plans to picket about a 
dozen commuter rail stations 
the eastern strike began saturday with a walkout by 8500 
mechanics baggage handlers and ground crew over demands for wage 
concessions most of easterns pilots and flight attendants have 
honored picket lines virtually shutting down the carrier 
only about 9 percent of easterns 1000 daily flights took off 
sunday according to eastern spokesman robin matell 
the sharp cuts in operations have stranded thousands of easterns 
usual 100000 daily passengers at airports nationwide and have left 
other airlines scrambling to accommodate those travelers 
pan american world airways said its alreadybusy shuttle doubled 
its normal rush hour schedule from washington new york and boston 
today 
the shuttle which usually flies once an hour from each city 
planned to fly every half hour today except for the slow hours 
between 1030 am and 230 pm said spokeswoman pamela hanlon 
she said pan am also planned to substitute 250seat airbus planes 
for 150seat boeing 727s on some flights between new york and boston 
the airline carried twice its usual weekend load of 3000 
passengers on the shuttle over the weekend also with a doubled 
schedule it expected 10000 passengers today double the weekday 
norm hanlon said 
easterns sister company houstonbased continental airlines 
which is also owned by texas air corp has added some extra 
sections to already existing flights where there has been market 
demand primarily newark nj to florida according to spokesman 
art kent 
kent said that pickets have not gone up against continental and 
that the strike was not having any effect on its operations 
in dallas greyhound lines inc said extra buses were standing by 
at several east coast cities today prepared for heavierthanusual 
traffic 
greyhound said it added 200 buses and 32 express routes 
connecting new york boston providence ri washington and 
philadelphia in anticipation of a heavier demand for bus travel 
were not like airlines we dont sell out of seats said 
spokeswoman elizabeth hale we just keep adding buses and sending 
them out 
hale said greyhound should be able to maintain ontime 
expectations now that the commuter rails are open 
on sunday us district judge robert patterson signed a 
temporary restraining order in new york blocking rail workers from 
sympathy strikes to support striking eastern employees 
the machinists had planned to mount secondary picket lines at 
commuter railroads today and rail union leaders had said they would 
honor them 
the machinists promised to file an emergency appeal today 
pattersons order will last until 3 pm wednesday when he will 
conduct a hearing to determine if he should issue a temporary 
injunction

the supreme court today refused to let 
tennessee officials impose a retirement age of 55 for officers who 
enforce state wildlife laws 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the state 
failed to show that physical fitness and a healthy heart are 
necessary to do the job 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals last october struck down 
the mandatory retirement age for officers of the tennessee wildlife 
resources agency the officers duties include investigating 
violations of hunting and fishing laws and arresting suspects 
the appeals court said the age limit violates the federal age 
discrimination in employment act aimed at protecting the rights of 
older workers 
tennessee officials said wildlife officers also are responsible 
for rescuing boaters and water skiers work long hours in bad 
weather and face lifethreatening situations 
the strenuous nature of the job is too demanding for those 55 and 
older the state officials said because older officers are more 
likely to be unfit and suffer from heart disease 
but the 6th circuit court said the state undermined its case by 
not requiring physical fitness tests or heart examinations for any 
officers and by permitting some officers to stay on past age 55 due 
to economic hardship or political pressure 
such waivers of the mandatory retirement age were granted 
without any determinations as to job performance physical ability 
or physical fitness the appeals court said therefore it said 
tennessee has not treated physical and coronary fitness as 
reasonably necessary to the position of wildlife officer 
the supreme court in 1985 said the federal agebias law requires 
employers to show that employee qualifications such as physical 
fitness are reasonably necessary to carry out the employers work 
the court also said in that ruling that an employer must show 
that workers over a certain age lack such qualifications or that it 
is impractical to test the workers individually to determine whether 
they are so qualified 
justice department lawyers representing the federal equal 
employment opportunity commission in the case said the tennessee 
dispute has limited application 
there are only about a dozen similar cases in which states or 
cities allegedly have violated the federal age discrimination law 
the government lawyers said 
they also noted that congress amended the law in 1986 to make it 
easier for states and cities to impose mandatory retirement ages for 
firefighters and law enforcement officers 
the case is tennessee wildlife resources agency vs eeoc 881100

the number of working oil and gas rigs increased 
by four this week to total 761 continuing a seesaw trend that saw a 
slight boost with the addition of 20 texas rigs baker hughes inc 
reported 
the count dropped by nine last week to total 757 following an 
increase of 20 rigs in the previous week baker hughes said monday 
a year ago the rig count was 978 
the rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling 
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for 
oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
among major oil producing states only three saw increases this 
week including texas with 20 additional rigs california seven 
and michigan two 
oklahoma saw the biggest decline with five fewer rigs followed 
by kansas and ohio two each and louisiana new mexico and

the supreme court today refused to revive 
lawsuits by johnsmanville corp that sought government 
reimbursement for more than 35 million paid or owed to shipyard 
workers suffering from asbestosrelated diseases and injuries 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that threw the 
suits by johnsmanville out of a federal claims court 
thousands of workers exposed to products containing asbestos made 
by johnsmanville have sued the company 
many of the workers were employed at governmentowned shipyards 
others at privately owned shipyards that built or repaired ships for 
the government many of the claims date back to world war ii 
johnsmanville sought reimbursement from the government 
contending that federal officials negligently approved use of 
asbestos in shipbuilding the company also accused the government of 
failing to protect and warn workers about the hazards of exposure to 
asbestos 
the corporation filed suits in the us court of claims a court 
here that handles various claims against the federal government 
the claims court threw out the suits and a federal appeals court 
upheld the dismissal 
the appeals court said johnsmanville is barred from seeking 
reimbursement in the us court of claims because the corporation 
also sued the government in a federal district court in another 
asbestosrelated matter 
the related case sought reimbursement for 45000 johnsmanville 
paid a worker injured by asbestos exposure after 1963 
the appeals court said the fact that the cases stem from asbestos 
exposure some 20 years apart does not permit johnsmanville to seek 
recovery in the claims court while also seeking reimbursement in 
federal district court for a similar claim 
the case is johnsmanville vs us 881052

a michigan law that required 7 percent of all 
state contracts be awarded to minorityowned businesses and 5 
percent to businesses owned by women was unconstitutional the 
supreme court ruled today 
the justices without issuing any written opinion upheld a 
federal appeals courts invalidation of the law 
in a jan 23 decision the high court itself struck down a 
similar affirmative action plan that set aside 30 percent of all 
city construction contracts in richmond va for minorityowned 
businesses 
in that ruling the justices made it far more difficult for local 
governments and by extension state governments to impose strict 
racial quotas as part of affirmative action plans 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals said the michigan program 
enacted in 1980 was unlawful because there was inadequate evidence 
of past discrimination by the state against minorities and women 
state officials have relied upon certain conclusory historical 
resumes of unrelated legislative enactments and proposed enactments 
executive reports and a statefunded private study conducted in 
1974 the appeals court said this documentation is not 
reflective of discriminatory action by the state of michigan 
the appeals court said there was little if any probative 
evidence of discrimination against minority groups and it said 
evidence of discrimination against women is nonexistent 
the minority groups covered by the program are blacks hispanics 
orientals eskimos and american indians 
state officials said the quota figures were based on the 
percentage of businesses in the state owned by minorities and women 
the setasides were challenged by various contractors doing 
business with the state led by the michigan road builders 
association 
the supreme court in 1980 upheld a federal law that set aside 10 
percent of federal contracts for minority owned businesses

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by a 
group of rural electric cooperatives challenging the authority of 
colorado officials to restructure rates charged to customers 
the court citing the lack of a properly presented federal 
question let stand a ruling supported by major oil companies that 
buy power from the cooperative group 
the colorado supreme court ruled last july that the states 
public utility commission acted properly when it ordered the 
coloradoute electric association to redesign its rates 
the association comprised of 14 rural electric cooperatives had 
been charging what is known as a flat rate one not taking into 
account the differences between fixed capital costs and variable 
energy costs that fluctuate depending on fuel needs and costs 
the utility commission ordered the cooperative association to 
adopt a pricing setup that reflects separate charges for capital and 
energy costs and varies according to seasonal demands of customers 
the associations power needs generally are greater in winter 
supporting the change ordered by the state officials were shell 
oil co exxon atlantic richfield and union carbide corp 
the state supreme court said the public utility commission had 
adequate grounds to order the cooperative association to restructure 
its rates because the old system resulted in an uneconomic 
underutilitization of capacity 
rates charged should accurately reflect the utilitys actual 
cost of providing service including both capital costs and 
operating expenses the state court said 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the cooperative 
association also argued that its constitutional rights were violated 
because the public utility commission based its findings in part on 
a key computer analysis that the association was barred from 
challenging adequately 
the cooperatives said the they did not have an opportunity to 
examine the computer program and supporting documents 
the coops also said the state regulators interfered with the 
power of the rural electrification administration a federal agency 
to regulate the cooperative utilities 
coloradoute electric association has 14 members one member 
empire electric association opposed the appeal by the other 13

the supreme court said today federal workers do 
not have a right to sue in federal court when they accuse the union 
representing them of unfair treatment 
the justices voting 90 ruled that the only recourse for the 
employees in such cases is to file an unfair labor practice charge 
with the federal labor relations authority 
justice byron r white writing for the court said the federal 
civil service reform act of 1978 does not provide a private cause 
of action to enforce federal employees unions duty of fair 
representation 
the court ruled against efthinios karahalios a greek language 
instructor at the defense language institute in monterey calif 
karahalios had worked for the institute for nearly 20 years when 
in 1976 he was promoted to the higherpaying position of course 
developer 
greek language instructor simon kuntelos objected to the 
promotion and filed a grievance with the national federation of 
federal employees which represents the institutes workers 
karahalios is not a member of the union but it represents him in 
collective bargaining kuntelos is a union member 
the union decided to arbitrate kuntelos grievance without 
telling karahalios about it after a hearing not attended by 
karahalios an arbitrator cleared the way for kuntelos in effect 
to get karahalios job 
karahalios objected to his demotion but the union refused to 
arbitrate in his behalf 
he filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the federal 
labor relations authority but the union and flra settled the case 
when the union agreed to state it would not undertake similar acts 
in the future 
karahalios then filed a federal court suit against the union 
a federal judge said the union breached its duty to give 
karahalios fair representation and ordered the union to pay his 
lawyer fees the 9th us circuit court of appeals overturned the 
ruling and threw out the suit 
in upholding the appeals court decision white said today that 
federal workers do not have the same relationship to unions as 
privately employed workers 
the court enforcement procedures for private 
collectivebargaining contracts do not apply to federal employees 
covered by the civil service act white said 
the case is karahalios vs national federation of federal 
employees 87636

the supreme court today said a contract dispute 
between stanford university and a computer firm should be settled in 
state court not in arbitration 
the courts 62 decision is a victory for stanford and a setback 
for volt information sciences inc which had asked the justices to 
compel arbitration 
writing for the court chief justice william h rehnquist said 
california not federal law governs the case 
the dispute developed when volt submitted a claim for additional 
compensation for extra work it said it performed installing a system 
of electrical conduits connecting computer facilities on the 
university campus in palo alto calif 
the contract signed by stanford and volt contained a provision 
that any dispute would be submitted to binding arbitration the 
contract also specified in typical contractual language that the 
pact would be governed by the law of the place where the project 
is located 
when volt demanded that its claim for additional compensation be 
arbitrated stanford sued in state court its suit alleged breach of 
contract against volt and two other companies with whom stanford did 
not have arbitration agreements 
california courts ruled that the contract dispute should be 
resolved in state court and not in arbitration because of a state 
law allowing arbitration to be postponed pending lawsuits involving 
third parties not bound by the arbitration 
in seeking supreme court review lawyers for volt said the 
company was being deprived of its arbitration rights under the 
federal arbitration act 
but rehnquist wrote today that such rights are not absolute and 
may be overridden by agreements to let state law govern 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall dissented and 
justice sandra day oconnor did not participate in the case

the pan am shuttle doubled its normal rush hour 
schedule from washington new york and boston today in the wake of a 
strike at its competitor eastern airlines 
eastern however had crews available and was operating its 
shuttle today said spokesman tim cook four out of eight scheduled 
eastern shuttle flights left by 10 am two to boston and two to 
washington and the others were canceled because of snow not the 
strike he said 
eastern also got off one nonshuttle flight to miami from 
laguardia airport this morning cook said eastern was not operating 
from the other new yorkarea airports john f kennedy international 
and newark international 
the shuttle crews were made up of a combination of union 
employees who crossed picket lines and airline managers pressed into 
duty cook said he said he did not know how many passengers were on 
the eastern shuttle flights the man who usually tracked such 
figures was out throwing bags 
the pan am shuttle which normally flies once an hour from each 
city was scheduled to fly every half hour today except for the 
slow hours between 1030 am and 230 pm said spokeswoman pamela 
hanlon 
pan am also planned to substitute 250seat airbus planes for 
150seat boeing 727s on some flights between new york and boston

the supreme court today reinstated a challenge 
to a miami affirmative action plan requiring 5 percent participation 
of businesses owned by women or minorities in building a rail 
transit system 
the justices by a 54 vote ordered a lower court to reconsider 
its dismissal of the challenge in light of their jan 23 decision 
striking down a similar affirmative action set aside program in 
richmond va 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall harry a blackmun 
and john paul stevens voted to leave intact the miami affirmative 
action plan 
the richmond plan required that 30 percent of all public works 
contracts go to minorityowned businesses 
the miami plan was challenged by a construction company that 
submitted the lowest bid on the project but was rejected for lack of 
minority participation 
the project involved construction of an electrified third rail 
for the citys transit system which is run by metropolitan dade 
county officials the construction is financed with 80 percent 
federal funds 
dade county awarded the contract in 1979 to transit products 
inc which submitted the second lowest bid of 837 million the 
low bid 808 million was submitted by hk porter company inc 
county officials required that 5 percent of the work be farmed 
out to minority subcontractors unless the main contractor could show 
it made every reasonable effort but failed to get minority 
participation 
porter said it was unable to arrange minority participation 
the corporation said it has a plant in chicago that would 
assemble the electrified third rail and that only four items from 
outside sources would be needed to complete the project the firm 
said no minority firms produced any of those items 
after its bid was rejected the company sued for 15 million in 
damages the firm said the dade county setaside plan is a form of 
reverse discrimination that violates its constitutional rights 
a federal judge threw out the porter lawsuit and the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals upheld that ruling 
the appeals court citing key supreme court rulings on 
affirmative action said the miami plan is justified by a federal 
law mandating minority participation in federally financed public 
works projects 
congress in 1978 passed the surface transportation assistance act 
appropriating money for highways and mass transit the law without 
setting specific percentages called for participation of minority 
business enterprises to alleviate past discrimination against women 
blacks hispanics and other minorities 
the 11th circuit court said dade county was not 
constitutionally required to make additional findings of past 
discrimination regarding the awarding of this contract congress was 
concerned about a national problem its findings provide adequate 
support for such local projects 
the appeals court conceded it was troubled by a lack of evidence 
to support the 5 percent figure for the miami project but the 
appeals court said the supreme court had upheld higher percentages 
for minority participation 
the appeals court also noted that porter failed to show it made 
every reasonable effort to get minority participation from 
subcontractors to support its bid 
in urging the justices to reject porters appeal dade county 
officials noted that the federal regulations at issue in the case 
acted on today were amended by a 1982 law 
the new law changes the concept of minorityowned businesses to 
require 10 percent participation in federally supported projected of 
small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals

the supreme court today enhanced the power of 
states to regulate natural gas production including 
useitorloseit rules designed to stimulate production 
the justices unanimously upheld the authority of kansas officials 
to control production from what is believed to be the largest 
natural gas reservoir in the world 
the decision upheld regulations adopted by the kansas corporation 
commission 
at issue was gas from the hugoton field which extends across 
portions of kansas oklahoma and texas about twothirds of the 
field is in kansas containing some 4000 wells as of 1983 most of 
the gas is carried outside the state through pipelines 
the kansas corporation commission since 1944 imposed regulations 
aimed at assuring that each well will ultimately produce about the 
amount of gas underlying the land held by each leaseholder 
the idea was to treat well owners equally since gas can migrate 
underground from an unproducing area to a well that is overproducing 
to assure equal treatment the state fixed the maximum amount of 
gas that can be produced each month from each well 
in practice wells cannot always be operated to meet monthly 
ceilings for varying reasons for example there may be a low demand 
in a given month 
to allow for these variables state officials permitted owners of 
underproducing wells to save up their production ceilings 
creating what are called underages and overproduce in future 
months to make up for the shortfalls 
to create a production incentive the kansas commission changed 
the rules in 1983 by declaring that underages must be used within 
specified periods of years or they would be cancelled 
the useitorloseit policy was challenged by northwest central 
pipeline corp one of the major buyers of the hugoton gas for 
transport outside kansas 
northwest central said the 1983 rule change prevents it from 
purchasing gas reserves that it is entitled to contractually 
the pipeline company asked the supreme court to strike down the 
1983 regulations on grounds that the federal energency regulatory 
commission has exclusive authority over natural gas production 
northwest central also argued that the regulations impermissibly 
interfered with interstate commerce 
writing for the court today justice william j brennan said the 
kansas regulations are neither preempted by federal law nor 
unconstitutional 
we must decide whether a regulation to govern the timing of 
production of natural gas from the kansashugoton field violates 
either the constitutional clause giving federal law supremacy over 
conflicting state laws or the commerce clause brennan said we 
hold that it does not 
the justices ruled in 1986 that states may not require interstate 
pipelines to buy gas from all owners of a common gas pool when the 
pipeline had preexisting contracts with only some of the owners 
but reagan administration lawyers had told the high court that 
the kansas controversy should not be controlled by the 1986 ruling 
the case is northwest central pipeline corp vs state 
corporation commission of kansas 861856

eastern airlines president phil bakes birthday 
horoscope on monday promised youll be on more solid 
emotionalfinancial ground in april 
but bakes 43 didnt get the present he hoped for a return of 
easterns pilots to work without the pilots who are supporting a 
strike by the airlines machinists union the airlines chances of 
survival by april are considered low 
bakes in pleading sunday for the pilots to cross the machinists 
picket lines declined to speculate how long eastern could survive 
but said the economics are clear he also referred to 
speculation about consequences such as bankruptcy that could stem 
from a prolonged strike at eastern which is 25 billion in debt 
and says it is losing 1 million a day 
since becoming eastern president 2 years ago bakes has talked 
of plans to pull the carrier out of its 10year financial tailspin 
make it grow and make it profitable 
but union leaders call bakes one of the continental crew the 
executive team that helped texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo 
turn continental airlines into a cheaplabor predominantly 
nonunion company texas air bought eastern three years ago 
lorenzo and his unionbuster image have galvanized eastern 
workers who believe his priorities are attacking organized labor and 
milking cash out of eastern 
what were seeing here is a remake of the continental movie 
pilots union spokesman ron cole said sunday after bakes made a 
televised plea for pilots to cross machinists union picket lines 
youve got the same players and frank lorenzo as the script writer 
and director but this time the first act has been different 
in 1983 pilots crossed machinists picket lines at continental 
but both unions later had their contracts voided when the parent 
texas air took continental into bankruptcy reorganization 
bakes said he was somewhat surprised and had miscalculated 
the extent to which eastern pilots would support the machinists 
easterns strike contingency plans had counted upon the pilots to 
follow tradition and not support the machinists or for many of the 
pilots to defy their union leadership and cross the picket line 
the tall lean longdistance runner with bright piercing blue 
eyes was born in little rock ark and graduated with honors from 
loyola university of chicago and harvard law school 
bakes served as an assistant prosecutor in the watergate 
investigation was a counsel for senate subcommittes and then the 
civil aeronautics board and then after the airline industry was 
deregulated joined texas air as a vice president 
in 1982 bakes became executive vice president at continental and 
the carriers president and chief operating officer in 1984 there 
he helped continental return from bankruptcy reorganization as a 
lowcost aggressive airline 
bakes joined eastern as its chief executive in october 1986 and 
in january 1987 unveiled a plan to turn the airline around with a 
sixpoint program that included marketing expansions and 490 
million in labor cost cuts he has promised eastern which has 
shrunk steadily under texas air will grow again if its labor costs 
can be cut 
bakes said he inherited a tense labor situation that predated 
lorenzo himself and chief eastern negotiator tom matthews 
eastern airlines is a company thats lost 15 billion since 
deregulation frank lorenzo as chairman of texas airowner of 
eastern airlines has only been involved for three years 
what weve tried to do is say give it a chance we will put 
contractual guarantees that perhaps will get over the initial 
distrust 
with a successful company when were growing buying 
airplanes refurbishing trust will come bakes said

paraguay has reapplied to join the 96nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade the main pact setting rules 
for world trade a gatt source said monday 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said a paraguyan 
delegate brought his nations bid to a regular meeting monday of 
gatts governing council which is open to all members 
after the overthrow of longtime military strongman alfredo 
stroessner last month paraguays new government had notified the 
gatt administration that it wants to pursue its bid to join which 
it abandoned in 1974 
gatt has agreed to consider the request the source said 
reaching a decision seems likely to take months if not years 
asked whether the timing of the bid was related to the new 
governments coming to power the gatt source said only that 
paraguay already had indicated renewed interest in joining for about 
a year 
gatt is an agreement promoting free trade and also a forum for 
negotiations and resolution of trade disputes gatt sets mutual 
privileges and obligations an attempt at expanding their scope 
aimed at further freeing global commerce is currently underway in a 
fouryear round of world trade talks due to wind up in 1990

on reviewing the monthly housing statistics you 
might think that one of todays most popular participant activities 
is moving preparing to move or thinking about moving 
it isnt quite true it is true nevertheless that real estate and 
housing markets have been particularly busy in recent months and 
years in spite of foreboding by economists and despite rising 
prices and interest rates 
january housing starts soared to 169 million units 170000 
units higher than in december 1988 and 310000 thousand higher than 
in december 1987 singlefamily resales last year reached 363 
million units the highest since 1978 
but while such statistics are impressive and to some extent 
unexpected there is an aspect of the housing market that is even 
more active remodeling that is seems to have become the national 
pastime 
while final figures arent in the national association of home 
builders already has declared that remodeling and fixup 
expenditures last year exceeded 100 billion for the first time 
double the amount spent five years earlier 
while the exact amount for the year hasnt been determined it is 
known that in the first three quarters the annual rate was better 
than 102 billion and that preliminary indications were for a strong 
fourth quarter 
the spending rise has been what economists tend to call 
dramatic after varying between about 45 billion and 49 
billion in the four years from 1980 through 1983 the total soared 
to 698 billion in 1984 
it has risen without interruption since then to 803 billion in 
1985 912 billion in 1986 and 941 billion in 1987 
even when adjusted for inflation says kenneth klein a tulsa 
remodeler and chairman of the nahb remodelers council this huge 
increase makes the remodeling industry the fastest growing sector 
of the construction industry 
whether growth will continue is questionable because almost all 
segments of housing markets are cyclical the nahb expects growth of 
four to six percent for the next three to five years or little more 
than the inflation rate 
some nonhousing people wouldnt be surprised however to see 
the trend continue especially if the cost of new housing continues 
to rise they point to these factors as contributing to the 
remodeling and repair statistics 
the rising cost of housing which often makes it more 
advantageous to remodel than move new houses often absorb all of 
the old equity remodeling may leave some for other purposes 
the desire to remain in mature communities with good schools and 
desirable amenities rather than moving to new communities with 
prospects of higher taxes for new schools and municipal improvements 
equity growth and growing access to that equity through 
taxadvantaged loans 
convenience as well as savings anyone who has moved recently 
knows it can be costly for moving expenses setup costs lawyers 
new mortgages and the points that accompany them 
there may be inconvenience in either instance moving or 
remodeling but in remodeling you can at least stay put amid the 
noise confusion and dirt 
according to an nahb survey the top remodeling activities in 
1987 were room additions which accounted for 255 percent of all 
remodeling and kitchen remodeling 202 percent complete 
rehabilitation accounted for 79 percent 
as many homeowners might guess the major expenditures by type of 
work were painting plumbing and roofing with heating and central 
air conditioning not far behind luxuries such as swimming pools 
were far down the list

the opec nations produced about 194 
million barrels of oil a day in february less than in the previous 
month but still above their new production goal according to fresh 
estimates released monday 
the international energy agency said in its monthly oil market 
report that estimated production by the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries dipped last month from 202 million 
barrels a day in january 
the oilproducing nations agreed in november to slash output 
starting jan 1 to try to boost prices to 18 a barrel 
since then analysts say the oil nations have reduced the crude 
flow to meet their ceiling or quota of 185 million barrels a day 
in the first six months of the year 
the slowdown in output has boosted prices about 5 since last 
november the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by opec 
was 1631 a barrel last week 
independent oilproducing nations have also agreed to lower their 
exports in the apriljune quarter in an effort to kick up prices 
further as part of that drive the soviet union on friday announced 
it would cut its exports by about 5 percent in the first half of the 
year 
the soviet union the worlds largest crude oil producer said 
monday the export reduction would amount to 100000 barrels a day 
and was an effort to cooperate closely with opec to stabilize world 
oil prices 
the soviet union sells foreign clients an estimated 18 million 
barrels of oil a day 
the international energy agencys report estimated the world oil 
supply at 496 million barrels a day in february off 900000 
barrels from january 
the reduction it said is due primarily to lower 
production in several middle eastern countries as well as a slight 
production decline in the organization for economic cooperation and 
development the oecd is an organization of about twodozen 
industrialized nations 
oil output in those nations it said was estimated at 162 
million barrels a day in february down 100000 barrels from january 
the report also said strong economic growth especially in japan 
helped lift oil consumption in the industrialized nations to 388 
million barrels a day in the octoberdecember quarter of 1988 up 
about 5 percent from yearearlier levels 
heavy fuel oil consumption increased in all regions mainly 
because of higher demand by electric utilities the report said 
in north america there was considerable switching from natural 
gas partly because of competitively priced fuel oil 
oil consumption in north america it said was 197 million 
barrels a day in the fourth quarter of last year a gain of about 
45 percent from the same period of 1987 european consumption it 
said advanced about 35 percent in the last three months of 1988 
the report estimated that oil consumption in the industrialized 
nations would rise about 16 percent in the first quarter of this 
year 
january consumption growth was quite strong but appeared to 
slow in february it said 
according to the agencys supply estimates only iran ecuador 
and the united arab emirates appeared to be producing in february 
above the levels set for individual opec countries last november 
irans output was estimated at 27 million barrels a day in 
february compared with its quota of 26 million barrels 
the united arab emirates produced about 16 million barrels a 
day well above its target of 988000 barrels ecuador was measured 
at roughly 300000 barrels a day compared with its quota of 230000 
barrels 
saudi arabia the worlds largest crude exporter produced an 
estimated 45 million barrels a day in february the same as its 
quota its daily output was roughly 48 million barrels in january 
opec released figures late last month that showed member 
countries complying in january with the new output accord it said a 
dozen of its members supplied a total of 1742 million barrels a day 
in january just under the combined quota for those countries of 
1751 million barrels 
opec said it measures a nations quota by figuring crude 
production and the amount of oil put into or drawn out of stocks 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

since coming to eastern airlines as president 2 
years ago phil bakes has insisted he has firm plans to pull the 
carrier out of its 10year financial tailspin 
the crippling strike that continued in its third day today 
indicates his employees dont really believe him 
instead union leaders call bakes one of the continental 
crew the executive team that helped texas air corp chairman 
frank lorenzo turn continental airlines into a cheaplabor 
predominantly nonunion company 
its lorenzo and his unionbuster image that has galvanized 
easterns workers who believe his priorites are attacking organized 
labor and milking cash out of eastern 
by all the actions theyve already taken its clear where hes 
taking the airline pilots union spokesman ron cole said sunday 
after bakes made a nationally televised plea for pilots to cross 
machinists union picket lines and return to work he bakes is 
trying to deflect the issue away from frank lorenzo 
what were seeing here is a remake of the continental movie 
youve got the same players and frank lorenzo as the script writer 
and director cole said but this time the first act has been 
different 
cole referred to 1983 when pilots crossed machinists picket lines 
at continental only to join the machinists in having their 
contracts voided when the parent texas air took the carrier into 
bankruptcy reorganization 
bakes admitted sunday he was somewhat surprised and had 
miscalculated the extent to which pilots would support the 
machinists easterns contingency plans had counted on pilots 
crossing the picket lines 
if the pilots had come to work friday night id be at the 
miami grand prix this afternoon and youd all be home with your 
families bakes told reporters 
this morning bakes accused the pilots of misleading the airline 
and later in the day the airline dropped the other shoe by filing 
suit against the pilots saying the work stoppage was illegal 
the pilots have been saying over the last year that if the 
machinists did strike they would come to work thats why we were 
so surprised bakes said today on cbs this morning 
this is the pilots strike that really shouldnt have been 
added bakes 
eastern filed the request for a restraining order to halt the 
strike with a federal judge in miami who did not immediately 
schedule a hearing 
the tall lean longdistance runner with bright piercing blue 
eyes turned 43 today a newspaper horoscope for those with birthdays 
today promises youll be on more solid emotionalfinancial ground 
in april 
however bakes is unlikely to reach that ground with eastern if 
the strike doesnt end soon 
he declined to speculate on how long eastern could stay alive 
but said the economics are clear he referred to speculation 
about the consequences of a prolonged strike which include 
bankruptcy bakes said sunday the company is keeping up its payments 
on nearly 25 billion in debts 
philip j bakes a little rock ark native graduated with 
honors from loyola university of chicago and harvard law school

bakes agreed that trust is an issue 
we would hope that over time there will be much more trust 
among all the eastern people he said adding that he inherited a

slightly last month to 530 from 532 the february level was the 
lowest for the index since february 1987 when it was 526 percent 
despite the drop the index still pointed to economic growth a 
reading above 50 generally indicates the economy is expanding while 
below 50 it is contracting the index has exceeded 50 for 31 
consecutive months 
the economy appears to have entered a period of slower and more 
moderate growth than the robust pace of last year said robert j 
bretz association chairman and director of materials management at 
pitney bowes inc 
this coupled with a decreased employment and a declining

percent from 562 percent in january the february level was its 
lowest since 530 percent in december 1986 
vendor deliveries continued to grow but their change came at a 
slower pace slow vendor deliveries are a bullish economic signal 
they indicate a business is getting new orders faster than it can 
fill them 
sixteen percent of the respondents said deliveries were slower 
while 74 percent said they were the same and 10 percent said they 
were faster in january 15 percent reported slower deliveries 
while 79 percent said they were the same and 6 percent said they 
were faster

while 57 percent said they were the same and 5 percent said they 
were lower in january 51 percent reported higher prices while 46 
percent said they were the same and 3 percent said they lower 
employment declined in february after eight consecutive months of 
increasing according to the survey

up at their companies 72 percent said it was the same and 15 
percent said it was down the previous month 10 percent reported

colored plastic wrap introduced monday by 
reynolds metals co will make the mundane task of wrapping 
leftovers fun the company says 
skeptical 
reynolds says consumers responded with even more enthusiasm than 
expected when the company tried out the red green blue and yellow 
plastic wrap in focus groups and simulated test markets 
the addition of color gives an emotional appeal to plastic 
wrap which in its clear form is considered purely a functional 
product said jane d nims of reynolds consumer products 
division adding color to plastic wrap makes a useful product 
exciting 
the new product called crystal color plastic wrap is 
intended to liven up the kitchen make things more 
interesting said spokeswoman anne f waring 
marabel morgan author of the total woman and proponent of 
the idea that women spice up their marriages by greeting their 
husbands at the door wearing only plastic wrap says the colored 
wrap is a great idea it would really add a lot of zip she said 
sunday in a telephone interview from her home in miami 
the richmondbased company will promote use of the colored wrap 
in crafts as well as food storage ms waring said reynolds will 
have several special promotions around the holidays for the product 
which is manufactured at its plant in grottoes va 
the colored wrap is unlikely to have a significant impact on the 
companys sales reynolds analysts said 
its a tempest in a teapot said william g siedenburg of 
smith barney harris upham amp co in new york reynolds is 
principally and always will be an aluminum producer 
does it matter what color you use to wrap the meat you didnt 
finish at dinner he added 
but michael via of anderson amp strudwick inc in richmond said the 
innovation is part of the companys movement away from aluminum 
which has a cyclical market toward plastic products and consumer 
packaging which have higher profit margins 
in 1988 reynolds reported a record net income of 482 million 
or 835 per share on revenues of 56 billion 
ms waring said the consumer products division accounts for 10 
percent of reynolds sales

the supreme court monday enhanced the power of states to regulate 
natural gas production including useitorloseit rules 
designed to stimulate production 
the justices unanimously upheld the authority of kansas officials 
to control production from what is believed to be the largest 
natural gas reservoir in the world 
the decision upheld regulations adopted by the kansas corporation 
commission 
at issue was gas from the hugoton field which extends across 
portions of kansas oklahoma and texas about twothirds of the 
field is in kansas containing some 4000 wells as of 1983 most of 
the gas is carried outside the state through pipelines 
the useitorloseit policy was challenged by northwest central 
pipeline corp one of the major buyers of the hugoton gas for 
transport outside kansas 
northwest central said the 1983 rule change prevents it from 
purchasing gas reserves that it is entitled to contractually 
the pipeline company asked the supreme court to strike down the 
1983 regulations on grounds that the federal emergency regulatory 
commission has exclusive authority over natural gas production 
northwest central also argued that the regulations impermissibly 
interfered with interstate commerce 
writing for the court justice william j brennan said the kansas 
regulations are neither preempted by federal law nor 
unconstitutional 
in other action the court 
rejected an appeal by northeastern states seeking to force the 
federal government to crack down on acid rain and other pollution 
they say is caused by smokestacks in other states 
decided federal workers do not have a right to sue in federal 
court when they accuse the union representing them of unfair 
treatment the justices voting 90 ruled that the only recourse 
for the employees in such cases is to file an unfair labor practice 
charge with the federal labor relations authority 
in a case stemming from delta air lines takeover of western air 
lines refused to let delta force the retirement of a group of 
flight engineers over age 60 the justices without comment let 
stand a ruling that delta is bound by an agebias lawsuit the flight 
engineers won against western 
turned down the freespeech arguments of a financial magazine 
accused of violating an antitouting provision of federal securities 
law the court without comment let stand a ruling that could force 
the stock market magazine to tell readers whether companies featured 
in its articles bought advertising space or paid the magazine for 
other services 
took steps against two affirmative action programs citing its 
ruling last month that invalidated a system of racial preferences in 
the award of public works contracts in richmond va 
the justices told a federal appeals court to consider dismantling 
a miami plan requiring 5 percent participation of businesses owned 
by women or minorities in the construction of a rail transit system 
and the court declared unconstitutional a michigan law requiring 
that 7 percent of all state contracts be awarded to minorityowned 
businesses and 5 percent to businesses owned by women

stock prices posted a broad gain today in 
activity dominated by buying of communications and entertainment 
issues 
the big news of the session was the weekend merger agreement 
between time inc and warner communications 
analysts said the deal immediately touched off speculation that 
other companies in the entertainment and publishing industries might 
be candidates for mergers or takeovers 
brokers also said the overall market benefited from a monthly 
report by a purchasing managers group that suggested a slowing of 
economic growth 
that was interpreted as a favorable portent for the inflation 
outlook and a possible slackening of upward pressure on interest

contracts for new construction fell 5 percent in 
january from the high level of december when public works projects 
had surged fw dodge group said monday 
fw dodge a division of mcgrawhill information services co 
said fluctuations in contracting for public works projects have been 
a big influence on the building sector for several months 
commercial and industrial construction showed renewed strength in 
january while residential building slowed 
contracting for public works and utilities in january was 20 
percent lower than decembers unusually strong level the january 
decline brought the annual pace of contracting in this sector to a 
more normal level fw dodge said 
the value of all newly started construction in january declined 
to an annual rate of 2436 billion from decembers annual rate of 
2562 billion 
george a christie f w dodges vice president and chief 
economist said the construction sector entered 1989 on a weak note 
and could deteriorate as the year goes on if the federal reserve 
board becomes increasingly aggressive in its battle against 
inflation 
the building business is very sensitive to interest rate 
movements and interest charges have been rising lately as the 
central bank pursues a tightmoney policy 
one month hardly sets a trend but if the federal reserve 
stands firm in its determination to tighten credit further as 
inflationary pressures continue to mount the coming months could 
make january look good christie said

to jennifer dickson commercial television is as 
welcome in the classroom as it is in the living room 
the people against the commercials should wake up and smell the 
coffee the 12thgrader at detroits mumford high school said 
monday after viewing the first edition of whittle communications 
channel one news program this is the 1980s and commercials are a 
way of life 
theyre just trying to create the image of leave it to beaver 
and its just not that way anymore dickson said of the shows 
critics 
students and administrators at mumford gave high marks to channel 
one a 12minute daily program being tested in six schools around 
the country by whittle a knoxville tennbased media company 
the launch of channel one came amid growing criticism by some 
childrens advocates and educators including the national 
parentteachers association of the inclusion of 30second 
television ads 
commercials for snickers candy bars head and shoulders shampoo 
levis 501 jeans and the partnership for a drugfree america were in 
the initial show 
i enjoyed the program said lamesa williams a 12thgrader 
not a lot of kids go home and watch the news on television so 
its good that they have the opportunity to see it at school 
about 20 students viewed the premier show with members of the 
media in the high schools library on monday the program contained 
features on students reactions to the continuing death threats 
against salman rushdie author of the book the satanic verses 
life for a teenager in the soviet union and the controversy 
involving the launch of channel one 
the story about the soviet union was especially interesting 
because i got to see how teenagers over there live what they wear 
what music they listen to 12thgrader tammy warren said 
students appeared to watch the program closely with some taking 
notes while others at times were distracted by the lights of 
television cameras from local stations covering the programs first 
showing 
detroit schools superintendent arthur jefferson on hand for the 
debut of channel one said the program would be monitored carefully 
we take very seriously the responsibility of educating young 
people jefferson said we have to be very careful about the 
intrusion of commercialism upon a captive audience

a senate subcommittee chairman lashed out at 
boeing co on monday just moments after a top official of the 
seattlebased aerospace firm testified there was no evidence to link 
the use of a hightech composite material with workers health 
problems 
i am somewhat resentful of your testimony said nevada 
democratic sen harry reid chairman of the toxic substances 
environmental oversight research and development subcommittee of 
the senate energy and public works committee 
reid said he felt boeing was minimizing the effects the 
materials can have on workers by pleading ignorance and emphasizing 
the disagreements in the medical community 
joseph peritore boeings vice president for human resources 
told the subcommittee his company had decided to discontinue use of 
the material even though it was determined that the material 
presented no significant health hazard 
peritore also said doctors were divided on the effects composite 
materials can have on workers and that boeing had not only met 
but significantly exceeded regulatory standards governing use of 
the material 
peritore said that boeing in ending its use of a resin that 
contains phenol and formaldehyde was responding to workers 
complaints 
the fact that we believed the material was safe became 
irrelevant said peritore in the highlycharged atmosphere that 
existed we felt the only way to alleviate our employees concerns 
was to remove the material from the shop altogether and we did 
reid told reporters after the hearing that he felt testimony 
from an official of the lockheed aeronautical systems co showed 
that firm recognized the problem and was trying to do something 
about it 
the difference between lockheed and boeing was like night and 
day said reid 
the subcommittee hearing stemmed from complaints by boeing 
workers in the seattle area and employees at a production site for 
the new stealth fighter operated by lockheed aeronautical systems 
co in burbank calif 
the materials are mixtures of plastic carbon and synthetic 
fibers which increasingly are being used to replace metal in aircaft 
nearly 100 workers are suing lockheed claiming workplace 
chemicals resulted in ailments ranging from dizziness nausea and 
bloody urine to skin and organ injuries and cancer lawyers 
representing the workers say at least five have died of cancer since 
the lawsuit was filed in 1986 
boeing workers at plants in the puget sound region including 
kent everett renton and auburn have had similar health complaints 
dr gordon baker a burien wash allergist whose patients 
include more than 130 boeing employees said composite materials are 
causing widespread serious health problems for aerospace 
workers 
chemicals are being used without adequate health and safety 
data without proper testing and without giving some workers the 
necessary protective equipment ventiliation and training that are 
essential to safely using these toxic industrial materials said 
baker 
baker said his patients showed a definite pattern of symptoms 
that were unprecedented and unexpected in a general allergy 
practice 
there are widespread serious health problems throughout the 
industry now that they are using the new composite materials said 
baker 
baker said that of the boeing employees he has seen 75 percent 
suffer from extreme fatigue 68 percent had memory lapses 67 had 
chest pains or trouble breathing and 68 percent had vision problems 
in addition baker said there was evidence that some of the 
employees may be suffering from organic brain poisoning which 
can result in varying degrees of incapacity to perform and think 
up to previous abilities 
it is of the greatest urgency that adequate safety is insured 
in the workplace wherever these materials are used baker said 
the unfortunate victims of these chemical poisons should be 
properly cared for and not be subjected to harrassment demotion 
termination or forced to continue working in unhealthy work 
environments until they can work no more 
two women who worked at boeings auburn plant testified they were 
never warned that the chemicals could be dangerous 
i had no idea what chemicals we had in the shop said beverly 
mccormick of north bend wash 
ms mccormick said the exposure to chemicals left her with a 
number of medical problems and an overall lack of energy i cant 
play with my own granddaughter for more than a few minutes she 
said 
bonnie faye schrum who lives in renton wash said workers were 
discouraged from reporting their health problems and were warned 
they would be fired if they did 
im not the same person i was five years ago said ms 
schrum i cant go to the grocery store without getting sick i 
cant sleep at night you dont eat you have no energy 
my memory is a mess i dont know my kids some days i dont 
even know i am in my home she said

du pont co says it has developed two products 
that could become longterm replacements for a chemical commonly 
used as a cleaning agent that is suspected of damaging the earths 
ozone layer 
the products are intended as substitutes for cfc113 a 
chlorofluorocarbon used by the electronics and other industries 
requiring high standards of cleanliness in such equipment as wiring 
assemblies 
cleaning agents account for about 20 percent of the world market 
for cfcs which also are used in refrigeration aerosols and 
blowing agents including for insulation and cushioning 
du pont which accounts for about half of the us production of 
cfcs and is the worlds largest producer plans to stop making the 
chemicals and has been researching possible alternative products 
with the latest two products du pont has developed candidates to 
replace cfcs in each of the four major areas in which the chemicals 
are used said archie w dunham a du pont group vice president he 
made the announcement sunday at an international conference on ozone 
protection in london and a summary of his remarks was released in 
the united states 
the 120nation conference has focused attention on the chemical 
compounds that scientists say are destroying the ozone shield that 
protects the earth from the suns cancercausing ultraviolet rays 
the compounds are blamed for creating an ozone hole roughly the 
size of the continental united states over the antarctic every 
winter a smaller hole has also been spotted over the arctic 
one of du ponts longterm cleaning agent substitutes is a 
fluorocarbonbased blend that has about 90 percent less ozone 
depletion potential laboratory tests show it might be a superior 
cleaning agent in removing residue from wiring assemblies in the 
electronics industry 
the other candidate contains a mixture of solvents and 
surfaceactive agents and it is designed to remove residue in a 
process using a final water rinse it has no potential to deplete 
the ozone layer 
du pont has applied for patents on both blends and limited 
quantities of each are available for evaluation 
the company said that depending on market reaction and further 
testing the fluorocarbonbased product could be ready for 
commercial use in several years and the other product could be ready 
by the end of this year 
du pont plans to introduce a series of product alternatives to 
cfcs over a threeyear to fiveyear period beginning in 1990 the 
company expects to phase cfcs out of several major market segments 
in the early to mid1990s but complete phaseout may take until the 
turn of the century 
the company said it has spent or authorized nearly 100 million 
on developing substitutes for cfcs and plans to spend 45 million 
more this year an investment of more than 1 billion would be 
needed to completely restructure its us cfc business to produce 
alternative products du pont said

continental airlines employees showed little 
sympathy monday for the walkout at eastern saying many of them earn 
less money than the strikers at the troubled sister carrier 
pilots for continental itself the target of wage cuts and job 
actions during a tumultuous 1983 reorganization under texas air 
corp chairman frank lorenzo predict their eastern counterparts 
will suffer for honoring picket lines texas air owns both airlines 
my personal opinion is that the pilots or for that matter 
anyone else should not have gone out on strike i think theyre 
going to lose their jobs and theyre probably going to lose the 
airline said one pilot who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
i think frank lorenzos going to shut that thing eastern down 
and either sell parts of it or bankrupt it he said adding that 
eastern pilots he talked to in advance of the strike had hoped to 
keep flying i dont see how they can continue 
of more than a dozen continental employees interviewed none 
expressed misgivings about aiding eastern management by accepting 
additional passengers bumped from the sister carriers flights 
however some continental laborers suggested their comments were 
restricted by management 
its going to be tough to try to find anyone to talk to said 
one worker theyre really cracking down on us 
with only four daily eastern flights through houston airports 
continental workers say they have seen only a slight rise in 
passengers and shipping since the strike began continental is based 
in houston and eastern is in miami 
despite increased security and fears that striking eastern 
workers may target continental because of its relationship to texas 
air there have been no reported attempts to block continentals 
houston operations union and airline officials said 
many of the pilots flight attendants and other workers at 
houstons intercontinental airport the airlines main hub said 
they considered the labor strife unrelated to their operations and 
uncalled for when compared with salaries at continental or in other 
industries 
nearly all of them however said they hoped to see an end to the 
strike and the ultimate survival of eastern 
what lorenzo did is look at their salaries and then compare 
them to salaries in the marketplace what those people would make 
working somewhere else said another continental pilot who asked 
not to be named 
lets face it throwing a bag is throwing a bag no matter 
where you do it he said this is a supply and demand business 
and theyre in business to make a profit they have to answer to 
their shareholders 
the sentiments apparently spread through the ranks at continental 
on monday although many employees refused to be interviewed 
the problem isnt really the mechanics its the baggage 
handlers said one worker they outnumber the mechanics and 
theyre the ones who pushed this thing and theyre making a lot of 
money for what theyre doing 
he said that his wife a nurse makes about 6 per hour less than 
an eastern baggage attendant who may have no advanced education 
teresa white who was laid off after continental filed for 
bankruptcy protection in 1983 but later was rehired and rose to a 
supervisory position said union members at eastern apparently 
missed a valuable history lesson 
i think they should have foreseen what was taking place and 
know what he lorenzo would do get rid of their jobs she said 
of the possible response to the strike

american officials 
there is no legally binding agreement except the semiconductor 
agreement an official of the ministry of international trade and 
industry said 
us government officials have said japan has failed to live up 
to a commitment to increase the percentage of the japanese chip 
market held by american companies while japanese officials say they 
made no such commitment former commerce department official clyde 
prestowitz alleged last year in his book trading places how 
america allowed japan to take the lead that the japanese 
government pledged in a secret document to raise the us market 
share of semiconductors in japan to 20 percent by 1991 
in the third quarter of last year the latest period for which 
there are statistics foreign manufacturers had 109 percent of 
japans chip market the miti official said in an interview the 
us commerce department says the american share rose from 92 
percent in 1987 to 95 percent in 1988 
in a 1986 semiconductor agreement japan pledged not to dump 
computer chips selling them at less than fair market value in 
the united states and to increase american access to japans chip 
market 
prestowitz wrote that there was a confidenial side letter in 
which the japanese said that they understood welcomed and would 
make efforts to assist the us companies in reaching their goal of 
a 20 percent market share within five years 
the us negotiators said that this commitment meant there 
would be a guaranteed increase in the us share of the japanese 
market prestowitz added 
japanese officials will not confirm the existence of a separate 
document accompanying the semiconductor agreement but say there was 
no document that holds them to increasing us market share 
in a sense he prestowitz is wrong because there are no 
legally binding documents in fact us government statements never 
admitted to the existence of such a document the miti official 
said 
in general there are a lot of letters of exchange between the 
us and japan in any kind of trade negotiations he said 
sometimes theyre secret and sometimes theyre not 
asked if there was an informal agreement by the japanese 
government on a 20 percent share for us chip manufacturers the 
official said no comment 
but he added imagine if there was such a letter it wouldnt 
represent a commitment to a market share 
a us government official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
repeated monday the american position that japan is failing to live 
up to an agreement to ensure a steady increase in us market share 
in japan 
in april 1987 washington imposed penalty tariffs of 300 million 
against japanese electronics imports saying japan still was dumping 
chips worldwide and had failed to live up to its market access 
pledge 
washington reduced the penalties to 165 million two months 
later saying japan had stopped dumping but that the access question 
remained 
japanese manufacturers accounted for 50 percent of semiconductors 
sold in the world last year up from 48 percent in 1987 while the 
american global share fell from 39 percent to 37 percent according 
to a us survey

exxon corp chairman lawrence g rawl said monday 
he might be willing to accept a gasoline tax increase of 5 cents a 
gallon if the money was used to repair aging roads and bridges 
theres a lot of money needed for infrastructure rawl said 
the us highway system needs a great deal of work done on it 
rawl spoke at a news conference preceding an economic club of 
detroit luncheon 
rawl said he disagreed with proposals that would use the 
increased tax receipts for uses other than roads and bridges a 
large increase in the fuel tax is not an easy option for fiscal 
relief he said later in his formal address 
on another matter rawl said exxon expects stable crude oil 
prices in the coming year with no marked increases for more than two 
years 
rawl predicted that the price of north sea brent crude oil will 
average 15 to 17 a barrel this year with west texas intermediate 
crude about 1 a barrel more 
the predictions represent no change from the current price of 
1650 for brent crude and slightly over 18 for west texas 
intermediate 
after two or three years we see some growth in prices rawl 
told reporters 
the exxon chief executive officer said he wouldnt dispute 
predictions of 25 to 30abarrel prices by 2000 but he said i 
wouldnt bet a nickel on it either 
rawl said he didnt know how long the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries december agreement to limit the countries 
total production to 185 million barrels a day would last 
such agreements all hold up for a while he said 
he refused to forecast exxons earnings for the year but said 
they would depend heavily on crude oil prices

a buyout specialist monday offered to buy ohio 
mattress co the worlds largest bedding maker and producer of 
sealy posturepedic and stearns amp foster mattresses in a deal 
valuing the company at nearly 1 billion 
this is a great day for all our stockholders said ernest m 
wuliger chairman and chief executive of ohio mattress which 
announced nov 18 that it had hired an investment banking firm to 
review a possible sale 
gibbons green van amerongen with offices in new york and los 
angeles said it was offering 2550 in cash for 96 percent or 369 
million of ohio mattress shares the remaining shares would be 
exchanged later for shares in the new company 
the tender offer alone would cost 940 million the value of the 
whole company implied by the price of 2550 a share is 980 
million the tender offer is dependent on obtaining at least 51 
percent of ohio mattress shares 
the stock jumped 287 a share to 2462 in consolidated new 
york stock exchange trading 
harvey katz an industry analyst with salomon brothers inc in 
new york said the news of the bid was no big surprise given the 
ohio mattress announcement last fall that it was reviewing its 
possible sale options 
the price being offered would seem to be a done deal and 
reasonably close to full value katz said 
he said it was unlikely gibbons green van amerongen would 
attempt to sell off much of ohio mattress to pay off the takeover 
debt noting that most of the companys operations reflected its 
core bedding business any nonbedding operations would be 
relatively small he said 
e stephen benson a partner in the investment firm said the 
firm was attracted to ohio mattress by its market share its 
opportunity for international growth and plans for direct home 
delivery by ohio mattress of products sold by retailers 
we think we can run the company more efficiently benson said 
by phone from new york 
europes largest bedding manufacturer madridbased fl betere 
sa the flex group plans to take a minority participation role 
in the new company according to benson the percentage ownership it 
will have was not disclosed 
we believe such an international strategic alliance coupled 
with domestic opportunities we see for the company to develop its 
home delivery business as one example will enable management to 
generate an accelerated and even more profitable rate of growth in 
the years ahead benson said 
ohio mattress said it received six acquisition offers last 
wednesday three of which were subsequently improved the other 
bidders were not disclosed 
the gibbons green offer was selected by ohio mattress board 
following its determination that the offer represented the best 
available transaction for the ohio mattress stockholders the 
company said in a statement 
the tender offer is expected to begin friday ohio mattress said 
gibbons green said it has financing commitments from the first 
national bank of chicago the entire offer will be financed with 
funds from first national bank of chicago and its own equity funds 
gibbons green said 
wuliger said he had been asked by gibbons green to remain as 
chairman and become an investor in the subsidiary company 
for the fiscal year ended nov 30 ohio mattress had sales of 
6615 million and profits of 332 million ohio mattress has 5555 
employees at locations around the nation wuliger said

a 17month labor dispute at eastern airlines capped 
by the virtual shutdown of the striketorn carrier monday displays 
the power of pilots over their employers 
the decision by most of the 3600 eastern pilots to join the 
workingclass machinists strike dealt a crushing blow to eastern 
after a long history of financial losses and labormanagement 
tensions 
and pilot power is poised to expand its reach tuesday when 
pilots across the country planned a job action that could delay 
every flight on every major airline 
eastern on day three of the strike said it was shutting down 
nearly all operations and idling 5000 to 6000 workers the company 
was quick to blame the pilots saying it could not afford to 
continue operating because they had honored the machinists picket 
lines 
the pilots are conducting their own economic strike against the 
company eastern spokesman robin matell said 
why did eastern pilots who earn an average 80000 a year cast 
their lot with mechanics and baggage handlers who make about 19 and 
15 an hour respectively 
the older pilots dont have a chance to go to another 
airline said gordon lane an eastern pilot were going to lose 
our profession 
the fact that were out here picketing is frank lorenzo 
period said lane 47 who has flown for eastern for 22 years 
lorenzo who controls eastern through parent texas air corp has 
been a lightning rod for the pilots anger he is widely mistrusted 
by pilots and other eastern workers because of what they call his 
triumphant unioncrushing campaign at sister carrier continental 
airlines 
they also accuse lorenzo of diverting precious eastern assets to 
continental 
the eastern pilots have been torn between their dislike for 
lorenzo and reluctance to quit the airline and sacrifice years of 
seniority 
a shortage of pilots nationwide means they could easily find jobs 
at other airlines but they would have to relinquish seniority and 
accept lower pay and benefits said kit darby executive vice 
president of future aviation professionals of america in atlanta 
the job market for pilots is extremely good darby said 
noting that the airline pilots earn an average 82500 a year plus 
substantial benefits 
eastern had said about 200 pilots out of 3600 were flying during 
the strike but the pilots union put the number at 88 eastern has 
operated only a fraction of its customary 1040 daily flights during 
the strike 
air line pilots association president henry duffy has asked all 
pilots nationwide to strictly follow aviation rules tuesday to 
ensure the safety of the air traffic system which he said had 
been weakened by the eastern disruptions 
duffy said the action would slow air traffic but insisted that 
was not the intent 
we expect a very good response from pilots at all carriers 
alpa spokesman john mazor said pilots are going to recognize that 
there are problems generated out of the eastern strike that have a 
ripple effect throughout the system 
delta air lines pilots prepared to join the slowdown and pilots 
at united airlines also expressed support

a federal judge has ruled in favor of a 
massachusetts software company in a copyright infringement case that 
may protect software manufacturers against what is called the look 
and feel of clones 
the judge in bridgeport conn ruled recently that three 
competitors infringed on the copyright of the costimator program 
made by manufacturers technologies inc of west springfield 
the costimator helps users to estimate the time and cost of 
manufacturing parts 
the competitors did not copy the mechanics of the costimator 
software but duplicated its onscreen appearance what is commonly 
called the look and feel of the program 
the ruling was made in late january but manufacturers 
technologies officials said monday that they delayed publicizing the 
decision until the 30day appeal period had expired

rockwell international corp was fined 55 
million monday for doublebilling the pentagon on a navigation 
satellite 
the company which pleaded guilty to conspiracy and contempt of 
court in the case but maintained it was innocent vowed to appeal 
the us district court fine 
the el segundobased aerospace and manufacturing company was 
fined 500000 for an alleged conspircy among some of its managers 
to double bill the air force by approximately 450000 on the 
navstar navigation satellite system between 1982 and 1984 
us district judge consuelo marshall ordered a 5 million fine 
for a contempt of court charge brought against rockwell because the 
terms of settlement of an earlier unrelated case barred the company 
from fraudulent billing the fine for contempt of court is unlimited 
rockwell also was sentenced to five years probation 
the companys attorney james neal vowed to appeal the fine 
on jan 19 rockwell entered a conditional plea of guilty to the 
charges in an agreement with prosecutors under which a number of 
related charges were dismissed 
the conditional plea was based on the companys appeal of an 
early ruling in the case to a higher court if that appeal were to 
succeed the company hoped to have its guilty plea erased from the 
record 
neal maintained the fraud was perpetrated by division managers 
without the knowledge or consent of upper management 
in the earlier ruling the judge rejected a company motion to 
throw the case out of court on grounds that rockwell had reported 
the fraud under provisions of a pentagon program intended to 
encourage defense contractors to report dishonesty 
since it entered its plea rockwell has engaged in a public 
relations campaign portraying itself as a victim of overzealous 
prosecution and maintaining that the example of rockwells case 
would deter other defense contractors from reporting fraud under the 
pentagons voluntary disclosure program 
federal prosecutors maintain that rockwell didnt report the 
fraud until after auditors were on the trail 
the case involves billing for repairs to the satellites radio 
gear performed by a subcontractor itt corps defense 
communications division itt wasnt a defendant 
a rockwell manager robert zavodnik 47 has pleaded guilty to 
lying to the government and conspiracy in the case his supervisor 
donald carter 60 was acquitted of the same charges by a federal 
jury
