a federal judge monday struck down 
illinois death penalty law raising doubts about the fate of 121 
prisoners on the states death row including serial killer john w 
gacy 
us district judge harold baker ruled that the 1977 law gives 
prosecutors too much discretion in deciding when to seek the death 
penalty violating us supreme court directives that capital 
punishment not be imposed in an arbitrary and capricious manner 
if sustained on appeal the decision would invalidate the 
sentences of the 121 men currently facing the death penalty in 
illinois they include gacy convicted in 1980 of killing 33 young 
men and boys in the worst multiplekilling case in us history 
prosecutors said they were confident the ruling would be 
overturned by the 7th us circuit court of appeals in chicago 
no one has been executed under the states death penalty law 
which was upheld by the state supreme court in 1979 
judges threw out three earlier death sentences that emerged 
through the appeals process in federal court but mondays ruling 
was the first to address the constitutionality of the law 
i think we knew that in some case a federal judge would 
rule specifically on the statute said theodore gottfried head 
of the state appellate defenders office which handles appeals for 
death row inmates we didnt know which case it would be 
first assistant attorney general michael ficaro defended the 
death penalty law 
the illinois supreme court has dealt with that issue over 60 
times ficaro said we believe the statute is constitutional 
jay miller director of the states american civil liberties 
union chapter said were delighted with any decision that finds 
any death penalty law unconstitutional 
we think theyre all unconstitutional miller said i 
dont think theres any way to write a death penalty law thats 
constitutional 
legal experts agreed a ruling by the federal appelate court is 
virtually a certainty should the us supreme court decline to 
review that ruling it would in effect become the last word on the 
laws validity 
bakers ruling came in the case of a double killer charles 
silagy who demanded the death penalty after being convicted in 
1980 of a double killing in vermilion county 
silagy who has been on death row since august 1980 had his 
sentence appealed twice to the state supreme court and once to the 
us supreme court but was unsuccessful until his case reached 
baker in one of the last stages of the deathpenalty appeals 
process 
the states capital punishment law allows a trial court to 
consider a death sentence in certain circumstances such as a 
multiple killing when requested by the prosecution 
the state supreme court upheld the law in 43 ruling in 1979 
dissenting justice howard c ryan whose opinion was cited by 
baker wrote 
our statute contains no directions or guidelines to minimize 
the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action by the 
prosecutor in either requesting or in not requesting a death 
sentence hearing

the government began a new effort 
monday to rally nato allies behind its proposal for superpower 
talks on reducing shortrange nuclear weapons which has caused a 
dispute with the united states and britain 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher was quoted as saying 
west germanys argument must have special weight because it is 
the alliances front line and a war with such battlefieldrange 
weapons would be fought on its territory 
both the united states and britain say the negotiations proposed 
by chancellor helmut kohl might endanger western security 
the new york times reported tuesday that the elements of a 
compromise have begun to emerge with a us proposal submitted to 
nato headquarters in brussels belgium 
quoting unidentified diplomats from several nations the 
newspaper said washington proposed wednesday that the alliance 
decide to upgrade the weapons and then announce unilateral 
reductions nato would then challenge the soviets to make cuts to 
the lower levels 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
monday that the united states remains committed to a mixture of 
nato conventional and nuclear forces called flexible response as 
a deterrent to attack 
the west german position demonstrates the special strength 
that nato has fitzwater said our allies can debate quite 
vigorously these issues yet maintain the basic strength of our 
unity 
our position remains that keeping the peace requires a strong 
nato alliance and a policy of flexible response 
genschers remarks were the first official west german comment 
since a meeting sunday in which prime minister margaret thatcher of 
britain tried but failed to change kohls mind on the issue 
in pursuit of support for the west german position kohl plans 
to visit rome on tuesday and genscher will go to paris 
italy has said it agrees with west germany that negotiations on 
the shortrange weapons should begin but france has not made its 
position clear west germany claims the support of seven of the 16 
north atlantic treaty orgnization members 
in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau genscher was 
quoted as saying this is not a new demand that has only now been 
made by us and other alliance partners this concerns putting into 
effect an intention which has already been stated in two alliance 
decisions 
his ministry made copies of the interview available to other 
news organizations before publication in the papers tuesday 
editions 
genscher has noted previously the nato decision at summits in 
1987 and 1988 that negotiations on shortrange nuclear weapons 
should be held at some point the united states and britain say 
this is not the time 
naturally the german view must have a special weight because 
the lance rockets are on our soil and because our army represents 
the largest conventional contribution in west germany to the 
common western security genscher said 
west germanys army has about 500000 soldiers most of the 
alliances shortrange lance rockets are on its territory and would 
be used there in a war 
kohl and genscher say nato should not pass up opportunities to 
negotiate in important areas of disarmament and they insist the 
time is right for taking up the battlefieldrange weapons the 
chancellor has said he wants the talks to begin soon but has 
not proposed a timetable 
a west german government official said privately monday the 
chancellor was optimistic about a compromise 
us and british officials say starting negotiations now could 
lead to elimination of the shortrange weapons and increase the 
threat from the soviet blocs superior conventional forces 
after the meeting with mrs thatcher on sunday kohl said he 
does not favor pulling the lance missiles out of west germany 
under the present circumstances 
gen john galvin the american who commands nato forces in 
europe was quoted as saying he did not believe there was 
disagreement on strategy within the alliance 
in an interview for publication tuesday the newspaper die welt 
quoted galvin as saying recent statements make it very clear 
that there are no differences in the grand strategy the importance 
of nuclear deterrence is recognized

when the prime ministers political secretary 
committed suicide many saw him as a victim of the money politics 
entwined with japanese culture and tradition 
beside such westernstyle institutions as a parliament and free 
elections japan has customs that demand exchanges of gifts and 
favors and lingering ideals of absolute loyalty 
japanese politicians spend campaign money in a very personal 
manner 
voters expect their representatives not only to bring 
porkbarrel projects to the district but to help their children 
find jobs in tokyo attend weddings and send donations to funerals 
political secretaries spend much of their time going to family 
ceremonies and delivering obligatory gifts 
results of a survey published in the newspaper asahi said a 
legislator or his representative attends on average 265 funerals 
a month 
ihei aoki for three decades prime minister noboru takeshitas 
closest aide may have killed himself wednesday because more than 
1 million in donations and loans he received from the recruit co 
helped bring down his boss who had announced the day before he 
would resign 
the tragic case of aokis suicide pathetically calls for a 
drastic reform of the moneyoriented structure of politics the 
daily yomiuri said in an editorial 
asahi said political aides function as cloaks that cover up 
foul play of 13 politicians linked to the recruit scandal it 
noted six took donations in aides names rather than their own 
political secretaries who would be called legislative 
assistants in the united states carry a burden imposed by the 
moneydriven election system most spend hardly any time drafting 
legislation a job generally handled by bureaucrats 
aokis main task as secretary to a top leader was to raise 
money from big business and distribute it to legislators said 
kotaru nogami chief political editor of the kyodo news service 
secretaries of legislators in turn pass some of the largesse 
on to their districts 
basically a secretary does everything and anything he is told 
to do and he has to carry out any order to perfection even though 
specific guidelines are not given said chris redl of phoenix 
ariz a political secretary to a legislator of the governing 
liberal democratic party 
when he began working in japan redl said he was surprised to 
see aides in funny costumes dancing to entertain constituents at a 
local festival 
he said he was exhausted by the dawnto2am schedule of 
courtesy calls and parties with supporters in the hokkaido district 
of his legislator shizuo sato 
i talked to another secretary who had to do this all the 
time the american said he told me its like the old days 
you have to be ready to die for your shogun 
when aoki killed himself many people were reminded of the 
suicide in 1976 of former prime minister kakuei tanakas driver 
who had carried payoff money in the lockheed scandal tanaka 
eventually was convicted on a bribery charge 
after the lockheed scandal there was a lot of discussion of 
political reform but it was never carried out nogami said 
a partial reform limited donations but the recruit case 
revealed ways around it buying many tickets to fundraising 
parties and selling shares at bargain prices before offering them 
for public sale 
recruit was limited to contributing 115000 a year to all 
politicians in three years however takeshita alone got more than 
15 million from the company in donations stocksale profits 
loans and proceeds from ticket purchases all of it went through 
aokis hands 
such huge sums of money are needed in part because taxes cover 
only a fraction of what it costs to run the parliament 
the recruit scandal was born of the system said sato 47 
the young americans boss he is a member of the governing partys 
cmmittee on reform and wants more government funds so legislators 
will be less dependent on contributions 
in the tiny office the government provides he told an 
interviewer the budget from the government allows for only two 
aides i have 15 
his monthly travel allowance of 500 covers just a quarter of 
what he spends visiting his constituency 
sato depends on a patron former prime minister yasuhiro 
nakasone for political funds and in return backs nakasone in 
intraparty maneuvers 
patrons like nakasone or takeshita lead liberal democratic 
factions that operate almost as separate parties particularly in 
raising money 
explaining how japanese politicians spend campaign funds in 
their districts sato said its different from america a simple 
television ad wont get votes its a matter of obligation and 
human feelings 
americans might see the exchanges of favors and money as graft 
or votebuying but in japan they generally are considered social 
custom 
contributions by recruit were at the top level of an 
interlocking system of gifts and obligations stretching down to 
ordinary citizens 
some japanese say they dont mind politicians collecting large 
amounts of money because they usually recirculate it rather than 
enriching themselves 
giving gift envelopes of cash at weddings funerals and bon 
voyage parties even between parents and children at the new year 
is a matter of etiquette in japan 
a parliamentary survey indicated young legislators spent an 
average of 274000 a year on cash gifts for funerals weddings 
community festivals and local clubs 
when a politician gives money at a funeral its not because 
hes a politician but because its a matter of japanese custom 
sato said now it may be necessary for us to distance ourselves 
from japanese habits 
among reforms an advisory group suggested to takeshita last week 
was prohibiting parliament members from giving money at weddings 
and funerals

horsemen in armor monks in brown robes 
and four musketeers gathered near the rio grande to commemorate 
what they say was the united states first thanksgiving 
celebration in 1598 
the group took a step sunday toward revising history with a 
reenactment of the fiesta held april 30 1598 23 years before 
the pilgrims celebrated in massachusetts 
while the 400 settlers led by spanish aristocrat juan de onate 
were celebrating the pilgrims were still in europe dreaming of a 
place where they could worship freely 
the el paso mission trail association sponsored the 
reenactment in addition to the armored horsemen franciscan monks 
and musketeers it included a dozen sheep a goat and a donkey to 
represent the 7000 head of livestock the original settlers brought 
with them 
no one is asking to move thanksgiving from the fourth thursday 
in november to april 30 but organizers want people to know about 
the 1598 feast 
we dont want to fight against any tradition said ricardo 
martifluxa spains consul general in houston but we feel it 
was a deprivation not to acknowledge the full history of the united 
states of america 
mission trail president sheldon hall said he wants the 
reenactment to become an annual event in el paso 
the 130 men and 270 women and children in onates party started 
out from central mexico in early 1598 to settle along the rio 
grande according to the groups chronicler capt gaspar perez de 
villagra while crossing the vast chihuahuan desert of northern 
mexico the group ran out of water five days later and near death 
by thirst they reached the river april 20 
according to the perez de villagra the settlers rested for 10 
days before holding a thanksgiving feast a few miles east of 
presentday el paso 
we built a great bonfire and roasted the meat and fish and 
then all sat down to a repast the like of which we had never 
enjoyed before perez de villagra wrote 
onate then took formal possession of the rio grande basin in the 
name of king philip ii of spain an action called the toma 
and his party eventually settled near presentday santa fe nm 
during the reenactment the settlers led by the horsemen 
wandered around the grassy slopes of chamizal national memorial 
near downtown el paso and spied the river national park service 
rules prevented a reenactment of the feast but the actors 
recreated onates toma a solemn mass led by the franciscan monks 
and a celebratory dance 
about 1000 people watched the pageant

the riots that shook the kingdom have 
turned jordans focus toward internal problems and made the country 
less of a factor in the israelpalestinian controversy over the 
future of the occupied territories 
it has become increasingly clear that king hussein was serious 
last year when he vowed never to negotiate on behalf of the 
palestinians saying it is a matter between israel and the 
palestinians themselves 
the king was bowing to the obvious the palestinian uprising on 
the israelioccupied west bank of the jordan river which he ruled 
until 1967 showed he had little remaining loyalty there it had 
shifted to the palestine liberation organization 
even the idea of a confederation between jordan and a 
palestinian state a proposal to make palestinian independence 
palatable to israel seems only remotely possible these days 
hussein for months has said he will consider a confederation 
only after a palestinian state is created and only if palestinians 
there and jordanians in his country vote for it 
many oldline jordanians or east bankers oppose a 
confederation because it could give palestinians a larger say in 
jordanian affairs palestinians already make up half of jordans 3 
million people 
palestinians were almost nowhere to be seen in the four days of 
rioting that began on april 18 and rocked more than a dozen towns 
and villages in southern jordan the bedrock of support for hussein 
the rioting in which at least nine people were killed was 
sparked by governmentimposed price increases but contained a cry 
by east bankers that hussein pay attention to their problems and 
give them a greater voice in running the country 
some have resented the prosperity and political prominence of 
palestinians who were granted full citizenship when jordan merged 
with the west bank in 1950 some also hold a grudge from 1969 and 
1970 when plo guerrillas began to set up a state within a state in 
jordan often harassing east bankers at guerrilla roadblocks 
husseins selection thursday of field marshal zeid bin shaker 
the former army commander as prime minister partly answered that 
plea 
bin shaker a man of bedouin stock commands wide loyalty in the 
armed forces which are still a favored occupation for bedouin 
youth he also was prominent in crushing the guerrilla movement in 
1970 
he replaces zaid rifai whose jordanian birth was not enough in 
the eyes of many east bank eyes to compensate for his fathers 
palestinian origins 
hussein will not renounce the palestinians in jordan itself he 
has woven them into the fabric of his society along with smaller 
immigrant groups such as armenians and circassians 
but the king has demanded they act as jordanians and his 
security forces watch closely for any expressions of domestic 
palestinian nationalism 
israeli leaders still speak often of turning part of the west 
bank back to jordan or putting it under the control of jordanian 
security forces 
but hardline israelis refuse to give up any of the west bank or 
consider any form of palestinian entity they say there already is 
a palestine jordan 
however some of the resentments that led to the recent rioting 
demonstrate that jordan is not a palestinian state 
no amount of introspection will keep jordan from being an 
essential player in middle east peace maneuvering it shares 
israels longest border and is permanently threatened by a conflict 
that has twice swamped jordan with refugees 
the king has vowed to maintain his support of the palestinians 
in the occupied lands and has been an important moderating force on 
the plos negotiating demands his abandonment of claims to the 
west bank helped push the plo to focus its attention on ending 
israeli occupation there 
and the palestinian organization followed husseins longstanding 
appeal that it formally endorse israels right to exist 
that led the united states to open a dialogue with the plo in 
december and turn its gaze away from jordan as the answer to the 
41year conflict 
hussein is urging israelis to do the same

for years residents of this rural 
community wanted nothing to do with native son woody guthrie 
citing his writings in a communist newspaper and his support for 
the postdepression labor movement 
but detractors were nowhere to be found saturday as more than 
750 fans waited in line hours to see his son arlo perform at a 
benefit concert to commemorate the author of songs such as bound 
for glory and this land is your land 
thank you for being here arlo guthrie told the more than 
750 people present and i know that my dad thanks you also very 
much for this night god bless you all 
the concert guthries first in his late fathers hometown was 
a benefit performance to raise money for scholarships 
for arlo guthrie the concert was a homecoming of sorts to a 
place hes visited many times but perhaps never really appreciated 
ive been walking around the whole town feeling kind of 
strange he said i have other folks here my grandfather and a 
lot of his folks grew up here spent their lives here i feel like 
i have encountered my own roots and im real happy about that 
he spent much of his twohour performance talking to the 
audience and at one point took a moment to joke about the 
controversy that has surrounded the memory of his father 
i think a lot of good things are happening for my dad now 
that he doesnt need it so much guthrie said 
the younger guthrie known for songs such as alices 
restaurant and city of new orleans told the audience how he 
asked his father to teach him the words to this land is your 
land when classmates teased him for not knowing them 
i remember he sat me down and he taught me some verses that 
werent in the schoolbook version i didnt just go back to school 
i went back armed he said 
it never occurred to me in sixth grade that other people would 
know that stuff i thought that just went on in our house 
the celebration was an emotional experience for guthrie who 
said many of his memories of his father are of the years before his 
death when he had grown weak from a nervous disorder 
i wish my folks were alive especially my mom he said 
but at any rate where they are now i know that they are looking 
down and having a ball laughing hysterically that this could 
possibly go on here tonight 
eightyyearold ramona davidson attended the concert and said 
she was happy her hometown honored guthrie 
its about time all this has come to pass woody has come 
home its just too bad woody wasnt here to see all of this she 
said

three days and 2000 miles apart two 
little girls became victims of violence so shocking that disbelief 
was the first response of many then came love 
twoyearold carmina salcido was found april 15 in a remote 
county dump in northern californias scenic wine country with her 
throat slashed beside her lay the bodies of her two young sisters 
who died of similar wounds inflicted the day before 
despite her wound carmina told a detective daddy cut me 
on april 17 in indianapolis 5yearold erin bowers hand was 
blown off when she reached for a tube of toothpaste while shopping 
with her parents and 1yearold sister at a k mart store a pipe 
bomb hidden in the pumpstyle container exploded 
erin was the victim of a random attack while carmina allegedly 
suffered at the hand of her father yet the two girls are united by 
an outpouring of love from strangers across the country 
carminas hospital room was filled with gifts wheeled in on a 
brand new shiny red wagon when loved ones gathered april 24 to 
celebrate her third birthday 
the hospital was deluged with more than 500 toys clothing 
balloon bouquets and other gifts are piled so high in offices that 
officials recently began urging wellwishers to contribute instead 
to one of several trust funds established for carmina 
her 28yearold father ramon salcido is in jail awaiting trial 
on murder charges in the deaths of her two sisters mother 
grandmother and the grandmothers two young daughters and a 
coworker of her father 
in indianapolis about 20 federal and local investigators are 
still trying to find the person who planted the bomb 
erin lost four fingers and half of her left hand in the 
explosion and the remainder of her hand was amputated the 
following day although doctors removed the lens of her left eye 
april 25 they are optimistic she will regain at least partial 
sight in the eye she was released from the hospital friday 
methodist hospital spokesman david richards said so many gifts 
and letters arrived for erin that he couldnt even guess a number 
shes become such a sort of touching and sad news event that 
all the staff follow it carefully richards said ive heard 
many expressions of condolences 
unlike carmina erins family remains intact 
im just glad we have our little girl erins mother 
maureen bower told reporters she doesnt have a hand but shes 
ours and shes got her same personality back shes going to be 
fine 
by contrast the public barely knows carmina family survivors 
remain in seclusion and the spunky little girl whose mother always 
dressed her in beautiful party clothes remains under 24hour guard 
in the hospital to protect her privacy 
the only available photo of carmina is a small snapshot of her 
sitting with her two sisters 
doctors believe carmina will remain hospitalized for five more 
weeks but adoption offers have already poured in from across the 
country according to mary frost a spokeswoman for petaluma valley 
hospital in the northern california town of petaluma 
carminas grandfather robert richards was the sole family 
member to escape the attacks unharmed and county officials report 
that he has begun the formal process of asking to become carminas 
guardian they are hopeful that her permanent home will be selected 
soon after her release from the hospital

david kirp says he saw america at its best 
and its worst in the two years he spent studying the way 
different communities reacted to children with aids 
in his book learning by heart kirp offers a wrenching 
account of the paths taken by nine communities forced to wrestle 
with the dilemma of aidsinfected children in school 
from kokomo ind and ocilla ga which banished students in a 
frenzy of irrational fears to swansea mass and a hispanic 
neighborhood in chicago where understanding and reason triumphed 
learning by heart is a mirror on humanity and sometimes 
inhumanity 
aids is a very powerful light on us kirp said in an 
interview how do we deal with a crisis that directly touches our 
lives most of the time we dont get to make moral decisions 
his book kirp said is really about america at its absolute 
best and absolute most meanspirited 
a newspaper columnist magazine writer and professor of public 
policy at berkeley kirp said he had a fantasy i could write this 
like politics and policy a dry treatise on how communities 
behave 
instead he found himself repeatedly on the verge of tears or 
anger as he interviewed families and school administrators and 
government officials he even dreamed about one young aids victim 
after a particularly affecting encounter 
i didnt know what would lie ahead of me along the way kirp 
said but for all the sad moments when terrible things are 
happening to good people you find people who are behaving with 
amazing nobility they are really ordinary heroes 
kirp did several drafts of the book moving away from a 
judgmental stance 
doctors can tell parents over and over that aids is transmitted 
only through blood and semen that classroom contact is virtually 
riskfree yet fear persists 
among the most trying tales was that of ocilla where white 
administrators barred from school three black children with 
aidsstricken relatives tests showed that none of the children 
carried the virus but the superintendent insisted there were no 
absolutes in dealing with aids 
you want an absolute ill give you one dr lynn feldman a 
local health officer shot back in frustration you cant get 
aids from someone who doesnt have it 
teenager ryan whites protracted fight to attend kokomo schools 
was one of the first involving an aids victim and one of the most 
widely publicized i tried not to add to the chorus of 
condemnation kirp said in 1984 when the story was breaking 
the unknowns were so great the ifs and the fears my real 
unhappiness about the kokomo story is that they got stuck there 
opposing ryans return and could never get dislodged 
the whites eventually moved away from kokomo to a less hostile 
setting ryan told his mother i didnt want to die there 
the swansea story was equally poignant but altogether different 
there a popular teenager with a passion for baseball was welcomed 
back by school administrators health officials schoolmates and 
their parents after he contracted aids they were better than 
they had to be wrote kirp 
the boy mark hoyle 13 eventually died but not before he 
returned to school read macbeth in english class learned how 
to bake a yellow cake in cooking class and won the science fair 
with an exhibit on the wonders of the human eye 
kirp found some common threads in communities that reacted 
nobly wellinformed school authorities and involved local doctors 
who held lots of meetings to educate parents and let them vent 
their fears and who talked about the ill child as one of us as 
opposed to one of them 
the most spectacular example of tactics that backfired was in 
new york city where authorities let parents know exactly 48 hours 
in advance that a secondgrade aids victim would be attending 
school somewhere in the vast anonymous metropolis the result was 
furious parents a massive boycott and a court case ultimately 
decided in favor of the city 
at one point in his book kirp comments that it seems strange 
that a question as basic as the rights of children with aids should 
be decided locally he concludes with criticism of the reagan 
administration accusing the former president of a silence that set 
cities and towns adrift as they tried to cope 
the historians will wonder how it was that the nations 
president through much of the decade could have been mute on 
aids for so long and when he finally spoke out could have been so 
inarticulate kirp wrote the right words from the president 
at the right moment could have made all the difference 
kirp recalled what happened to the three aidsstricken ray boys 
of arcadia fla their home was burned to the ground in 1987 after 
their parents had fought to enroll them in school 
i just got furious thinking of that kirp said what 
happened in places like arcadia and kokomo made no sense powerful 
signals from washington could have changed attitudes but there was 
nobody in washington communicating any sort of moral message

the use of socalled tropical oils by us 
food manufacturers has fallen considerably in recent years but the 
agriculture department says it wont make much difference 
economically 
imported products such as palm oil palm kernel oil and coconut 
oil have been attacked vigorously by many us farm and consumer 
interests because of their high levels of saturated fats and 
possible effects on health 
the departments economic research service says the united 
states used about 145 billion pounds of fats and oils in food 
products in the last year but that only 550 million pounds or 4 
percent were tropical oils 
soybean oil accounted for more than 10 billion pounds corn oil 
950 million pounds and cottonseed oil 800 million animal fats 
lard and tallow totaled about 11 billion pounds other sources 
of vegetable oil include sunflower seed and rapeseed 
major edible uses of fats and oils are salad and cooking oils 
baking and frying fats and margarine 
economists bob cummings and jim schaub said that use of tropical 
oils in the united states may average about 184 billion pounds 
since 1985 but the portion used in food products is expected to 
average only about 650 million pounds a year down from the record 
16 billion pounds in the mid1970s 
in 1986 the american soybean association after watching palm 
oil and other tropical oils nudge into the lucrative us market 
launched a campaign highlighting the health benefits of soybean 
oils relatively low saturated fat content 
cummings and schaub writing in the may issue of agricultural 
outlook magazine said the soybean people were joined by the 
national heart savers association which began promoting the use of 
oils low in saturated fats 
tropical oil interests deny adverse health effects and the 
malaysian palm oil growers council has mounted an information 
campaign and has underwritten medical studies to support its case 
but cummings and schaub said saturated fats have been linked 
with high blood cholesterol levels and heart disease citing last 
years report by the us surgeon general recommending reduced 
intake of dietary fats especially saturated fats 
several major food companies have eliminated tropical oils in 
all or most of their products and others plan to follow 
if edible use of tropical oils were cut 50 percent the effect 
on us fats and oils markets would be marginal because these oils 
are only a small portion of total use the economists said in 
their report substitute oils would capture some of the small 
market share held by tropical oils 
the report added prices also would be little affected those 
manufacturers using large quantities of relatively lowpriced palm 
oil would experience the largest impact consumers would hardly be 
affected because tropical oils account for only a small part of 
the price of finished food products 
cummings and schaub also said that a 50 percent reduction in 
us food use of tropical oils would have little effect on us 
imports and world trade and the effect on suppliers such as 
malaysia would likewise be minor

a final order is expected to be issued soon by 
the agriculture department clearing the way for a watermelon 
checkoff plan to finance a national research and promotion program 
the departments agricultural marketing service said the next 
steps after the formal order is to hold meetings and solicit 
nominations for a 29member board that will oversee the program 
those nominations are expected to be submitted by the end of july 
after a board is selected a proposed spending budget will be 
drawn up and submitted for review the agency says it may be fall 
or later before everything is wrapped up 
in any case the watermelon assessments which are mandatory 
but can be refunded are expected to be ready for 1990 production 
the assessments and the program were authorized by congress in 
the 1985 farm law a referendum was held in february in which 
approximately 52 percent of the growers and 56 percent of the 
handlers approved the plan 
agency officials said an estimated 7000 watermelon producers 
and handlers would be covered by the checkoff program 
the assessment to be recommended by the board and then set by 
usda can be levied at rate of up to two cents per 100 pounds of 
watermelons sold by producers and two cents per 100 pounds for 
handlers 
all producers of watermelons having five acres or more and first 
handlers are required to pay the assessment a grower of five acres 
or more who also handles watermelons would have to pay both 
assessments

not since the 1970s when the snail darter 
took a run at a dam on the little tennessee river has the 
endangered species act been the focus of a dispute as acrimonious 
as that surrounding the northern spotted owl 
the tellico dam was eventually completed but only after a 
lengthy and bruising battle over the darter a tiny fish that 
reached the us supreme court congress and the carter white house 
at stake in the spotted owl showdown is the fate of some of the 
oldest forests on earth and the role of logging so rich a part of 
the heritage of the pacific northwest in the economic future of 
washington state oregon and northern california 
a mediumsized mostly nocturnal bird the spotted owl is 
fiercely territorial and nests almost exclusively in the 
cathedrallike ancient forests of the northwest the trees in these 
stands average 500 years in age with some of the giants up to 1000 
years old 
when the first settlers arrived in the early 1800s more than 20 
million acres of oldgrowth forest dominated the landscape no one 
is quite sure how much remains with estimates ranging from 2 
million acres to 6 million acres 
but if current levels of logging continue over the next 
halfcentury the only suitable spotted owl habitat remaining may 
be in wilderness areas and the national parks 
environmentalists have used the owl as part of a campaign aimed 
at halting logging of these virgin stands of timber the bulk of 
which are on federal land 
oldgrowth timber is among the most coveted by the industry and 
dozens of onemill towns in the northwest are economically 
dependent on logs cut in federal forests 
the national forest products association claims that protection 
of the owl could result in the elimination of 280000 direct and 
indirect jobs in the northwest 
conservationists say those estimates are hysterical and peg 
the job loss at about 2300 they also insist that if all the 
remaining spotted owl habitat is protected the timber harvest on 
federal lands would be reduced no more than 25 percent over the 
next 50 years 
the us fish and wildlife service reversing a reagan 
administration decision that congressional investigators found was 
based more on politics than biology proposed last week that the 
owl be protected as a threatened species under the endangered 
species act 
the agency found that about 1500 breeding pair of owls remain 
and that without protection their numbers could be cut in half by 
the year 2050 
a species is considered threatened if it is likely to become 
an endangered species in the foreseeable future throughout all or a 
significant portion of its range 
the agency now has up to two years to decide whether to actually 
list the owl but once the recommendation is published in the 
federal register in the next few weeks federal agencies will be 
required to consult with the fish and wildlife service before 
taking any action that would affect spotted owl habitat 
such actions could presumably include timber sales in the 
national forests and logging of billions of board feet of timber 
already under contract 
some have already suggested that the endangered species act be 
amended to exclude the spotted owl from listing though few 
lawmakers find the prospect politically palatable similar 
suggestions were made when the battle over the snail darter was 
raging 
interior secretary manuel lujan in a comment that sent shock 
waves through the environmental community suggested the act might 
be changed to take into account the economic impact of listing a 
species 
the fish and wildlife service is now allowed to consider only 
biological factors when deciding whether to list a species 
the congressional general accounting office found that top 
interior officials had pressured the fish and wildlife services 
regional director in portland ore to reject a petition to list 
the owl 16 months ago 
this time a spokesman for lujan said the decision was strictly 
up to regional director marvin plenert 
no one beat on me plenert said 
steve goldstein lujans spokesman said that in such a highly 
charged atmosphere it would have been inappropriate for us to do 
anything but let the regional director make the decision 
however he said future decisions affecting the owl could 
possibly be reviewed at a higher level 
although they are pleased by the listing conservationists are 
still reserving judgment on the bush administrations claim to 
environmental respectability 
from a political point of view this was inevitable said 
george frampton president of the wilderness society based on 
the scientific evidence they had no choice there would have been 
an uproar if they hadnt 
jim pissot a wildlife specialist with the national audubon 
society said there are indications that the regional directors 
decision raised a few eyebrows within the interior department 
but biologists and legal staff insisted this was their only 
course of action he said

after discussing west germanys 
demand for early talks on cuts in shortrange nuclear weapons 
chancellor helmut kohl and prime minister margaret thatcher of 
britain remained firmly divided on what has become a major nato 
dispute 
both leaders reported making little progress during an afternoon 
of talks sunday on an issue that has split the alliance describing 
their talks as frank and intensive 
kohl assured mrs thatcher of his countrys firm allegiance to 
nato whose leaders meet in brussels at the end of the month for a 
summit 
the west german leaders call last week for prompt superpower 
negotiations on shortrange nuclear weapons has placed him in a 
battle of wills with mrs thatcher and president bush 
we still have quite a lot of work to do kohl told reporters 
during a joint news conference with mrs thatcher after sundays 
talks in this village west of the rhine river city of mannheim 
however kohl said he thought the issue could be worked out 
before the brussels summit mrs thatcher also expressed optimism 
but stressed that all north atlantic treaty organization nations 
need to agree on a common position 
the british leader said any suggestion of eliminating 
shortrange nuclear weapons in europe is unacceptable and 
dangerous at one point she appeared to question kohls position 
on the issue 
im sure mr kohl will correct me if i have misunderstood him 
on this issue said mrs thatcher 
kohl responded by having his interpreter read a line from his 
speech to parliament last week in which he rejected the total 
elimination of the tactical nuclear weapons under the present 
balance of military forces in europe 
washington and london say talks on reducing shortrange nuclear 
arsenals should not begin as long as the sovietled warsaw pact has 
a superiority in conventional forces they also argue that it would 
be hard to stop talks from ending in the total elimination of 
shortrange forces that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
advocates 
the west germans say superpower arms talks should be attempted 
on a broad scale in light of the current disarmament climate in 
moscow they remind their allies that most of natos shortrange 
nuclear weapons are based in west germany and would be used 
exclusively on german soil in the event of war 
critics of the west german position say it divides and weakens 
the alliance at a time nato must show unity on defense 
mrs thatcher said elimination of shortterm weapons would mean 
the soviet union will have achieved its objective of getting 
landbased nuclear weapons out of europe this i believe would be 
disastrous 
throughout the 40minute news conference mrs thatcher 
repeatedly returned to the topic of flexible response and the 
necessity of upgrading natos aging tactical weapons arsenal 
flexible response is not just something you mouth mrs 
thatcher said strength must continue not only in words strength 
has to be translated into weaponry 
she added that the missiles must be upgraded because obsolete 
weapons do not deter 
under the flexible response policy the allies could respond to 
a soviet bloc attack with either conventional or nuclear weapons 
kohl faced with uncertain election prospects next year wants 
to delay until at least 1992 a decision on modernization and 
deployment of the lance shortrange nuclear rockets 
recent polls show that the majority of west germans no longer 
believe the soviet union to be a military threat 
kohl while reaffirming his commitment to natos flexible 
response strategy was also adamant that the west german position 
on missile talks be acknowledged 
he said he hoped a joint document which takes our special 
situation into account could be prepared at the brussels summit 
and that has nothing at all to do with the germans having 
become unreliable or anything like that kohl said referring to 
suggestions that west germany is no longer following agreed upon 
nato doctrine

newt gingrich seems to be taking out his 
frustrations on the pavement as he sets off on a 6 am walk down 
washingtons mall 
the morning newspaper includes a poll showing that twothirds of 
americans arent paying much attention to the ethics problems of 
house speaker jim wright and just 37 percent know that hes a 
democrat gingrich the newly elected no 2 leader of house 
republicans is annoyed 
my party is simply not an aggressive tough competitor 
compared to the democrats he says in full stride in hiking 
boots and a sweatsuit as the sun begins to rise on the dogwoods and 
azaleas on the capitol lawn 
given a comparable problem at any given moment republicans 
are slower and softer and vaguer we are not in the habit of going 
out and being tough were in the habit of being a minority 
what should the republicans be doing in the case of jim wright 
who has been charged by the ethics committee with 69 violations of 
house rules 
heres a chance to say over and over again its sad but you 
can understand after 35 consecutive years of being in power why the 
democrats are having a hard time gingrich says making his 
favorite link between power and corruption 
republicans have a chance to communicate whats wrong with the 
way the house is currently run were not using it its as though 
somebody filled up a theater for us and our side decided not to 
perform 
gingrich the strident conservative whose complaint last year 
launched the ethics case against wright seems to be having some 
trouble making the transition from gadfly to statesman 
the georgia lawmaker has had some early successes in his new job 
as gop whip lining up an organization that includes not only his 
supporters but also some oldline moderates and he demonstrated 
votecounting skills last week when he was one of the few to 
foresee a chance to win a key budget vote on the house floor 
but it has been difficult for him to follow the advice of senior 
republicans who have told him to sit out the jim wright affair 
everybody pretty much agrees that for right now it doesnt 
serve anyones interests to have newt as the spokesman says rep 
vin weber rminn a close gingrich ally its very delicate 
right now members of the house may be asked to act as jurors its 
very hard for him to play any kind of a role in that environment 
the country should not see republican members of congress as a 
hanging jury 
part of gingrichs problem has been his inability to sell the 
notion that there is a clear link between a politicians ideology 
and his ethics he has been striving to make that case in recent 
weeks pointing to bigcity democratic political machines as 
evidence that the partys ethical problems extend beyond washington 
ethics is in the long run a devastating issue if youre on the 
wrong side of it he says an occasional jogger slows to stare at 
this prematurely gray former history professor who is bustling 
along the mall keeping up a steady patter of politics before 
breakfast 
those democrats who want to gamble that jim wrights little 
problems will disappear are welcome to do it but its both 
historically and morally wrong and theyre going to find that 
politically its a disaster 
disaster seems to be one of gingrichs favorite words along 
with profound fundamental and the phrase corrupt 
liberal welfare state 
when pressed gingrich concedes that the republicans have had 
their own ethics problems watergate and more recently deaver and 
meese which have been costly but without elaborating he insists 
those have been less systematic than the moral shortcomings of 
the other party and he doesnt mention his own book promotion 
deal which is being brought to the ethics committees attention by 
house democrats 
its almost impossible to convince the american people that 
one party is the clean party and the other is the corrupt party 
weber says they tend to view us all as the same there is no 
clear partisan advantage 
despite his beliefs gingrich has been trying lately to suppress 
his instinct to batter wright publicly and at a national press 
club speech last week he wore a button that said moderates make 
a difference 
i obviously am more cautious now that im whip because i dont 
just speak for newt gingrich he said i speak for 174 other 
republicans in the house

the case of a father accused of killing his 
comatose son by disconnecting him from a respirator is going to 
court and two past cases fared very differently in the nations 
courtrooms 
rudy linares a 23yearold house painter from west suburban 
cicero is charged with firstdegree murder in the death of his 
severely braindamaged son samuel at rushpresbyterianst lukes 
medical center 
police say linares kept nurses in the pediatric intensivecare 
unit at bay with a handgun while he disconnected the 16monthold 
boys respirator wednesday and cradled him until he was sure the 
baby was dead 
i think he was definitely in a state of irreversible 
vegetative coma said the boys physician dr gilbert goldman 
director of the pediatric intensive care unit my opinion was 
that recovery was not possible 
yet the hospital refused the familys request that the 
respirator be turned off contending that illinois law prohibits 
withdrawing lifesupport unless the patient is already legally dead 
three years ago a 25yearold miami father was sentenced to 
life in prison for killing his comatose 3yearold daughter whom 
he shot with a pistol as she lay in her hospital crib eight months 
after she had been injured in an accident 
an illinois case that began six years ago has a vastly different 
history 
in that case charges against a beecher veterinarian who 
admitted crushing the head of his severely deformed newborn son 
were dismissed by a judge after two juries failed to reach a 
verdict 
in both instances the legal battles are dragging on 
charles leroy griffith of miami is appealing his sentence which 
carries a mandatory 25year term in the hope of obtaining a new 
trial in the shooting of his daughter joy 
he never denied the act the girl had been in a coma for eight

marilyn quayle is keeping an 
independent schedule and pursuing a separate agenda as she tours 
the pacific with her husband vice president dan quayle 
in australia the quayles first stop on their 12day trip mrs 
quayle frequently went her own way 
while quayle visited a pub she toured a childrens hospital 
while he met with australian prime minister bob hawke she went 
sightseeing at the national art gallery while he dropped by a 
tennis clinic she taught an elementary school class and when he 
teed off for golf she signed up for a tennis lesson 
if you want to go out and see the country go with marilyn 
quayle said at the beginning of the trip he called her schedule 
the more interesting of the two 
since quayle assumed office a little over three months ago mrs 
quayle 39 has kept a low profile rarely granting interviews and 
jealously guarding her familys privacy 
an attorney by training mrs quayle has not practiced her 
profession in over a decade though she told a group of school 
children in melbourne australia that she wouldnt mind returning 
to law 
in my original job i was a lawyer but since my husband 
became vice president ive had a lot of duties to perform for 
him she said 
so im not sure i can practice law although i would like 
to 
having apparently ruled out that career path for now questions 
have arisen over how mrs quayle plans to define her new role 
barbara bush for instance used the second ladys slot as a 
platform to promote literacy and nancy reagan pushed the just 
say no program to fight drugs when she was first lady 
before the quayles left on their trip the vice president was 
asked what role his wife would adopt 
quayle made light of the question responding she has a very 
major cause and a very major interest a very complex and 
consuming issue with her and that is me 
but on this trip mrs quayle made it clear she had her own 
interests interests which often kept her out of her husbands way 
when he dealt with substantive topics such as grain exports 
in addition to her official duties she will also pursue her 
interest in disaster relief and disaster preparedness mrs 
quayles office said in a statement explaining her trip schedule 
in canberra mrs quayle was briefed on australias national 
disasters organization a group that responds to floods cyclones 
and other such events 
in indonesia mrs quayle will travel from the capital to learn 
about coping with volcanic eruptions and in singapore shell find 
out about cleaning up oil spills 
on her first foreign trip as the vice presidents wife mrs 
quayle seems to have adapted to her new status whether standing 
somberly by her husbands side at a war memorial or dancing with 
him at a blacktie ball 
during a treeplanting ceremony mrs quayle referred formally 
to her husband who says he likes to be called dan as the vice 
president and she has handed out souvenirs marilyn quayle 
signature key rings embossed with pictures of the vice presidential 
mansion in washington 
but she doesnt seem entirely comfortable with the constant 
media scrutiny 
ive done my duty she told reporters aboard air force two 
after chatting for about two minutes four days into the trip 
in fact mrs quayle seems to have some ambivalence about her 
role 
asked by a school child whether she ever thought she would be 
the wife of the vice president she replied it wasnt on my 
agenda

the fate of a man who held hospital workers at 
bay as he disconnected his comatose son from a lifesupport machine 
is at the heart of a controversy over laws governing hopelessly ill 
children 
rudy linares has been released on bail after being charged with 
firstdegree murder for removing his severely braindamaged 
16monthold son from a lifesupport system 
a tearful linares the father of two other children cradled the 
boy in his arms wednesday until the child died 
the boy was to be buried today in a private service at which his 
father was expected to attend 
prosecutors the hospital and the boys doctor contend that laws 
prohibit anyone from disconnecting mechanical life support even 
from severely braindamaged youngsters who are not expected to ever 
recover 
on the other side are defense lawyers and other physicians and 
attorneys who argue that the same laws along with court rulings 
and accepted practice protect doctors and parents from criminal 
liability when they decide to end futile treatment 
it is our fervent hope that a case like this doesnt become a 
precedent or a landmark because the issues are so unclear they 
are so murky at this point said richard scholz the public 
defender for linares 
linares 23 a house painter from suburban cicero and his 
21yearold wife tamara had requested months ago that 
lifesupport be withdrawn from their son samuel who swallowed a 
balloon at a birthday party in august and almost suffocated but 
hospital officials say the family did not seek the required court 
order 
despite extensive medical efforts to revive him when the 
accident occurred the boy was definitely in a state of 
irreversible vegetative coma said his physician dr gilbert 
goldman my opinion was that recovery was not possible 
but there was no legal precedent for turning off the respirator 
that kept samuel alive said goldman director of pediatric 
intensive care at rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center 
max brown a hospital lawyer said goldman and the hospital 
could have left themselves open to prosecution under illinois 
childabuse laws or worse been charged with murdering the boy 
he was not braindead brown said he was not dead 
according to any legally or medically accepted criteria 
such a criterion is not required under any existing laws said 
fenella rouse legal director of the society for the right to die 
in new york city 
in a case like this for a child withdrawing ventilator 
support is not the least bit controversial she said in a 
telephone interview friday 
courts in florida michigan and georgia have supported the 
decisions of parents to end lifesupport in such cases ms rouse 
said and most importantly nobody has ruled to the contrary 
moreover linares is wrongly charged with murder for 
disconnecting his son from the ventilator she said 
theres no doubt about it its legal its just as legal for 
the father to do it as for the hospital to do it she said 
ms rouse noted that murder charges in a 1983 california case 
against two physicians who withdrew lifesupport from an adult man 
were struck down 
i think its conceivable he could be charged with trespass or 
illegal use of a handgun or threatening behavior but as far as i 
understand criminal law he cannot be charged with something like 
this she said of linares 
prosecutors disagree 
under no circumstances does any person have the right to take 
the life of another said cook county states attorney cecil a 
partee who added he could understand the emotions of a distraught 
parent in such a case 
the linares family had been advised early about the possibility 
of obtaining an order in cook county circuit court for the hospital 
to disconnect the ventilator and the hospital would have been 
supportive brown said 
why they did not do that i dont know he said 
dr stanley schade chief of hematology at the university of 
illinois hospital and chairman of its ethics committee said some 
legal authorities would say a court order is necessary for 
withdrawal of lifesupport but he believes dealing with the next 
of kin is sufficient 
but brown said that just because something is done doesnt mean 
it is legal 
we dont like to be in the center of the storm like this but 
we are following the law and abiding by the law he said i 
will be glad to change our hospital procedures but the law has to 
be changed first

radio and tv stations could help take 
discussion of sex and aids out of the locker room and into the 
nations living rooms but the language must be frank enough to 
persuade skeptical teens to practice safe sex broadcasters were 
told 
panelists at a national association of broadcasters convention 
said sunday that broadcasters can expect heavy criticism from some 
groups for public discussions of safe sex but if they stick to 
their guns they also can change minds 
americans need direct language about sexuality itself about 
sexual behavior about sexual decision making so that its not 
euphemistic and abstract and something they cant mentally cue 
into said mary lee tatum a sex educator at george mason 
university 
she said too often movies and television treat sex as a dirty 
joke or as something in which people lose their reasoning 
abilities in fits of passion at the same time kids are told by 
authority figures to think before they have sex they often dont 
listen she said 
were hindered by the fact that we think that any serious talk 
about any kind of sexual behavior is pornographic she said 
critics can be a potent force against frank public 
discussions of sex but another panelist william miller of ktvktv 
in phoenix said it is important that broadcasters take a chance 
these kinds of campaigns take a lot of guts because initially 
youre really hit with an awful lot of rejection miller said 
but he said broadcasters have a lot to do with determining 
whats acceptable and whats not acceptable and how we talk to 
people within our society 
he said his station found it difficult to find corporate backers 
for an antiaids campaign because theres a stigma with aids 
they were afraid of being the aids electric company the aids 
convenience store 
but peoples minds can be changed miller said noting that a 
phoenix catholic bishops position on public service announcements 
about condoms changed so that now he is one of the most 
supportive people we have 
after you see some of these things on television it becomes 
easier to talk about the subject a lot of it is up to us he 
said 
tatum said educators are looking for good visual material on 
aids and would welcome broadcasters assistance 
toby pate marketing director at kpixtv in san francisco said 
her stations emmy awardwinning public service show aids 
lifeline is being distributed to stations in 55 cities and is 
being used by schools 
reed tuckson public health commissioner for washington dc 
said the rate of new aids cases is declining in areas with heavy 
gay populations while it is increasing in areas outside urban 
centers 
he said such statistics show the value of public education 
campaigns 
the panel discussion attracted less than 30 audience members at 
this convention which is being attended by nearly 50000 
broadcasters 
one member of the audience delbert lewis also from the phoenix 
station said he was angry that more broadcasters had not 
taken this ball and run with it and expounding more on the aids 
problem we could do more he said 
another audience member jordan cohen of wfmj in youngstown 
ohio said the fact that this room is nowhere near full not even 
50 percent shows that there still is maybe a lot of educating to 
be done among our own 
an nab official said the organization for the past 18 months has 
been distributing aids spots and written material to radio and tv 
stations along with suggestions for possible campaigns 
nab also has been helping distribute material from elizabeth 
taylors antiaids program americans for aids research said rory 
benson an nab vice president in charge of public service 
activities 
we didnt have any negative feedback she said in an 
interview 
a new campaign to be launched before the end of the year will 
allow stations to target highrisk groups with more explicit 
material she said

as the northeast sweats out the prospect of 
another summer of electricity shortages much of the rest of the 
country is nearly drowning in power 
government and industry officials say utilities in new england 
and new york may be forced to impose brownouts or brief 
periods of reduced voltage if this summer brings a heat wave as 
intense as last years 
a power glut in other areas meanwhile is creating problems of 
a different sort 
public service co of new mexico is drowning in surplus power 
last month state regulators in effect penalized the utility for 
having invested in power projects that today are not needed the 
utility facing financial peril stopped paying dividends on its 
stock 
we still stand in a very precarious state says rick 
brinneman a public service spokesman 
the disparate power supplies raises a question of growing 
urgency why cant regions with too much power send their surplus 
to areas with shortages 
the answer lies in the fragmented nature of americas electric 
power grid 
while it is physically possible to transfer power from one area 
to another and it is done regularly between some western states 
there is no nationally integrated transmission system and no master 
plan for relieving regional bottlenecks 
ashley brown a member of the ohio public utilities commission 
calls the nations inability to balance its regional power needs 
a travesty 
if you came from mars and looked at the new england states 
and at the midwest which we can say charitably is endowed with no 
shortage of capacity and you saw that we cant get power from one 
place to another there is no logical explanation for that he 
told a meeting of state utility regulators 
some officials say the northeasts power squeeze may be even 
more severe in a few years as growing demand for electricity 
outstrips the regions stagnant supply 
the nearterm outlook for the electricity system in much of 
the northeast is grim unless the shoreham nuclear plant in new 
york and new hampshires seabrook plant are activated said henson 
moore the deputy energy secretary local opposition to the plants 
makes their operation unlikely 
in the pacific northwest the bonneville power administration 
has so much excess electrical generating capacity that it is 
holding back on conservation measures that could save power equal 
to the yearly output of 1 nuclear power plants 
it would just exacerbate our surplus says lee johnson of 
the agencys washington office 
electricity rates in much of the northwest rose after a 
consortium of utilities after sinking 22 billion into a pair of 
nuclear plants abandoned them for lack of power demand northwest 
consumers also are paying 14 million a year to keep two other 
nuclear plants in mothballs 
despite the regional disparities the united states as a whole 
enjoys a comfortable balance between electricity supply and demand 
in 1987 the latest year for which such figures are available the 
nations utilities had the capacity to provide 23 percent more 
power than was needed the margin of reserve power varied however 
by region 
a comprehensive study of the electric power industry published 
last month by arthur anderson amp co and the cambridge energy 
research associates said no single measure exists for 
measuring the nations power transfer capability 
some utilities are striking deals on their own the los angeles 
department of water and power for example put together a group of 
western utilities to build a coalfired generating plant in utah 
with one transmission line to serve utah and nevada and another to 
supply power to los angeles 
larry hobart executive director of the american public power 
association representing the nations publicly owned utilities 
says the los angeles deal showed how longdistance power transfers 
can help a major city avoid the environmental controversy and cost 
of building new power plants in its own area 
there are transactions taking place that wouldnt have been 
dreamed of 10 years ago hobart said in an interview 
but such arrangements are more difficult in the densely 
populated eastern states 
the new hampshire and west virginia state governments have 
proposed building a new power transmission line to provide the 
northeast with coalfired power from west virginia but the 
obstacles to winning agreement from the states in between are 
formidable 
power transfers are gaining prominence in part because they are 
an alternative to building new generating capacity utilities are 
reluctant to commit the huge sums needed to build new plants 
largely because the memory of overbuilding in the 1970s before 
energy demand slumped is still fresh 
its a financial trap that utilities such as public service co 
of new mexico are still struggling to escape it sank 12 billion 
into the palo verde nuclear project in arizona the nations 
largest nuclear generating station in the 1970s when electricity 
use was growing at a 7 percent annual clip demand fell before the 
project was completed 
its an odd catch22 said brinneman you plan for the 
very eventuality that the east is now going through and yet a 
utility can suffer dire consequences if that doesnt occur

scott leffel straddled a motor scooter 
behind the sigma alpha epsilon house and reflected on a future 
prerequisite for fraternity parties at washington state university 
good grades 
im not too happy with it actually said leffel a 
sophomore it seems like the university is continually working 
against us rather than with us 
but the no grades no parties rule that will take effect 
next year wasnt the brainstorm of a scheming college dean trying 
to rid the campus of an animal house 
the greeks often considered synonymous with parties imposed 
this rule on themselves to bolster their image and academic 
standing 
beginning next spring semester a fraternity will have to forgo 
parties for two weeks for every 005 point that its gradepoint 
average for the preceding fall semester falls below the average gpa 
for all male undergraduates 
the rule believed to be the first of its kind for an entire 
campus fraternity system was adopted by the intrafraternity 
council on a 221 vote of chapter presidents the 16000student 
school has 25 fraternities with a total of 1400 members 
council vice president tom gallagher said his fraternity lambda 
chi alpha would have been pinched if partying penalties had been 
imposed based on last falls grades but that hasnt dampened his 
enthusiasm for the rule he helped develop 
gallagher and council president gary downing said the policy 
attracted much interest at a western regional conference of 
fraternities they attended recently in oakland calif 
the ifc leadership wanted to send a message that kind of flew 
in the face of the stereotypical perception of greeks that all 
theyre here for is to party said jack burns fraternities 
coordinator for the residence life and housing office he said he 
wasnt aware of a similar campuswide rule anywhere else 
some fraternity brothers question the correlation between grade 
point average and keggers though 
maybe the problem isnt just with the partying maybe its 
with the teachers and stuff you know said leffel of sig ep i 
mean a lot of my tas teaching assistants are from foreign 
countries and when i go in there to try and talk econ i cant 
even understand this guy 
you can party as much as you want and still make good 
grades said a member of alpha gamma rho who was among a group 
soaking up sunshine on the fraternitys lawn recently its just 
a matter of budgeting your time 
some fraternity members claim the university pressured the 
fraternity council to adopt the rule with some suggesting that 
president sam smith is bent on making the campus dry 
smith dismisses those suggestions although he praised the 
council for its move 
if we tried to put in a rule like this it would be fought 
smith said 
under the new system even a fraternity whose members get 
straight fs wont have to abandon all merriment the rules set a 
maximum penalty of 10 partyfree weeks penalized houses will get 
to pick which weeks theyll spend on the social sidelines 
gary downing of delta upsilon said that if the rule was in 
effect this semester based on last falls grades 14 houses would 
have been penalized with three drawing the maximum of 10 weeks 
delta upsilon would have been forced to drop parties for two weeks 
he said 
enforcing those sanctions could be problematic though says dan 
thumlert a sophomore at sigma alpha epsilon houses could avoid 
any party ban just as many have gone around another recent rule 
prohibiting buying kegs of beer with a house check he said 
you just do it through a private account said thumlert 
and weve had more kegs this year than we had last year

a broadranging study drafted by the commerce 
department recommends a coordinated government policy to halt the 
erosion of the us electronics industry department officials say 
jack mcphee director of the office of computers and business 
equipment said the report calls for development of a coordinated 
policy led by the vice presidents council on competitiveness 
he said work on the study which was requested by the house 
appropriations committee has been going on since last november 
we are now putting the finishing touches on an initial draft 
to run around the policy areas at commerce with the obvious 
intention of eventually sending it to congress after everybody has 
concurred on what it should say mcphee said 
he noted that many of the things that we recommend or concur 
with in the report are things that are under way or may be slightly 
beyond where things are whether its antitrust or research and 
development policy or science and engineering policy its a 
very broad report 
mcphee declined to give further details on the studys findings 
saying the report was not ready for public release 
the council on competitiveness chaired by vice president dan 
quayle was established in late march to review regulatory and 
other issues bearing on us competitiveness around the world its 
members include attorney general dick thornburgh treasury 
secretary nicholas brady budget director richard darman and 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher 
william krist vice president for international trade of the 
american electronics association an industry group said he had 
reviewed a draft copy of the commerce study 
it portrays the electronics industry as a strong industry 
having had really good growth but that masks a deep erosion of 
competitive strength because some other countries have increased 
their market share at a much more substantial rate and weve lost 
market share he said 
krist noted that theres no simple solution to this its kind 
of a web of problems it the study deals with a lot of these 
trade problems the cost of capital erosion in the educational 
base 
my impression of it is that its a good report and one 
certainly i hope congress will give a lot of really serious 
attention to he said 
oliver r smoot executive vice president of another industry 
group the computer and business equipment manufacturers 
association said that regardless of what surfaces in commerces 
report we have to keep in mind a fundamental fact about the 
competitiveness of the us electronics industry 
in some product areas us companies used to have 100 percent 
of the market share worldwide because they were the only ones that 
made the items but in that situation any competition from a 
foreign producer means the us companies then have less than 100 
percent 
thats not inherently bad but its an early signal that the 
companies affected by the change must make changes in order to stay 
on top he said 
alan mcadams a cornell university economist and specialist on 
the electronics industry said that in electronics our technology 
base is being rapidly eroded and we are becoming increasingly 
dependent upon foreign suppliers were getting close to the point 
of no return where we will have real difficulty in recovering and 
reestablishing our own industry 
mcadams said he was particularly concerned over loss of us 
companies producing the sophisticated equipment needed to 
manufacture computer chips one of the last such companies in this 
country perkinelmer corp of norwalk conn announced recently 
that it would stop making the equipment 
when perkinelmer is gone thats a real blow he said

cartoonist berke breathed says he will 
discontinue his pulitzer prizewinning comic strip bloom county 
on aug 6 and begin a new sundayonly strip the next month 
the announcement from the washington post writers group was 
reported in todays edition of the post it quoted breathed as 
saying a good comic strip is no more eternal than a ripe melon 
bloom county featuring opus the penguin and a cast of other 
characters from the fictional locale quickly became one of the 
nations most popular comic strips after its introduction in 
december 1980 it is now carried by nearly 800 daily and college 
newspapers 
breathed 31 was awarded the pulitzer prize for distinguished 
cartooning in 1987 
in the announcement breathed said the ugly truth is that in 
most cases comics age less gracefully than their creators bloom 
county is retiring before the stretch marks show 
the cartoonist declined to comment beyond the prepared statement 
but william dickinson general manager and editorial director of 
the writers group which distributes bloom county said breathed 
had been considering such a move for about a year 
this was not an impetuous decision on berkes part 
dickinson said he thinks the strip may be past its peak in some 
way which isnt true but thats his decision 
dickinson declined to give details about the new strip planned 
by breathed it will have a different name he said asked if 
any of the bloom county characters might appear in the new 
strip he said apparently not with maybe one exception 
he declined to elaborate 
six collections of bloom county strips have been published 
by little brown and co with 4 million sold the writers group 
said

three shortrange nuclear weapons that account 
for 5 percent of the total stockpile of us warheads are headed 
for the navy scrap heap officials say 
the weapons originally were intended to provide a nuclear 
deterrent against attacks on surface ships by soviet warships and 
submarines but navy strategists now believe they can protect us 
ships by other means 
so by 1991 the navy will retire the asroc nuclear depth charge 
the subroc missile and the terrier missile a total of 1100 
warheads according to navy officers and documents released under 
the freedom of information act 
the decision to discard the weapons unilaterally was contained 
in documents obtained by an independent analyst william arkin and 
first reported in sunday editions of the new york times it was 
confirmed sunday by navy officers who spoke on condition they not 
be further identified 
it was not clear why the bush administration chose to take the 
step without public announcement and apparently without seeking to 
include the weapons in negotiations with the soviet union 
the decision was prompted by the realization that the united 
states has more aircraft carriers and large surface vessels than 
the soviet union and that such ships are vulnerable to nuclear 
attack said navy officers 
there is a recognition that if there is a nuclear war at sea 
we have got more to lose than the russians the times quoted vice 
admiral henry c mustin who retired last year after serving as 
deputy chief of naval operations 
the concept of a nuclear war at sea is a concept whose time as 
passed it is in the interest of the country to persuade that the 
time has passed mustin said in the published report 
arkin said another reason for the decision appears to be a shift 
in emphasis by the navy from shortrange weapons to nucleartipped 
tomahawk cruise missiles the tomahawk can fly below enemy radar 
and strike targets such as bomber airfields on the soviet 
mainland at ranges up to 1300 miles 
the soviet union has been insisting that the united states agree 
to limit or ban submarinelaunched tomahawk cruise missiles but 
under the reagan administration the navy balked the issue is being 
considered as part of a strategic review being conducted by the 
bush administration to be completed by may 10 
the decision to retire the shortrange nuclear weapons will not 
affect strategic ballistic missiles stationed aboard navy nuclear 
submarines that form a key part of the us nuclear triad land 
air and seabased weapons intended to deter a largescale attack 
said navy officers 
the weapons that are being retired constitute part of the 
american nuclear arsenal that has received little public attention 
in the media or on capitol hill compared to the extensive 
discussions that have occurred on the cruise and ballistic systems 
the asroc nuclear depth charge carried aboard us destroyers 
cruisers and frigates involved in antisubmarine warfare has a 
range of up 62 miles 
the subroc missile is carried by attack submarines and is 
designed to fly at supersonic speeds then drop a nuclear charge 
against enemy submarines 
the terrier antiaircraft missile which entered service in 
1962 is fired from surface warships and has a range of up to 217 
miles according to janes fighting ships an independently 
published military handbook 
arkin said in a telephone interview that the strategy behind the 
decision was outlined in the theater nuclear warfare utilities 
study conducted in january 1988 and supplied to him with 
significant portions blacked out 
as a result of the decision said arkin scores of navy 
destroyers frigates and attack submarines that had been 
nucleararmed will no longer carry nuclear weapons 
it was not clear whether or how much money the defense 
department will save by retiring the shortrange weapons

a navy spokesman has declined comment on a 
report that there was a misfire in a gun at the uss iowas no 1 
turret shortly before the battleships no 2 turret exploded 
killing 47 sailors 
while it is under investigation we cannot comment one way or 
another lt cmdr john marchi said sunday referring to the 
inquiry into the fiery blast aboard the battleship 
the virginianpilot and the ledgerstar of norfolk va 
reported sunday that a survivor of the april 19 explosion petty 
officer kendall l truitt said the misfire occurred during gunnery 
exercises just before the blast ripped through the no 2 turret 
later after the explosion and firefighting attempts they 
still had bullets in turret ones gun truitt said 
the newspaper also reported that survivors said 12 sailors in 
the turret area survived the explosion the navy has said only 11 
men lived 
capt fred p moosally the commander of the ship has said 
there were no indications of any problems with the guns before the 
explosion 
the ships weapons control officer cmdr robert j kissinger 
said earlier this week the guns had passed a rigorous inspection 
that morning they had been fired last in early february he said 
the powder also had been inspected before the exercise 
kissinger said 
the newspaper quoted truitt as saying quick action by gunners 
mate john m mullahy jr prevented the fire from spreading to the 
ships powder magazines 
truitt was contacted by the newspaper at his parents home in 
illinois 
the only survivors in the guns area were those working at the 
bottom level of the turret in the nearby powder magazines and in a 
narrow hallway that ringed the armored turret 
mullahy was on the turrets internal communications system when 
the explosion occurred the newspaper reported unable to raise 
anyone on the upper decks of the sixdeck turret mullahy opened 
the blastproof door between the magazine and the hallway letting 
in the three men who were outside truitt said 
then mullahy opened the door to the powder flats an area on 
the turrets bottom level where powder is temporarily stored on its 
way up to the guns the newspaper reported 
there were no lights only a thick brown haze and a fire burning 
to the right the covers on several 110pound bags of powder were 
also burning the newspaper said mullahy told investigators 
mullahy quickly got out of the powder flats and left the 
magazine which truitt ordered evacuated locking the door behind 
him 
once outside the magazine truitt said mullahy threw emergency 
switches to flood the area 
moosally has said he ordered the magazines flooded seven minutes 
after the blast

monday and the key index on the tokyo stock exchange finished at 
yet another high 
the 225issue nikkei stock average closed at a record 3379317 
gaining 7982 points or 024 percent the index had gained 21252 
points for a record closing of 3371335 on friday 
the dollar finished trading at 13390 yen up 141 yen from

ranged between 1329813390 yen 
traders said the dollar started higher in tokyo following its 
rise in new york overnight 
daiwa banks takamasa yamasaki said the dollar was strong though 
the only economic factor to encourage dollarbuying was market 
players expectation that the central bank is unlikely to raise the 
official interest rate soon 
participants were less inclined to buy the yen because their 
expectation for the interestrate hike seemed to have faded away 
he said 
he said the bank of japan conducted a rate check shortly after 
the trading began and then sold some 100 million by midmorning 
to halt the dollars further rise 
but 100 million would not be enough to reverse the current 
uptrend of the dollar he said adding that the central bank was 
only trying to discourage the markets dollarbuying mood 
the bank of japan does not comment on its monetary activities 
on the stock exchange market trading was quiet mainly because 
of the yens weakness on the foreign exchange and a holiday week 
said an analyst with nomura securities in tokyo speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the index inched up as some participants bought issues including 
steels and real estate but most market players remained on the 
sidelines he said 
stock and exchange markets are to be closed for national 
holidays on wednesday thursday and friday

confetti a speech from president bush and a 
parade marked the celebration of george washingtons inauguration 
200 years ago and the experiment in government it ushered in 
everyone here today can still feel the pulse of history the 
charge and power of that great moment in the genesis of this 
nation bush told more than 4000 people sunday at federal hall 
for a reenactment of the inauguration 
there will be more bicentennial anniversaries including one for 
the passage of the bill of rights in 1991 but sundays events 
capping a week of festivities commemorated the official beginning 
of a new form of government that survives today 
for all of the turmoil and transformation of the last 200 
years there is a great constancy to this office and this 
republic bush said so much of the vision of that first great 
president is reflected in the paths pursued by modern presidents 
after his speech balloons were released confetti and flowers 
were dropped from skyscrapers and military bands kicked off a big 
wallstreettowashingtonsquare parade including military bands 
fife and drum corps and people in colonial garb 
protesters chanted during bushs speech hundreds of seats in a 
special section went unclaimed and several thousand people outside 
the section had to watch a sometimes balky largescreen tv screen 
150 yards away 
and when the standin for george washington arrived in a fancy 
carriage he was greeted with polite applause not the sustained 
cheering that history books say occurred in 1789 
but the sun shone the speeches were short and many who watched 
said they were moved 
there is a sense of history the constitution lives said 
joan marshalldutcher of king of prussia pa whose husband david 
dutcher played washingtons aide col david humphreys in the 
reenactment 
on every continent the people are demanding government by the 
people former chief justice warren e burger declared to the 
crowd this is your constitution it is our constitution lets 
keep it 
its a great thing to commemorate said chris mccarthy 29 
of new york its so easy to take for granted that we have a 
democracy something like this drives home the fact that weve had 
it for so long 
bush and his wife barbara left the parade after a couple of 
blocks to head back to washington dc leaving the parade to 
george himself philadelphia actor william sommerfield who took 
the oath in the reenactment 
on saturday thousands lined the shores to watch fireworks spin 
through the sky on a rainy night 
the rockets and flares painted the sky red white and blue and 
anyone with radios could hear a narration by walter cronkite 
the weekend began with a parade of ships steaming into new york 
harbor as cannon blasts greeted them the biggest were the warship 
uss ticonderoga and the uss macdonaough a guided missile 
destroyer 
the celebrations concluded late sunday with a dinnerdance at 
the waldorfastoria that featured descendants of each of the 40 
presidents 
hilles timpson of quogue on long island is the great 
granddaughter of martin van buren president from 1837 to 1841 but 
she said she did not feel as if her blood was especially 
presidential 
i dont think i have much of any kind im always cold she

harvards undergraduate student council 
has reversed its decision to ask rotc back to the campus declaring 
an earlier vote a violation of the undergraduate constitution 
but the debate is not over 
the university forced reserve officers training corps programs 
from campus in 1969 by declaring the programs extracurricular 
activities without special privileges the move followed a building 
takeover and student strike 
last week the student council voted 4124 to ask the 
administration to negotiate with the military and bring rotc back 
sunday night about 400 students attended the meeting where the 
council voted 4339 against its weekold resolution 
the resolution effectively said bringing rotc back was in 
violation of the student constitution because the program denies 
membership and therefore scholarships to homosexual students 
about 150 activists wearing pink arm bands and tshirts 
demonstrated outside before the meeting and chanted 2468 no 
to rotc gay or straight 
during the debate some students argued that barring rotc may 
deny economically disadvantaged students rotc benefits 
the issue is one of symbolism verses practicality said 
garrett price who supported bringing rotc back 
others said fewer than 20 of the 150 harvard students who take 
part in rotc programs do so at nearby massachusetts institute of 
technology and receive less money from rotc because their program 
was not on campus 
harvard has a needblind admissions policy said deepak 
bhargava a rotc opponent if its not living up to this policy 
we should force it to do so 
although the council reversed itself sunday members next week 
will consider the measure that would approve rotc on campus if the 
military did not bar homosexuals

india today postponed the testfiring of 
its first intermediaterange ballistic missile for a second time 
after a leak was discovered in the rockets liquid fuel propellant 
military sources said 
a military official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
scientists detected the leak minutes before the scheduled launch 
time and attempts to repair it quickly were abandoned three hours 
later 
on april 20 firing of the missile named agni was canceled 
after a lastminute hitch in the ignition system 
the military official said senior defense officers and 
scientists had not yet decided when a third attempt would be made 
the 75ton missile has a range of 1550 miles indian military 
experts say it was to be boosted in the first stage by a solid 
propellant engine and in the second stage by a liquid fuel motor 
a successful launch would make india the sixth nation in the 
world to demonstrate ballistic missile capability the others are 
the united states the soviet union france britain and china 
the agni fire in the hindi language was to have been 
launched from the chandipur test range on the bay of bengal about 
750 miles southeast of new delhi the postponement was met by 
cheers and blowing of conch shells by many of the 12000 villagers 
who were temporarily evacuated from their homes around the launch 
site 
the villagers fear they will be permanently shifted from their 
homes if the missile launch is successful and the test range is 
used for more firings 
agni is the fourth missile india has developed since the 
integrated guided missile development program started in 1983 
india has already testfired three surfacetosurface and 
surfacetoair missiles with ranges from 20 to 155 miles 
defense experts say agnis oneton payload enables it to carry a 
nuclear warhead although new delhi has said its demonstrated 
nuclear capability is for peaceful purposes such as generating 
power 
india exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago and western 
nuclear experts believe scientists can assemble an atomic weapon in 
one week 
the testfiring of the intermediate range ballistic missile is 
intended to be only a technology demonstration of the countrys 
capabilities according to the government

sergio leone the italian director whose widely 
imitated films included the good the bad and the ugly and 
spawned the spaghetti western genre has died at age 60 
he died early sunday of a heart attack at home 
leones career spanned four decades but he is best known for the 
handful of westerns he made in italy during the 1960s typically 
featuring terse gunslinging loners dueling on a spare and 
sunscorched landscape 
his films made an international film star of clint eastwood 
leone the son of a film director vincenzo leone began his film 
career in 1948 as an assistant on vittorio de sicas bicycle 
thief 
he went on to be assistant director on dozens of films 
including ben hur and the last days of pompeii working 
with such hollywood directors as william wyler and fred zinneman 
the first film leone directed was the colossus of rhodes 
one of a series of popular mythological films made in rome in the 
1950s the film won him a wide following and a flood of offers to 
direct similar films 
but the american westerns he saw as a child were what captured 
his imagination and in the early 1960s he began to make a fistful 
of dollars leone paid attention to historical detail and 
attracted a solid cast led by eastwood then an american television 
cowboy leone released the film in 1964 and it was a boxoffice 
smash despite the prevailing opinion that the western genre was in 
decline 
eastwood recalled sunday in california that leone used the 
pseudonym rob robertson to release the movie because in those 
days people didnt want those italian westerns 
leones next film was for a few dollars more in 1965 and 
the good the bad and the ugly in 1966 
the universal attraction of the western is that it is a great 
fable a myth like achilles he told an interviewer in 1968 
for me personally the attraction is the joy of making justice 
without asking permission bang bang 
after the three westerns leone began work on a saga about 
american gangsters in the early 1900s but he fell in love with a 
film he had cowritten once upon a time in the west and 
directed it himself working with a cast that included henry fonda 
and charles bronson he followed it with yet another western 
duck you sucker in 1972 
leone had trouble in the 1970s finding producers who would foot 
the bill for his lavish productions and turned to producing other 
peoples films 
finally in 1983 he managed to finish once upon a time in 
america an impressionistic film using flashbacks and 
flashforwards the movie was praised at the cannes film festival 
and was a hit in france and italy but it was drastically cut for 
its us release and got lukewarm reviews 
leone had been planning to direct a blockbuster film about the 
siege of leningrad by german troops during world war ii 
the directgor who made his home in both italy and france is 
survived by his wife carla and his children raffaela francesca 
and andrea funeral services were scheduled for wednesday

university of utah researchers who claim a major 
breakthrough in cold fusion apparently misinterpreted crucial data 
and may not have achieved fusion according to two massachusetts 
institute of technology scientists 
in a paper they plan to present to the american physical society 
in baltimore tonight the mit scientists question the reported 
level of neutrons emitted during the utah experiment a release of 
neutrons could be a sign that fusion was taking place 
were asserting that their neutron emission was below what 
they thought it was including the possibilty that it could have 
been none at all ronald r parker director of mits plasma 
fusion center said early today 
utah chemist b stanley pons and martin fleischmann of englands 
university of southampton announced on march 23 they had produced 
fusion in a jar at room temperature 
the report has aroused hopes of a cheap and virtually limitless 
supply of clean energy but it also has elicited skepticism from 
many scientists who doubt fusion could take place at anything but 
extremely high temperatures 
parker said mit researchers have been working for weeks to 
verify the utah experiments but their results didnt hold up when 
measured against a standard known as a neutron capture gamma 
spectrum 
if fusion occurred at all it was far below what they 
deduced from their measurements parker said 
part of the problem parker said is that pons and fleischmann 
did not directly measure the neutrons released in their experiment 
the measurement they made was an indirect measurement not of 
neutrons directly but of gamma rays produced by neutrons parker 
said 
the neutrons were taken by many to be an indication that real 
fusion was taking place he said and when you remove the 
neutrons or vastly lower their rate of emission then i think this 
lessens the possibility that fusion has taken place but doesnt 
completely rule it out 
parker conducted his research along with ronald ballinger head 
of mits materials science and engineering and nuclear engineering 
departments 
parker called their findings a warning to not accept all the 
claims at face value and not to expect that theres an overnight 
path to nirvana as far as energy is concerned

two months after 50000 of the 70000 eastern 
european jews living in the vilna ghetto of poland during world war 
ii were slaughtered a theater company was started by some of the 
survivors 
it was an extraordinary event the founding of an artistic 
community at the height of the holocaust to keep alive the spirits 
as well as the lives of those still trapped by its horrors 
the story of the theaters birth in 1942 and its death two years 
later is told disjointedly in joshua sobols ghetto which 
opened sunday at broadways circle in the square theater the play 
even with the addition of songs and music is heavy on philosophic 
discussion and short on dramatic continuity and character 
development 
that might seem strange considering the thousands of 
unspeakable tragedies that occurred in vilna but sobol is more 
concerned with historical events than individuals the events 
some real and some imaginary are told in flashback by srulik a 
ventriloquist and the artistic director of the fabled theater his 
remembrances make for some striking images but confusing story 
lines 
director gedalia besser captures the audiences attention 
immediately as srulik as an old man sits on stage in a hospital 
wheelchair and remembers suddenly the back wall falls and 
mountains of bags containing the clothes of dead jews tumble to the 
floor as a prison wall topped with barbed wire rises in its place 
its a mesmerizing beginning to the play and an image that nots 
topped during the rest of the evening 
in the ghetto srulik carries a ventriloquists dummy played by 
a real actor gordon joseph weiss weiss is made up to look like 
the lascivious master of ceremonies in the musical cabaret the 
dummy is the one occupant of the ghetto who talks back to the nazi 
officers particularly the commandant kittel played with sneering 
ferocity by stephen mchattie 
its kittel who has the idea for the theater company and he 
orders jacob gens the zionist leader of the jewish police in the 
ghetto to carry it out the play eventually becomes an argument 
about the existence of the company between gens and other members 
of the ghetto particularly hermann kruk founder of the ghetto 
library 
gens is a practical man who will sacrifice some jews so others 
can be saved if only jews who work can be kept alive he will give 
them jobs in the theater but kruk is appalled at the idea and 
proclaims in a cemetery there can be no theater 
george hearn as the realistic gens and jarlath conroy as the 
more cultured kruk enunciate their arguments well but not much is 
learned about them from the play except their opposite stands on 
the theater company 
avner eisenberg best known as the clown avner the eccentric 
plays srulik he isnt given much of an opportunity to develop his 
character even though the story is told through his eyes srulik 
serves primarily as an excuse for announcing the various excerpts 
of the companys theatrical productions which are shown only in 
brief segments 
there are a few interesting characters particularly a cabaret 
singer played with heartbreaking desperation by helen schneider 
she sings the songs both original numbers from the ghetto theater 
as well as new material written by william schimmel with 
authenticity and donal donnelly has some incisive moments as a 
tailor who helps organize workers to mend german uniforms and which 
helps keep them alive 
sobols play translated by david lan never develops 
dramatically once the ghetto residents establish the theater 
company it goes from incident to incident without shedding more 
light on the characters or why they participated in it 
the theater finally was closed down by the nazis in 1944 which 
the play depicts in a bloody and unsatisfactory finale even after 
more than two and a half hours the audience is left wondering 
about the inhabitants of vilna marveling at their determination to 
survive but wanting to know a lot more about what they were really 
like than ghetto manages to tell 
in other reviews the new york times frank rich said the 
presentation is lifeless and is aiding rather than combating 
historical amnesia 
in the daily news howard kissel said the play has moments in 
which harsh images come to life but for long stretches it is 
curiously uninvolving 
clive barnes writing in the new york post said sobol has 
theatricalized this fragmentary morality play with great skill

the local communist party chief is complaining 
that safety standards have eased at the chernobyl nuclear power 
plant and welltrained specialists are in short supply at the 
facility 
grigory i revenko first secretary of the kiev region says in 
an article in sundays pravda that workers still are searching for 
the best way to seal the plants no 4 reactor which exploded and 
spewed radiation three years ago last week in the worlds worst 
nuclear accident 
after the april 26 1986 accident which killed at least 31 
people the reactor was encased in concrete to prevent further 
radiation leaks 
revenko a ukrainian who was recently elected to the new soviet 
parliament did not say why additional measures were needed to seal 
the reactor 
while that work continues however problems with the safe 
operation of the station more and more are being moved back to 
second priority revenko wrote in the communist party daily 
the understanding of the acuteness of the problems including 
those concerning the safety of the station has dulled we consider 
this unacceptable and demand decisive intervention by the 
government he said 
other reactors at the plant are working and reportedly have 
generated more than 40 billion kilowatthours of electricity since 
the accident 
revenko 53 said chernobyl workers either have not received the 
equipment and highquality spare parts they need or have received 
them after long delays he also said scientists and technical 
specialists throughout the country are poorly coordinating their 
work on eliminating the accidents consequences 
in addition he said the atomic energy ministry is not sending 
enough workers capable of coping with the special problems at the 
plant 
the threecolumn article said it was taking too long to build 
housing and other buildings for chernobyl plant workers in a new 
town slavutich and that an offlimits contaminated zone around 
the plant is being poorly managed 
recent soviet news reports have said thousands more people will 
be evacuated because their land is contaminated by chernobyl 
radiation and that deformed animals are routinely born on 
contaminated ukrainian farms 
the reports also have complained that despite the kremlins 
policy of greater openness the government recently adopted a rule 
forbidding disclosure of the illnesses people suffer from chernobyl 
contamination

surface operations in international waters when the accident 
occurred at 230 am the statement said 
yoshikazu nakamura of the maritime safety agencys office in 
kagoshima prefecture said there probably were numerous big waves at

boats searched today for the missing sailors 
a japanese defense official who spoke on condition of

soviets marked may day today with a parade through 
red square that focused on efforts to encourage economic growth 
carry out competitive elections and clean up the environment 
in its broadcast of the annual workers celebrations staterun 
television paid tribute to those killed in a proindependence 
demonstration in soviet georgia last month as well as to the 
victims of the armenian earthquake and a fire aboard a nuclear 
submarine 
no parades were held in the armenian and georgian capitals this 
may day out of respect for the dead the official news agency tass 
reported 
in moscow the mood was upbeat and the weather was balmy and 
bright with the emphasis on progress and only general references 
to international issues such as signs extolling peace 
president mikhail s gorbachev and members of the communist 
partys ruling politburo stood atop lenins tomb to view the 
festivities as thousands upon thousands of marchers passed through 
red square waving banners pushing floats and releasing 
heliumfilled balloons 
raisa gorbachev the presidents wife was nowhere to be seen 
the gorbachevs daughter irina and granddaughter oksana were in 
a stand reserved for vips 
us ambassador jack matlock and other western diplomats who 
boycotted the parade to protest the 1979 soviet intervention in 
afghanistan were in their places with the diplomatic corps today 
they returned last year after the soviets announced they would 
withdraw their troops a withdrawal completed in february 
in a section reserved for government dignitaries stood boris n 
yeltsin the communist leader ousted from his post as moscow party 
boss and removed from the politburo but elected to represent the 
soviet capital in the new parliament that meets may 25 
also present were members of a chinese delegation in moscow to 
prepare for gorbachevs visit to beijing this month for the first 
sovietchinese summit in 30 years 
the may day parade unlike the one each revolution day nov 7 
is not a military affair but soviet television interviewed a 
missile commander on the square col gen yuri a yashin who said 
defense industries now devote 40 percent of their production to 
making consumer goods for civilians and plan to increase that share 
to 60 percent in coming years 
its mostly things like refrigerators cars washing machines 
agricultural machinery yashin said reflecting official policy 
to commit more resources to producing consumer goods for a 
productstarved domestic market he said the soviets have destroyed 
860 missiles under the ussoviet treaty to eliminate 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
yashin also said the first military bases covering nearly 
10000 acres have been turned over to the civil sector for farming 
hundreds of signs and red banners held aloft by what tass said 
were 150000 marchers stressed the virtue of work the signs 
carried by the marchers also boosted perestroika gorbachevs 
program to modernize soviet society a campaign to make the 
communist state a nation of laws and recent parliamentary 
elections for the new congress of peoples deputies 
also this year there was increased attention to environmental 
concerns to the coming generations a clean planet pledged 
one banner 
access to red square is severely restricted for such events and 
the vast majority of soviets who saw the twohour parade did so on 
television which augmented its coverage with prerecorded segments 
including one on the importance of cleaning up the water supply and 
conserving natural resources

irene opdyke risked death at the hands of the gestapo by hiding 12 
jewish friends in the basement and attic of a german officers 
villa where she worked

repaying a debt to her we owe her 
opdyke is one of only a few nonjews at the 875bed facility 
that provides communal living for old people 
mrs opdyke 68 said she vowed to help her jewish friends when 
she saw the way hitlers army treated jews during the 1939 invasion 
of poland she called it a nightmare that changed my life 
i saw a man with a white beard and a little white hat running 
carrying a torah she said little ones were screaming mama 
mama i saw a soldier pull a baby out of its mothers arms and 
throw him to the ground later i heard shooting they were killing 
innocent people 
while working as a housekeeping for a german major she hid 
jewish friends for nearly eight months sometimes in the homes 
attic other times in the basement 
recently as ms opdykes husband began suffering from the 
advanced stages of alzheimers disease administrators at the 
jewish home for the aged said they felt a special obligation to 
care for him 
she risked her life and this is the return we want to give

oceanographers have recovered jason the errant 
submersible robot that took a dive last week but have decided to 
give its understudy medea the starring role in an underwater show 
jason a hightech propellerdriven submersible equipped with 
video cameras and maneuverable arms was retrieved from the bottom 
of the mediterranean sea on saturday it sank 2100 feet to the 
ocean floor wednesday when its cable to the support ship star 
hercules snapped 
meanwhile the submersible medea which was used to recover 
jason was expected to take center stage today as the first of 
250000 students in 12 cities across the united states and canada 
hook up via twoway satellite with marine explorers off the coast 
of italy 
over the next two weeks museum officials and elementary and 
high school students will watch via satellite as medea inspects the 
wreckage of a sunken spanish galleon 
medea is a sixfootlong oneton platform carrying three 
television cameras two color and one blackandwhite unlike 
jason it is not remotely operated with its own propulsion system 
it is towed behind a surface craft and its cameras operate as it 
passes a target 
organizers had hoped jason would be able to go on with the show 
but sonya hagopian of the woods hole oceanographic institution a 
sponsor of the program said jason will undergo a complete 
evaluation before returning to service 
jason will probably be going back in but not right away 
hagopian said sunday from cape cod it could be a matter of just 
a few days 
about 2000 museum officials teachers and technicians were 
testing a satellite hookup last week when jason the younger 
brother of the robot that first rummaged through the titanics 
wreckage unceremoneously sank on its debut mission 
hagopian said that while most of the damage to jason appeared to 
be cosmetic technicians planned to run it through a series of 
tests before returning it to the water 
i understand that there is minimal damage to it it is still 
very usable its not bad at all she said on a scale of one 
to 10 with one being minimal damage id say were at a one

syrian and christian forces battled with 
mortar and tank fire in the hills above beirut today killing two 
people and wounding seven the first casualties in a 3dayold 
truce called by the arab league 
fighting raged from nightfall sunday to daybreak today in the 
mountaintop town of souk elgharb where syrian troops and druse 
militiamen surrounded a christian army garrison police said 
mortar and tank cannon rounds crashed in christian and druse 
villages around souk elgharb wounding seven villagers police 
said 
two lebanese soldiers also died in the fighting the first 
fatalities reported by officials since a truce went into effect 
friday in an arab leaguemediated attempt to halt eight weeks of 
bloodshed 
this is the gravest violation of the truce its worse than 
the sporadic bombardment of the coastline of the christian enclave 
in the past two days according to a police spokesman said 
the coastal shelling underlined the dispute over blockaded 
seaports but the fighting in souk elgharb has wider dimensions 
that could undermine the arab leagues peace plan altogether he 
said he spoke on condition of anonymity 
souk elgharb sits atop a strategic network of mountain roads 
leading from the druse hinterland southeast of beirut to the 
christian heartland north and northeast of the capital if the 
christiancontrolled town falls to the allied syrians and druse 
christians would lose the central mountain stronghold shielding 
their 310squaremile enclave 
the latest casualties increased the overall toll to 275 people 
killed and 1000 wounded since march 6 when army commander gen 
michel aouns 20000 mainly christian troops blocked illegal moslem 
militiarun ports the syriandruse alliance responded by 
blockading the christian enclave 
a spokesman at aouns command claimed the syrian army and 
militiamen of druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive socialist 
party were trying to provoke us into a mass retaliation to 
undermine the arab leagues ceasefire 
but the general is determined to strip them from that excuse 
were not responding said the spokesman who requested anonymity 
he said aouns army was merely defending front positions and was 
not shelling moslem residential areas or distant syrian targets 
jumblatt meanwhile issued a may day statement calling for 
aouns removal from power as a condition for peace 
its impossible to reach a compromise with michel aoun he 
must be removed or toppled said jumblatt this must be clear 
to all other christian leaderships 
the political and military wrangling underlined a dispute over 
the second provision of the latest ceasefire that calls for the 
lifting of air land and sea blockades 
aoun who heads a christian military cabinet in lebanons dual 
government refused to call off the blockade of illegal harbors 
which he says deprive the state of 100 million yearly in lost 
taxes he said his gunboats and helicopter gunships were applying 
lebanese laws 
but the rival moslem cabinet under acting prime minister salim 
hoss has insisted aouns blockade be lifted

student protest leaders today denounced meetings 
government officials held with students as insincere attempts to 
placate the students without seriously addressing the democratic 
reforms they seek 
several student leaders meanwhile said they have been warned 
to stop planning a protest thursday the 70th anniversary of 
chinas first democratic movement 
two cabinet ministers met students today the third day of 
meetings to discuss student demands for reforms including a free 
press and an end to official privileges and corruption 
some students complained the government has snubbed their 
independent group the united association of beijing universities 
by refusing to allow it to represent the student movement in the 
talks the government says the group is illegal 
we dont recognize this dialogue said a spokesman for the 
group which has been leading two weeks of protests including the 
largest protest marches in 40 years of communist rule and a 
weekold class boycott 
we demand a dialogue based on the principles of equality and 
openness conducted directly between democratically chosen student 
representatives and government decisionmakers he said at a news 
conference the student did not want his name used for fear of 
government reprisals 
wang dan a student leader at beijing university the nations 
most prestigious school called for establishment of a nationwide 
independent student group and indefinite continuation of the class 
boycott by about 75000 students in beijing and nearby tianjin 
on monday the minister of metallurgical industry qi yuanjing 
met students at the beijing college of science and technology and 
minister of the aeronautics and astronautics industry lin 
zhongtang met students from the beijing aeronautical institute 
staterun radio reported 
officials acknowledged to students that government decisions 
often are made too quickly and without sufficient study the radio 
reported 
at the first meetings the government selected 45 students to 
meet education minister he dongchang and other senior officials 
saturday and 29 students to meet sunday with beijing mayor chen 
xitong and city party chief li ximing 
officials at the meetings insisted they share students 
opposition to worsening corruption but urged them to calm 
down halt plans for new marches and end the class boycott 
the guangming daily chinas national newspaper for 
intellectuals praised the meetings as expressions of socialist 
democracy and channels for clearing up misunderstandings and 
suspicion 
students however complained they were only allowed to ask 
questions and there was no giveandtake 
the government answers to student questions illustrated their 
lack of sincerity the united association spokesman said he 
accused the government of trying to deceive public opinion by 
making an appearance of conceding to student demands 
students we risked bloodshed and danger to get as far as we 
have said a poster at the peoples university please continue 
your efforts 
chinas communist party meanwhile marked the international 
labor holiday may day today by appealing to workers in editorials 
and speeches to resist forces of instability 
so far there has been no largescale organized support among 
workers for the student marches but workers have cheered on 
student protesters and voiced support for demands for an end to 
official corruption 
although the government toned down its initial harsh criticism 
of the student movement after tens of thousands of beijing citizens 
applauded a student march thursday it has continued to claim an 
unspecified handful of people are illegally plotting revolution

vice president dan quayle said today 
he had a productive meeting with cambodian resistance leader prince 
norodom sihanouk but the two did not broach the subject of us 
military aid 
it was a good meeting quayle said after the 45minute 
session with sihanouk i had not met him before 
aides to the vice president arranged the meeting with sihanouk 
after learning that the two would be in jakarta at the same time 
quayle who arrived here today after five days in australia 
also held discussions throughout the day with a host of 
indonesians including president suharto and three human rights 
activists 
quayle said that in his meeting with sihanouk he did not talk 
about the possibility of providing military assistance to cambodian 
resistance forces although that option is under consideration in 
washington 
we talked about the process and moving the process forward and 
what coalition may or may not be who the players are and what some 
of the expectations would be the vice president told reporters 
cambodias future and us policy toward the country is one 
of the top items on quayles agenda during his 12day trip to the 
pacific region vietnam has said it plans to end its military 
occupation of its southeast asian neighbor this fall 
the united states supports having sihanouk lead an interim 
government until elections can be scheduled in cambodia others 
jockeying to run the country include factions led by hun sen the 
head of the vietnamese puppet government in phnom penh the khmer 
rouge and an anticommunist group headed by son sann 
both hun sen and son sann were in jakarta for meetings with 
sihanouk 
while the united states has yet to clearly define its policy 
toward cambodia quayle and his aides have firmly rejected a 
takeover by the khmer rouge the chinesebacked group that was 
responsible for killing as many as 15 million people in the late 
1970s 
sihanouk has called for an international conference in paris 
that would devise an enforcement mechanism for the withdrawal of 
vietnamese troops and the transition toward an elected government 
a senior aide to quayle said that in his meetings with suharto 
the vice president reiterated that the united states wants to 
follow the lead of its asian allies in devising its policy toward 
cambodia 
washington does not want to do anything that is 
counterproductive said the aide who asked to remain anonymous 
quayle also discussed trade with the indonesian leader and said 
the united states is interested in human rights issues such as the 
situation in east timor a former portuguese colony annexed by 
indonesia in 1975 
while the united states views indonesia as a reliable ally it 
wants to see jakarta develop more openness on the political side as 
well as economically 
underscoring his commitment to human rights quayle met with 
three local activists to hear their concerns the vice president 
did not agree with all of the activists issues but he listened 
and received material about individual cases of alleged human

plo officials abroad approve most of the orders 
to kill arabs suspected of collaborating with israel after 
underground trials are conducted by local palestinian 
activists palestinian sources said today 
the plo headquarters in tunis had no immediate comment on the 
report 
in the latest attack on an alleged collaborator ahed ramini a 
30yearold palestinian was fatally stabbed today by attackers in 
the occupied west bank city of tulkarem arab reports said 
his death brought to 41 the number of alleged collaborators 
killed since the palestinian uprising began nearly 16 months ago 
most the victims of attackers who support the palestine liberation 
organization more than 60 alleged collaborators have been wounded 
in recent weeks the palestinian underground has established a 
clandestine system to conduct what they say are trials of those 
accused of cooperating with israels military government in the 
occupied west bank and occupied gaza strip 
palestinian sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
socalled trials included testimony from witnesses and that notes 
or tape recordings were made of the proceedings 
as the palestinian organization becomes more disciplined 
there have been situations where people have been pulled in and 
questioned testimony has been taken as well as confessions which 
are tape recorded and signed said one palestinian believed to 
have close contacts with underground activists 
on the basis of such statements recommendations were forwarded 
to plo officials abroad said another source adding that a black 
list had been compiled of palestinians who informed or worked 
with israeli military authorities 
the palestinian sources said the orders to kill the alleged 
collaborators were approved by a moslem clergyman who was deported 
by israel from the west bank in 1980 and is now believed to be 
based in iraq 
the sources said orders are relayed via coded messages broadcast 
by baghdad radio 
an israeli military official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the plo had encouraged and cooperated in attacks on 
palestinians who had dealings with israel or adopted antiplo 
positions he also confirmed the clergyman was involved in 
approving such reprisals 
according to israeli government figures 960 attacks were 
carried out between december 1987 and midapril most of them 
warnings such as firebombs hurled at houses or cars 
foreign minister moshe arens said there was a wave of terror 
being waged to intimidate moderates who might otherwise support 
israels proposal to hold elections in the occupied territories to 
choose palestinian negotiators 
foreign ministry spokesman alon liel told reporters april was 
the bloodiest month for palestinian attacks on palestinians with at 
least 10 killed he was unable to cite evidence that palestinians 
were killed for political beliefs but contended the attacks had a 
chilling effect on diplomatic efforts 
it is impossible to convince people to start working on the 
elections in this atmosphere liel said confirming newspaper 
reports that arens complained to us ambassador william brown that 
terror was being used to thwart israels attempts to find 
palestinian partners for dialogue 
palestinians denied the killings were designed to rein in 
dissidents and said collaborators were punished because they 
endangered the lives of underground activists who were sought by 
israeli authorities 
one source said the united national leadership of the uprising 
which guides the revolt against israeli occupation had issued an 
internal memo recently stressing that no reprisals could be taken 
against collaborators without permission of the underground 
if anything there are less attacks as a result said one 
palestinian 
a leaflet distributed in nablus today and signed by fatah 
yasser arafats plo faction vowed to strangle anyone who will 
think of interfering with the intefadeh uprising and those who 
collaborate

technicians today replaced two 
faulty fuel system parts aboard space shuttle atlantis and nasa 
hoped to be able to reschedule the onceaborted launch attempt for 
as early as thursday 
space agency spokeswoman lisa malone said a new pump and 4inch 
fuel line were installed and were being prepared for pressure leak 
and other checks 
the work is going very well she said today 
shuttle managers scheduled a meeting this afternoon to consider 
a new launch date earlier they had said the earliest possible 
liftoff date was friday but with the work progressing smoothly 
they said today that a thursday afternoon liftoff was a possibility 
because of the shifting positions of earth and venus there is 
only a 32day launch opportunity for sending the 550 million 
magellan spacecraft in atlantis cargo bay toward venus 
if the shuttle cant get off the ground by may 28 the mission 
would have to be put off for two years at a cost of 100 million 
until the two planets are again aligned properly 
the launch was scrubbed last friday just 31 seconds before the 
planned liftoff when controllers noted a sudden power surge on a 
fuel pump that recirculates liquid hydrogen propellant for one of 
the three main engines 
engineers later discovered a tiny leak in a 4inchdiameter fuel 
line that carries hydrogen from the external fuel tank to the 
shuttle 
had the countdown continued a computer designed to detect such 
problems would have stopped the engines from firing and the five 
astronauts would have been safe according to the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
workers on sunday erected scaffolding and platforms around 
atlantis removed access panels and unhooked insulation wiring 
and other equipment as they began removing the bad parts 
two of the astronauts commander david walker and pilot ronald 
grabe practiced shuttle landings in a training aircraft sunday and 
then flew to their home base in houston mission specialists mary 
cleave mark lee and norman thagard returned to houston on saturday 
at the johnson space center in houston the astronauts will keep 
sharp by rehearsing aspects of the flight in a shuttle simulator 
six hours after launching the astronauts are to release the 
magellan from atlantis cargo bay starting it on a 450day journey 
to venus the 7600pound craft is to orbit the planet and map up 
to 90 percent of its cloudveiled surface with a high resolution 
radar system 
the images relayed to earth and enhanced by computer could 
tell scientists much about the history of venus and why it evolved 
so differently than its sister planet earth

paraguayans voted today for a 
president and congress to replace the 34year regime of gen 
alfredo stroessner who was toppled in a feb 3 coup 
gen andres rodriguez the candidate of the ruling colorado 
party and the man who ousted stroessner was expected to easily 
defeat former exile domingo laino and six other rivals the 
colorados were expected to retain control of congress 
laino denounced election irregularities such as a lack of 
indelible ink at some stations to prevent double voting and a voter 
registration list that favored the ruling party 
but he said this morning that some flaws were unavoidable and if 
fraud was not generalized his party the countrys second 
biggest would accept the results 
voters interviewed shortly after polls opened at 7 am 8 am 
edt said the elections were as free as any they had voted in 
voting was conducted in privacy and the ballots of all eight 
parties were available said architect ricardo facetti that 
didnt use to happen in the days when paraguayans were encouraged 
to vote for stroessner and the colorado party 
before i wouldnt even have talked with you what if a 
policeman saw said cesar ramon gonzalez 57 a retired public 
accountant now the atmosphere is completely different 
polls indicate rodriguez will receive as much as 70 percent of 
the vote 
stroessner 76 seized power in a 1954 coup and brooked little 
opposition during his lengthy rule arranging to be elected every 
five years he was unseated on feb 3 and sent into brazilian exile 
the 65yearold rodriguez has been hailed by paraguayans for 
toppling stroessner but opposition parties banned under 
stroessner have complained they were not given enough time to 
prepare for todays elections 
eight parties have fielded candidates in the voting for 
president 36 senators and 72 deputies to finish the fiveyear 
terms begun by stroessner and congress following elections in 
february 1988 
the parties are responsible for providing their own ballots and 
presidential candidate fernando vera said his opposition 
revolutionary febrerista party was not sure its ballots would be 
available at all of the more than 10000 polling places nationwide 
weve distributed our ballots to the main places but im not 
sure weve gotten through to smaller more remote villages in the 
nation of 4 million he said 
the colorado party has controlled the government for 42 years 
and rodriguez has broadened his base by improving relations among 
its factions as well as with foreign governments and the roman 
catholic church to which most paraguayans at least nominally 
belong 
at a campaign rally saturday night rodriguez repeated his 
pledge to complete only stroessners term and to hand over power in 
august 1993 to my successor freely elected by the people at the 
ballot box 
the opposition contends the colorados will benefit from dated 
voter registration lists even the central electoral board says 
that up to 600000 names on the list of 22 million may be invalid 
the main campaign issue has been who can best move a country 
that has never had a democratic government in that direction 
rodriguez has broadened civil liberties and pledged to reform 
the constitution electoral laws and penal code 
the polls were to open at 7 am and close at 4 pm with 
unofficial results expected tonight paraguayans ages 18 to 60 are 
required by law to vote violators face small fines

pope john paul ii celebrated an 
open air mass in an impoverished farming region today and said that 
despite tough economic times the faithful should not use artificial 
birth control 
while it appears necessary to be aware of family planning 
couplesshould use natural methods the pope told the 100000 
people who gathered for the mass 
the roman catholic church approves only what it calls natural 
family planning or abstinence during a womans fertile period 
many western nations have pressured third world countries to 
control their population explosions which hinder economic growth 
and are a chief factor in environmental degradation 
the pope said that although the churchs teachings seem 
difficult natural methods will work and the faithful should reject 
contraceptive imperialism 
john paul arrived 90 minutes late for his last mass on this 
indian ocean island fog had closed the airport 240 miles south of 
the capital of antananarivo 
after the mass the pope flew back to the capital and boarded an 
air madagascar boeing 737 for the hours flight to the french 
island of reunion the second of four stops on his fifth african 
tour on tuesday he travels to zambia then malawi 
president didier ratsiraka called the popes visit a source of 
comfort for those who are suffering in this impoverished country 
in fianarantsoa the pope blessed 100 lepers who kneeled in a 
sandy field near the airport before saying mass from a raised 
wooden altar covered by a canopy 
the pope today spoke of the serious environmental problems 
facing madagascar and other developing countries and reaffirmed his 
call sunday for an international effort to safeguard the 
environment 
from the north to the south of your great island i have been 
able to admire the beauty diverse richness of the earth and its 
fruit and yet the way it is being used risks its degradation and 
sterilization 
saving this 225000squaremile island that split from the 
african mainland more than 150 million years ago has become a 
priority of many international environmental groups 
ninety percent of the islands plants and animals are found 
nowhere else including hundreds of species of orchids and 29 
species of lemurs small primates whose name derives from the latin 
word for ghost because of their nocturnal habits 
the destructive farming methods of the islands population 
constantly seeking fresh terrain to plant rice and other crops has 
caused widespread deforestation 
the mozambique channel off the islands west coast is so red 
from the infusion of soil washed in by erosion that it is clearly 
recognizable to astronauts circling the globe 
on sunday the pope spoke on the environmental threat to a 
gathering of foreign diplomats he said he supports international 
efforts to halt the dumping of toxic wastes in poor countries and 
development that endangers the worlds remaining rain forests 
also sunday the pontiff beatified a malagasy woman credited 
with keeping the faith alive 100 years ago after the queen had 
banned all roman catholic services beatification is a first step 
toward possible sainthood 
the church has been openly critical of madagascars government 
since a communist revolution in 1975 the countrys economy has 
declined and recently the government made policy alterations to 
assure foreign aid

the supreme court today agreed to restudy in 
a case involving the michigan chamber of commerce what limits 
should be placed on campaign spending by political groups that 
incorporate themselves 
the court said it will hear an appeal by michigan officials that 
is supported by the federal election commission 
the michigan chamber of commerce has about 8000 duespaying 
members about threefourths of them corporations 
the chamber planned in 1985 to place a paid advertisement in the 
grand rapids press in support of richard bandstra a republican 
candidate for the state house of representatives 
fearing the ad would be considered illegal under michigans 
campaign finance act the business group filed a federal lawsuit 
seeking to have the law declared unconstitutional the chamber said 
the act violates its freespeech rights 
the state law generally prohibits corporations from spending in 
behalf of political candidates and carries a maximum 10000 fine 
the law permits a corporation to make such expenditures if it 
sets up a special fund or political action committee that is 
required to keep records and disclose the names of contributors 
the chamber of commerce has such a fund however it wanted to 
pay for the newspaper ad for bandstra out of its general treasury 
which is exempt from the recordkeeping and reporting requirements 
of the state campaign finance law 
a federal judge ruled that the chamber may not spend money from 
its general treasury in behalf of a political candidate the judge 
said the state campaign finance act aimed at heading off 
corruption of the political process applied to the chambers 
activities 
but the 6th us circuit court of appeals last september 
overturned the judges decision 
we conclude that indirect expenditures made by a 
nontraditional corporation like the michigan chamber of commerce 
formed for essentially ideological purposes and to disseminate 
economic and political ideas and not to amass capital do not pose 
the threat or appearance of corruption the appeals court said 
the appeals court relied heavily on a 1986 supreme court 
decision limiting the federal governments power to regulate 
corporate political spending 
the justices said then that the federal election campaign act of 
1971 violates freedom of speech when applied to corporations formed 
primarily to influence public opinion not to make a profit 
the high court ruled in favor of a massachusetts group formed to 
protest the legalization of abortion 
the 1986 ruling said corporations formed to promote political 
ideas that have no shareholders and are not established by 
business corporations or labor unions should not be subject to the 
federal campaign spending law 
the 6th circuit court said the michigan chamber of commerce fits 
that description 
the appeals court also said there was no danger the chambers 
corporate members will use the business group as a conduit for 
massive undisclosed corporate political spending 
anyone contributing more than 100 to a political candidate 
through the chamber or otherwise still must file a report 
disclosing that spending under state law the appeals court said 
in a dissenting opinion judge gilbert merritt said the ruling 
allows corporate giants such as general motors ford and chrysler 
to funnel large sums of money through the chamber to favorite 
candidates without revealing the spending 
the federal election commission joined michigan officials in 
urging the supreme court to overturn the appeals court ruling 
the decision if applied to federal law would substantially 
undermine congressionally mandated limitations upon the use of 
corporate wealth to influence the outcome of federal elections 
the fec said 
the case is austin vs michigan chamber of commerce 881569

a highway patrolman spotted jennifer muir 22 a us navy petty 
officer third class on a roadside outside villa san giovanni in 
southern calabria about 4 am and recognized her from a magazine 
article previewing the television program said police col 
antonino di vincenzo 
ms muirs father thomas muir an ibm engineer from trumbull 
conn appeared on the staterun raitv sunday night on the 
premiere of a show that decribes missing persons and appeals for 
help in finding them 
italian police had suspected foul play in her disappearance 
shes fine and has been reunited with her father said di 
vincenzo from his office in police headquarters in reggio calabria

the supreme court today agreed to hear a bush 
administration appeal aimed at allowing the government to collect 
potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes from 
multinational corporations 
in a case involving goodyear tire and rubber co the court said 
it will review a ruling that allows multinationals to use foreign 
tax laws to reduce their us taxes 
the case stems from operations of goodyears british subsidiary 
in the early 1970s 
the ohiobased corporations subsidiary incurred net losses in 
1972 and 1973 at least under british tax law the subsidiarys 
1973 loss included british tax deductions that were not allowed 
under american tax law 
as a result the british government refunded to the subsidiary 
the tax payments it made there for 1970 and 1971 
the refunds prompted the us internal revenue service to 
recompute the taxes it said goodyear owed in this country 
multinationals are entitled to claim a share of taxes paid by 
subsidiaries overseas as credits against us taxes 
in the goodyear case since american law did not recognize the 
1973 deductions permitted the company in great britain the 
corporations loss was converted into a profit 
the redetermination had the further effect of wiping out for 
us tax purposes the foreign tax credits previously allowed in 
1970 and 1971 
as a result the irs assessed goodyear 791240 in taxes and 
interest for 1970 and 1971 
goodyear then sued in the us claims court saying the irs 
erred in applying american law instead of british law to determine 
the companys accumulated profits 
the claims court ruled against goodyear but a federal appeals 
court here reversed the decision last august 
the appeals court said a multinational company is entitled to 
use a foreign nations tax laws to determine accumulated profits 
made by a subsidiary in that country 
administration officials said the ruling could have enormous 
importance for us tax revenues 
justice department lawyers in the appeal acted on today said 
more than 25000 foreign subsidiaries of us companies are doing 
business in more than 100 countries the government said its most 
recent figures show the companies claimed more than 9 billion in 
foreign tax credits in 1982 
the irs is reviewing 150 million in claimed refunds in such 
cases and expects the appeals court ruling will prompt an 
additional 750 million in refund claims 
the government appeal conceded that the impact of the appeals 
court ruling has been blunted by a 1986 change in us tax law that 
may mean multinationals no longer will be able to use a foreign 
countrys calculation of its accumulated profits for most future 
tax payments here 
the case is us vs goodyear 881474

the supreme court today appeared to clear the 
way for a federal trial against nine current and former synanon 
foundation figures accused of illegally conspiring to regain the 
groups taxexempt status 
the justices sent the case back to a federal appeals court for 
restudy in light of their march 28 ruling that criminal defendants 
may not immediately appeal a judges refusal to dismiss an 
indictment for alleged grand jury abuses by prosecutors 
the synanon foundation figures had sought to throw out an 
indictment that charges them with destroying evidence of violent 
activities at the californiabased organization 
the defendants said the 1985 indictment should be dismissed 
because of prosecutorial misconduct 
synanon was founded by charles dederich some 30 years ago as a 
nonprofit center for rehabilitating drug and alcohol users in the 
late 1970s it became embroiled in allegations of violence threats 
and harassment of former members and opponents 
dederich has been accused of converting the organization into a 
violent cult in october 1978 paul morantz a california lawyer 
representing two former synanon members in a suit against synanon 
was bitten by a rattlesnake he found in his mailbox 
dederich and two other synanon members pleaded no contest to 
charges of conspiracy to murder morantz 
the indictment involved in the case acted on today did not name 
dederich but it said nine others including his daughter cecelia 
jason dederich altered or destroyed evidence that could undermine 
synanons claim to be a charitable nonviolent foundation 
the indictment said they plotted to deceive the internal revenue 
service which had revoked synanons taxexempt status the 
foundation later called synanon church faces millions of dollars 
in tax liens 
the indictment said destroyed documents and tapes had evidence 
of violence against perceived enemies of synanon acquisition of an 
arsenal of guns diversion of synanon money into private hands and 
socalled love matches and other activities of sexual 
promiscuity 
the nine defendants said the government engaged in misconduct by 
using university of california professor richard ofshe as a witness 
before the grand jury that indicted them 
the grand jury was not told that ofshe was suing synanon for 
millions of dollars and that ofshe was allowed to listen to tape 
recordings to help identify individuals who were indicted the 
defendants said 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last july said the 
prosecutors failure to disclose ofshes source of potential bias 
was a breach of duty to the grand jury however it does not by 
itself justify dismissal of the indictment 
the other defendants named in the indictment are synanon counsel 
philip c bourdette former counsel dan l garrett jr david 
benjamin elizabeth missakian steven simon miriam bourdette dan 
sorkin and sybil schiff 
the case is benjamin vs us 881290

the supreme court today allowed the government 
to impose annual licensing fees of around 1 million for nuclear 
power plants 
the justices without comment rejected an appeal by 29 
companies that own or operate nuclear reactors 
the licensing fee for nuclear plants was adopted by the nuclear 
regulatory commission under a 1986 budget bill passed by congress 
the measure the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act 
authorizes the nrc to pay for onethird of its annual budget by 
assessing such fees 
the commission imposed a fee of 950000 last year on each 
holder of a nuclear plant license the fee is expected to be more 
than 1 million for the current fiscal year 
the us circuit court of appeals here upheld the fee last may 
the appeals court rejected arguments that the fee should be tied 
directly to services the nrc performs for the benefit of a 
particular nuclear plant 
the appeals court also said the fee is a constitutional 
delegation of congress power to impose taxes 
the appeals court said congress may delegate the tax power 
where adequate standards are set for implementation of 
congressional intent 
the fee bears a reasonable relationship to regulatory services 
performed by the nrc the appeals court added 
the justices last week unanimously upheld federal safety user 
fees imposed on pipelines that transport natural gas and 
hazardous liquids 
the case acted on today is florida power amp light vs us

the supreme court today refused to hear an 
appeal by hawaii officials seeking to recover from asbestos 
manufacturers the cost of removing the product from public schools 
in the state 
the court without comment let stand rulings from pennsylvania 
that included hawaii in a socalled classaction settlement of 
claims against the asbestos companies 
hawaii officials said they were not given a proper opportunity 
to remove themselves from the classaction court settlement in 
which thousands of school districts are eligible to receive money 
from an asbestos cleanup fund 
hawaii wants to be excused from the general lawsuit so that it 
can sue two manufacturers proko industries inc and owensillinois 
inc for millions of dollars in hawaii state courts 
hawaii officials said they first learned of the classaction 
settlement pending before a federal judge in pennsylvania in may 
1987 
at that time they were told they had until aug 1 1987 to 
notify the judge they did not wish to be a part of the settlement 
group thereby preserving their right to sue separately 
the officials said they were not alerted to a change in the 
deadline that moved it up to june 22 1987 and later extended for 
a month as a result they said they failed to notify the federal 
judge that they wished to opt out of the settlement 
the officials also contended that the settlement violates the 
constitutions 11th amendment that limits federal court authority 
over states 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals based in philadelphia 
ruled against hawaii last october 
the case is hawaii vs proko industries 881484

the judge at oliver norths trial said today 
the news medias attempt to force disclosure of a sealed document 
concerning a 1985 missile shipment may imperil the case against the 
former white house aide 
us district judge gerhard a gesell commented at a hearing 
shortly before the jury of nine women and three men began its ninth 
day of deliberations 
at a hearing gesell said he thinks the issues raised by 10 news 
organizations seeking access to the document are very very 
broad 
if you prevail in this matter gesell told a lawyer for the 
10 news organizations one possibility is i must discharge the 
jury 
at issue is a stipulation summarizing highly secret intelligence 
intercepts that tracked a ciaassisted november 1985 shipment of 
hawk missiles to iran the intercepts were gathered by the national 
security agency 
norths lawyers used the document in his defense referring to 
it in open court in a highly unusual move the document was given 
to the jury for its deliberations but gesell has kept it under 
seal from the public ten news organizations including the 
associated press went to court april 21 in an attempt to force its 
release 
the justice department acting on behalf of the us 
intelligence community says release of the information would 
jeoparidize national security 
timothy b dyk representing the 10 news organizations said the 
issues raised by the matter are narrow ones and pointed out that 
only one document is involved 
gesell replied that its the only document i treated this way 
after 14 months of dealing with over a million documents 
the document shows that top us officials knew at the time of 
the november 1985 shipment that hawk missiles were aboard the 
aircraft 
on april 22 gesell rejected the disclosure motion saying the 
stipulation is a classified document 
the news organizations appealed an appeals court panel friday 
sent the matter back to gesell calling for a hearing on national 
security issues involved saying it cannot make a decision without 
having such a record 
north is charged with creating a false chronology that says no 
one in the us government knew until january 1986 that hawks were 
aboard the november 1985 shipment 
part of norths defense was to show that cia director william 
casey and national security adviser john poindexter were aware at 
the time from the intercepts what was aboard yet arranged the 
false story that no one knew 
north is accused of lying to congress to cover up his role in 
secretly assisting the nicaraguan contra rebels and lying to the 
attorney general about the diversion of funds to the contras from 
the reagan administrations secret arms sales to iran 
he also faces charges that he accepted a 13800 home security 
system and converted 4300 in travelers checks from a contra 
leader to his own use

a federal judge today refused to stop the 
federal government from requiring atlantic and gulf coast shrimpers 
to equip their nets with a device intended to preserve sea turtles 
in danger of extinction 
louisiana attorney general william guste had filed suit on 
behalf of gulf coast shrimpers who say the turtle excluder 
devices commonly called teds are dangerous to pull unnecessary 
and reduce their catch 
environmentalists maintain the devices will help save the 
endangered kemps ridley sea turtle from extinction by reducing the 
number of turtles caught by the shrimpers 
us district judge patrick carr issued his ruling today after 
holding a rare telephone hearing friday on gustes request for a 
temporary restraining order to block the requirement 
congress has the power and authority to suspend the 
enforcement of the use of teds until further studies are made but 
chose not to do so carr wrote in his brief ruling the courts 
have no such power or authority 
if this law isnt changed it will mean that the entire 
shrimping industry is out of business tee john mialjevich 
president of concerned shrimpers said saturday 
its not that we dont want to save turtles its that we want 
to feed our families 
mialjevich said his group represents 2000 shrimpers from north 
carolina to brownsville texas 
teds fit into the mouth of trawls a type of net and have trap 
doors that let turtles escape shrimpers argue that they are too 
easily clogged with debris and that a significant portion of their 
catch escapes with the turtles 
shrimpers won a 60day reprieve from hefty fines that were to 
have gone into effect today for boats not equipped with teds 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher last week told the coast 
guard to issue only warnings through june 30 instead of fines of 
up to 10000 to violators along the gulf and atlantic coasts 
shrimpers disclaim responsibility for most of the 11000 turtle 
deaths estimated by the national oceanographic and atmospheric 
administration each year 
ted shepard director of the 400member louisiana shrimpers 
association which is also fighting the teds said that kemps sea 
turtles are uncommon in the areas that his louisiana members fish 
adding theyre in the atlantic and off the coast of florida 
shrimpers have proposed alternatives mialjevich said including 
a 25 fee on shrimping licences each year dedicated to hatching and 
growing the turtles

the supreme court today revived an indiana 
prison inmates lawsuit ruling unanimously that the suit should 
not have been automatically ruled frivolous 
the justices said a federal trial judge was wrong in finding 
harry williams srs suit frivolous because it failed to state a 
claim on which a court could grant williams some relief 
such a failure to comply with the federal rules of civil 
procedure does not automatically make a lawsuit frivolous justice 
thurgood marshall wrote for the court 
williams an inmate at the indiana state reformatory sued 
various prison officials in 1986 
his complaint said he had been diagnosed by a doctor at the 
indiana state prison as having a small brain tumor that affected 
his equilibrium and he should be excused from all work details 
williams suit said that when he was transferred to the 
reformatory doctors refused to treat the tumor and officials 
assigned him to do garmentmanufacturing work 
when he refused to continue working the reformatory 
disciplinary board responded by transferring him to a less 
desirable cellhouse 
the suit however did not allege deliberate indifference on 
the part of prison doctors or officials a necessary allegation in 
such cases when prison inmates allege cruel and unusual punishment 
the case is neitzke vs williams 871882

the sandinista government has extended 
for the 11th time a monthlong unilateral ceasefire on offensive 
operations 
a statement from the presidents press office sunday said the 
government was extending the ceasefire to achieve firm and 
lasting peace in the region 
the statement broadcast over the governmentcontrolled voice of 
nicaragua radio said the extension of the ceasefire was agreed to 
during meetings among the five central american presidents in 
february 
at the twoday meeting in el salvador president daniel ortega 
agreed to push for democratic reforms in his country and moved up 
presidential elections by 10 months to february 1990 the 
presidents also agreed to come up with a plan for dismantling the 
antisandinista rebel forces known as the contras 
referring to the rebels the government statement said extending 
the ceasefire would create conditions for the demobilization 
relocation or repatriation of the nicaraguans who have been 
involved directly or indirectly in armed activities 
some 11000 contra rebels along with their families live in 
honduran camps near the nicaraguan border 
nicaragua signed a temporary ceasefire with the contras in 
march last year and the truce was to be the basis for a permanent 
peace accord but talks to extend it stalled the sandinistas have 
unilaterally extended the temporary ceasefire monthly since june 
when the original one expired 
the government statement said the ceasefire extension would 
not affect the general plans for defending the nation or repelling 
criminal attacks by the mercenary forces which continue to bloody 
our country 
despite the ceasefire sandinista officials and the rebels 
continue to blame each other for offensive attacks 
meanwhile the weekend edition of the sandinista party newspaper 
barricada quoted sandinista army lt col ricardo wheelock chief 
of intelligence as saying fighting between government and 
guerrilla forces increased in recent months 
wheelock told the newspaper that during the first four months of 
this year there were 403 rebel attacks resulting in 43 sandinista 
deaths and 75 injuries three sandinistas were reported missing 
wheelock said the rebel forces in attacks they have 
provoked have suffered 193 deaths he said the sandinista army 
captured another 89 rebels during the fourmonth period

lawyers may not be forced by federal law to 
represent poor people in noncriminal federal cases the supreme 
court ruled today 
by a 54 vote the court ruled in favor of john a mallard an 
attorney from rural fairfield iowa who specializes in business 
cases he had refused a federal judges order to represent prison 
inmates in a civil rights suit because he said he felt unqualified 
for the assignment 
we do not mean to question let alone denigrate lawyers 
ethical obligation to assist those who are too poor to afford 
counsel said justice william j brennan for the court 
in a time when the need for legal services among the poor is 
growing and public funding for such services has not kept pace 
lawyers ethical obligation to volunteer their time and skills 
is manifest he said 
but brennan said the federal law is clear lawyers may be 
requested to help not forced to do so 
the federal law authorizing legal help for poor people in civil 
cases specifically says a judge may request any attorney take 
the case brennan noted 
he was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and justice 
byron r white antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
in a dissenting opinion justice john paul stevens said congress 
may have used the word request but actually meant 
respectfully command 
in my opinion congress gave its endorsement to these judicial 
requests assuming that it would be unthinkable for a lawyer to 
decline without an adequate reason stevens said 
he was joined by justices thurgood marshall harry a blackmun 
and sandra day oconnor 
mallard who argued his own case before the high court last 
february had been ordered to represent two current inmates and a 
former inmate at the iowa state prison in fort madison 
the inmates said prison guards and officials filed false 
disciplinary reports against them physically mistreated them and 
endangered their lives by revealing they were informants 
a federal judge picked mallard in 1987 to represent them from a 
list of more than 100 lawyers compiled by the legal services corp 
of iowa and the states bar association 
in addition to saying he lacked experience in trial work 
mallard said the federal courts do not have power to require an 
unwilling attorney to represent someone in a civil case 
the possible penalties mallard faced for his refusal to take the 
prison cases were not discussed but presumably he could have been 
held in contempt and fined or even jailed had the supreme court 
rejected his appeal 
courts routinely assign lawyers to represent indigent defendants 
in criminal cases and the lawyers are paid at taxpayer expense 
generally a fraction of what they would receive normally 
in civil rights cases lawyers are paid expenses and may receive 
a share of any damages won by their clients 
us district harold d vietor had denied mallards motion to be 
excused from the inmates suit the judge said mallard was 
competent and had trial experience 
the case is mallard vs us district court 871490

spree in an english coastal town fourteen other people were 
injured in the rampage 
police said robert sartin was charged with killing 41yearold 
kenneth mackintosh they said sartin would appear in magistrates 
court later today 
witnesses said the gunman strolled through the streets of 
monkseaton a fashionable suburb of the whitley bay seaside resort 
in northeast england firing a doublebarreled shotgun at anyone 
within range 
the victims sunday included several churchgoers returning home 
a cyclist a couple driving by in a car a man mowing his lawn a 
woman who opened her front door and others who peered out their 
windows officials said 
north tyneside hospital spokesman michael scargill said six of 
those wounded were hospitalized three in serious condition 
the first ambulance officers on the scene came under fire 
he was having a go at any person he met said ken heads 
superintendent of the northumbria ambulance service 
i have never seen anyone so calm and totally in control he 
was like a robot said a resident 40yearold jane boyd 
witnesses said the gunman was dressed all in black with dark 
sunglasses and his hair in a pony tail they said he wore an 
ammunition belt around his waist had a hunting knife strapped to 
one leg and stalked the streets pausing only to shoot and reload 
the gunman who had driven to the suburb just before midday 
drove away after the rampage an unarmed policeman chased him in an 
unmarked car and arrested him without incident outside a pub 
news reports said the suspect lived with his parents a mile from 
the shooting scene a policeman stood guard outside their home 
today 
press association the british news agency quoted the gunmans 
brother as saying all i can say is that he is such a loving and 
caring lad the agency did not identify the brother 
the tabloid sun said the gunman regularly went claypigeon 
shooting with his father and quoted a neighbor identified as harry 
stephenson as saying you couldnt hope to meet a more pleasant 
young man

married and had two children he was returning from church when he 
was gunned down

for cover when more shots were heard grant said 
home secretary douglas hurd the cabinet minister responsible 
for law and order ordered a full report on the incident from 
police and the police federation called for even tighter gun 
control laws 
the rampage was similar to the massacre of 16 people in the 
southern town of hungerford on aug 19 1987 by michael ryan who 
killed himself after being trapped by police 
the bloodbath shocked britain where most police are not armed 
britains already strict gun control laws later were tightened to

the us labor department today cited two 
contractors for safety and health violations and proposed 115 
million in fines for a methane gas explosion that killed three 
workers in a sewer tunnel project 
sa healy of mccook ill the main contractor for the project 
was cited for 68 willful violations carrying fines of 680000 in 
connection with last novembers fatal blast ch2m hill of 
corvallis ore hired to supervise the project was cited for 47 
willful violations carrying penalties of 470000 
both companies have 15 days to appeal the citations and 
penalties to the occupational safety and health administration 
said mike connors regional administrator of oshas chicago office 
the proposed fine of 10000 per willful violation was the 
maximum allowed connors said 
willful violations are the most serious issued by osha and are 
based on a finding that the contractors knew that a dangerous 
condition violated safety standards and made no effort to correct 
it connors said 
these penalties are one of the largest i am aware of for the 
region and certainly the largest that i am aware of for a tunnel 
project he said 
osha investigators believe they have located the exact cause of 
the nov 10 explosion but connors declined to release that 
information citing concerns about future litigation 
criminal negligence charges could also be filed against the 
contractors he said 
the citations accused the two contractors of failing to train 
workers about the proper response when methane is detected in a 
tunnel using inappropriate electrical equipment and wiring methods 
for a gassy tunnel failing to have adequate ventilation for 
the tunnel and keeping inadeqauate records of air monitoring in 
the tunnel 
oshas investigation concluded that the two contractors were 
directly responsible for the deaths of the three workers he said

of gunshot wounds suffered in clashes with troops or paramilitary 
police the other person died of beating injuries inflicted by 
soldiers it said 
the center founded by a number of leftwing parties and peace 
movements said the worst month of the uprising was april 1988 
when 44 palestinians were killed 
the center said a total of 423 palestinians have died since the 
uprising began 16 months ago to protest israeli rule of the west 
bank and gaza strip 
the associated press death count based on arab hospital 
reports also listed 34 palestinians killed by army gunfire last

liberally when their cars are stoned

prime minister noboru takeshita brought down by a 
scandal that reached the top of business and politics is expected 
to ask former foreign minister masayoshi ito to replace him 
government sources said monday 
takeshita said a week ago he would resign but the choice of a 
successor as leader of the governing liberal democratic party and 
thus as prime minister has been put off until he returns sunday 
from a nineday trip to southeast asia 
after takeshitas announcement party secretarygeneral shintaro 
abe and keizo obuchi the chief cabinet secretary informally asked 
ito to take the job ito who is 75 and diabetic said he would not 
take the job because of his age and health 
the government sources said privately monday however that the 
party would have no other choice but to persuade ito who 
they described as the only candidate on whom all party factions 
could agree 
ito has a clean reputation and most other party leaders have 
been linked to the scandal centered on recruit co an information 
and publishing conglomerate he now is chairman of the executive 
council the partys policymaking body 
masaya ito a critic of the political scene who is not related 
to the former foreign minister said the offer of succession is 
no more than asking him to lend his clean image without actual 
political power 
it sounds to me no more than an insult for a senior politician 
like ito said the critic who was an aide to the late prime 
minister hayato ikeda it is apparent that the current party 
leadership is trying to remain in control by appointing ito and 
other senior officials no dignified politician would take such an 
offer 
whoever the liberal democrats choose will become prime minister 
because of their large majority in parliament the party has 
rejected opposition demands to call elections so voters can pass 
judgment on the scandal and an unpopular 3 percent sales tax that 
took effect april 1 
takeshita said he was resigning to take responsibility for the 
scandal he is to step down after parliament passes the 1989 
budget which has been approved by the lower house 
fourteen people have been arrested on bribery and other charges 
so far in the recruit case and three cabinet members were forced 
to step down before takeshitas announcement 
recruit sold stocks in a subsidiary to about 160 influential 
politicians bureaucrats and businessmen at bargain prices before 
the shares were offered for public sale the price soared when the 
stock went on the market and the buyers made huge profits 
prosecutors contend that in some cases the deals amounted to 
bribes in exchange for favors to the company 
the prime minister has acknowledged getting more than 1 million 
in political donations from recruit and that an aide who committed 
suicide the day after takeshita announced his resignation received 
a loan of about 376000 from the company

thousands of prehistoric indian 
petroglyphs etched into dark basalt rock have survived for 
hundreds and hundreds of years but time no longer is on their side 
the onceremote volcanic ridge they adorn on albuquerques west 
side is in danger of being swallowed by civilization 
if we dont get the federal authorization from congress this 
year the pressures of development and vandalism are so intense out 
there we may be losing the opportunity said ike eastvold a 
leader in a move to have congress create a national monument to 
preserve the carvings of humans and animals it really is the 
11th hour 
evidence of the threat to the petroglphs is all around the 
17mile escarpment created by lava flows that began 190000 years 
ago 
houses and roads creep closer one path to the area passes 
mounds of rubbish some drawings have been marred by spray paint or 
damaged by gunshots 
the drawings are the work of early pueblo indians who lived in 
the area between 1300 and 1650 ad spanish settlers arriving the 
area in the 1500s added their own petroglyphs 
this is the largest concentration of rock art in the world in 
a major city said eastvold 
he said preserving the more material elements of a culture such 
as architecture is not enough the art and religion are what made 
them live eastvold said 
he said the petroglyphs are even more exciting because they were 
done by the ancestors of the present pueblo indians of new mexico 
and eastern arizona meaning they still are part of a living 
culture 
eastvold said the petroglyphs also are artistically appealing 
new mexicos two us senators republican pete domenici and 
democrat jeff bingaman have introduced legislation to establish 
the monument 
they conducted an energy and natural resources committee public 
lands subcommittee hearing friday in albuquerque to hear from 
federal state and local officials developers conservationists 
and indian leaders 
those who spoke at the hearing indicated support for the 
monument 
john e cook regional director of the national park service 
said at the hearing that if congress fails to take action within 
two years the land will become degraded to the point it could no 
longer be considered for monument status 
eastvold head of the group friends of the albuquerque 
petroglyphs said he believes that if the national monument is not 
created most of the land will be lost to development 
you would probably end up with little bits and pieces 
preserved in an inadequate manner he said 
the bill introduced by domenici and bingaman and an identical 
measure introduced in the house by rep steve schiff rnm calls 
for the national monument to include 7100 acres 
about 4300 acres of land already is publicly owned the total 
value of the land that would have to be acquired is estimated at 
90 million with 50 million coming from the federal government 
and the remaining 40 million from the city and state the state 
and city already have made provisions for a portion of their 
commitments 
in addition to preserving the estimated 15000 carvings 
proponents say the monument would draw 400000 visitors and 
generate 5 million in revenue for the city and its businesses in 
the first year alone 
domenici believes that what should be stressed is not so much 
the cost of doing the project but the cost of not doing it because 
the drawings would continue to be degraded until they are lost 
forever 
bingaman agreed 
i think the longer you go into the future the more important 
its going to have been that people at this time took the 
opportunity to set some land aside and preserve some of these 
petroglyphs he said

the legendary french wine house chateau 
lafiterothschild is sending a task force to the united states to 
recork at no charge older bottles of the fabulously expensive 
bordeaux 
starting tuesday in new york the experts will recork some 2000 
bottles of 1962 or older vintages the group also will visit 
boston atlanta miami and dallas 
the lafite team which was in san francisco last year took 
reservations for the recorking service through next january the 
demand said the company was tremendous 
an 1806 vintage the same year napoleon ordered the blockade of 
britain and construction of the arc de triomphe in paris will be 
among the wines to be recorked a bottle from that year once sold 
for 31000 
there is no charge for this service said david s milligan 
president of seagram chateau amp estate wines co the major lafite 
importer in this country the chateau does it as the most 
remarkable aftersale service in the industry 
milligan would say only that the 1806 is owned by a collector in 
boston whose identity he couldnt disclose 
the recorking is carried out by lafite because as the wine 
experts say wine is only as good as its cork old corks can 
become dry which allows air to seep into the bottle and can cause 
wine to spoil 
recorking is especially needed for the nobler wines of the 
world made with the view that a very good bottle may not reach the 
most drinkable period for years even decades and generations 
a minimum of 15 years is often recommended before a given 
vintage of lafite should be consumed the 1961 vintage for 
instance wasnt ready for drinking until last year 27 years 
as the rothschilds have tended over a century of vintages at 
lafite they have determined that their bottles should be recorked 
about every 25 years or so said milligan even the finest cork 
has limited lifespan and keeping the cork in good condition is 
essential to protect the wine

student protest leaders monday blasted government 
meetings with selected students as a sham accusing officials of 
trying to coopt students without agreeing to democratic reforms 
student activists also said they had been warned to stop 
planning a protest for may 4 the 70th anniversary of chinas first 
democratic movement 
they called for the establishment of a nationwide independent 
student union and indefinite continuation of the class boycott 
begun last week by about 75000 students in beijing and nearby 
tianjin classes were out monday to celebrate the may day holiday 
highranking government officials from two ministries met with 
students for a third day to discuss student calls for more 
democracy the staterun radio said 
on the steps of beijing universitys library a spokesman for 
the indepedent student association said the group had rejected the 
talks 
meetings between the government and students began over the 
weekend in a government effort to quell two weeks of student 
demonstrations the protests culminated thursday when 150000 
students and their supporters participated in the biggest march in 
40 years of communist rule 
the students want a fundamental reform of chinas tightly 
controlled political system including a free press and an end to 
widespread corruption and nepotism 
we demand a dialogue based on the principles of equality and 
openness conducted directly between democratically chosen student 
representatives and government decisionmakers said the 
spokesman for the united association of beijing universities 
he said the association wants the government to recognize it as 
a legal entity and conduct its talks with association 
representatives 
on saturday two student leaders from the association were 
invited to the first meeting after that all representatives 
appear to have been from officially appointed student unions 
on monday the guangming daily a national newspaper for 
intellectuals praised the meetings it called them an example of 
socialist democracy and said they were a way of clearing up 
misunderstandings and suspicion 
many students disagreed 
students particularly were upset when beijing mayor chen xitong 
and citys communist party chief li ximing said they made 81 a 
month about three times the average monthly salary 
they forgot to add their free cars and all their free meals 
said one student 
they also forgot their free apartments fancy trips and 
bottles of maotai said another 
the government answers to student questions illustrated their 
lack of sincerity the association spokesman said he accused the 
government of trying to deceive public opinion by appearing to 
concede to student demands 
student leaders at the beijing normal college declared on their 
campus loudspeaker until we have a dialogue with the government 
that meets our demands we wont return to class 
students we risked bloodshed and danger to get as far as we 
have said a poster at the peoples university please continue 
your efforts 
on monday four of the seven leaders of the association said 
they were under pressure to stop organizing a protest for may 4 
ou yang a student leader from qinghua university said teachers 
from his college on sunday night warned him to confine his 
activities to inside the qinghua gates 
wuer kaixi president of the association said officials at 
beijing normal college had informed him through friends that he 
should stop his activities he said he was afraid of arrest 
another two leaders said they planned to stay close to their 
dormitories and restrict their organizing activities 
a studentrun loudspeaker at wuers school broadcast an open 
letter to his mother monday 
mother the letter went i am not wrong but perhaps for 
the sake of many more mothers and fathers in the future you might 
have to lose your son 
you always taught me to be courageous and speak out for my 
beliefs that is what i am doing 
the government harshly criticized the student movement last 
week calling it a plot to overthrow the government 
it toned down its criticism after tens of thousands of beijing 
citizens applauded the student march thursday but it continues to 
claim that an unspecified handful of people illegally are 
plotting revolution 
on monday two groups of students met with qi yuanjing minister 
of the metallurgical industry and lin zhongtang minister of the 
aeronautics and astronautics industry the radio said 
selected students also met with state education minister he 
dongchang and highranking officials from the beijing city 
goverment 
the meetings with government ministers were an indication of how 
seriously the government regards the recent student unrest 
the government apparently hopes it can split most of beijings 
students from the leaders of the independent student association 
and their calls for fundamental change 
indeed throughout the meetings officials have made no promises 
to change state policy they have acknowledged some student 
complaints but mostly have urged students to calm down

rosie the duck can have her ducklings anywhere 
she chooses officials say and the mallard has decided to set up 
her nest alongside a downtown highrise 
because the duck enjoys the protection of the us fish and 
wildlife service she and her 12 eggs cannot be moved from a 
planter near the chicago river to a safer location its against 
the law at least until hunting season opens in the fall 
you cant touch her harm her or take her declared a 
government agent who viewed her friday 
indeed the duck is protected by the migratory bird treaty act 
between the united states mexico and canada anyone who touches 
the bird could be fined 2000 or be sentenced to up to one year in 
jail said the agent 
some rosie watchers had sought to move the duck to a safer more 
secluded spot along the chicago river below 
tishman speyer properties which owns the commercial highrise 
ordered security guards to keep an eye on the duck after a 
maintenance worker found the nest in midapril 
she seems rather calm and happy there said paul collins a 
guard who patrols the nesting site 
rosies eggs are due to hatch this week

budget cuts forced by voter rejection of 
a tax package will go beyond common sense gov buddy roemer 
said monday as the administration studied closing some universities 
and hospitals 
rejection in saturdays referendum means the state will have a 
projected 720 million deficit when the new fiscal year begins july 
1 roemer said 
even with passage of the package the administration would have 
been forced to cut spending by 200 million including reducing a 
charity hospital to an outpatient clinic and laying off 4100 state 
employees roemer said 
now we must go beyond that the cuts will be deeper than i 
wanted deeper than common sense but we will not do business as 
usual roemer said wearily at an impromptu news conference 
the governor referred to projecting oil prices high enough to 
balance the budget on paper a routine practice until roemer took 
office in march 1988 
with high oil price projections the state ended each year with 
massive deficits which had accumulated to 900 million by the time 
he took over 
each increase of 1 a barrel in the price of oil sustained for 
a year means around 28 million in extra state tax revenue 
roemer said the state realistically could increase the 
projection from 15 to 17 a barrel since the price of louisiana 
oil at this time is about 18 but youre only talking about 60 
million if we do that 
the tradition of having oil companies and other big businesses 
pay a big share of state revenues in louisiana dates back to the 
days of populist gov huey long in the 1920s and 1930s 
roemers plan would have shifted the tax burden away from big 
business putting more of a load on individuals through the income 
tax it would have reduced sales taxes and given businesses 
incentives to move to louisiana and expand 
the plan also included a 14 billion program to improve 
highways airports and shipping ports funded by a gasoline tax 
increase of 4 cents a gallon 
romer touted his plan as a way to bring jobs to louisiana which 
has the highest unemployment rate in the nation at 96 percent and 
to end the states dependence on the oil industry 
we had a number of industrial prospects that had anticipated 
fiscal reform to open new plants roemer said i had to call 
them this morning and talk it through its not all good news 
well hang on to what we can 
the legislature could extend for another year a temporary 
suspension of sales tax exemptions on food drugs and utilities 
that was put into effect last summer to stave off bankruptcy 
roemer said allowing that suspension to expire on june 30 would 
leave a 500 million hole in the budget he said 
roemer said he didnt want to talk about specifics of what 
universities or hospitals might have to be closed 
youll know as soon as we know he said 
rep robert adley chairman of the house appropriations 
committee and a close adviser to the governor had said earlier in 
the day that his phone was ringing off the hook this morning 
theyre lawmakers scared reality is setting in and they dont 
want to lose institutions in their districts 
meanwhile state rep david duke perhaps the most vocal 
legislative opponent of the tax package said lawmakers might want 
to extend sales tax increases to avoid closure of charity hospitals 
and universities 
throughout the tax referendum campaign duke said the people 
dont want any more taxes none 
ill hold an olive branch out to him the governor said 
duke a former ku klux klan leader weve got to solve the 
financial problems the legislature might be willing to restore 
some of the temporary taxes if it comes to that we still have some 
time to play with this thing

ads for mississippi burning adorn 
the lobby of the towns only theater but the manager says theres 
been little interest in the film based loosely on the 1964 slayings 
of three civil rights workers nearby 
ive had the advertisement up for a couple of weeks that 
its coming may 24 and i can only recall a couple of people who 
had comments said shelly steiger whose family has owned and 
operated the ellis theater in the town of 7000 for 35 years 
mayor charles mcclain said most of the talk in town now involved 
plans for a special memorial program june 21 to honor the three 
civil rights workers 
mississippi burning starring gene hackman and willem dafoe 
is a fictionalized account of federal investigation of the murders 
of andrew goodman james earl chaney and michael schwerner in 
neshoba county their bodies were found in an earthen dam near 
philadelphia six weeks after their deaths on june 21 1964 
the orion pictures release has received praise from movie 
critics but harsh criticism from people who were involved in the 
civil rights movement particularly blacks who see the movie giving 
too much credit to the fbi 
im sure if there were people here who were real interested in 
the movie they have already gone to a town where it has been 
shown said steiger 
the film was shown earlier this year in jackson about 80 miles 
southwest and in meridian about 40 miles east 
steigher said his theater seats about 500 people which means 
2500 people could see the movie during its fiveday run 
of course that would mean a sellout every night and its been 
a long time since that has happened he said 
mcclain said he also had not heard too many comments about the 
movie 
the mayor said he had seen the film and thought it just piled 
everything on one locality when at the time it was spread out 
across the state and the south 
he said philadelphia had good race relations and i thought 
they really didnt give our city a very fair presentation even for 
1964

attackers ambushed a second united nations 
food convoy in southern sudan spraying the lead vehicle with small 
arms fire un officials said monday 
no one was hit in fridays attack near kapoeta and the convoy 
arrived sunday at its destination in torit with 300 tons of food 
said world food program spokesman paul mitchell 
it is the second ambush of a un convoy in less than two weeks 
near kapoeta a garrison town held by the rebel sudan peoples 
liberation army 
eight armed rebel escorts were killed april 18 when the first 
operation lifeline sudan convoy to torit was hit by a rocket and 
automatic weapons fire 
the united nations temporarily suspended operations on the 
overland route between kapoeta and torit and last weeks convoy 
was the first to make a new attempt 
mitchell said they will stop using the route again and any 
further supplies will be sent to torit through uganda 
the 132 million operation hopes to save 100000 lives in sudan 
where officials estimate as many as 500000 people died from 
drought flood and warinduced famine last year 
un officials concede that political logistical and other 
problems will prevent them delivering more than than half their 
115500ton goal of supplies before seasonal rains cut off outlying 
villages 
mitchell said 27 trucks set out in fridays convoy from 
lokichoggio in northern kenyan and were 12 miles outside kapoeta 
when attacked 
it was small arms fire from the bush mitchell said they 
didnt see anybody and its hard to say who they the attackers 
were or how many there were 
government troops for years have battled rebels demanding more 
autonomy in southern sudan but both sides agreed in march to allow 
safe passage for relief food other gunmen in the south include 
nomadic tribal warriors and governmentsponsored militiamen 
nils enquist operation lifelines logistics coordinator said 
between six and 10 bullets struck the vehicle 
it was carrying a driver and the convoy leader and it is only 
by the grace of god they werent hurt enquist said the trucks 
following the lead vehicle werent shot at 
he identified the convoy leader as gerard vigay a world food 
program employee from france and the driver as an unnamed kenyan 
mitchell said the convoy halted briefly as armed rebel guards 
unsuccesfully sought the attackers

many americans see latin american communism as a 
rising danger to the united states while the threat from communism 
in other nations is viewed with less alarm a media 
generalassociated press poll has found 
fortyfour percent in the survey saw communism in latin america 
as more of a threat to us security than it has been in the past 
only about 15 percent said the same for the soviet union china and 
eastern europe 
the polls respondents said overwhelmingly that capitalism holds 
greater influence than communism in the world today 62 percent to 
23 percent with the rest undecided but only one in five said 
communism is on the decline 
instead among those with an opinion 27 percent said communism 
was on the rise in the world and 46 percent said it was holding 
steady the poll of 1108 adults march 615 had a 3point margin of 
error 
with a sinosoviet summit planned this month respondents said 
by a narrow margin that closer relations between the soviet union 
and china posed a threat to the united states 49 percent to 41 
percent with the rest unsure 
about half favored closer us trade with the soviet union to 
encourage democratic reforms there a third were opposed on grounds 
that us trade would only support the current system the rest 
were undecided 
greater trade with the soviets was supported equally by 
republicans and democrats but there was a political split on latin 
america conservatives and republicans were considerably more 
likely than liberals and democrats to see communism there as an 
increasing threat 
liberals also were more confident in another measure 71 percent 
said capitalism has more influence than communism in the world 
while just 57 percent of conservatives agreed 
bettereducated americans and men were more likely to perceive 
changes in communism and to view communist nations as a decreasing 
threat to the united states thirtysix percent of those with 
postgraduate work said communism is on the decline for example 
while just 13 percent of high school graduates held that view 
the greatest agreement was on changes in communism seventy 
percent said most communist countries are less likely now to follow 
soviet policies and 67 percent said most communist nations are 
giving their people more freedom 
a 58 percent majority saw the soviet union as moving away from 
its centralized communist economic system 47 percent said the same 
of china and 45 percent saw such movement in some eastern european 
nations 
just 7 percent said communism was less of a threat in latin 
america than it has been in the past 30 percent rated it about the 
same 9 percent said it never has been a threat and the rest had no 
answer marxists rule in nicaragua communists rule in cuba and are 
waging insurgencies in colombia el salvador peru and other latin 
american nations 
communism elsewhere was viewed with less suspicion just 14 
percent saw communism in the soviet union as more of a threat to 
the united states than it has been in the past while 38 percent 
saw it as less of a threat 
similarly chinese communism was seen as more of a threat by 15 
percent and less of a threat by 34 percent communism in eastern 
europe also was seen as more of a danger by 15 percent and as less 
of one by 28 percent

irans deputy foreign minister says 
tehran soon will buy weapons from the soviet union and is 
negotiating with other unidentified countries for advanced fighter 
bombers the government press reported monday 
the islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia quoted 
ali mohammad besharati as saying iran must diversify its 
armspurchasing sources 
if we depend on one particular country or bloc then they take 
advantage of the situation they want to impose their own 
ideology on us he said his comments were published in an 
interview with the englishlanguage daily tehran times the agency 
said 
besharati said in extensive talks with soviet officials 
all related issues have been finalized 
he did not disclose what kind of soviet weapons iran will 
acquire or the cost but the iranians are known to be seeking to 
upgrade and rebuild their air force and armored divisions following 
the aug 20 ceasefire in the eightyear war with iraq 
recently the iranians have turned increasingly to the east bloc 
for much of their military hardware as relations between tehran and 
moscow warmed 
speculation the soviets would start supplying the iranians with 
sophisticated weapons systems possibly including aircraft and 
tanks was heightened when soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze visited tehran in february 
the soviets were iraqs main weapons supplier during the war and 
are participating in a major defense exhibition in baghdad that 
ends tuesday but iran purchased large amounts of sovietdesigned 
weapons systems mainly through north korea and china 
the soviets are not prepared to go too far as far as the 
iranians are concerned said hansheino kopietz a military 
specialist with the londonbased international institute for 
strategic studies 
they want to play footsy with both sides just how much 
hardware they will provide the iranians themselves is questionable 
they dont want to be seen to be tipping the balance but it makes 
sense that they should do something in this regard he said in a 
telephone interview 
the moscowtehran rapprochement was accelerated by the halt in 
the gulf war and the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan where 
tehran supports moslem guerrillass fighting kabuls communist 
government 
before the 1979 reolution irans military was armed almost 
exclusively with us weaponry bought by shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
before he was toppled 
a usled embargo did much to prevent the iranians acquiring 
spare parts and replacements for that equipment 
by the end of the war irans oncepowerful air power was 
reduced to an estimated 60 operational combat jets before the war 
iran had 447 combat aircraft all of them ussupplied they 
included 199 f4 phantoms 166 f5 eagles and 77 f14 advanced 
interceptors 
the iranian agency quoted besharati as saying we have gone 
into negotiations with various countries outside the soviet union 
for the purchase of fighter bombers 
very soon you will see fighter bombers flying which are 
other than those of the united states and the soviet unions he 
said without elaboration 
the iranians claim they soon will build their own combat jets 
but western analysts believe these will be chinesesupplied f6 and 
f7 jets beijings versions of the mig19 and mig21 shipped in 
parts to be assembled in iran 
us defense department sources have reported that tehrans 
links with the warsaw pact countries for arms supplies have 
improved prospects for coproducation deals under which iran could 
build soviet bloc weapons under license 
they estimate iran is spending up to 5 billion a year on its 
forces

tens of thousands of people marched 
through the capital monday to celebrate may day and the rebirth of 
solidarity in the unions biggest show of strength since it 
regained legal status 
while the warsaw march was generally peaceful troops used 
clubs water cannons and tear gas to crush other demonstrations in 
gdansk and wroclaw dissident sources said a minor clash was 
reported in warsaw later monday 
an estimated 100000 people took part in the solidarity march 
from northern warsaw and the rally afterward the communist partys 
official may day rally nearby was more subdued and drew about 
20000 people 
redandwhite solidarity banners vied for attention with the red 
flags displayed by communist party faithful 
union supporters marched in a procession that took nearly an 
hour to pass a single point chants of down with communism 
soviets go home free elections and solidarity must 
win echoed off the buildings of narrow streets 
the march began with about 30000 people and was tripled in size 
by the time it reached a park on the banks of the vistula river 
near warsaws center 
participants trumpeted last months accord with the government 
which resulted in solidaritys legalization after an eightyear ban 
and provisions allowing noncommunists to participate in coming 
parliamentary elections 
warsaw solidarity leader zbigniew bujak introduced the unions 
candidates to the two legislative houses 
we not only can organize uprisings we can also build a 
normal democratic order he told the crowd 
the solidarity gathering was by far the unions biggest since it 
regained legal status on april 17 participants signed nominating 
petitions for unionbacked candidates to the two chambers of the 
congress the senate and the seijm 
some radical factions of solidarity that joined the rally called 
for boycotting the june elections the sejm and senate are yours 
the factories are ours read one banner 
but the crowd loudly booed seweryn jaworkski a leader of a 
splinter faction supporting a boycott when he was allowed to 
speak the crowd instead began to chant the name of solidarity 
leader lech walesa 
the government faced with a crumbling economy agreed to give 
the solidarityled opposition a greater voice in order to win 
workers cooperation on economic reforms 
we have entered a path of substantial reforms we have dared 
to do an extraordinary thing polish leader gen wojciech 
jaruzelski told the participants in the official may day rally in 
victory square 
lets therefore close the polish book of sorrows and 
bitterness he said what the country needs most is peace and 
joint action 
police used tear gas water cannons and clubs to crush a rally 
in wroclaw organized by the splinter group fighting solidarity and 
the banned polish socialist partydemocratic revolution said 
opposition spokeswoman maria pinior 
in gdansk riot police with batons attacked participants in a 
rally that included several banned groups said solidarity 
spokeswoman joanna wojciechowicz the street fighting lasted for 
several hours she said 
there was no information available on arrests or injuries 
earlier at a rally of about 1000 people in gdanski walesa was 
accused of betraying the movement he founded by anna walentynowicz 
a woman whose firing from the gdansk shipyard caused the strike 
that led to solidaritys formation in 1980 
ms walentynowicz denounced walesas agreement with authorities 
on social and economic reform 
warsaws main solidarity events were peaceful but later in the 
day at least one small clash took place between police and about 
100 militant young marchers in central warsaw police charged the 
rockthrowing demonstrators and dispersed them

former arms negotiator paul warnke criticized 
the bush administration on monday for failing to assert leadership 
and avert an argument raging in the nato alliance over shortrange 
nuclear weapons 
there has been no american leadership whatsoever said 
warnke and as a result we have a very sharp dispute over a 
silly issue 
warnke chief arms negotiator for thenpresident carter 
recommended that the north atlantic treaty organization stick to 
agreements reached in the alliance in 1987 and 1988 to modernize 
us lance tactical missiles in west germany 
at the same time warnke said nato should open negotiations 
with the soviet union about eliminating the entire class of nuclear 
missiles with ranges of under 300 miles and therefore not subject 
to the intermediaterange nuclear force pact which took effect 
last year 
the dispute over modernizing shortrange nuclear weapons has 
pitted west german chancellor helmut kohl against british prime 
minister margaret thatcher and president bush 
kohl and thatcher held what they called frank and intensive 
talks on the issue sunday in deidesheim west germany but parted 
in disagreement 
we still have quite a lot of work to do kohl said after the 
meeting although predicting that an agreement was possible before 
a nato summit in brussels belgium this month 
kohl whose party faces tough elections next year wants nato to 
begin negotiations with the soviet bloc on the issue and to delay 
until at least 1992 a decision on lance modernization 
thatcher said eliminating shortrange nuclear weapons would mean 
that the soviet union will have achieved its objective of getting 
landbased nuclear weapons out of europe this i believe would be 
disastrous 
warnke said nato could finesse the issue by entering 
negotiations while stipulating that the western alliance would not 
eliminate its shortrange nuclear weapons until the sovietled 
warsaw pact sharply reduced its conventional forces in europe 
thereby removing the threat that the lance is intended to deal 
with said warnke 
the existing shortrange force should not be a priority 
warnke said at a breakfast meeting with reporters it does not 
seem to me that we need either to eliminate or modernize tactical 
nuclear systems 
they can only be used if the russians invade western euroupe 
you are not going to blow up the mens room in the kremlin 
with the lance which cannot reach beyond german borders said 
warnke who was assistant secretary of defense from 1967 through 
1969 and the head of the arms control and disarmament agency in 
1977 and 1978 
warnke also urged the bush adminstration to move more quickly to 
take advantage of conventional arms concesssions made by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev who last december announced a cut 
of 500000 troops in soviet forces and the withdrawal of 50000 
soviet troops from eastern europe

pope john paul ii flew to this french 
indian ocean island monday after urging his flock in the 
impoverished african nation of madagascar to reject contraceptive 
imperialism and abortion 
the pope arrived on this volcanic island about 450 miles east 
of madagascar on the second stop of a nineday tour that will also 
take him to the african nations of zambia and malawi 
he was greeted at the airport by french prime minister michel 
rocard and a french military band playing the marseillaise 
john paul then rode in his glassenclosed popemobile to the 
municipal building to meet privately with rocard and address 
political and church officials he later spoke to local clergy at 
the 19th century cathedral and had dinner with bishops from 
reunion mauritius and the seyechelles 
earlier monday john paul concluded a threeday visit to 
madagascar with an openair mass for about 100000 people in 
fianarantsoa a wineproducing town in the south of the island 
he devoted much of his homily to birth control a pressing issue 
in madagascar where the average citizen earns 250 a year and the 
population of 11 million is growing at an annual rate of 3 percent 
only one in 100 married women in madagascar uses contraception 
according to the world watch institute and western aid agencies 
have sought to promote the use of artificial birth control 
the power to transmit life must be respected said the 
whiterobed pontiff speaking in french from a wooden altar 
overlooking a dirt field near the airport 
you cannot let yourselves be won over by the increasing 
tendency to consider it childbearing secondary or even to want 
to prevent human fertility from expressing itself 
the pope said that if it is necessary for couples to choose 
family planning they must follow methods that respect nature 
he was referring to the only method approved by the roman 
catholic church natural family planning based on abstinence during 
a womans fertile period 
the teaching of the church seems difficult but many couples 
testify that it is possible to follow it and that it is even a 
liberation compared to what we call contraceptive imperialism 
john paul also decried abortion saying families must respect 
the life of the child from conception 
do not accept that abortion is commonplace take care of the 
fragile but human life of the unborn child the dignity of man 
is at stake 
before the ceremony the pope blessed lepers kneeling in the 
sand at the foot of the altar patting each of them on the head 
they came from a nearby leper clinic founded in 1912 by a polish 
jesuit missionary jan beyzym 
i would like to say to those suffering from leprosy and other 
illnesses how much the church wants to bring them consolation 
and comfort how much she loves them 
addressing officials in st denis john paul told islanders they 
should rethink certain ways of life he didnt elaborate but 
local church officials have expressed concern about consumerisim 
and materialism as well as superstition exorcism and satanic cults 
reunion covering 970 square miles has been a french overseas 
department since 1946 it is the richest of the countries on the 
popes trip as a tourist attraction and sugar exporter and also has 
the highest percentage of catholics 90 percent of the 500000 
population 
seventy percent of its people are descendants of the african 
slaves brought to the island by the french in the 1600s

the state department has told the taiwanese 
that their relationship with the united states could suffer unless 
they curb illegal driftnet fishing in the north pacific a us 
official said monday 
ed wolfe ambassador for oceans and fisheries said he delivered 
a note of protest to an official of the taiwanese coordinating 
council for north american affairs and warned of the possible 
fallout if the government of taiwan fails to negotiate a driftnet 
fishing agreement with the united states 
i delivered a forceful message regarding the potential serious 
consequences of recent illegal fishing activities and the lack of 
taiwanese cooperation on driftnet negotiations specifically the 
enforcement aspect of those negotiations said wolfe 
wolfe said he told the taiwanese that the fishing issue has 
attracted interest at the highest levels of the state 
department and called for an immediate resumption of negotiations 
to avoid potential bilateral foreign policy problems 
the meeting friday came about a week after the coast guard 
boarded a taiwanese ship suspected of illegal driftnet fishing for 
salmon in the north pacific 
the ship was spotted 450 miles outside the legal driftnet 
fishing zone in waters where the taiwanese government itself has 
banned driftnetting the ship allegedly cut its net and fled after 
being spotted by the cutter jarvis 
the jarvis shadowed the vessel for almost 700 miles before 
receiving permission from the taiwanese government to board 
wolfe said monday that a fish scale and fin found on the ship 
have been sent to a national marine fisheries service laboratory to 
see if they were from a salmon of north american origin 
american fishermen claim vessels from taiwan south korea and 
japan use driftnets to illegally snare millions of tons of salmon 
under the guise of squid fishing fishing groups have said the 
illegal fishing has already hurt salmon runs in alaska washington 
state and oregon 
driftnets can stretch 35 miles in length and cover more than 
30000 square miles of ocean on any given day environmentalist 
claim the nets are responsible for the deaths of thousands of 
porpoises seals seabirds and other marine life annually

officials from taiwan arrived monday on the first 
visit to china by a nationalist chinese delegation since the 
communists won the civil war in 1949 and chiang kaisheks forces 
fled to the island 
the 12member delegation led by finance minister shirley kuo 
will attend the threeday annual meeting of the asian development 
bank that begins in the chinese capital thursday 
were happy that taipeichina like any other member of the 
bank will be able to attend this 22nd annual meeting of the adb 
said bank spokesman reynaldo pacheko 
ms kuo and the other delegation members went straight to the 
hotel where the conference will be held 
taipei officials have said the delegations only purpose is to 
fulfill taiwans obligations as a founding member of the asian 
development bank and no official meetings will be held with the 
communist government 
since the defeat in 1949 the nationalists have had a policy of 
no contacts with mainland authorities the bank meeting however 
continues a practice of raising the level of exchange that began 
with a softening of taiwans approach two years ago 
taiwan lifted restrictions on visits to the mainland late last 
year and several thousand people have traveled to china for 
reunions tourism or business indirect trade has grown rapidly 
reaching an estimated 27 billion last year 
last month young taiwanese gymnasts became the first athletes 
from the island to compete on the mainland opening the way for 
taiwans participation in the 1990 asian games in beijing 
only 23 countries recognize taiwan while 136 have diplomatic 
ties with the beijing government 
the asian development bank a regional development institution 
established in 1966 is the only major international organization 
in which taiwan holds membership it had to accept a name change 
from republic of china to taipei china when the 47member 
organization admitted china in 1986 
many in taiwan including members of the ruling party see 
adherence to the official policy of no contact as an attempt to 
avoid the impression of eagerness until taiwan is assured the 
communists will consider it more than a local government 
if this is not an official contact then what is it 
legislator huang hoching a liberal member of the nationalist 
party said before the delegation left taiwan 
as a joke he offered to give ms kuo a pair of gloves so she 
could shake hands with chinese delegates without violating the 
governments directive against direct contact 
early in april taiwan proposed that china be considered a 
single nation with two governments one in beijing and the other in 
taipei that would allow the island to rejoin international 
organizations as an equal 
beijing rejected the idea saying it would require abandonment 
of the onechina policy

auditorium lights dimmed and thousands of 
youngsters nationwide went silent monday when a 7 million science 
project whisked them to the bottom of the mediterranean sea live 
and in color 
television screens showed them the satelliterelayed view of a 
cameraequipped submersible robot being towed over the ocean floor 
it was the first of two weeks of live broadcasts to an expected 
250000 students at 13 museums from british columbia to florida 
the project suffered a temporary setback last week when the 
7footlong robot jason a newer version of the cameracarrying 
submersible that explored the sunken ocean liner titanic sank 
among the ruins of an ancient roman trading ship off the coast of 
italy 
the cable used to lower the milliondollar jason and its mobile 
garage or transporter argo snapped and the pair plunged 2100 
feet to the soft silty ocean floor 
organizers said the show would go on with or without jason 
the robot was resurrected apparently undamaged saturday but still 
wasnt used in mondays 40minute broadcast 
jason has propellers and can be remotely guided in and around 
underwater objects its replacement monday medea was merely a 
sophisticated camera platform that is towed over a target area from 
the surface 
in addition to the underwater shots expedition leader robert 
ballard discoverer of the titanic talked to the students from the 
bridge of the support ship star hercules in the mediterranean he 
took questions from students at three of the 13 participating 
museums narrated live footage of underwater volcanoes and 
introduced films on satellite technology and the ancient greek 
voyager jason for whom the 20thcentury undersea robot was named 
our journey to the mediterranean has been anything but 
uneventful ballard said in recounting jasons mishap the 
voyage became a nonstop exercise in problemsolving 
during weeks of lessons and classroom discussion the students 
have developed an affection for the little robot explorer 
the biggest laugh of the morning came when a boy identified only 
as kenneth a gradeschool student from memphis tenn got to 
question ballard 
is jason alright he asked 
jason is fine ballard said his prides a little hurt but 
luckily none of his instrumentation is 
greg tardiff a seventh grader from beverly mass said word of 
jasons loss last week spread rapidly through the shore country day 
school 
we were crushed the 13yearold said we thought the 
whole thing would be called off 
paul fontaine of bostons museum of science said he was 
thrilled with the shows premiere although disappointed that 
the slightly less than stateoftheart standin took jasons place 
jason is the superior robot and probably could have picked a 
bigger variety of images he said but it was still a pretty 
impressive show 
for some of the kids too the show wasnt quite the same 
without jason 
the teachers said it was going to be so real that it would 
seem like the water could come right off the screen said 
10yearold almas rathod of the walter j paton school in 
shrewsbury mass it wasnt like that 
but classmate barry lyall said it met his expectations 
its much more interesting than hearing about it in a 
classroom the 9yearold native of scotland said it was the 
next best thing to being there 
the project sponsors include woods hole oceanographic 
institution turner broadcasting system inc the national 
geographic society and electronic data systems 
in addition to woods hole participating museums are the boston 
museum of science the museum of natural history in denver the 
detroit science center the discovery place in charlotte nc the

movement announced monday a conditional monthlong ceasefire which 
he called a goodwill gesture toward ending a sixyear civil war 
john garang a renegade army colonel who leads the rebels said 
the unilateral truce will hold only as long as the government 
carries out no troop movements in the wartorn south this includes 
reinforcing beleaguered army forces in the region he said 
there was no immediate government response to his offer which 
follows weeks of successes for the rebel sudan peoples liberation 
army several government garrisons including in the largest 
southern town of juba are under severe pressure 
in a statement broadcast by clandestine radio spla garang said 
he has ordered his forces to remain in their present positions 
throughout may 
army troops must do likewise he said but added a formula could 
be worked out to allow provision of nonmilitary supplies 
our people are suffering it is our responsibility to end the 
war he said on the broadcast from ethiopia and monitored in 
khartoum the sudanese capital 
the united nations in april began a relief operation to ease a 
warinduced famine and the flight of potential victims garang 
refused overtures to declare a month of tranquillity in the 
south but he did agree to allow passage of goods through specified 
corridors 
unidentified attackers twice have ambushed un food convoys 
since then 
on monday ambushers sprayed a vehicle with small arms fire near 
the rebelheld town of kapoeta on april 18 a convoy was hit by a 
rocket and automatic weapons fire also near kapoeta eight armed

called on the sudanese government to reciprocate 
he said his fighters will wait for the government to implement 
the requirements of the sudanese peace initiative after which a 
comprehensive ceasefire will be worked out 
in november the rebels signed an agreement with the democratic 
unionist party calling for the suspension of harsh islamic laws and 
a constitutional conference of all political powers 
prime minister sadek mahdi initially refused to submit the 
agreement to his cabinet for endorsement after pressure from the 
army and professional organizations and trade unions he formed a 
new broaderbased government and won parliaments approval to 
suspend the 1400yearold islamic penal code

government demanding social and economic reforms for the minority 
christians and animists of the south

a white antiapartheid 
activist was shot and killed monday outside his home by an 
assailant firing from a passing car police said 
colleagues said they had no doubt that david webster 44 was 
assassinated because of his political activities 
webster a lecturer in social anthropology at the university of 
the witwatersrand in johannesburg and a prominent member of several 
antiapartheid organizations was a leading opponent of the 
governments policy of detention without trial and held periodic 
tea parties for the families of detained black activists 
police said webster died almost instantly after he was hit in 
the back by a bullet fired from a heavycaliber weapon outside his 
home in the johannesburg neighborhood of troyeville nothing was 
known about the assailant police added 
with webster at the time was maggie friedman a friend and 
fellow member of the human rights commission a johannesburgbased 
monitoring group established by antiapartheid activists last year 
she said webster was shot after they had returned from buying 
plants at a nursery 
she said she heard a noise from a passing car which she thought 
had backfired then saw webster stagger and tell her ive been 
shot with a shotgun get an ambulance 
it is clear to me that his killing was a highly professional 
job she said i find it frightening that those who opposed him 
were prepared to go to such lengths to eliminate someone 
dozens of black activists have been killed in recent years in 
unsolved murders the five freedoms forum a human rights groups 
with which webster worked described mondays killing as one of the 
first assassinations of a white activist 
we are deeply shocked by this blatant assassination of our 
dear comrade said mohammed valli moosa a former detainee who 
serves as unofficial spokesman for major antiapartheid groups 
we are concerned that his death comes as a result of 
unflinching opposition to the system of apartheid valli moosa 
said the only beneficiaries of his death are those who have an 
interest in perpetuating this evil system

scientists on monday aborted the launch 
of indias first mediumrange ballistic missile seconds before it 
was to lift off when computers detected an error in one of the 
rockets systems officials said 
one military official said a problem developed in the liquid 
fuel propellant of the 6 million missile and there would have been 
a big disaster had the countdown reached zero 
it was the second time in 11 days that scientists postponed the 
testfiring of the missile which experts say has the capability to 
carry a nuclear warhead 
the postponement was met by cheers and the blowing of conch 
shells by many of the 12000 villagers who were temporarily 
evacuated from their homes around the launch site in this eastern 
indian town overlooking the bay of bengal 
a government statement issued at the remote seaside missile 
center said the launch was called off when computers detected the 
data error 
it is not a major fault said vs arunachalam scientific 
adviser to the defense ministry and head of indias missile program 
at the launch site 
but a military official said scientists detected a leak in the 
missiles liquid fuel propellant 11 seconds before the scheduled 
firing 
had the scientists counted to zero it would have ended in a 
big disaster the official said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
a previous attempt to fire the missile on april 20 was called 
off because of a snag in the ignition system 
military sources said the missile would likely be dismantled and 
every part checked before a third attempt is made 
scientists will postpone the launch for at least one week the 
sources said 
before the launch angry residents said prayers and held special 
ceremonies beseeching hindu gods and goddesses to prevent the 
missile from being fired the villagers fear they will be 
permanently shifted from their homes if the missile launch is 
successful and the test range is used for more firings 
the 7ton surfacetosurface missile has a range of 1550 
miles indian military experts say its first stage is boosted by a 
solid fuel propellant engine and its second stage is powered by a 
liquid fuel engine 
the range is sufficient to hit targets as far as iran in the 
west hong kong in the east china in the north and islands around 
the equator in the south western military officials said 
the missile named agni or fire in hindi can hit any 
target in neighboring pakistan indias longstanding adversary the 
two countries have fought three wars in the past 42 years 
defense experts said the oneton payload capability is more than 
enough for the missile to carry a nuclear warhead 
india has said its nuclear capacity will be used only for 
peaceful purposes but western military experts in new delhi said 
if india ever uses the missile in a war it might not carry a 
conventional warhead 
you need accuracy or a point target if you are using a 
conventional warhead said one western analyst speaking on 
condition of anonymity but if you are using a nuclear warhead 
the exact target does not matter 
india exploded a nuclear device 15 years ago and western 
experts estimate it would take indian scientists one week to 
assemble a nuclear device

president bush said monday he hopes soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev succeeds in his economic reforms and 
the white house brushed aside defense secretary dick cheneys 
prediction that gorbachev would fail 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said cheneys remarks 
in a weekend broadcast interview were merely his own personal 
observations and did not reflect the views of the administration 
which has adopted a public posture of trying to encourage soviet 
reforms 
bush speaking to the annual meeting of the us chamber of 
commerce said even the socialist world is beginning to see that 
socialism isnt just another economic system its the death of 
economics and there is a new breeze blowing 
bush said he told gorbachev last year we wanted to see 
perestroika economic reforms succeed in the soviet union and 
likewise we want to see success for the economic reforms in 
china 
the president did not mention cheney or his remarks fitzwater 
said he did not think bush talked about the soviet reforms because 
of cheneys comments rather fitzwater said it was a natural 
fit in a speech about economics 
the white house and state department joined forces to 
disassociate the administration from cheney who had said of 
gorbachev if i had to guess today i would guess he ultimately 
would fail 
in the broadcast interview the pentagon secretary predicted 
gorbachev then would be replaced by someone far more hostile 
toward the west 
last tuesday cheney made similar remarks during testimony 
before the house armed services committee he predicted a very 
real likelihood that gorbachevs reform plans would fail and that 
the soviet leader may either be forced to change course or hand 
over power 
cheney told congress that as a result the united states and its 
nato allies must resist the temptation to respond to gorbachevs 
proposals for reducing arsenals and troop strengths and stick to 
the policies it has advocated until now 
in his speech bush said reform efforts in the soviet union 
china and other socialist countries were part of an exciting 
trend and in my view it will continue 
whenever in the world there is economic reform the united 
states should be hoping that that reform succeeds economic reform 
with its emphasis on incentive and market economics leads to more 
freedom bush said 
he joked that the may day parade in moscow had included a 
delegation from the soviet economic planning ministry 200 
economists marching along yelling may day may day 
however bush said today that is beginning to change 
at the white house fitzwater said the administrations 
position on the soviet union whether expressed by president bush 
secretary baker or secretary cheney reflects the view that we want 
reform to succeed 
fitzwater asked about cheneys comments said i dont know 
what his motivation was in reading it the transcript it looks 
like it was just a question that came up in the interview when he 
offered his personal observations im sure it wasnt part of any 
grand strategy 
he said bush had not talked with cheney about the matter 
on another subject fitzwater said the white house did not plan 
to release documents that would buttress bushs contention that 
there was no link between his march 1985 meeting in honduras and 
that countrys support for the contra rebels in nicaragua 
bush and others involved in that meeting have all said there 
was no quid pro quo associated with the vice presidents trip to 
honduras however there is no campaign to publicize information 
fitzwater said 
on capitol hill senate majority leader george j mitchell 
dmaine said he has not changed his mind about the need for a 
review of whether the reagan white house withheld documents or 
other key information from the congressional investigation of the 
secret arms sales to iran and aid to the contras 
well have the intelligence committee look into that 
mitchell said questions have arisen that i think ought to be 
answered i think the intelligence committee will make a 
thorough review of the matter

workers strode through red square in a tightly 
controlled may day march monday but soviet armenians defied a ban 
and rallied in their capital thanking the world for helping them 
dig out of a deadly earthquake 
thousands of armenians gathered in yerevan to express gratitude 
for foreign aid that followed the dec 7 earthquake that killed an 
estimated 25000 people the government newspaper izvestia reported 
authorities had banned the traditional celebrations in yerevan 
and in tbilisi the capital of the soviet republic of georgia 
because of proindependance unrest in both cities and because of 
the armenian earthquake 
armenian activist rafael popoyan said the yerevan march was 
massive but peaceful he said participants demanded freedom for 
jailed members of a group leading the effort to annex 
nagornokarabakh a disputed region in the neighboring republic of 
azerbaijan 
in kishinev capital of the republic of moldavia youths 
boycotted a rally after student activists were refused their own 
column in that citys parade izvestia said 
the tiny republic on the romanian border has been the scene of 
several demonstrations and some violence in recent months as 
activists have pressed for greater independence from moscow 
in moscow howver the mood was decidedly upbeat under bright 
skies with the traditional red square parade highlighting the 
official tribute to workers of the world 
the emphasis was on progress at home and there were no direct 
references to international issues or the soviet troop withdrawal 
from afghanistan 
access to red square is severely restricted for such events and 
the vast majority of soviets who saw the twohour parade did so via 
television 
in an article coinciding with the holiday the daily newspaper 
socialist industry charged monday that soviet trade unions are mere 
government puppets that dont protect workers rights 
the newspaper which specializes in labor and economics called 
for giving labor organizations greater independence 
president mikhail s gorbachev and members of the communist 
partys ruling politburo stood atop lenins tomb to view 
festivities as thousands of marchers passed through red square 
waving banners pushing floats and releasing heliumfilled balloons 
his wife raisa was absent from the festivities that she has 
attended in the past there was no explanation 
in a section reserved for government dignitaries stood boris n 
yeltsin the maverick ousted as moscow party boss and removed from 
the politburo last year he made a remarkable comeback by winning a 
popular election to represent moscow in the new parliament that 
meets may 25 
signs and banners boosted perestroika gorbachevs program 
to overhaul and modernize soviet society there also was increased 
attention paid to the environment 
to the coming generations a clean planet pledged one 
banner 
in one solemn passage the parade announcer called for 
participants to remember those who died in armenia georgia and the 
soviet submarine accident last month in the norwegian sea 
it seems that one can hear at the square even now echoes of 
requiems that have not died away in armenia and georgia he said 
and the cold sea has not yet dried its salty tears mourning those 
heroes submariners who perished 
yerevan has been under curfew for more than six months to curb 
ethnic rivalries that killed more than 90 people in armennia and 
azerbaijan last year about 20 people died in proindependence 
unrest in tbilisi last month and 42 sailors were killed in the 
submarine tragedy

forty american and soviet poets and short 
story writers celebrated glasnost on monday by announcing the 
publication of a 345page anthology of some of their best works 
which author bel kaufman called an exchange of our common 
humanity 
the englishlanguage edition of the book titled the human 
experience is published domestically by alfred a knopf for 
1995 the russianlanguage version will be sold to soviet readers 
for two rubles each or about 330 
published under the auspices of the quaker usussr 
committee a philadelphiabased organization that promotes contacts 
between the two countries the anthology is the first joint 
sovietamerican venture in publishing fiction 
contributing american writers and poets include john updike 
joyce carol oates garrison keillor alice walker john sayles and 
stanley kunitz their soviet counterparts include evgeny 
yevtushenko tatiana tolstaya alexander kushner and vasily belov 
the book has to do with our common feelings love hate 
envy worry about our children life and death ms kaufman told 
a news conference at the national press club thats what will 
bring us together more than politics or polemics 
soviet publisher george andjaparidze said the anthology will 
allow the people of both countries to get to know each other and 
understand each other in sharing such mundane concerns as 
getting up with the alarm clock every morning finding a job 
falling in love 
there is nothing in this book about politics or ideology he 
said 
jay worrall jr clerk of the quaker committee said the book 
owes much to mikhail s gorbachevs glasnost policy of opening up 
soviet society and culture 
we owe it all to gorbachev and the quakers said 
andjaparidze who is editor of the khudozhestvennaya literatura 
publishing house in moscow 
some of the writers represented in the book 20 from each 
country will begin three days of informal consultations tuesday at 
the quaker meeting house in washington 
among their other scheduled activities are receptions at the 
folger shakespeare library and the soviet embassy and a poetry 
reading at the library of congress 
prominent soviet literary figure tatiana kudryaviseva said the 
easiest american writers to translate into russian are john 
cheever whose prose is crystal clear and william styron 
whose literary style reminds her of the great russian novelist leo 
tolstoy 
she said it is more difficult to translate the works of donald 
barthelme and joyce carol oates because of their unusual literary 
images and use of american slang 
in a foreword to the book styron wrote that the joint literary 
project may be symbolic of an even greater and more lasting 
solidarity as america and the soviet union choose friendship over 
the folly of perpetual strife 
in a separate foreword soviet novelist daniil granin wrote that 
feeling the oneness of the earth and recognizing your own 
thoughts and feelings in other people is the best pathway to 
trust

israeli professors monday protested the 
15month closure of palestinian universities and called the measure 
an unwarranted collective punishment that threatens peace efforts 
even though closing the universities doesnt kill or maim it 
causes serious injury to the fabric of any society said ruth 
gavison a law professor at hebrew university it disturbs life 
in a way that is far reaching 
israeli military authorities closed bethlehem university on oct 
29 1987 and by february 1988 had shut the remaining palestinian 
universities in the occupied west bank and gaza strip about 18000 
students are affected 
authorities called the colleges breeding grounds for 
antiisraeli protests 
but the 1200 professors from israeli universities said the 
closures threatened efforts to find moderate palestinians with 
which to negotiate an end to their 16month uprising at least 457 
arabs and 18 israelis have died in clashes mostly in the occupied 
territories 
universities are the only place the moderate elements of the 
palestinian community can develop said hava lazarusyafeh a 
professor of asian and african studies at hebrew university 
otherwise palestinian leaders grow in prisons and leaders 
who grow in jail tend to be more violent she said 
staterun primary and secondary schools in the west bank have 
also been closed for all but a few weeks since feb 4 1988 
kindergarten first and secondgrade classes in some private 
schools were allowed to reopen earlier this year 
authorities barred home study for university students and 
refused to allow them to use college facilities such as 
laboratories or libraries said david kretzmer a hebrew university 
law professor recently a west bank university was refused 
permission to open its library he said 
it is hard to understand how opening a library to librarians 
could endanger security kretzmer said 
hebrew universitys ms gavison called the closures a 
farreaching collective measure 
necessary security measures should be taken not against 
institutions but against those individuals who have may have 
violated order she said 
the longterm closures violate international statutes such as 
the geneva convention which governs the treatment of people under 
occupation kretzmer said 
he said that a 1982 israeli supreme court ruling determined 
military closures of palestinian schools could not surpass a 
reasonable period

cambodias vietnameseinstalled 
government has changed the countrys name and flag and invited its 
banished prince to return home and help rule 
in nearby indonesia resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk 
welcomed the concessions and appeared ready to make a few of his 
own to end the 10year conflict 
it seems that we are at the end of the tunnel we are going to 
make progress on the way toward a settlement sihanouk said on 
monday the eve of new peace talks 
prime minister hun sen of cambodia invited sihanouk to abandon 
his khmer rouge allies and join us 
the official cambodian news agency spk monday quoted hun sen as 
promising sihanouk will have real power if he returns to phnom 
penh the comments made at a phnom penh news conference saturday 
appeared tailored for the peace talks in jakarta which now are 
expected to last longer than a day 
hun sen stopped in bangkok on his way to jakarta on monday and 
told reporters the changes are concessions to help settle the war 
he too said he was confident of success in the talks with sihanouk 
he said that on sunday the national assembly unanimously 
adopted constitutional amendments changing the peoples republic 
of kampuchea to the state of cambodia 
hun sen sported a model of the new flag the top half is red 
the bottom is blue and a gold image of angkor wat temple is in the 
center a new national anthem and coat of arms also are in the 
works he said 
his government was installed by vietnamese forces that invaded 
the country in late 1978 and toppled the brutal khmer rouge regime 
it is battling a coalition of three guerrilla groups led by 
sihanouk 
diplomats say the changes are to strengthen the governments 
domestic and international support as it begins to confront the 
resistance without the help of vietnam 
hanoi announced last month that it will withdraw its troops by 
sept 30 to encourage a political settlement in cambodia 
sihanouk and other resistance officials in the past have 
demanded not only changing the countrys name and flag but also 
dismantling the government before general elections 
on monday sihanouk said he would not insist on this or un 
supervision of the vietnamese withdrawal so long as an adequate 
powersharing formula can be found 
he also appeared to drop a call for hun sen to join a fourparty 
government that would include sihanouks noncommunist followers 
anticommunists under former premier son sann and the communist 
khmer rouge 
i had a good feeling when i left phnom penh that prince 
norodom has already offered two concessions if this is true it 
could lead to a political settlement hun sen told reporters 
although he called on sihanouk to join his government and 
abandon the khmer rouge hun sen also stressed the princes options 
are few 
we have traveled 10 years without sihanouk we started with 
empty hands and have established material and technical bases 
hun sen said 
the country was known as the kingdom of cambodia when sihanouk 
led it to independence from the french in 1953 sihanouk ruled 
until he was toppled in a 1970 coup by marshal lon nol who changed 
the name to the khmer republic 
the khmer rouge changed it to democratic kampuchea when they won 
a civil war and overthrew lon nols usbacked government in april 
1975 the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people in 
attempts to fashion a peasant society along fanatical communist 
lines 
the united nations does not recognize the provietnamese 
government instead it seats the guerrilla coalition formed in 
1982 called the coalition government of democratic kampuchea

the united states averted a potentially 
serious rift in usjapanese relations by going ahead with the 
controversial agreement for the two countries to develop jointly a 
new jet fighter for japan the new american ambassador to tokyo 
said monday 
ambassador michael armacost told reporters that despite 
persistent strong objections to the project on capitol hill im 
confident it will meet with the acquiescence of our congress 
president bush announced friday that the united states intends 
to proceed with the fsx fighter program because it is in the 
strategic and commercial interests of the united states 
after taking office in january bush ordered a review of the 7 
billion project negotiated under his predecessor ronald reagan 
critics in congress and the commerce department have said it 
amounts to a giveaway of us high technology and have said japan 
should make an offtheshelf aircraft purchase as do other 
nations that are us customers 
armacost brought up the negative side of scrapping the agreement 
in an appearance at the washington foreign press center on the eve 
of his departure for japan where he is due next week 
proceeding with the fsx project is important from our 
standpoint because of what it avoided namely america and japan 
going down separate tracks he said it avoids what could have 
been an important breach in our relationship if this deal had gone 
awry 
the fsx agreement is a good arrangement for both our 
governments we have had coproduction in past but major 
codevelopment is in a sense the first such arrangement with 
japan said armacost a former undersecretary of state for 
political affairs 
i hope this will be a model of the flow of twoway technology 
which is quite appropriate to a more mature relationship between 
our countries in this field the ambassador said 
the white house said monday that with japan bush has been 
very tough in demanding equity for the united states in terms of 
its commercial interests and he was successful in getting 
everything he asked for fridays announcement said us 
companies would be guaranteed about 40 percent of the production 
work on the planned 130 new fighters while certain computer codes 
from the us f16 jet which provides the model for the fsx would 
be withheld

a northern minnesota countys 
attempt to boost its population with a land giveaway program 
brought thousands of responses from around the world 
it also brought complaints and legal snags that threaten the 
program 
were getting tremendous pressure to shut down the program 
said bruce biggins the koochiching county commissioner who heads 
the homestead authority we got into it in good faith but weve 
taken a tremendous amount of flak 
among the problems are resentment from longtime county 
residents far less available land than originally planned 
reluctance by bankers to make construction loans and an 
overwhelming demand 
you have a whole lot of people out there really really 
desperate for a new way of life said larry chezick a county 
commissioner it frankly swamped us we didnt fieldtest it 
before the media got onto it 
the international publicity of the program drew people to the 
area who had not received approval to homestead last winter three 
homesteading hopefuls from colorado were arrested trying to break 
into an empty farmhouse another time two germans wandered into 
the local job service office saying they intended to homestead and 
needed work 
on paper the whole idea looks good but the reality doesnt 
live up to it said sheriff bill elliott who received calls from 
police officers around the country who were interested in the 
program 
for a while the homesteading office had to hire receptionists 
who could speak german to handle the overseas requests 
more than 10000 people asked for information about the program 
about onefourth of whom sent 10 to receive an application about 
250 people followed through with an application and only two 
homesteaders have received their 40acre parcels 
tom johnson jr 24 one of the homesteaders said he had 
trouble finding bank financing for the house he wants to build the 
land cant be used as collateral because under the program 
homesteaders do not receive title to it until they live there for 
10 years 
weve tried to get that across to them since the beginning 
said marlys raboin senior vice president of first american bank in 
international falls if you cant finance the property the 
program just isnt workable 
the program has turned out to be unworkable in other ways 
because homesteaders were mistakenly told that about 50000 acres 
of taxforfeited county lands and state lands were available but 
it was later discovered that most of the state land cant be given 
away because its held in trust 
officials say now it is not clear exactly how much land they are 
entitled to give away 
some sites also might have mineral leases or significant 
waterfront property that could prevent them from being given away 
said dennis hummitzch the countys land commissioner 
program officials said they were extremely selective in choosing 
participants but some local residents have their doubts

the customs service proposed on monday that 
the government unions and airline and shipping industries unite in 
a drive to prevent drug smuggling by air and sea 
it would be the first time that industry labor and government 
have joined together to put together a plan to combat drug 
smuggling customs commissioner william von raab said before 
meeting with representatives of about 100 air and sea carriers 
where the plan was outlined 
von raab estimated that 30 percent of the cocaine coming into 
the country is entering in containers he said he expected that to 
reach 50 percent in the next two years and up to 80 percent to 90 
percent by 1992 because of a crackdown on other forms of 
trafficking 
the plan seeks to prevent drugs from being put on board at 
foreign ports said lou razzino the agencys program manager for 
narcotics interdiction in commercial cargo prevent is the key 
word up until now weve been talking interdiction he added 
at the meeting a longshoremens union leader said union members 
might refuse to unload any cargo from drugproducing countries if 
they dont curtail the illegal trafficking 
john bowers president of the international longshoremans 
association said some foreign countries dont even care whether 
drugs are going on these ships 
he added that his members are saying that if they think they 
can use those ships as the dumping grounds in the united states for 
their drugs then were going to put on a boycott we know wed 
lose wages wed rather lose wages than lose our children 
he declined to say what criteria the union would use to refuse 
to unload ships he noted that longshoremen had refused for 25 
years to unload cargo from the soviet union and recently paid 9 
million in fines because the union lost a supreme court decision 
over the boycott 
the proposal outlined monday calls for industries to impose 
strict security standards at foreign and domestic terminals and 
facilities and aboard their carriers customs would provide 
security training surveys of foreign and domestic sites and help 
in identifying potential smuggling opportunities 
compliance with the voluntary agreement will be considered in 
assessing penalties or seizing a vehicle found to have illegal 
drugs after the pact is signed 
the cost to each carrier has not been determined 
under the antidrug abuse act of 1986 penalties for carrying 
illegal drugs went up to 1000 per ounce of heroin and cocaine and 
500 per ounce of marijuana the law also authorized seizure of the 
carrier 
some carriers representatives wanted a tariff imposed that 
would cover their costs for new security measures the agreement 
would demand so they would remain competitive with carriers that 
dont participate razzino said however that such a decision 
would be up to congress

soviet trade unions serve to promote the 
government and the status quo instead of workers rights a 
newspaper said monday in an article that injected some criticism of 
official bodies into may days labor pageantry 
under the headline what do we need a union for economist 
alexander auzan compared the countrys unions to a grandmother 
who makes a lot of fuss interferes in everything but who no one 
really listens to 
the trade unions have been turned into a government 
maidservant concerned not with defending the interests of the 
workers but only with maintaining peace and quiet and an imitation 
of mass support auzan wrote in socialist industry the soviet 
daily 
many western unions long have said their soviet counterparts 
have been coopted by the government 
president mikhail s gorbachev urged labor unions in 1987 to be 
more vigorous in defending rankandfile workers but increasing 
numbers of critics say the unions should prod bureaucrats more 
aggressively to improve housing salaries and working conditions 
although some soviet labor officials acknowledge failings of 
their unions they have publicly ruled out forming independent 
trade organizations like polands solidarity 
in his article auzan said unions should be given more 
independence and suggested they be decentralized 
unions should act as information clearing houses on vacancies 
and dislocated workers set up retraining centers and guarantee 
unemployment benefits the economist said 
he also called for union representatives elected to a new 
national congress of peoples deputies to press for a strike law to 
clarify what job actions are legal 
in his criticisms of unions auzan said union leaders never 
fly urgently to the scene of a strike conflict or act as 
mediators between workers and government organs 
even though most strikes are prohibited there have been 
increasing reports of workers walking off their jobs to demand 
higher pay or to protest working conditions 
the economist also complained that membership in trade unions is 
practically universally obligatory and he said many 
bookkeepers automatically deduct union dues from the salaries even 
of nonmembers 
enough of paying tribute to the union bureaucracy he wrote

greenpeace asked the soviet union on monday to 
seek world help to recover from the bottom of the norwegian sea 
one mile down a wrecked submarine and its two nuclear reactors and 
nuclear weapons 
a technical report commissioned by the environmental 
organization said the soviet submarine on april 7 took a 
significant amount of highly active and toxic radioactive 
materials to the bottom 5296 feet beneath the surface 
if the submarine is not recovered intact then it is in our 
opinion inevitable that all of this material will disperse to the 
marine environment said the report by the independent nuclear 
engineering consultants john large and associates ltd of london 
fortytwo seamen were killed and 27 survived when the vessel 
armed with two nuclear torpedoes and reportedly fueled by uranium 
235 caught fire and sank 120 miles southwest of norways bear 
island 
the report said the nuclear reactors may have contained up to 20 
million curies of radioactivity and the reactor hull parts 1 
million curies greenpeace said its figures are conservative 
because they do not include the radioactivity of the reactors 
liquid metal coolant or the toxic plutonium of the torpedoes 
the no 4 reactor at the chernobyl nuclear power plant by 
comparison emitted an estimated 50 million curies of radiation 
after it caught fire in the soviet union in april 1986 
the report said much of the radioactive material aboard the mike 
class submarine will continue to emit radiation and be harmful to 
marine and human life for many tens of thousands of years 
this vast quantity of radioactivity is mainly from highly 
active materials which will remain highly toxic to organisms almost 
indefinitely said greenpeace spokesman damian durrant 
inevitably they will be released and a proportion absorbed 
into the marine food chains through fisheries and toward man the 
only question is when the reactors breach and this process begins 
director johan baarli of the norwegian national institute of 
radiation protection said in response to the report there is no 
reason to doubt that the subs reactor is in its containment 
according to all information we have there is no radiation 
leakage 
the institute said last month that tests showed the submarines 
reactors and weapons have apparently withstood tremendous water 
pressure water samples collected near the submarine showed no 
radiation that could be attributed to it the institute said 
the soviet news agency tass quoted deputy prime minister igor 
belovsov last month as saying a decision on whether to raise the 
submarine is months away 
the report does not discuss the possible impact of leaked 
radioactivity on the marine environment 
this requires a further study dependent on the provision of 
more information from the soviet union as requested by greenpeace 
as well as the norwegian government but which neither have thus 
far received greenpeace said 
the report noted that when the united states tried to raise a 
soviet golf class nuclear submarine in 1974 the vessel broke in 
half 
it said recovery should not be regarded as a quick technical 
fix for this or future nuclear submarine accidents and called for 
elimination of all 544 military nuclear reactors from ships and 
submarines worldwide

the united states on monday reaffirmed its 
insistence on the improvement of shortrange nuclear missiles in 
west germany despite the opposition of chancellor helmut kohl and 
his government 
there was no hint of compromise in the statement read by 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler at the state department she denied 
however that us officials were irritated with kohl for trying to 
delay the modernization of the lance missiles and artillery and for 
demanding us negotiations with the soviet union to reduce the 
nuclear arsenal 
secretary james a baker is not upset the us official 
said 
the rift was not healed during a weekend meeting in west germany 
between kohl and british prime minister margaret thatcher an 
ardent proponent of extending the range of the missiles as a way of 
deterring soviet attack 
we of course share the view of the united kingdom that it 
would be a mistake to engage in negotiations on snf shortrange 
nuclear forces ms tutwiler said we also share the united 
kingdom view that we need to maintain an uptodate landbased 
nuclear deterrent in europe 
she continued we have a difference of opinion with other 
members of the north atlantic treaty organization alliance and we 
will be seeking to resolve the issue 
the statements reference to groundbased missiles appeared to 
rule out a compromise under which the lances in west german might 
be scaled back or withdrawn and their place in nato strategy taken 
by airlaunched cruise missiles 
it also suggested the west germans have some support within nato 
the dispute is causing strains in the alliance and could put a 
damper on president bushs summit meeting in brussels may 2930 
with the leaders of the 15 other nato countries 
baker is due in brussels on may 12 for previously scheduled 
talks with nato officials and will discuss the tactical nuclear 
issue with western foreign ministers 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater asked about the 
impasse said our position remains that keeping the peace 
requires a strong nato alliance and a policy of flexible response 
we believe the vast soviet superiority and warsaw pact conventional 
forces must be reduced before we can discuss reductions in short 
range nuclear weapons 
the west german position demonstrates the special strength 
that nato has fitzwater said our allies can debate quite 
vigorously these issues yet maintain the basic strength of our 
unity 
but he continued we believe very strongly in our position 
we believe very strongly that flexible response is essential to the 
peace of europe 
the new york times quoted unnamed bush administration officials 
on sunday as saying the kohl government was threatening natos 
unity by pressing for speeding negotiations with the soviets on the 
missiles and artillery the newspaper said the officials had grown 
increasingly irritated with kohl for trying to line up other 
european nations against the united states 
behind the scenes the two sides are jockeying for support 
the associated press disclosed last week that all us 
ambassadors in nato capitals were instructed to outline the us 
position to the host governments to try to win them over west 
germany is using the same approach

a witness against the defendant in the 
night stalker serial murder trial failed to tell the whole 
truth the prosecutor in the case disclosed monday 
the unexpected move by deputy district attorney p philip halpin 
stalled the opening of richard ramirezs defense case as halpin won 
permission to reopen his case to question the witness again 
jurors were told something has come up to abort mondays 
court session and were instructed to return tuesday when the 
witness is to appear 
ramirez 29 a drifter from el paso texas is charged with 13 
gruesome murders and 30 related felonies in a string of nighttime 
attacks that terrified southern california in the summer of 1985 
halpin said the omitted testimony is nothing spectacular 
its not significant evidence but he said he was dutybound to 
reveal the omission which he discovered after he rested his case 
april 13 and the judge ordered a twoweek recess 
halpin who had called 137 people to testify since opening his 
case jan 30 refused to identify the witness or describe the 
missing evidence he said only that the witness told him the 
testimony was withheld to protect someone to protect a woman 
ramirez had expected his attorney daniel hernandez to deliver 
his opening statement to the jury 
if the district attorney is going to stop the procedures for 
this one witness it must be very significant hernandez said 
outside court 
but his cocounsel ray clark said it was not unusual to find 
out that a witness didnt tell the whole truth most witnesses 
fudge he said 
halpin said the witness is not a victim or survivor of the night 
stalker attacks of 1985 he said that during the recess he asked 
that a few witnesses be interviewed again by investigators 
there ware a couple of things concerning me he said a 
lot of hearsay floating around 
he added i dont think the testimony is going to change 
anything in this case

lawmakers said monday that congress painfully 
aware of the more than 20 billion invested in the b1 bomber will 
take a close look at an air force request for an additional 12 
billion to correct major flaws 
it doesnt make a lot of sense not to make the b1 work if you 
can do it said rep marvin leath dtexas a member of the house 
armed services committee we really have to put the arm on the 
air force 
the service has proposed spending the extra 12 billion over 
five years to improve the b1 the swingwing plane resurrected by 
thenpresident reagan in 1981 as the answer to the aging of the 
nations force of nucleararmed bombers 
the b1b fleet has experienced major problems three of the 
original 100 ordered by reagan have crashed and two months ago the 
general accounting office the investigative arm of congress 
concluded that the cost of planned improvements could be nearly 
400 million for each bomber 
the gao cited problems with the aircrafts defense system and 
also troubles with fuel leaks 
in a memorandum circulated to members of the house armed 
services procurement subcommittee last week committee chairman les 
aspin dwis questioned whether spending more money would solve 
the fleets problems 
even when these fixes are made the plane will fall far short 
of the original electronic countermeasure specifications well 
have to decide if improvement planned is worth the money aspin 
said 
congress will review the request within the next two months as 
part of the defense authorization process 
rep andy ireland rfla a member of the armed services 
committee said the country has spent more than 20 billion on the 
fleet and abandoning that investment would be difficult 
we do have 97 already invested we need to finish them up 
again under close scrutiny said ireland 
the florida republican said the b1 performs substantially as 
expected in a lot a lot of ways but an area of skepticism 
needs to prevail 
in addition to the funding request for the b1 the air force 
also has proposed shifting nearly 300 million for procurement of 
the b2 stealth bomber to research and development on the aircraft 
we have to take a long hard look at the b2 said leath 
that thing is going to consume tons and tons of money and im 
not sure at this point after going through the b1 if were up to 
that 
defense secretary dick cheney has already proposed pushing back 
production of the b2 to 1993 and almost 41 billion is being cut 
from the fiscal 1990 and 1991 budgets for the radarevading plane 
recent estimates of 500 million per plane would make it the most 
expensive in history

city officials fed up with unruly grateful 
dead fans and drug use at weekend concerts said they will try to 
ban future appearances by the rock band 
about 100 people were arrested during concerts friday saturday 
and sunday for various offenses most involving drug possession 
police said all of the lsd and other drugs we confiscated was 
just incredible said police sgt al murray 
hundreds of fans turned up without tickets to see the soldout 
concert saturday police declared an emergency and called in 
reinforcements from other cities when about 100 fans tried to storm

rodrigues said 
the missing men were identified as fireman apprentice james 
david lear of washburn ill and lt walter gray womble ii of

afghan government commanders have issued 
sovietmade gas masks to their troops in the besieged city of 
jalalabad according to a telephone reports from guerrilla leader 
gen abdul rahim wardak military commander of the national 
islamic front of afghanistan conveyed the information by telephone 
from peshawar pakistan on april 25 to marin strmecki a 
washingtonbased analyst who recently returned from jalalabad 
he informed me by telephone that the afghan government troops 
had been issued gas masks and other chemical warfare equipment for 
example protective suits and the launchers for chemical warfare 
shells strmecki said monday 
the troops loyal to the sovietbacked government in kabul have 
not used chemical weapons to break the siege said strmecki an 
aide to former national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski at the 
center for strategic and international studies in washington 
some reports have implied the failure of the attack against 
jalalabad involving an estimated 15000 anticommunist mujahedeen 
guerrillas and a slightly smaller force loyal to the sovietbacked 
government 
the city in eastern afghanistan was viewed as a gateway to 
kabul 
another recent visitor to afghanistan charles schnabel 
assistant to rep charles wilson dtexas said he saw sovietmade 
gas masks during a trip to other parts of afghanistan that ended 
last dec 13 
i was going to bring some back but i got tired of carrying 
them these were a long way inside afghanistan said schnabel 
the congressional aide said he heard numerous reports of the use 
of chemical weapons but found no eyewitnesses and did not believe 
government troops would use them to defend jalalabad 
if your back is to the wall you might do something like that 
there appears to me to a stalemate so it doesnt appear to me that 
they would use it he said 
strmecki did not depict the battle as a stalemate and forecast 
a mujahedeen victory 
wardak reported the mujahedeen are slowly and inexorably 
tightening a ring around jalalabad and are within three miles of 
the city center strmecki said 
strmecki said he had visited the eastern and northern edges of 
jalalabad on march 12 six days after mujahedeen began their siege 
government forces he said were inflicting heavy casualties on 
the guerrillas with high altitude bombing runs by mig27 fighters 
and converted antonov12 transport planes operating above the range 
of ussupplied stinger antiaircraft missiles said strmecki 
the jalalabad airport has been closed since the siege began and 
government resupply efforts have been confined to about 20 or 25 
helicopter deliveries per day he said

speaker jim wright now defending himself 
against house ethics charges in 1985 inserted in congress 
official journal his effusive endorsement of a home video program 
sold by a company employing his wife 
in the endorsement later used by the company for promotional 
material wright praised the program as a marvelously useful home 
video tool 
congressional rules generally bar members from receiving 
benefits as a result of improperly exerting their position and 
guidelines caution lawmakers against becoming so affiliated with 
a particular enterprise that it creates an appearance of 
impropriety 
the speaker who is defending himself against charges that he 
broke house rules 69 times over the past decade has argued 
recently that the career of his wife betty is totally separate 
from his work as a member of congress 
but in the dec 9 1985 edition of the congressional record 
wright inserted a 350word endorsement of the pacific institutes 
family video series that mrs wright had helped develop he did not 
mention her 36000ayear job at the seattle wash company or 
role in its production 
it was a nice gesture we didnt ask for it said jack 
fitterer the companys chief operating officer we were 
pleasantly surprised 
asked monday about the incident wright said he would have no 
comment 
in the endorsement wright calls the marketing of the video a 
heartening development indeed and notes that the series is 
available at a nominal price within the range of most american 
families the tapes sold for 3495 each 
he also terms the taped motivational program a marvelously 
useful home video tool to promote togetherness and really 
productive family conversation 
wright adds from its base in seattle wash the pacific 
institute has drawn upon the skills of professional educators and 
specialists in personal and family development to perfect a series 
of 21 home video programs the institute promises to make these 
services available widely throughout the country 
the company later reprinted wrights congressional record 
comments as promotional material for its video series 
any member of congress is free to insert material into the 
congressional record which is the daily journal of congress 
official floor activities but the rules generally bar any member 
from receiving benefits which would occur by virtue of influence 
improperly exerted from his position in the congress 
the guidelines also caution lawmakers not to become too 
closely affiliated with a particular enterprise to prevent the 
appearance that the rule is being broken they say further that 
communications should be drafted so that they do not lend 
themselves to misinterpretation as an official endorsement from the 
congress 
and the rules specifically bar members from letting their 
congressional stationery be used by outsiders for commercial 
promotions 
in addition to charging wright with 69 instances of house rules 
violations the ethics panel is continuing to investigate a texas 
gas well deal that brought huge profits to wrights blind trust in 
a short period last year wrights ties to the pacific institute 
and his wifes employment are not currently subjects of the ethics 
probe 
it is not known whether the committee was previously aware of 
wrights submission of the promotional material to the record 
first reported monday by the wall street journal 
but betty wrights employment by another company the investment 
partnership she and her husband had with fort worth real estate 
developer george mallick and his wife marlene is central to the 
ethics probe the panel found reason to believe that 18000ayear 
job from 1981 through 1984 was nothing more than a conduit for 
gifts from mallick to the wrights 
mrs wrights employment at the two companies overlapped for 
several months 
she was hired by pacific institute founder lou tice in september 
1984 and she worked for the company for 36000 a year through 
1987 during that time tice met numerous corporate executives and 
lobbyists through the wrights including at an appearance in 1985 
at the annual retreat of house democrats to the greenbrier resort 
in west virginia 
mrs wright also ran one of tices motivational seminars for 
wrights congressional staff during the time she worked for the 
company according to people who attended the twoday session in a 
capitol meeting room 
tices motivational message is based on the power of positive 
thinking model often used in sales he encourages people to boost 
their own selfimage visualize their possibilities and screen 
out negative thoughts wright himself is said by colleagues to be 
an strong adherent of tices message 
in a related development five texans subpoenaed to testify 
before the ethics panel on wednesday about a gas drilling venture 
attacked the report of committee counsel richard phelan as 
misleading 
in a report issued by their washington lawyer stanley brand 
the group argued that a geological formation struck by the well 
continues to be promising even though the well so far has been 
unable to produce commercial quantities of gas or oil 
the report states that phelan in characterizing the lucrative 
sale of wrights share in the venture as a gift has shown a 
fundamental misunderstanding of the oil business the remaining 
partners in the venture plan to spend 2 million more to drill 
again because they estimate some 88 million in recoverable oil and 
gas is present in their leased tract near the louisianatexas line 
brand said the group which includes san antonio financier 
morris jaffe and his son md jaffe has not yet decided whether 
to honor the ethics committees subpoena calling for them to 
testify on wednesday and thursday

yasser arafat said he expects his first 
official visit to paris on tuesday to give middle east peace 
efforts a push forward 
the palestine liberation organization chairman said in an 
interview monday he has great confidence in francois 
mitterrand the french president as a man of principles and a 
supporter of the cause of justice 
he criticized french jewish leaders who have protested the visit 
and declared im sure those who are interested in seeing peace 
prevail will change their minds and support the visit which will 
certainly give further impetus to peace moves 
jewish groups have said they will mount protests during the 
twoday visit arafat will meet with mitterrand premier michel 
rocard and foreign minister roland dumas 
he will be accompanied by farouk kaddoumi head of the plo 
political department yasser abedrabbo the information director 
and mohammed milhem and mahmoud darwish members of the executive 
committee 
kaddoumi acts as the plo foreign minister and abedrabbo has led 
the plo team in meetings with the united states in tunis 
plo sources said arafats media adviser bassam abu sharif and 
spokesman ahmed abdelrahman also would make the trip to paris 
washington ended its 13year ban on dealings with the plo in 
december and initiated a dialogue after arafat renounced terrorism 
and recognized israels right to exist 
the changed us attitude and nearly 17 months of palestinian 
rebellion against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip have helped alter western europes perception of the plo 
several countries have begun direct contacts 
arafat said in the interview at his heavily guarded military 
headquarters in baghdad i will discuss with president mitterrand 
everything including our peace initiatives 
i will be ready to hear from him his ideas on the middle east 
and the palestinian issue in particular i have great expectations 
that my visit to france and my meetings there will push forward the 
peace efforts in the region 
in paris about 2000 police were mobilized for the visit 
authorities said sharpshooters were stationed on rooftops and 
helicopters patrolled overhead 
simultaneous demonstrations were planned for tuesday evening 
one by arafat supporters and the other by jewish protesters 
premier rocard told journalists sunday night the protocol would 
not equal that accorded a chief of state because arafat is 
neither a head of state nor a prime minister he is being treated 
according to his level of dignity 
neither mitterrand nor rocard will meet arafat at orly airport 
for example 
an independent palestinian state was declared last november at a 
meeting of the palestine national council which acts as the plo 
legislature 
on monday the israeli foreign ministry complained that the 
insignia adopted for it features a map incorporating most of israel 
it is worrying a ministry official said privately they 
say they want the west bank and the gaza strip now they introduce 
a logo and it includes israel 
he gave reporters copies of two letters with the insignia one 
signed by arafat and the other by nabil ramlawi plo representative 
to the united nations in geneva 
in the insignias center is a map that includes the west bank 
gaza strip and all of israel except the golan heights 
israel captured the three territories in the 1967 middle east 
war it annexed the golan heights taken from syria in december 
1981

in the occupied west bank and gaza strip an israeli human rights 
group said monday 
also monday palestinian sources said plo officials abroad 
approve most orders to kill arabs suspected of collaborating with 
israel 
the israeli information center for human rights in the 
territories said soldiers killed 34 palestinians in april but the 
army disputed the figure the organization said the monthly total 
was second only to 44 killed in april 1988 
doctors at mukassad hospital in jerusalem said 10yearold samir 
merai died monday of a wound suffered wednesday in a confrontation 
with soldiers at the tulkarem refugee camp in the west bank

police on monday charged a 
22yearold civil servant with murder in a shooting spree that 
killed one man and wounded 14 people in a coastal town 
lawmakers called for tightening britains already strict gun 
control laws following the 15minute shotgun rampage sunday 
afternoon 
police arrested robert sartin 22 shortly after the attack in 
monkseaton a fashionable suburb of the whitley bay seaside resort 
in northeast england dressed in black and wearing sunglasses and 
an ammunition belt the gunman walked the streets shooting 
indiscriminately witnesses said 
kenneth mackintosh 41 married and the father of two children 
was killed four of the 14 wounded remained hospitalized monday 
three in serious condition 
on monday police granted the suspect a fiveminute visit with 
his parents then announced his identity and said he was charged 
with the slaying of mackintosh 
detective superintendent bob benton told reporters sartin 
probably will be charged with other offenses later 
a neighbor of sartin said she was absolutely stunned to hear 
of the young mans arrest the woman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said he was always a nice boy he has never given 
any trouble here 
police said the shotgun found in his car during his arrest was 
licensed to his father 
home secretary douglas hurd the cabinet minister responsible 
for law and order asked for a police report into the shootings 
britains gun laws were tightened following the countrys worst 
mass murder in august 1987 gun collector michael ryan ran through 
hungerford 60 miles west of london killing 16 people including 
his mother before turning his gun on himself 
the new laws banned sawedoff shotguns mortars and selfloading 
rifles a highpowered weapon similar to that used by ryan 
britons were already prohibited from owning such automatic 
weapons as machine guns and must obtain a license to own other 
weapons applicants for gun licenses must satisfy police they have 
a good reason to own each firearm and its ammunition a suitable 
place to use them and can store them securely to prevent theft 
but police and lawmakers said monday that too many loopholes 
remain in the law 
its far too easy for people to get ahold of shotguns said 
alan eastwood chairman of the police federation which represents 
more than 120000 police officers 
lawmaker david winnick of the opposition labor party said the 
government should make it more difficult for individuals to obtain 
a license to own a shotgun his colleague ted leadbitter called 
for a ban on individuals owning any firearms for private use 
however anthony beaumontdark member of parliament for the 
governing conservative party cautioned against a kneejerk 
reaction 
the british association for shooting and conservation said 
tighter laws were not the answer 
there are nearly a million legitimate shotgun holders in 
britain said director john swift one man dressed in black 
leather with a knife strapped to his thigh has nothing to do with 
those ordinary men and women who take part in country shooting

the united states averted a potentially 
serious rift in usjapanese relations by going ahead with the 
controversial agreement for the two countries to develop jointly a 
new jet fighter for japan the new american ambassador to tokyo 
said monday 
ambassador michael armacost told reporters that despite 
persistent strong objections to the project on capitol hill im 
confident it will meet with the acquiescence of our congress 
president bush announced friday that the united states intends 
to proceed with the fsx fighter program because it is in the 
strategic and commercial interests of the united states 
after taking office in january bush ordered a review of the 7 
billion project negotiated under his predecessor ronald reagan 
critics in congress and the commerce department have said it 
amounts to a giveaway of us high technology and have said japan 
should make an offtheshelf aircraft purchase as do other 
nations that are us customers 
armacost brought up the negative side of scrapping the agreement 
in an appearance at the washington foreign press center on the eve 
of his departure for japan where he is due next week 
proceeding with the fsx project is important from our 
standpoint because of what it avoided namely america and japan 
going down separate tracks he said it avoids what could have 
been an important breach in our relationship if this deal had gone 
awry 
the fsx agreement is a good arrangement for both our 
governments we have had coproduction in past but major 
codevelopment is in a sense the first such arrangement with 
japan said armacost a former undersecretary of state for 
political affairs 
i hope this will be a model of the flow of twoway technology 
which is quite appropriate to a more mature relationship between 
our countries in this field the ambassador said 
the white house said monday that with japan bush has been 
very tough in demanding equity for the united states in terms of 
its commercial interests and he was successful in getting 
everything he asked for fridays announcement said us 
companies would be guaranteed about 40 percent of the production 
work on the planned 130 new fighters while certain computer codes 
from the us f16 jet which provides the model for the fsx would 
be withheld

eight men from soviet georgia were holding a 
hunger strike in a tbilisi hospital and demanding an antidote to 
gas used by soldiers to quell a nationalist demonstration a 
georgian activist said monday 
the men ranging in age from 19 to 26 have been fasting since 
friday said david nadiradze a member of a georgian 
proindependence group he said they also are demanding an 
inspection by the international red cross 
nadiradze said in a telephone interview that the strike aimed to 
defend the poisoned people referring to the dozens of tbilisi 
residents still hospitalized with symptoms that georgian health 
officials say resemble the effects of nerve gas 
at least 20 people died and 1100 were injured in ethnic unrest 
in tbilisi the capital of georgia on april 9 georgian activists 
say the soldiers attacked a peaceful demonstration with shovels 
clubs and chemicals 
soviet officials have acknowledged tear gas was used on some 
protesters but they deny nerve gas or other lethal chemical 
weapons were turned on the demonstrators 
members of a citizens commission investigating the 
confrontation and doctors treating victims say a second gas that 
paralyzes the central nervous system was used 
georgias communist party chief givi gumbaridze said some 
victims died of gas poisoning 
the southern republics minister of internal affairs shota 
gorgodze on monday denied a military officers claim that soldiers 
and their families have been beaten and their apartments stoned 
because citizens blame them for the april 9 confrontation 
pravda quoted gorgodze as saying that his ministry had received 
eight reports of attacks against soldiers and all turned out to be 
false he said no official complaints had come in of attacks 
against families and rumors to that effect proved wrong 
gen in rodionov commander of the caucasus military district 
said saturday that people in tbilisi are blaming red army soldiers 
for the clash and taking revenge on their families 
he pointed out the troops involved belonged to the interior 
ministry and suggested they should wear special uniforms that would 
help identify them 
demonstrations in georgia first began april 4 when protesters 
criticized calls from members of the republics ethnic abkhazian 
minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by 
georgians 
other protesters have demanded georgia secede from the soviet 
union because of alleged interference from the central government

expansion of private and public health 
insurance to the nations 37 million uninsured is illadvised 
because it doesnt target people who need help most and doesnt 
curtail spiraling health care costs a former health adviser to 
president bush said monday 
the testimony from deborah steelman a washington lawyer and 
formerly chief health adviser to the bush came as the senate labor 
and human resources opened hearings on the measure introduced by 
the panels chairman sen edward kennedy dmass and rep henry 
a waxman dcalif 
while steelman now has no formal ties with the bush 
administration she is widely regarded as an expert on health 
financing issues and the criticism she laid out of the 
kennedywaxman bill amounted to a blueprint of the strong 
opposition to the legislation that is likely to produce protracted 
debate 
this bill offers no proposals to counteract a dangerous trend 
over the last 15 years healthcare expenditures in the united 
states have risen at an average annual rate of 12 percent she 
said 
kennedy has acknowledged that his bill does not try to get at 
the larger issue of acrosstheboard health cost control but says 
that shouldnt be used as a reason to oppose it 
kennedy and other proponents maintain it would be unfair to wait 
until broadbased programs to control costs are developed before 
extending health care to the uninsured 
the massachusetts democrat has acknowledged that his bill 
probably would cost an additional 12 billion a year when fully 
phased in about 10 years but argues that costs should not stand in 
the way of a nation taking care of its ill and injured 
steelman however predicted there will be great fanfare over 
minor increases totaling less than 500 million nationwide and 
questioned where the support would come for such massive 
expenditures as envisioned by the kennedy bill 
we have not seen any domestic program increases of this since 
at either the state or federal level since the early 70s she 
said 
she said there are variety of ways to deal with the problem of 
the medically insured but argued that kennedys bill tries to do 
too much through a government program 
obviously the proper role of government and the first 
priority of a program for the uninsured must be to cover lowincome 
individuals through a carefully targeted improved and expanded 
medicaid program she said 
the bill was supported by a panel of four individuals who 
recounted their difficulties in paying medical bills on low 
salaries and by representatives of th american public welfare 
association the national association of public hospitals and the 
american diabetes association

native and civil rights groups demand 
the state police minister resign because of a manhunt for an 
aborigine suspect in which an innocent man was fatally shot and 
officers staged a fake arrest 
an aboriginal activist group even put up posters monday saying 
the new south wales police minister ted pickering should be shot 
the way police conducted their search for a john porter 
suspected of wounding two officers in sydney a week ago has 
angered the state ombudsman and political opposition as well as 
aboriginal and civil rights organizations 
aborigines already chafing at the slow pace of a government 
inquiry into more than 100 black deaths in police custody accused 
authorities of conducting a witch hunt in the search for porter 
aboriginal activists claim most of the deaths since 1980 have been 
due to police brutality 
police commissioner john avery urged the suspect to surrender to 
avert further bloodshed he said investigating officers were 
abundantly aware that every move they make will come under 
microscopic scrutiny 
i dont want the suspect to feel too harried or pursued or 
hes going to react violently and that means more lives will be 
lost avery said what we want is to resolve this peacefully 
without any more people being killed 
porters family said he should not surrender 
jenny davies 28 commonlaw wife of the suspects brother 
said if he showed his face police would shoot him dead they 
wouldnt give him a chance they would shoot him on sight for sure 
one innocent man has already been shot dead by police over this 
police say porter emptied an automatic pistol at two policemen 
who thought he was trying to steal a car in sydney a week ago then 
eluded pursuit in the city and is being hunted on a national scale 
one of the policemen alan mcqueen 26 was in critical 
condition monday after surgeons removed a lung a kidney and part 
of his liver the other wounded man 19year jason donnelly was 
discharged after treatment for a stomach wound 
when the hunt began in earnest it was a bad week in sydney 
for colored men with dreadlock hair the morning herald said 
blacks with rastafarian hairstyles complained of police harassment 
officers rounded up dozens of people for questioning in one 
case stopping a car carrying three men from tonga one was found to 
be in australia illegally and was deported 
on thursday police stormed the home of david gundy and fatally 
shot the unarmed aborigine police initially said gundy who was in 
bed lunged at them and went for a gun but then contradicted the 
original statement 
richard mcdonald a neighbor said he overheard a detective 
saying i was sure it was him porter he was around the same 
size 
another neighbor brian walsh was awakened by the sound of 
police kicking in gundys door 
that same day police raided six houses in sydney and brisbane 
in queensland state they fired five stun grenades into the empty 
home of porters brother and faked an arrest that was filmed for 
the evening television news then told the media it was a hoax 
the gundy shooting brought calls for pickerings resignation and 
demands for a royal commission of inquiry the highest 
investigation available into police conduct 
on monday an aboriginal group calling itself the coalition 
against legalized murder or calm distributed posters in sydney 
that showed pickerings head framed in a gunsight and said someone 
should upgrade premier nick greiners government with a 
bullet 
pickering said he was considering legal action

syrian forces pounded the coast north of 
beirut on monday after a night of tank and mortar battles with 
christian army units outside the city despite a threeday truce 
druse warlord walid jumblatt demanded christians topple their 
gen michel aoun as a condition for peace and aoun charged the 
syriandruse alliance broke the ceasefire organized friday by the 
arab league 
police said two lebanese soldiers were killed and seven 
civilians wounded in overnight fighting around the christian 
garrison town of souk elgharb the first casualties since friday 
jumblatts spokesman announced in damascus syria that 
christian shells monday killed one of their militiamen and wounded 
two 
this brings the toll to 276 people killed and 1002 wounded 
since march 8 when fighting erupted 
rocketpropelled grenades and antiaircraft fire crackled monday 
across the abandoned commercial district straddling beiruts port 
this ominous escalation threatens plans by the arab league 
to dispatch a panarab observer force to lebanon to monitor the 
truce said a police spokesman who cannot be identified under 
regulations 
despite the fighting neither side appears to consider the truce 
irretrievable 
beirut radio stations said lakhdar ibrahimi the algerian envoy 
of arab league secretarygeneral chedli klibi was due in beirut 
within 24 hours to finalize deployment of the multinational arab 
observer force 
the police spokesman said at least 45 shells and rockets 
exploded on a 10mile strip of beach between byblos and jounieh 
ports paralyzing shipping activity 
an aoun spokesman said his units fired back in selfdefense 
in souk elgharb and beirut port but did not respond to shelling 
of the christian coastline 
souk elgharb sits atop a strategic network of mountain roads 
if it falls the moslems will be poised to flush out the christians 
from mountain strongholds protecting their 310squaremile enclave 
syrian army troops and the druse militia outnumber aouns mainly 
christian army by 31 
jumblatt issued a may day statement saying its impossible to 
reach a compromise with michel aoun he must be removed or 
toppled 
aoun who also heads the christian cabinet in lebanons dual 
government has refused to call off the blockade of three illegal 
harbors run by moslem militias which triggered the fighting 
although the arab league ceasefire plan provides for lifting 
air sea and land blockades aoun contends his gunboats and 
helicopter gunships are applying lebanese laws 
the rival moslem cabinet under acting prime minister salim hoss 
has insisted raising the blockade is an integral part of the arab 
leagues peace plan without it there will be no ceasefire 
aoun imposed the blockade in a bid to restore state authority 
and recoup lost annual taxes of 100 million 
the rival cabinets emerged in september after outgoing president 
amin gemayel and parliament was unable to elect a new leader 
the french navy tanker penhors returned to lebanese waters 
monday with 15000 tons of fuel from the european economic 
community to boost rationed electricty in beirut 
the rival cabinets said the tanker will unload 75 percent of the 
shipment in the christian port of zouk and the rest in the moslem 
oil terminal of zahrani 
christian radio stations later said the syrian bombardment 
prevented the penhors from approaching zouk 
police and the french embassy withheld comment but hoss who 
had pledged to the 12nation trade bloc that no shelling would 
occur when the penhors approached apologized 
i feel bound to extend my apology to the european community 
for being unable to honor my obligations due to surprise 
developments that caused a delay in the unloading operation he 
said in a statement

a food and drug administration advisory 
committee on monday recommended approval of an aerosolized version 
of a drug that helps prevent a lifethreatening pneumonia in aids 
patients 
the fda is expected to follow the recommendation and approve an 
aerosol version of pentamidine within weeks said an fda source who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity 
aerosolized pentamidine has been widely available to aids 
patients since the fda in february allowed its distribution to be 
expanded as an experimental medication under government review 
however many insurance plans do not cover experimental drugs 
fda approval would allow nearly universal reimbursement for aids 
patients using the drug 
the advisory committee recommended approval of aerosolized 
pentamidine for preventing initial and recurring bouts of 
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia which causes an estimated 60 
percent of aids deaths 
pentamidine was approved five years ago for use as an injectable 
drug to treat those already suffering from pneumocycstis the spray 
version would make it easier to take into the lungs where the 
pneumonia infection first shows up 
the fda estimated that 50000 patients with aids could benefit 
from the treatment 
the recommendation was based largely on data collected from a 
recent clinical trial conducted by the san francisco community 
consortium a group of physicians who treat aids patients 
the trial which compared the safety of different doses of 
aerosolized pentamidine found that the drug did not provide 
complete protection but did significantly reduce the incidence of 
this pneumonia the fda said 
lyphomed inc of rosemont ill the leading supplier of 
injectable pentamidine is asking to be licensed to supply the 
aerosol version

prisoners rampaged through two cell 
wings of a jail monday and dozens conducted a rooftop protest of 
living conditions prison officers reported 
the risley remand center designed to hold just over 500 men in 
single cells now accommodates 600 men and 140 women awaiting 
trial it is near warrington 10 miles east of liverpool on the 
northwest coast 
trouble began sunday night when 17 prisoners tried to overpower 
guards who were unlocking cells in b wing for an exercise period 
authorities said 
scores of men wrecked furniture and water pipes a similar 
incident began in d wing monday when it was announced that visits 
would be canceled because of the violence officials said 
they said b wing was under control monday night but up to 40 
inmates remained on the roof of d wing several who hurled objects 
from the roof at prison officers wore hoods to hide their faces 
three cell areas were wrecked and both wings were flooded by 
water from the broken pipes said graham harrison chairman of the 
risley branch of the prison officers association 
four guards suffered minor injuries to fingers or ribs but no 
prisoners were injured he said 
two guards locked themselves in a secondfloor cell when the 
prisoners broke out their colleagues said rioters tried to enter 
the cell to get at the men but other officers rescued them by 
breaking through an outside wall with sledgehammers they said 
banners on the roof repeated common complaints about conditions 
in the jail 
a report last year by the inspector of prisons described 
conditions at risley as squalid and barbarous the 
investigation was conducted after seven suicides were reported at 
the jail in 18 months 
several prisoner protests including rooftop demonstrations 
have occurred since 
harrison said 250 inmates were moved from risley to nearby jails 
monday because their cells were smashed 
most of those who have been moved out have not been involved 
in the trouble but we had to move them because they had nowhere to 
sleep he said

secretary of state james a baker iii called 
monday on panamas defense forces to ensure next sundays elections 
are fair by blocking what he said are gen manuel antonio noriegas 
efforts to rig the balloting through massive fraud 
baker issued the unusual appeal in a state department speech but 
left unclear the precise steps he believes the defense forces 
should take in defiance of their commander 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said later that baker feels all 
institutions in panama including the defense forces should do 
what is necessary to promote an honest outcome next sunday 
speaking to the council of the americas a business group baker 
said the military forces are the key to a free election 
they can fulfill their constitutional duty as professional 
soldiers and allow the elections to proceed freely and fairly or 
they can face the consequences of the path on which gen noriega 
has placed them baker said 
asked for elaboration ms tutwiler said baker was merely 
pointing out that all of the people and institutions in panama 
including the defense forces are paying a price because of the 
isolation and economic crisis resulting from noriegas rule 
meanwhile four us senators two from each party wound up a 
visit to panama and predicted that we are about to see a totally 
fraudulent election 
in a statement they said they had learned noriegas government 
will be the only organization permitted to count the votes that 
the panamanian defense force which he commands will be responsible 
for safeguarding the ballots that no exit polling will be 
permitted and that following the government tally all ballots will 
be burned 
in a letter the senators urged the organization of american 
states to demand that noriega permit the election to be free 
fair and open and said they were concerned that the continuation 
of undemocratic government in panama would also likely result in 
a situation dangerous for hemispheric peace 
signing the letter were sens john mccain rariz connie mack 
rfla bob graham dfla and chuck robb dva 
bakers comments were part of a steppedup administration effort 
to call attention to what officials believe is an effort by noriega 
to stay in power through manipulation of voter lists and other 
devices 
the administration hopes to weaken noriega as much as possible 
by discrediting the election process in advance 
the principal contest sunday matches carlos duque a noriega 
ally who is the presidential nominee of a coalition of 
progovernment parties against an opposition slate headed by 
guillermo david endara 
free elections could usher in a new era for financially strapped 
panama baker said but he contended noriega is preparing for a 
massive fraud and to restrict the presence of international 
observers and press 
baker reaffirmed the longstanding us position that there will 
be no accommodation with a noriegadominated government with the 
help of the defense forces he said there is still time for the 
panamanians to save their country from the increasing destruction 
wrought by the noriega dictatorship 
bakers remarks followed by three days panamanian charges in the 
un security council that the united states has interfered in the 
election by supplying millions of dollars to opposition candidates 
and by sending commandos special weapons and helicopters to panama 
baker also warned the soviet union not to become ideologically 
or militarily involved in central america 
together with the other democracies we must send a clear 
message to others outside this hemisphere this is not a dumping 
ground for their arms or their failed ideologies 
he said the soviet union now has an opportunity to demonstrate 
its socalled new thinking and to demonstrate it in central 
america

a paper lunch tray might cost 5 cents more 
than a plastic model that harms the environment but students who 
rid their schools of plastic trays said monday it was worth a 
nickel to help save the earth 
several west milford nj students told of their successful 
antiplastics battle at un headquarters they appeared before 
hundreds of students at a daylong forum sponsored by the un 
environment program 
our battle cry was put your money where your mouth is 
said 15yearold tanja vogt who launched the campaign 
a majority of the students at west milford high school and 
macopin middle school agreed with her and paid an extra nickel for 
their cafeteria lunches to be served on cardboard trays 
the campaign against polystyrene products began when the 
teenager inspired by thomas paines revolutionary pamphlet 
common sense wrote a civics paper calling for their ban 
environmentalists say the products unlike paper take many years 
to break down 
in october i read an article in our local paper that stated 
despite threats to all life the school board continues to use 
polystyrene trays in the school cafeteria she said 
the reason given was pure economics paper trays cost 5 cents 
more than polystyrene 
i was disgusted i knew the environment was worth an extra 
nickel and i was very confident that my peers would agree she 
said 
for one week last autumn the schools gave the students a 
choice pay 120 for lunch on plastic or 125 for a meal on a 
paper tray 
seventytwo percent of the high school students and 86 percent 
of the middle school students paid the extra nickel for paper trays 
the board of education voted in december to stop purchasing 
polystyrene for the townships schools effective feb 1 
the students have launched a letterwriting campaign to persuade 
every school in new jersey to abolish the use of foam plastics 
kurtiz schneid 16 said the success of the antiplastics 
campaign led to formation of a west milford ecology club and to new 
initiatives 
i personally visited our local mcdonalds dressed as ronald 
mctoxic to emphasize our opposition to foam packaging he said

a leading soviet dissident dismissing 
moscows reform campaign as a onesided attempt to save a failed 
system predicted on monday that president mikhail s gorbachevs 
policies will lead to a terrible clash bloodshed of huge 
proportions 
but turmoil inside the soviet union could lead moscow to release 
its grip on such eastern european nations as poland and hungary 
vladimir bukovsky told a forum of democratic leaders from around 
the world 
bukovsky who was jailed and sentenced to internal exile in the 
soviet union then released in 1976 after an international campaign 
on his behalf now heads the center for democracy in the ussr a 
new yorkbased human rights group 
he spoke before the annual conference of the national endowment 
for democracy which brought to washington advocates of democracy 
from eastern europe africa asia and latin america to present 
report cards on what many of the speakers called a universal 
democratic revolution 
the endowment is a usfinanced privatesector attempt to 
foster democracy as an alternative to totalitarian and 
authoritarian regimes 
speaking at the forum in the meeting room of the house foreign 
affairs committee bukovsky contended that in spite of the 
widespread impression that genuine reform is taking place in the 
soviet union the politburo has not moved toward democracy 
perestroika is no attempt to establish a free market 
economy bukovsky said glasnost does not mean the same as 
freedom of speech 
this is an attempt to square a circle to find a form of 
socialism that can survive he said but you cannot square a 
circle 
bukovsky predicted a terrible clash in the soviet union 
between the people and the government bloodshed of huge 
proportions 
he said the process has already started with the bloody 
suppression of demonstrations in soviet georgia and the arrest of 
nationalists in soviet armenia 
citing what he said are other signs of a crackdown bukovsky 
added the good news is that when there is turmoil in the soviet 
system some countries like hungary and poland may have a chance to 
get out 
he said the west is confused about gorbachev and his aims and 
mistakenly wants to help him with economic credits 
instead he said the west should be supporting the democratic 
opposition inside the soviet union because the more cohesive and 
organized the opposition is the less likely the government is to 
repress it 
but rep tom lantos dcalif said it is clear to him there is 
a new element in the soviet leadership which is prepared to 
make major compromises 
weve got to deal with them lantos said we are trying to 
urge them to establish a social compact with all elements of their 
own society 
but bukovsky replied the west is doing nothing to help the 
soviet unions democratic forces 
he asserted that billions of dollars of economic credits mostly 
from west germany are flowing into the kremlins coffers 
this will prop up the soviet regime and help them not to 
reform he said 
he suggested that the west allocate 10 percent of any credits 
given to the soviet union to democratic forces there

a motorist suspected of drunken driving has no 
constitutional right to an attorney before deciding whether to take 
a breath test the state supreme court ruled monday 
in a decision overturning a worcester county judge the high 
court said it could find nothing in the federal or state 
constitutions compelling the conclusion that a defendant has the 
right to counsel before deciding whether to submit to a 
breathalyzer test 
in a unanimous opinion the high court said the moment at 
which a person must decide to take or to refuse to take a 
breathalyzer test is not a critical stage in the criminal process 
refusal to take the test results in suspension of a drivers 
license for 120 days 
the decision stemmed from an appeal by the worcester county 
district attorneys office in central massachusetts in a case 
involving roy d brazelton a worcesterarea resident arrested in 
1987 for operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol 
brazelton was taken to the worcester police station and booked 
and was advised of his miranda rights and his right to take a 
breath test or blood alcohol test 
when an officer told brazelton he couldnt call his attorney 
until after he had decided whether to take the breath test 
brazelton refused the examination 
district judge thomas f sullivan jr dismissed the charges 
against brazelton on grounds that he should have been allowed to 
call his attorney first saying it would not have caused an 
unreasonable delay in the administration of the test 
but the high court in voiding sullivans order and remanding 
brazeltons case to trial said formidable practical problems 
could arise if the lower courts ruling stood for instance the 
justices said if an attorney is not available a delay may ensue 
and the test results may then be stale and inaccurate 
brazeltons attorney herbert f travers iii said that because 
courts in other states have been divided on the question at 
least on 14th amendment due process grounds it may be a proper 
issue for determination by the us supreme court 
it was the first time the high court had been asked to decide on 
the right to counsel before a breath test 
some courts in other states such as alaska have found the 
right to counsel on breath tests in their state laws state 
constitutions or the us constitution

including a woman who didnt want any publicity because she feared 
the reaction in her druginfested neighborhood 
all three are women from philadelphia blanche downing 55 
betty rubin a housewife and angeline pavloski a 69yearold 
retired waitress who plans to split her prize with her brother 
george delorenzo 
ms downing told lottery officials her neighborhood has lots 
of cocaine activity and she fears for her safety now that she has 
apparently won a pennsylvania super 7 lottery prize worth 83 
million to be distributed over the next 26 years 
she was accompanied by a former philadelphia policeman and two 
other friends they quickly walked out of lottery headquarters 
after filing the claim trying to duck photographers and climbed 
into a car she declined to answer reporters questions 
lottery spokeswoman terry murphy said the lottery suggested ms 
downing not return to her neighborhood 
we realize the position shes in ms murphy said 
in order to claim her winnings ms downing had to agree to 
allow her name to be used 
if tickets held by her and the other claimaints prove to be 
winners the first checks will be issued next week ms murphy 
said the ticket validation process which started monday for all 
11 of 14 winning tickets presented so far will be completed 
sometime this week the spokeswoman said each annual payment will 
be 31752467 before taxes

maryland who said she had the winning numbers but wouldnt file a 
claim until later in the week winners have a year from the date of 
the drawing to file a claim 
asked why she waited until monday to file her claim mrs rubin 
said we just had other things to do 
neither mrs rubin who refused to give her age nor mrs 
pavloski said they had any plans for the money 
mrs pavloski was sick last week and didnt check her tickets 
until friday three days after the winning numbers were drawn 
she said she has played the lottery since its introduction in 
1972 
i always said to myself one of these days im going to hit 
real good and i never knew i was going to hit this big mrs 
pavloski said

thousands of expatriate senegalese and 
mauritanians flew to their homelands monday in an airlift aimed at 
ending a wave of violence that has left hundreds dead 
about 55 mauritanians were reported killed friday and saturday 
in dakar and the provinces by angry senegalese seeking revenge for 
the deaths of hundreds of their countrymen in neighboring 
mauritania earlier last week 
unconfirmed reports said as many as 400 senegalese were killed 
april 2425 in nouakchott mauritanias capital in a wave of 
violence that began over a land dispute nouakchott is 375 miles 
north of dakar 
states of emergency and curfews were in effect in both west 
african nations capitals but vandalism continued in dakar the 
french news agency agence francepresse reported bands of pillagers 
attacked the shops of some lebanese merchants after all 
mauritanianowned shops were burned or vacated 
officials said the airlift which started in full sunday had 
carried about 8720 senegalese home from neighboring mauritania by 
midday monday and about 5785 mauritanians back home from senegal 
france spain and morocco were assisting in the airlift planes 
were making an average of four round trips per day airport 
officials said 
among the senegalese brought back from mauritania some had 
their sex organs or limbs mutilated and most of the corpses 
brought home had been decapitated reporters said 
senegalese officials began a program to integrate the returning 
citizens and provide measures to fill the vacuum created by the 
departure of the mauritanians who ran 80 percent of the small 
businesses in this country 
absolute priority is being accorded to the distribution of 
basic foodstuffs in dakar as well as the provinces the commerce 
ministry said in a statement 
the violence was prompted by the killing of two senegalese april 
9 in a border village in a dispute over grazing rights between 
mauritanian shepherds and senegalese peasants 
mauritania straddles arab north and black west africa 
twothirds of its 2 million people are moors of arabberber 
extraction the rest are black mostly from the southern river 
region nearly all of senegals 7 million people are black 
the dispute concerns the right of senegalese to farm on a 
senegal river island after both countries became independent from 
france in 1960 the black toucouleur people of senegal continued to 
farm the mauritanian side they had considered their own for 
generations 
moors to the north traditionally nomadic herders did not farm 
but the recent completion of two dams on the river has opened up 
new farmland spurred mauritanian interest in agriculture and 
prompted them to force senegalese off the land

consumer products that release chemicals into 
the air which rip up the earths protective ozone layer would 
be regulated and those with nonessential uses would be phased out 
under legislation introduced monday by sen al gore dtenn 
gores bill is aimed at products ranging from leaking automobile 
air conditioners to noise horns to some types of fire extinguishers 
gore also introduced separate legislation to phase out within 
five years the most dangerous ozonedestroying chemicals and to 
impose a manufacturers tax on them 
an ozone layer conservation trust fund would be established to 
find alternatives to such chemicals as chloroflurocarbons and halon 
which have been shown to deplete the ozone layer of the 
stratosphere 
we know that these chemicals are ripping up the earths 
protective ozone layer and contributing to the greenhouse effect 
gore said in a statement 
we know that if we immediately stopped all use the problems 
theyve already created would linger on for decades he said 
hesitation simply cannot be tolerated we must move as quickly as 
possible to stop the destruction 
he said that simple common sense solutions are available 
now for application every day 
for example changing the way we service automobile air 
conditioners labeling and eventually stopping the production of 
nonessential consumer products such as noise horns or party 
streamers or certain cleaning fluids gore said 
he said us legislation can serve as a catalyst for efforts to 
eliminate the threat to the ozone layer by nations around the world 
my purpose is to sound an alarm loudly and clearly of 
imminent and grave danger and to describe a strategy for 
confronting this crisis with changes in our collective behavior and 
thinking which if made can forestall and prevent the horrendous 
prospect of an ecological collapse he said

comedian joe piscopo suffered a legal 
defeat monday when a state appeals court upheld most of a divorce 
judgment in which his exwife received about 500000 in joint 
assets and custody of their only child 
the threejudge panel also ruled it was not unreasonable to 
require piscopo to pay 40000 a year in child support and 
rejected his argument that his exwife should not have been allowed 
to move to florida with his son 
the movie actor and former saturday night live regulars 
exwife nancy piscopo hayes has remarried since the 1988 divorce 
decree their son is 10 years old 
the appeals court also upheld an award to mrs hayes of 50000 
which was half the value placed on piscopos celebrity status 
were disappointed that the appellate division did not reverse 
the trial court especially on the issue of joes son being removed 
to florida said piscopos attorney francis donahue 
donahue said he would discuss with piscopo whether to take the 
case to the state supreme court piscopo a former resident of 
alpine now lives in snedens landing ny 
mrs hayes attorney charles abut said his client was very 
pleased and hopes that with this ruling the litigation can be put 
to a rest and the child whos the most important asset of this 
marriage can be allowed to develop normally outside the court 
system 
abut also defended the 40000ayear childsupport judgment 
the testimony was that mr piscopo in the last year before the 
trial was making 700000 to 800000 so a child support award of 
40000 is very reasonable he said 
the appellate court relied largely on established matrimonial 
law in ruling that the couples assets should be evenly divided and 
that mrs hayes should receive about 500000 in property and money 
the court noted she had largely supported the couple while 
piscopo finished college and started his comedy career 
during the first decade of the marriage until he landed the 
saturday night live role in 1980 she also assisted his career 
by typing his scripts and helping him learn his lines 
the court rejected arguments that the mothers move to florida 
was detrimental to the child 
the court cited trial testimony that indicated there is a great 
deal of animosity by piscopo toward his exwife and that he had 
expressed such views in front of the child 
the court also noted piscopos arguments that the child and 
their relationship will suffer from being far away from his father 
the court ruled there is no evidence the child will suffer from 
the move and that piscopo has ample personal resources to keep up a 
weekly visitation schedule it noted that in january alone piscopo 
traveled to seven cities in four states to make appearances 
the court also agreed with the superior court judges ruling 
that the florida living arrangements add some structure to the 
comedians visits with his son 
the trial judge found and piscopo admitted that he 
frequently went to joeys school unannounced and took joey out of 
school that he frequently made the child choose which parent 
should take him from school and that he asked the child hundreds 
of times if he wanted to go to florida the court ruled

police investigated a report monday that a 
masked gunman abducted a baby girl from a couple who made the same 
complaint three years ago about another daughter who was found dead 
yards from their house 
on saturday robert and paula sims reported their 6weekold 
daughter heather missing from her bassinet after a masked gunman 
knocked mrs sims unconscious police said 
the report was identical to one filed in 1986 in nearby brighton 
when the sims 13dayold daughter loralei turned up missing her 
body was found five days later about 150 feet from the sims house 
no arrest was made although the parents were considered supsects 
what are the chances of somebody breaking into your house and 
taking your small infant child once in your life said police 
sgt billy lawrence you figure out the odds and then figure out 
the odds that it could happen a second time in a completely 
different city but im not trying to say anything 
the sims have an unlisted telephone number and could not 
immediately be reached madison county states attorney bill haine 
also did not immediately return telephone calls 
on monday police in this mississippi river city across from st 
louis said they were still treating heathers disappearance as a 
reported kidnapping 
we are doing everything we can possibly do but we have no 
idea where the child is said police sgt bud pyatt 
we were told mrs sims was approached by a male outside the 
home forced back inside the house and knocked unconscious said 
pyatt but we have no information other than what was obtained 
yesterday 
sgt rick mccain of the alton police said there was no 
physical evidence that mrs sims had been struck 
there is nothing that disproves their allegations said 
mccain but we are not discounting the information from the other 
case 
the reported timing of the abductions was nearly identical in 
1986 mrs sims said she was knocked out about 1020 pm on 
saturday she told police the assailant struck at 1030 pm as she 
took out the trash 
police said a 15monthold son was sleeping in the house at the 
time mrs sims said heather was abducted but the boy was not 
disturbed no valuables were reported missing 
mrs sims told police her husband arrived home saturday night 
about an hour after she was knocked out and revived her 
police searched around the sims home on sunday and pyatt said 
investigators might broaden the search 
sims brotherinlaw herb condray of cottage hills said 
police had advised the couple to make no public statement about the 
case they told the parents to let the police handle it and 
thats what theyre doing he said 
the family lived in brighton about 10 miles north of alton in 
1986 when mrs sims then 27 reported a masked gunman entered her 
home ordered her to lie down and took loralei from her bassinet 
in each case sims was at work at the time his daughters 
disappeared sims works at laclede steel co in alton 
jersey county sheriff frank yocom said sims and his wife were 
suspects in loraleis death but the couple declined to testify 
before a grand jury investigation citing their constitutional 
right for protection against selfincrimination and the panel took 
no action yocom said 
loraleis disappearance touched off an intensive search 
leaflets with the infants picture were distributed and the parents 
pleaded for help finding their daughter when her body was found 
five days later it was so decomposed a cause of death could not be 
determined 
sims and his wife insisted in 1986 they had nothing to do with 
loraleis disappearance and death 
the couple moved to the twostory frame home in alton about two 
years ago sims then 34 installed a tall chainlink fence around 
the front yard shortly after moving to alton neighbors said

state inspectors resumed investigations of 
accidents and safety complaints at businesses on monday nearly two 
years after gov george deukmejian virtually dismantled their 
agency 
all 21 district offices around the state opened for business 
today said richard stephens said spokesman for the state 
industrial relations department that oversees the california 
occupational safety and health administration or calosha 
the agency is being restored under terms of a statewide ballot 
measure last november that reversed the republican governors 
decision 
in july 1987 deukmejian cut most of the funding for the 7 
million staterun program as a costsaving measure his action 
turned over to the federal government the responsibility for 
monitoring job safety in the private sector where 105 million 
californians work 
all that remained of calosha was an inspection program for 
californias 17 million state and local government workers 
but a coalition of labor environmental business medical and 
education groups spearheaded proposition 97 to restore calosha 
saying the federal occupational safety and health administration 
provided workers with far fewer protections than the state agency 
voters passed the initiative by a margin of 54 percent to 46 
percent 
under a federalstate agreement announced last month inspectors 
for both agencies will police worker safety in california for the 
next five months as the state department of industrial relations 
brings calosha back to life 
as the state program returns to full strength the federal 
presence will be phased out so the state can assume full control on 
oct 1 
theyll have some growing pains but we anticipate calosha 
will be back on stream very rapidly said richard munn of the 
associated general contractors of california which pushed for 
restoring calosha 
about 140 state inspectors were on the job monday with the 
number scheduled to climb gradually to 214 stephens said state 
inspectors will respond to all complaints of unsafe working 
conditions in the private sector 
during the transition the federal osha will continue to conduct 
regularly scheduled inspections in selected industries 
frank strasheim regional chief for federal osha said his staff 
will retain jurisdiction over complaints received before may 1 
federal inspectors will retain responsibility for the safety of 
people who work at federal installations or aboard ships in federal 
waters

a white wolf that ran wild in an affluent 
residential area and ate a pet rabbit belongs to sam j jones who 
played comic book hero flash gordon in a 1980 movie animal 
regulation officials said monday 
we believe he purchased it as a pup from a breeder so it was 
raised in a sort of domestic environment but still you cant have 
them said lt marshall vernon of the citys west valley animal 
shelter 
the 100pound wolf a fullgrown female named hurricane was 
captured april 14 near the encino reservoir in the san fernando 
valley 
residents of the hillside neighborhood had complained that a 
huge white dog had been roaming the area for about two months and 
gobbled down a rabbit 
vernon said the predator is probably an endangered gray wolf 
which lives in the wild in alaska and minnesota 
it is illegal to keep wolves within city limits without a 
permit the misdemeanor offense is punishable by a fine of up to 
500 and six months in jail but there were no immediate plans to 
prosecute jones vernon said 
in addition to flash gordon jones appeared in 10 in 
1979 my chauffeur in 1986 and in the tv series hardcastle 
and mccormick and hunter 
jones personal manager stan kamens said he had no knowledge 
of the matter and would have no comment 
hurricane apparently lived on the run by hunting wild rabbits 
ground squirrels opossums and quail in the uninhabited brush 
around the reservoir which abuts the santa monica mountains 
a bait trap cage was set for hurricane who was described as 
very shy and withdrawn by thomas r walsh animal regulation 
district supervisor 
we want to give the wolf to some type of a sanctuary that can 
handle that type of animal we just dont want to send it 
anywhere he said shes not going back to the owner

secretary of state james a baker iii 
threatened monday to withhold us financial contributions to the 
world health organization if it votes to admit the palestine 
liberation organization 
he feels very strongly about this said margaret tutwiler 
the state department spokeswoman in announcing bakers position 
she said if threat of a cutoff did not deter the 166member who 
from admitting the plo at a meeting next week in geneva the united 
states would consider other unspecified steps 
the head of the un agency was expected at the state department 
on tuesday to plead for continued us financial support dr 
hiroshi nakajima a japanese physician said in geneva on saturday 
he had tried to persuade plo chairman yasser arafat to withdraw the 
application 
gordon brown the us deputy ambassador to tunisia informed 
hakim ballaoui of the plo of the decision at a meeting monday in 
carthage that focused on who membership asked if the dispute would 
curtail the dialogue the united states began with the plo in 
december the us official said there is no hint of that 
the talks were based on a us judgment that arafat had 
renounced terrorism and had accepted israels right to exist the 
statement read by ms tutwiler in behalf of baker made no reference 
to terrorism 
the united states vigorously opposes the admission of the plo 
to membership in the world health organization or any other un 
agency it said we have worked and will continue to work to 
convince others of the harm that the plos admission would cause to 
the middle east peace process and to the un system 
it added political questions such as this should not be 
raised in specialized agencies because such politicization detracts 
from the important technical work of these organizations 
to emphasize the depth of our concern i will recommend to the 
president that the united states make no further contributions 
voluntary or assessed to any international organization which 
makes any change in the plos present status as an observer 
organization 
the united states bears about 25 percent of the burden of world 
health organization expenses this amounted to about 150 million 
in the last two years 
more than 50 senators have signed a letter to baker saying they 
favored cutting off funds to the who or any other un agency that 
admitted arafats organization which is recognized by all 21 arab 
governments as the sole legitimate representative of the 
palestinian people 
last year the plo declared statehood on land held by israel 
president bush last month said he was opposed to an independent 
palestinian state 
we do not recognize them as a state nor do we believe they 
meet the criteria of being a state ms tutwiler said 
the us official acknowledged it is a very tough decision 
to threaten a cutoff of financial support to the world health group 
seymour d reich chairman of the conference of presidents of 
major american jewish organizations said he was gratified by 
bakers statement which underscores the seriousness with which 
our country views this issue 
reich said the plo was trying to gain backdoor admission to 
the united nations itself should the plo succeed he said a 
dangerous precedent will be set 
but clovis maksoud director of the league of arab states said 
if the us does carry through with its threat it would be 
making perhaps unwittingly the peace process hostage to the 
most intransigent of israeli policies admitting palestine to who 
contributes in our opinion to its universality and therefore 
effectiveness

exxon officials monday released a revised 
plan for cleansing 364 miles of alaskan coastline fouled by the 
nations largest oil spill but said their proposal requires a 
suspension of local environmental laws 
the plan makes no provisions for continuing the cleanup beyond 
midseptember and notes that 191 miles of lightly oiled coastline 
may not be cleaned mechanically at all but be allowed to be washed 
naturally by the environment 
it is expected that this will be the case for all lightly 
oiled gulf of alaska sites said the twopart 60page report 
we are going to have to take a hard look at that responded 
bill lamoreaux the ranking state environmental official monitoring 
the cleanup 
since march 24 when an exxon tanker struck a reef outside 
valdez and poured more than 10 million gallons of north slope crude 
into prince william sound exxon has financed cleanup crews 
fighting the spreading sludge signs of the spill have been sighted 
about 500 miles southwest of valdez 
the oil companys strategy which was submitted to state and 
federal authorities only hours before a deadline expired divides 
alaskas oiltainted shores into four categories from the most 
heavily polluted to those that are only lightly oiled 
it covers polluted areas within prince william sound as well as 
those outside the immediate spill zone and calls for nearly 3400 
workers to participate in the cleanup 
the worst areas three miles of sludgecovered beaches on 
several small islands would be targeted immediately with the 
others scheduled for gradual cleansing through sept 15 
exxons plan calls for the recovered waste to be strained for 
usable oil that can be refined and said the oillaced wastewater 
could be treated at the alyeska pipeline service cos disposal 
plant in valdez 
the gunk and sludge that resists treatment or salvage will be 
burned or buried according to the exxon study both methods likely 
will require exemptions from local environmental laws 
coast guard adm paul a yost jr the ranking federal official 
tracking the cleanup told reporters in sacramento calif that he 
would decide whether to approve the proposal within a week 
before the plan was released yost said he wanted much more 
detail than exxons original cleanup plan which included nothing 
on polluted areas outside the sound 
yost is scheduled to arrive in valdez on tuesday to review the 
latest plan 
meanwhile tar and sludge from the valdez spill fouled the 
beaches of alaskas wild katmai national park drenching hundreds 
of sea otters and birds and threatening the huge brown bears 
prowling the refuge 
the damage stretches along 260 miles of rocky rugged coastline 
southwestward from cape douglas some 500 miles from valdez park 
superintendent ray bane said monday 
the oil has made landfall in large quantities in katmai bay 
and hallo bay there is a heavy impact we have seen several 
hundred sea otters swimming in oil the oil has had an impact on 
virtually the entire coastline of the park bane said 
the 4 millionacre park also is a haven for brown bears a 
coastal cousin of the grizzly a number of bears have been seen 
walking in the vicinity of the beaches we have one verified 
sighting of a bear walking through the oil bane said 
bane said an aerial survey showed an amorphous oil patch 10 
miles wide and more than 20 miles long in the shelikof strait 
which is located along the migration route used by whales 
exxon is feeling the effects of the spill far beyond alaska 
waters several groups throughout the country have called for a 
boycott tuesday of exxon products 
in anchorage a group called the boycott exxon alliance has 
scheduled a rally in front of exxons alaska headquarters 
the attorneys general of idaho oregon and washington state 
scheduled a news conference tuesday to call for a federal 
investigation into the sharp rise in the price of gasoline since 
the spill 
the oil industry blames the spill and crude oil prices that have 
risen 7 a barrel since january for higher prices at the gas pumps 
exxon also received sharp criticism from the federal government 
which accused the company of footdragging in the construction 
of a second facility in seward to aid in the cleanup of sea otters 
fouled by the oil the animals depend on their thick fur for 
insulation against the cold water but the oil ruins the insulation 
effect 
exxon says the center will open wednesday

former french premier jacques chirac 
took a sentimental journey through this college town monday on the 
first day of a nineday crosscountry trip 
chirac who recently began his third term as mayor of paris 
planned the trip as a way of staying in touch with the major 
players in the united states spokesman pierre lellouche said 
chirac plans to meet with president bush he is scheduled to 
meet this week in new york with former secretary of state henry 
kissinger and un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar before 
traveling to los angeles where he plans to visit former president 
reagan and dine with such actors as gregory peck and jane fonda 
i prefer the east coast and my daughter likes the west coast 
so were doing both said chirac his daughter claude 25 was 
among a dozen french advisers and journalists along for the trip 
chirac attended a luncheon at the john f kennedy school of 
government at harvard university before wandering awhile along the 
cambridge streets he first haunted in 1952 as a summer student at 
harvards business school 
chirac 56 smiled as familiar sights jogged his memory he 
recalled the giddiness of his first visit to the united states and 
the american woman he fell in love with while working as a soda 
jerk at the old howard johnsons in harvard square 
it was a wonderful time he said it pleases me to relive 
it 
more recently times have been tougher for chirac head of 
frances neogaullist party who lost his bid last year to unseat 
socialist president francois mitterand 
not only did the conservative candidate lose the may 1988 race 
his party also lost its majority coalition in the national 
assembly forcing him to resign as prime minister 
chirac had held the posts of prime minister and paris mayor 
simultaneously it is not uncommon for french officials to hold two 
important elected jobs 
lellouche said chirac has emerged from a postelection letdown 
during which he was relatively withdrawn 
this is a man who was defeated the spokesman said its a 
time of opposition and a time of learning 
later monday chirac spoke in french to an audience of about 150 
students faculty and members of the local french community at 
harvards center for european studies

vice president dan quayle repeated his 
support for cambodian resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk on 
monday but the vice president and his aides said a meeting between 
the two had brought no changes in us policy toward that country 
quayle spending a day here after touring australia met for 45 
minutes with sihanouk the vice president also talked about trade 
issues and human rights with indonesian president suharto 
but much of the days focus was on the meeting with sihanouk 
who is visiting indonesia along with the leaders of two other 
factions hopeful of running cambodia after the promised fall 
withdrawal of vietnamese occupation troops 
the fourth group vying for control in cambodia is the khmer 
rouge a chinesebacked organization that was responsible for 
killing as many as 15million cambodians from 1975 to 1979 quayle 
and other us officials have said they will not tolerate a 
cambodian government dominated by the khmer rouge 
meantime cambodias vietnameseinstalled government has changed 
the countrys name and flag and invited sihanouk to return home 
and help rule 
sihanouk welcomed the concessions and appeared ready to make a 
few of his own to end the 10year conflict it seems that we are 
at the end of the tunnel we are going to make progress on the way 
toward a settlement sihanouk said 
quayle has said that the united states is considering giving 
military aid to sihanouk and possibly the other noncommunist 
cambodian faction headed by son sann 
but quayle said such aid did not come up in his discussions with 
sihanouk 
asked if us military aid might be overt or covert quayle 
responded there was a mixed view on the subject mixed being 
some overt some covert 
what he and sihanouk did discuss quayle said was the process 
and moving the process forward and timetables and who the 
players are and what some of the expectations would be 
sihanouk supports an international conference on cambodia that 
could lead to an enforcement mechanism to monitor the withdrawal of 
the vietnamese and to cope with a transition government until 
elections are held 
the united states backs making sihanouk the interim leader until 
free elections can be held 
later at a news conference before leaving indonesia quayle 
said the united states remains totally opposed to giving the khmer 
roupe any controlling role in cambodia 
its a nonstarter from the very beginning he said we 
dont believe that khmer rouge offer anythingbut mass murder 
an aide to quayle speaking on condition he remain anonymous 
said that quayle will relay his information to bush and that it 
might be several months before the united states decides whether to 
alter its policy toward cambodia 
with suharto quayle took up human rights issues particularly 
allegations that indonesia has more than 400 political prisoners 
and has used repressive tactics in east timor a former portuguese 
colony annexed by indonesia in 1975 some 30 members of congress 
had urged quayle to take up the human rights issue 
in addition quayle met with three human rights activists 
including shamet bratanata 
with suharto quayle advocated that indonesia practice 
political development as well as economic development 
other issues that were brought up with officials of indonesia 
considered a strong us ally were trade and space 
on tuesday quayle heads for singapore and then on to thailand 
the last two overseas stops on his 12day trip

progovernment and opposition labor 
leaders at separate may day rallies demanded monday that the united 
states lift its trade embargo on nicaragua 
were asking that the united states lift the embargo because 
those who suffer are not the sandinista leaders but the workers 
and the people of nicaragua said alvin guthrie president of the 
opposition confederation for labor unification 
he spoke to about 4000 demonstrators opposing the leftist 
sandinista government who later marched for two hours through 
workingclass neighborhoods of managua under a sweltering midday 
sun 
earlier monday about 20000 progovernment demonstrators 
gathered at the plaza de la revolucion in managuas former downtown 
area destroyed by a 1972 earthquake 
lucio jimenez secretarygeneral of the sandinista workers 
union condemned the 4yearold us economic blockade and accused 
reactionary nicaraguan capitalists of impeding the countrys 
industries 
he praised the governments call to investors to help reactivate 
nicaraguas paralyzed economy warning them this was their chance 
for continuing to live or disappear 
victor tirado one of the nine members of the sandinista 
national directorate told the rally peace wont come to nicaragua 
until the united states stops supporting the nicaraguan rebels 
known as contras last month congress approved a 497 million 
package of nonlethal aid for the contras most of whom are living 
in jungle camps in neighboring honduras 
the united states cut off all financial aid to nicaragua in 1981 
after alleging the sandinista government was supporting leftist 
insurgents in el salvador in 1985 thenpresident reagan imposed a 
commercial embargo on this central american country saying 
nicaragua had established close military ties with cuba and the 
soviet union 
private buiness people say the embargo isnt halting the flow of 
usmade goods to nicaragua and only makes parts and equipment 
more expensive to acquire because they have to route the items 
through a third country 
economists say the governments 3monthold austerity program is 
showing results in slowing hyperinflation that topped 20000 
percent in 1988 but they say those same measures have created a 
recession that could prove fatal to the economy if allowed to 
continue into the planting season the season traditionally starts 
in midmay the beginning of the rainy season 
president daniel ortega is on a 10country european tour to ask 
for more financial aid for nicaragua sweden the main west 
european supporter of the 10yearold sandinista revolution has 
organized a stockholm conference may 1112 so ortega can present 
his case before potential donors

george f walker doesnt hesitate to confess his 
amusement and elation at his success in his chosen field of drama 
i just laughed out loud on the subway he said recalling a 
recent ride in his hometown of toronto im a playwright and i 
have children to support 
he laughed again 
the bearded 41yearold walker never has had as successful a 
year as the past one with nothing sacred a staple on the 
repertory theater circuit from los angeles mark taper forum to the 
hartford stage company in connecticut time magazine named it one 
of the 10 best plays of 1988 although it has yet to be performed 
in new york 
the play is his 18th yet walker recalled that when his first 
play was produced it was only the second play he had ever seen 
i was just attracted to the idea that you could fill it up any 
way you want he said to explain his attraction to the theater 
the jovial softspoken walker was in ottawa for the opening of 
nothing sacred in a production very similar to its toronto 
origin at canadas modern national arts center 
walker keeps the 19th century russian setting for his version of 
ivan turgenevs fathers and sons but insists that it now is 
very much a modern canadian work 
he first read the original when he was 17 and said he thinks he 
was in a bit of a trance when he wrote his version 
i never meant it to be an adaptation he said over lunch 
before opening night in ottawa i wrote it in 10 to 11 days 
walker wanted to bill the play as inspired by turgenev but 
then decided that would be hokey 
mostly i thought if i just let it come through me so the 
language would be without being forced for actors living now 
literature was the starting point for nothing sacred just as 
other inspirations have come from something read in the newspaper 
or a conversation with a friend 
im sure if ivan were alive hed be on my side walker said 
about criticism of his adaptation 
much of his earlier work was of a more eccentric tone in line 
with his development in the toronto alternative theater scene of 
the 70s the appeal of the theater he said is its access that 
the multimillion dollar budgets required for movies generally are 
not needed to create plays 
thinking back 12 or 15 years to his early career walker again 
laughed at the contrast to the days when the crowds were smaller 
and the theaters less established 
when youre used to seeing 200 or 300 people come in and then 
you see 800 or 900 he joked where are we going to put them 
all 
walkers toronto agent ralph zimmerman astutely pitched 
nothing sacred last year to american repertory theaters and 
theres been some sniping that the success has as much to do with 
the politics of regional theater as it does with the play 
time reviewing the los angeles production said he 
persuasively makes the debate among student anarchists in 1860s 
russia echo that among marxist collegians of 1960s america 
the new york times gave a decidedly mixed review to the 
production of nothing sacred at hartford stage saying walker 
assumed too much artistic license for a project that could have 
used a bit more reverence 
on the other hand walker believes its time for the dominant 
role of new york reviews to be reevaluated in light of the 
changing theater scene that is less concentrated on broadway 
the playwright also said many canadians gripe about the lack of 
knowledge in the united states about their country but he chalked 
that off to a result of americans selfpreoccupation 
they dont know canada is up here feeling insecure about its 
culture he said they americans are generous come in be 
one of us ive never felt you intruder its kind of positive 
in its own way 
some comment has been made that walker is an example of a 
classic canadian case of gaining legitimacy at home only after 
being discovered in the united states but he believes his steady 
career in toronto was quite established before productions started 
of his plays in us theaters 
i think the message canadians always had was that we didnt 
need to develop our own he said recalling the days when 
canadian theater was dominated by imports from broadway or london 
somewhere along the line you go hey wait i can do that too 
 
and for those canadians who didnt hear about him until 
nothing sacred appeared on times top 10 list walker said 
simply thats ok i read time

the story of four single women 
who look for the perfect prince but have to kiss a lot of frogs 
along the way is the latest hit comedy movie in west germany 
the movie also blasts others in west germanys young social 
scene from yuppies who marry only for tax breaks to farout 
leftist activists 
the movie beim naechsten mann wird alles anders with the 
next man everything will be different is based on a bestselling 
book of the same title by writer eva heller who has also published 
collections of satirical cartoons 
the film released in january was rated no 5 on the hit movie 
list published by the hamburgbased weekly magazine stern in its 
march 2 issue that made beim naechsten mann the secondhighest 
ranked west german movie on the list after herbstmilch the 
poignant tale of a young bavarian farm woman during the nazi era 
movies focusing on women are still unusual in west germany 
despite the success in recent years of woman directors such as 
doris doerrie whose 1985 film maenner men was an 
international hit 
the heroine of the movie is constanze wechselburger a film 
student who sees herself as intellectual political and prominent 
in the feminist movement even though she spends most of her time 
hunting for men 
the film opens with a chaotic battle between constanze and her 
boyfriend albert a young doctor whom she eventually dumps for 
allegedly being both bourgeois and cheap albert criticizes 
constanze for her wastefulness cutting open a discarded toothpaste 
tube with a scalpel to show there was enough toothpaste left for 
several more brushings 
constanze is quick to retaliate this is what i think of your 
cheap christmas present she yells flushing her own gift to 
albert an expensive watch down the toilet 
constanze confides her troubles to her girlfriends over numerous 
glasses of wine most frequently in a local bar called the cafe 
kaputt 
im looking for a relationship that is built on an 
intellectual basis not a material one she says she also 
insists on emotional freedom rejecting marriage as a bourgeois 
institution 
ironically she lands in the arms of a married man film 
instructor gottfried schachtschnabel a veteran of the 1960s 
student revolts sports a threeday beard and pretentious leftist 
political attitudes 
he too rejects the notion of marriage but doesnt bother 
getting divorced he forgets to inform his girlfriends about 
his status and defends himself when hes caught 
marx was married too and he had an affair with his 
housekeeper we can only learn from that he tells constanze 
theres also sieglinde a socialclimbing dental assistant whose 
yuppie boyfriend marries her for tax savings the oldfashioned 
birgit who looks for her dream man in the want ads and julia a 
psychologist who also falls prey to schachtschnabel 
its a film with which west germans can apparently both laugh 
and identify the characters may be cliches but everybody 
recognizes a few things that are true in real life aspects he can 
relate to angela marquis of the films berlinbased production 
company said in a recent interview 
although the film focuses on women and the title indicates 
disappointment with men it is not just a work for feminists she 
said 
the story is really about curiosity not disappointment 
marquis said both men and women are often bored with what they 
have and think another relationship would be better but as the 
film shows that isnt always the case 
by the end of the film constanze succumbs to bourgeois society 
and gets married after all she chooses albert deciding that 
thriftiness is not the worst vice in the world

manuel melgarejo is trying to cool the 
fever in a country where gambling is a major sport musical slot 
machines abound and nearly everyone takes a flyer on el gordo the 
fat christmas lottery 
his shoestring version of gamblers anonymous is called the 
madrid association of recovering gamblers the telephone has been 
ringing constantly since he mentioned the number on a radio program 
and told listeners with gambling problems to call 
in the four months since he says the membership has grown from 
nearly zero to more than 200 an estimated 50000 addicted gamblers 
live in and around the capital 
its hang up answer hang up answer said melgarejo a 
reformed gambler who blamed the addiction for ruining his first 
marriage 
he interrupted the interview at a temporary office in a madrid 
roman catholic church to talk with a middleaged woman who walked 
in off the street to confess an addiction to slot machines 
spain has 420000 habitual gamblers 3 percent of the adult 
population according to the national gambling commission they are 
caught in a tradition that goes back at least to 1763 when king 
carlos iii started the worlds longestrunning public lottery 
the difference between habitual gamblers and addicts is 
basically a semantic one said santiago mendioroz head of 
gambling commission 
spaniards placed 29 billion in bets last year according to the 
commission it regulates staterun lotteries and sports pools and 
casinos bingo halls and slot machines which were legalized in 
1977 after a 53year ban 
mendioroz said the governments take from lotteries pools and 
fees last year was more than 22 billion 
press reports say spain ranks second in the world in gambling 
expenditures per capita behind the united states and ahead of the 
philippines mendioroz says there are no reliable figures but 
because of the slot machines in bars and restaurants gambling is 
omnipresent 
slots which blare bits of music as reminders of their presence 
are found in 80 percent of the more than 200000 bars and cafes 
commission figures indicate mendioroz said spain has 310000 of 
the machines 
one sure sign of a gambling problem he said is that 8000 
people have asked his commission not to let them into casinos and 
bingo halls 
he described the number as surprisingly high considering the 
custom in this roman catholic country of hiding such failings 
gambling is considered a vice almost a sin and the person 
who has that problem is very reluctant to admit it he said 
melgarejo a 44yearold insurance agent devotes much of his 
time to unpaid missionary work with gamblers he says 18 years of 
gambling cost him his first wife 10 or 12 jobs and about 
217000 
last year he spent three months at the cordoba association of 
recovering gamblers and managed to conquer the habit his 
organization and the original selfhelp group in cordoba are the 
only two in spain but melgarejo said a national federation may 
result if enough others are formed 
he believes the spanish character encourages gambling 
its like don quixote he said the spaniard is a 
romantic he believes in fantasy in destiny he thinks he can 
solve a lifetimes worth of problems with one stroke of luck

with about 200 stations now programming in 
spanish to the tune of 176 million in advertising revenue last 
year us hispanic radio is booming 
but the sound wasnt always sweet as seen in the new film 
break of dawn 
the movie released in selected southwestern cities recreates 
the story of spanish radio pioneer pedro j gonzalez who was 
imprisoned after his onair protests of depressionera deportations 
of mexicans 
its a story about justice prevailing over injustice said 
producer jude pauline eberhard set in los angeles in the 1920s and 
30s the film tells how gonzalez was paroled after being sent to 
san quentin on trumped up rape charges following his advocacy 
broadcasts 
gonzalez parlayed his musical talents and eye for business into 
a popular spanishlanguage radio program but it ended when he was 
sent to prison on charges that were later recanted by the woman who 
had allegedly been raped 
mexican recording star oscar chavez plays gonzalez portraying 
him as he first translates radio commercials into spanish then 
sings with his guitar and finally pays a station for early 
morning airtime gonzalez and his wife sold advertising on the 
show making a profit on the difference 
called los madrugadores the early risers the los 
angelesbased program developed a strong following among hispanics 
with a mix of live music discussion of issues and commercials 
now 94 gonzalez lives with his wife maria in northern 
california and was a consultant for the film said isaac 
artenstein who wrote and directed the movie 
to insure realism artenstein used both spanish and english 
dialogue you cant have pedro talking and singing in english if 
you say he was the first radio broadcaster in spanish said 
artenstein 
but the bilingual approach can pose distribution problems 
eberhard said exhibitors are shying away from the film because they 
dont know whether to market it as an english or spanish movie 
its scary for the distributors because of the natural language 
flow she said 
though he changed some characters names artenstein said that 
all of the films main roles are based on real people including an 
activist mexican consul a district attorney who helps frame 
gonzalez and a teenage girl who falsely accuses gonzalez of 
raping her 
courtroom testimony in the film is taken from gonzalez trial 
transcripts unearthed by a law library archivist artenstein said 
los angeles spanishlanguage daily la opinion also had extensive 
coverage of gonzalez case but the englishlanguage media did not 
have one story 
break of dawn which was shot for 850000 also stars maria 
rojo as gonzalez wife others in the film include tony plana pepe 
serna peter henry schroeder kamala lopez valarie wildman and 
socorro valdez the film was independently produced by san 
diegobased cinewest productions 
los angeles is now the nations largest hispanic media market 
with 327 million spent on spanishlanguage radio advertising in 
1988 according to hispanic business magazine seven radio stations 
and two television stations now air spanish broadcasts full time in 
the city 
it is a far cry from the days when gonzalez and his wife had to 
pay stations in advance for predawn airtime

the book theyre throwing at jim wright is 
more than twice as long as the one that got the speaker of the 
house into trouble in the first place 
its a governmenttan paperback with the uninviting title 
report of the special outside counsel in the matter of james c 
wright jr and it runs 279 pages 
wrights lucrative reflections of a public man was 117 
pages a lightweight by comparison but a moneymaker it made wright 
5464225 in what the house ethics committee charges were actually 
disguised honorarium payments that violated house limits 
wright says he never considered the book purchases to be speech 
payments but the report recounts 11 cases in which the speaker up 
against house limits on honoraria made appearances before groups 
ranging from the fertilizer industry to cranberry growers who then 
bought books instead of paying speech fees 
his socalled royalty was 55 percent 325 a copy on a book 
that was priced at 595 according to the report some of the 
interests that paid for books didnt bother to take any 
the speaker would have been better off if hed quit the book 
business after one of his earlier works was published even though 
it didnt do nearly as well financially the title of that one 
congress and conscience 
richard j phelan of chicago outside counsel to the ethics 
committee put together the wright report accusing the speaker of 
116 violations of house rules the committee voted to charge wright 
with 69 of them shelving the other 47 the phelan report covers 
them all 
the accusations the committee voted to pursue center on the book 
deal and on gifts and benefits wright received from his friend and 
business associate george mallick a fort worth businessman 
but some of the most striking sections of the phelan report 
cover alleged violations the committee is not pressing involving 
wrights interventions with federal savings and loan regulators in 
behalf of texas interests among friends and political fundraisers 
that happened early in the savings and loan crisis that now 
carries a price tag estimate at 126 billion over the next decade 
wrights early involvement in 1986 delayed action that might have 
started the government dealing with the process 
republicans contend the cost of solving the sampl crisis would 
have been cut by half if the government had started closing down 
insolvent institutions and paying off insured depositors two years 
earlier but the federal savings and loan insurance corp didnt 
have the money to do it 
wright then majority leader delayed house action on a bill to 
provide it while he pressed with sampl regulators about their 
dealings with a texas sampl operator edwin gray chairman of the 
federal home loan bank board was said to figure that the only way 
to get the action on bill his agenda needed was to do what wright 
wanted so he changed supervisors at an sampl that was under board 
control 
the phelan report likened that to blackmail 
the sampl bill was stalled for a week it passed the house but 
didnt make it through the senate before congress adjourned 
legislation to replenish the insurance fund didnt become law until 
august 1987 
wright also intervened in behalf of thomas m gaubert ousted by 
federal regulators as chairman of an insolvent sampl and barred from 
getting back into the business under an agreement he had made with 
the bank board gaubert who was treasurer of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee said he had been unfairly 
pressured into accepting the agreement and wanted it rescinded 
wright called gray eventually the bank board chairman named a 
special counsel to review handling of the gaubert case even though 
he told the ethics committee he had no reason to doubt the original 
handling the bank board still didnt have its recapitalization 
bill we had to have passage of the legislation and i had 
jim wright making it clear that i was to talk to his friend his 
buddy gray said 
soon after that in november 1986 gray got another call from 
wright this one to complain more generally about the way sampls were 
being treated in texas in that call gray testified wright said 
that a top texas regulator for the bank board was a homosexual who 
had established a ring of homosexual lawyers in texas at various 
law firms and was forcing people to deal with the federal home 
loan bank of dallas through those lawyers 
gray said wright asked him to get rid of the man 
and i said no i was the one who recruited him i think very 
highly of him he is doing what i want him to do 
while phelan recommended that wright be charged with rules 
violations in the sampl cases a divided committee didnt do so 
that probably reflects legislators sensitivity about their own 
presumably more restrained interventions with executive agencies in 
behalf of constituents it is part of the job and as phelan noted 
there is no house rule expressly defining undue influence

stock lists are forever offered from wall 
street one of the reasons being that wall street and its 
institutions and brokers have an increasingly shorter time horizon 
and an everchanging focus 
heres a list thats different its from main street prepared 
by serious amateurs who believe in fundamental analysis rather than 
hunches and longterm investing rather than shortterm trading 
the national association of investors corp has just released 
its top 100 stocks which it says is made up of the most widely 
held companies among individual investors and investment clubs 
around the country 
heading the list are walmart stores american family pepsico 
mcdonalds and american telephone amp telegraph four of which were 
also in the top five a year ago the newcomer mcdonalds jumped 
from 16th place 
advancing the furthest suggesting individual and club investors 
believe the shares have good longterm futures were rollins 
environmental from 80 to 34 upjohn from 92 to 51 and eastman 
kodak at 31 a newcomer to the list 
ken janke naic president observes that while the markets 
horizon seems to be getting shorter and its turnover greater and 
that many stocks seem to be chosen because of publicity the naics 
membership sticks to longterm goals 
fundamental to its investment concept is that company 
performance should be studied thoroughly before any commitment is 
made and that the investment should be made primarily in companies 
growing more rapidly than the economy 
in operating a portfolio it believes that regular investments 
even if in small amounts are necessary in order to offset the 
unpredictable ups and downs of the market and that dividends 
should be reinvested 
the effectiveness of that approach has been demonstrated in 
learned theses and simple comparisons but most effectively in the 
lives of club members who have paid tuitions bought homes taken 
trips and retired on their investments 
janke said a review of 1600 responses naic has 135000 
members identified at least two significant trends about 
individual investing habits 
first he said amateur and individual investors are taking 
their investing even more seriously than in the past placing more 
emphasis on facts and fundamentals rather than on hearsay or gossip 
a developing trend according to janke is the growing use of 
dividend reinvestment plans to help build club holdings and keep 
commission costs low more than onequarter of clubs appeared to be 
using such plans he said 
close to a thousand companies offer reinvestment plans in which 
dividends are transferred to the shareholders account with the 
company in addition most plans allow additional monthly or 
quarterly amounts to be sent directly to the company thereby 
eliminating or greatly reducing brokerage costs 
philip keating president of naics southeast florida council 
comments that the disciplined fundamentalist longterm 
perspective of members is often made difficult by the media and 
professional and institutional investors 
he claims the media and professional investors whom he 
described as the herd on the street and the flock on the 
block promote the notion of inout trading and distract from 
fundamental considerations 
wall street changes its opinion on stocks many times more 
often than the real longterm fundamentals of the underlying 
companies change he said in an analysis of the top 100 in 
better investing naics monthly magazine 
copies of the report are available at 2 from the national 
association of investors corp 1515 e eleven mile road royal 
oak mich 48067 annual membership of 31 includes the magazine

in the temporary navajo tribal council 
office one clock runs five minutes faster than another a few feet 
away an unintended symbol of a government thrown out of sync by 
the alleged corruption of its chairman 
peter macdonald who had held the highest office of the 
200000member tribe with one interruption since 1971 was voted 
out by the tribal council in february following allegations that he 
demanded kickbacks 
the 60yearold macdonald who says hes innocent has lived for 
years like a potentate in plain view of indians whose austere 
circumstances are proverbial and yet while he rode in limousines 
and flew to europe hawaii and the super bowl he also promised 
economic development a vision of herdsmen becoming technicians 
after spending 650000 to remodel his offices following his 
january 1987 inauguration macdonald was secure in his fourth term 
until january when the us senate select committee on indian 
affairs began investigating corruption in tribal governments 
witness after witness told of macdonald demanding kickbacks his 
son peter rocky macdonald jr testified after receiving 
immunity from prosecution using a code term in speaking of 
underthetable payments to his father as golf balls 
when the 88member tribal council began its winter meeting in 
early february it rebelled 
on feb 17 a friday night after many macdonald supporters had 
left the dissidents voted 4913 to place him and vice chairman 
johnny thompson on administrative leave 
the majority picked leonard haskie as interim chairman on march 
10 and has stood united since giving rise to th name 49ers 
the joke around here is that its the 49ers versus the 
stealers said cecil jones of chinle 
past navajo leaders usually were very wealthy men but i 
wouldnt say they compare to macdonald said duane beyal 
haskies press secretary and chief assistant to former chairman 
peterson zah with them they were counting herds of sheep with 
macdonald its the green stuff 
in visits to some of the 109 reservation chapters or wards 
macdonald has maintained his innocence he has refused repeated 
associated press requests for interviews and declined to respond in 
writing to a list of questions 
although the navajo supreme court upheld the council action 
macdonald refused to stop giving orders or vacate what haskie calls 
the mahogany palace wing of the administration building 
i am innocent and i am entitled under the law to be presumed 
innocent but the tribal council could care less macdonald wrote 
in an opinion piece for the gallup nm independent 
he has acknowledged taking gifts from contractors but argues 
gift exchanges are a timehonored way of doing business by indian 
chiefs to haskie thats a distortion of indian tradition 
those gifts were tokens to establish a longterm friendship 
with an individual not hundreds of thousands of dollars but small 
things bracelets moccasins a shawl haskie said 
no one knows how much macdonald realized from the tribes 1987 
purchase of the big boquillas ranch a 491000acre spread in 
northcentral arizona phoenix real estate broker byron bud 
brown testified that he arranged for a scottsdale oilman to buy the 
ranch for 262 million and sell it a few hours later to the 
navajos for 334 million 
brown said he gave macdonald 50000 in cash and the use of a 
bmw sedan along with paying off a 25000 loan dissidents claim 
macdonald may have received onetenth of the profit a federal 
grand jury in phoenix is investigating the allegations 
in 1975 macdonald was indicted on fraud and incometaxevasion 
charges a deadlocked us district court jury in may 1977 failed 
to reach a verdict and the judge ordered a directed verdict of 
acquittal 
the longtime tribal leader is not without defenders 
mr macdonald is a very strong statesman for indian people 
across the country said donald benally chairman of the 
councils advisory committee until haskie named a new panel 
i think we would have really made a big stride in our economic 
development if mr macdonald wouldve gone on without any political 
interruptions 
macdonald an electrical engineer worked in the aerospace 
industry in southern california before he returned to the 
reservation where people still live in traditional fivesided 
logandmud hogans tucked into remote canyons or squatting atop 
windswept mesas 
the native of teec nos pos a tiny community less than five 
miles from both utah and new mexico in the four corners heartland 
of navajo tradition served three terms as chairman before zah won 
the 1982 election 
four years later macdonald defeated zah by about 750 votes out 
of 61000 cast 
haskie said he doesnt know whether hell run for the 
55000ayear position in 1990 he added that he expects the 
chairmanship to have less power when he leaves office 
i never sought this job it just happened so fast said the 
43yearold civil engineer 
haskie has persuaded the us bureau of indian affairs and 
citibank corp of arizona that he is legally in charge 
john h stevens the bias navajo area director said courts had 
upheld the council majoritys action despite macdonalds claim that 
a twothirds majority was needed to remove him from office 
noting that citibank had decided to honor haskies signature on 
checks stevens strengthened haskies hand on april 6 by empowering 
him to allocate contracts controlling 91 million in federal funds 
for such purposes as navajo police work forest management fire 
and judicial services 
stevens a san carlos apache who grew up in arizona views the 
councils action as a legal housecleaning but macdonald has 
claimed that the bia is trying to undermine tribal sovereignty 
this happens in foreign countries not the navajo nation 
said council delegate anderson tully of teesto they are copying 
communistic countries 
john chapela a window rock attorney who claims to have gathered 
37000 signatures in a drive to recall macdonald has visited about 
25 chapters to show the senate videotapes 
mr macdonald is his own downfall said chapela whom 
macdonald has fired from three tribal positions he said macdonald 
is our best salesman of the need for a constitution that would 
ensure accountability and spell out procedures for removing leaders 
macdonald rejects a constitution as an anglo form of 
government and haskie said tailoring a constitution to tribal 
needs would require extensive discussion debates and public 
hearings 
meanwhile the uncertainty continues 
paula martin director of the navajo ethics office said she 
believes many people remain neutral about macdonald with few 
recognizing haskie as a legitimate successor 
i think there should be a new election for chairman she 
said

editors note torture is an ancient practice but the science 
of rehabilitating its victims has just started receiving serious 
attention in the past few years this nations most ambitious 
effort at treating the victims psychological as well as physical 
wounds has been undertaken at a private nonprofit clinic in 
minneapolis 
</TEXT>

at a clinic in a small stucco house near the 
university of minnesota doctors make a point of wearing street 
clothes instead of white coats and patient files are stored in a 
bank vault 
medical instruments are kept out of sight along with scissors 
and other sharp objects a psychologist may counsel a patient one 
day and take him to the dentist the next the whine of a drill or 
sight of a needle can cause terror 
this is a story about people whose personalities have been taken 
apart piece by piece and the people who try to put them back 
together the stucco house with its mismatched furniture colorful 
artwork and donated plants is the center for victims of torture 
the nations most ambitious attempt to rehabilitate torture 
survivors 
the psychologists doctors and others who work here face a 
distinct disadvantage torture is ancient but this is a science 
still inventing itself we are designing the car while riding in 
it linda valerian says 
though still a long way from the research training treatment 
and education institute envisioned by a governors task force the 
private nonprofit center already is looked to for leadership by a 
dozen groups trying to launch similar programs in los angeles san 
francisco and elizabeth nj in june representatives of each 
group will travel to minneapolis for four days of workshops 
the conference will focus on treatment of trauma because medical 
research on torture survivors has yet to be done the 10 doctors 
psychiatrists psychologists and social workers at the minneapolis 
outpatient clinic have borrowed from the treatment of rape victims 
vietnam veterans and others 
executive director douglas johnson thinks torture victims are 
more profoundly damaged by their experience if you were raped or 
mugged you would still have some hope of rescue he says but 
being tortured by your government means losing all recourse 
theres a sense of abandonment to evil 
nearly threefourths of the centers clients suffer from 
posttraumatic stress disorder the disease of combat soldiers 
rape victims and earthquake survivors symptoms include nightmares 
flashbacks loss of memory inability to concentrate and 
uncontrollable outbursts of anger 
in the beginning client assessments were kept to a minimum for 
fear that too many questions would trigger memories of 
interrogation for most people though weve found the process 
was actually comforting says johnson whose staff has begun 
compiling information as a prelude to serious research the center 
also is raising money to renovate a much larger building the state 
is donating to enable the program to expand 
so far 147 survivors and their relatives have been treated at 
the center they have come from 21 countries including cambodia 
ethiopia south africa el salvador honduras iran and vietnam 
eventually the center hopes to treat 100 a year 
nearly all now live in minnesota with its myriad church and 
state refugee programs the state has the highest per capita 
refugee population in the nation 39000 out of 6 million 
residents not counting central american and other illegal aliens 
all told johnson thinks there could be as many as 6000 torture 
survivors among them los angeles could have 50000 or more he 
says 
minnesotas clinic established with the help of gov rudy 
perpich in 1985 is one of two fullservice torturetreatment 
facilities in the united states chicagos marjorie kovler center 
for the treatment of survivors of torture opened in 1987 five 
years after copenhagen established the first center others are 
operating in toronto and paris 
typically anywhere from one to 10 years pass before a client 
finds his way to minneapolis for treatment the physical evidence 
may be long gone but the invisible psychic wounds have yet to 
heal 
the victims initial interview with barbara chester the 
clinical director may mark the first time they have ever discussed 
their experience some have trouble remembering others can bring 
themselves to speak of it only in the third person relaying tales 
of horror that happened to others 
its hard for a nation of donahuewatchers to understand the 
reticence of torture survivors says chester a psychologist 
in the third world life is much more personal some things are 
simply not talked about 
women who were sexually abused by their captors may view 
themselves as pariahs she says theres also the stigma that you 
must have told them something you must have joined the enemy to 
be still alive 
torture victims may not see the connection between the beatings 
of three years ago and the anxieties of today but such delays 
arent unusual youre so busy surviving it may not be until you 
rest for a moment that this comes out chester says 
center physician neal holtan has learned not to mince words i 
may ask pointblank if theyve ever been tortured often even 
when the answer is yes the response is an unequivocal no in some 
of the worlds prisons he says its considered normal to be 
beaten up every day 
when the longrepressed symptoms do surface the most mundane 
encounters the most common objects can cause panic a knock on 
the door a ring of a bell the turning on of a light bulb can 
trigger bad memories says university of minnesota law professor 
david weissbrodt a board member of both amnesty international and 
the center 
center staffers wear street clothes because many clients are 
afraid of uniforms even the sight of a mailman can upset them 
chester says 
for clients protection files are stored in a bank vault for 
their comfort the stucco house is unmarked and when the center 
opened four buddhist monks ceremoniously chased evil spirits out 
of each room 
psychologist rosa garciapeltoniemi and her colleagues probe 
gently we are careful not to play the role of interrogator and 
we watch out for anything institutional in the atmosphere of the 
place she looks at her donated office furniture and sighs i 
worry that my chairs are too drab 
garciapeltoniemi who came to america as a cuban refugee in 
1970 is especially attuned to her clients adjustment problems in 
their native countries they may have been students professionals 
or tribesmen in america they lose those identities 
refugees in america are also exposed to more risk than the 
average person she says they may live in poor neighborhoods 
with drugs crime assaults for refugees whove been traumatized 
another incident can have a powerful effect

for those kept alive by the american dream the reality can be 
daunting they may feel angry at the political asylum process 
says chester they may feel that americans should know whats 
happened theres very little recognition of their terrible grief 
and loss 
the world medical association defines torture as the 
deliberate systematic or wanton infliction of physical or mental 
suffering by one or more persons acting alone or on the orders of 
any authority to force another person to yield information to make 
a confession or for any other reason 
reports of torture have surfaced in 90 countries according to 
amnesty international the worldwide human rights organization by 
its count torture is systematic in 30 countries a serious problem 
in another 30 
historians have tracked the institutionalization of torture to 
the greeks and the romans who used it to extract confessions from 
slaves torture spread through the criminal justice system 
eventually it was used against citizens as well as slaves 
the pattern has stayed consistent through the ages chester 
says a small group of disenfranchised people are tortured for 
state security reasons it begins there but it doesnt end there 
invariably torture spreads 
the notion of torture as truth serum has long since been 
disproved extreme pain is likely to elicit whatever a torturer 
wants to hear 
but information isnt necessarily the objective johnson says 
the real purpose of torture is to dismantle the personality 
leaving an empty husk it is to leave the person ineffective 
afraid to act unable to lead a warning to the rest of the 
community 
to those ends it is chillingly effective he says no one can 
withstand modern torture 
torture victims may be forced to witness mock executions to 
watch loved ones being tortured to swallow or inject massive doses 
of drugs that carry terrible side effects to breathe water or 
worse 
overstimulation and sensory deprivation are common 
intermittent uncontrollable blasts of noise piped into cells 
hooded prisoners made to stand naked in brightly lit cells for 
interminable periods cells flooded with cold water making sleep 
impossible frequent cell changes heighten helplessness 
imagine how you would feel if every time you came home the 
furniture was moved and there were new people living in your 
house says pat rengel chief legislative counsel for amnesty 
internationalus people become totally insecure theres no 
feeling of control 
disorientation overstimulation and sensory deprivation are 
among the hardtodetect psychological methods that are replacing 
the bluntforce trauma of the past one reason for the change is 
the worlds heightened awareness of human rights abuses another is 
the heightened awareness of the workings of the human mind 
since we know so much more about the psychology of the human 
being rengel says it opens the door to people who want to do 
other than good 
a decade ago it was possible to identify the country 
responsible on the basis of a victims injuries todays methods 
are more uniform 
you dont need to be in a highly sophisticated setting to use 
electricity to torture people says rengel even in remote areas 
she says people can charge up a field battery and take it 
along 
in some cases electric shock is administered under a doctors 
supervision theres evidence of health professionals 
involvement in uruguay argentina and chile johnson says in 
europe theres evidence that doctors and psychologists are 
involved in designing prisons to keep people disoriented 
some techniques are more subtle and more devastating one 
woman was made to choose between two forms of torture thereby 
becoming a participant 
often a torturer persuades a victim that following certain 
rules will result in rewards such as a visit from relatives or an 
extra ration of food but the rules change constantly 
they want you to think you have some control but you can 
never figure out the magic words says valerian who has 
testified at immigration hearings as an expert witness on human 
rights abuses 
after weeks months or years the ordeal is over freedom is 
restored often as capriciously as it was taken away some 
survivors manage to slip out of the country the escapes in many 
cases are as dangerous as the imprisonment chester says 
nearly 80 percent of the centers clients find work although 
most people wind up with survival jobs says leigh 
bristolkagan a social worker she says some are highly 
indecisive a holdover from imprisonment when wrong decisions held 
weighty consequences low tolerance for stress is common as are 
troubled relationships within suvivors families 
problems with immigration judges are common because they have 
divorced themselves from their emotions clients have gone in and 
in great detail related what happened to them in a monotone 
johnson says the judge doesnt believe them the center often 
calls upon the minnesota lawyers project a sister organization 
for help 
about 30 percent of the clients are on antidepressants many 
are plagued by real or imagined pains crying spells and feelings 
of hopelessness panic guilt and shame also common is psychic 
numbing a sense of detachment from others and an inability to 
experience pleasure 
we think strong people tend to drive deep in themselves and 
protect some part of themselves to wall it off divorce themselves 
from their bodies in terms of joy and relaxation as well as 
pain johnson says 
if their sexuality or their emotions are being used against 
them they divorce themselves from that it gets them through but 
when the torture is over that part of them remains dysfunctional 
the minneapolis clinic has a budget of 350000 this year 
compared to 195000 in 1988 the money comes from foundation 
grants and private donations clients pay no fees for their 
treatment 
some seek only medical care others request longterm treatment 
invariably things get worse before they get better how much 
better remains to be seen we dramatically help a few patients 
and miserably fail a few holtan says most fall into the 
middle ground 
still the mood at the center is hopeful torture victims who 
seek treatment tend to be intelligent and motivated staff members 
say 
what we see here are the survivors says chester we are 
constantly amazed

transforming an ordinary citizen into a 
skilled torturer is easier than one might think says a longtime 
amnesty international volunteer 
linda valerian who is also a fundraiser and coordinator of 
volunteers for minnesotas center for victims of torture has 
testified at immigration hearings as an expert witness on human 
rights abuses she gained some of her insights from a former 
salvadoran torturer whom she interviewed at length 
valerian remembers him as charming and likable he was most 
concerned that i would be upset by what he had to say the 
torturer whod escaped to the united states agreed to be 
interviewed to clear his conscience she says 
his recruiters used a common technique part of the training 
involved propaganda induction sessions valerian says hed 
been told that world war iii had started communists were secretly 
infiltrating the country using it as a beachhead to take over the 
western world 
it was imperative that he be made to believe these people were 
holding the fate of the western world in their hands 
in reality the victims had been chosen at random valerian 
says he saw elderly men pregnant women and kids still he had 
no idea they werent communists 
as part of his indoctrination the torturer was himself tortured 
the torturers are often beaten three times a day sexually 
humiliated and punished arbitrarily valerian says this 
normalization of violence is the key the training lasts nine 
months this man from the back of his waist to his knees was one 
giant callus from canings with broom handles 
at the same time new recruits are being beaten valerian says 
theyre taught that theyre the ones who are informed as to 
whats really going on theyre the elite 
there are people who do enjoy it theres the power the 
perks the promise of a job for life theyre given cars and 
theyre paid very well with liquor and drugs for the asking a lot 
of the torture is done under the influence 
the salvadoran came from a family of 14 in a rural area they 
were very poor and always hungry valerian says 
for a time he did all that was asked of him he finally began 
to wonder when one of his superiors told him to cut the head off 
the body of someone theyd murdered and place it on his body as a 
warning to others valerian says he couldnt do it he 
couldnt bring himself to mutilate a dead body 
then he saw a commanding officer cut the finger off a corpse 
he wanted the dead mans ring 
he said thats crazy were acting like animals valerian 
says he escaped the next day

editors note from vietnam westward to laos and cambodia lie 
the remains of more than 2300 americans listed as missing in 
action since the war ended 14 years ago now the communist 
government has opened the doors wide for americans to come in and 
search for their dead apparently in hopes that more cooperation 
with the west will lead to more sorely needed economic aid the

on that day in 1967 when the skies 
filled with us warplanes raining bombs a former north vietnamese 
militiaman remembers burying an american airman who was shot down 
in a rice paddy 
on a recent spring day bui van lai now 52 along with 10 other 
vietnamese men and a group of americans were digging for the 
remains of the missing flier on the land that is now a cornfield 
grazed by water buffalo 
in vietnams paddies and peaceful fields sprinkled with violets 
in the foreboding triplecanopy jungles in the chilling waters of 
the south china sea from vietnam westward to laos and cambodia 
lie the remains of more than 2300 other americans also listed as 
missing in action 
for 431 of the missing their final resting place is apparently 
at sea off the coast of vietnam more than half of them from navy 
carriers an 82day undersea recovery operation using divers and 
special barges 16 years ago was unsuccessful although some 
wreckage was found 
now after more than a decade of basking in a bittersweet 
victory in selfimposed isolation communist vietnam is welcoming 
americans back in increasing numbers to search for their fallen 
comrades and even joining them in their effort what vietnam wants 
in return is badly needed american aid for a country that won the 
war but couldnt manage the peace 
even vietnams top official for mias nguyen can accompanies 
the joint usvietnamese excavation team as bui van lai leads them 
through the mud of ha son binh a wilderness 45 miles west of hanoi 
farmers who once were victims of us air attacks gather in 
curiosity around the searchers as they map the plot of land where 
the american pilot is believed buried 
quach thuc 68 her teeth rotten from vietnamese chewing 
tobacco points to the sky i saw the crash she says i 
didnt want to look i ran away 
the second crewman in the plane was captured spent six years in 
a prison camp and was freed by north vietnam along with 590 other 
americans during operation homecoming in 1973 
today the americans come armed not with laser bombs but with 
compasses tape measures trowels dental picks and whisk brooms 
the tools of the archaeologist their mission is to preserve the 
skeletal remains for their journey home 
each bone is measured its position sketched and photographed 
and then reassembled in a lab just the way it was found for 
identification 
i want the whole bone because i can make the best most 
scientific statement says peter miller a forensic 
anthropologist and archaeologist with the us central 
identification laboratory in hawaii if there are teeth in that 
jaw that jaw is going to be fragile therefore id better be 
careful how i dig it out because i want the dentist back in the lab 
to have a whole set of teeth 
the laboratory has a computerized data base on every tooth of 
every missing american who fought in vietnam so if the teeth are 
recovered they can be matched with the xrays 
the joint casualty resolution center in hawaii which searches 
for mias has all of the information on the crash including the 
site and names of the missing airmen based on eyewitness reports 
of other pilots and on informants such as bui van lai from bone 
fragments alone miller can determine the race sex and age of the 
victim 
but on this day and the next the searchers are unable to find 
the american remains even though they uncovered some pieces of 
wreckage time has altered the terrain and played tricks with bui 
van lais memory the searchers must move on but miller hopes to 
try again another time 
while other us and vietnamese search teams crisscross the 
countryside in usmade vans the families back home keep alive 
their last link to the lost some 3600 of them belong to the 
national league of families which was founded in 1970 to push for 
the return of any americans still alive the fullest possible 
accounting of those still missing and the repatriation of remains 
the leagues position is that americans are still held a 
policy based on history of the issue known discrepancy cases and 
the intelligence information which supports our view says ann 
mills griffiths executive director of the league who has a 
brother among the mias 
the vast majority of family members believe americans are 
alive mrs griffiths says they dont necessarily personalize 
it for themselves saying i believe my husbands alive they say 
i believe americans are alive im not sure about my own 
relatives 
for many families the mental torture never ends until the 
fallen are buried 
it is a human trait to hope that individual is alive unless 
you have some indication that man is dead mrs griffiths says 
even though its sad to lose someone you love if hes buried 
with military honors its done with for you its over 
all of the mias except one air force col charles e shelton a 
native of owensboro ky have been legally declared dead so the 
family can collect benefits just under half the mias were declared 
killed at the time of the battle based on eyewitness reports but 
heavy fire or other circumstances prevented recovery of their 
remains 
shelton was shot down in the mountains of laos on his 33rd 
birthday 24 years ago us rescuers contacted him by radio on the 
ground and he indicated he was in good condition villagers and 
defectors told authorities he was taken prisoner by communist 
laotian forces 
shelton is among the socalled discrepancy cases in vietnam 
and laos in which some americans were alive when last seen and the 
united states has reason to believe they were taken into captivity 
or turned over to communist authorities

over the years shelton has been promoted from captain to 
colonel his wife marian has turned 55 and his five children 
have grown up including one son who was ordained a catholic priest 
while authorities say his official status as americas only pow 
in vietnam is symbolic of us determination to make sure every mia 
is accounted for his wife believes he is still alive and waits for 
his return cherishing the memory of their first meeting on the 
tennis courts in owensboro when she was 13 and he was 14 
i think god gives all of us a cross to bear says mrs 
shelton who lives in san diego 
vietnam has repeatedly denied it is holding live american 
prisoners or is storing in morgues the remains of mias returning 
them when it suits its political purposes 
we have not been able to prove anyone is still alive but 
given the information we continue to receive we cannot rule out or 
ignore that possibility so we are going to continue to pursue the 
issue says lt col keith schneider a spokesman for the 
pentagon 
the united states has received more than 1100 firsthand reports 
of sightings of live americans in 63 percent of the cases 
schneider says the americans had been in indochina but had 
returned home and are not missing in action twentyone percent 
were fabrications the other 16 percent are under continuing 
investigation 
can says some vietnamese people have been giving out false 
information on pows and trafficking in mia remains by digging up 
vietnamese graves and trying to pass them off as the remains of 
americans in the mistaken belief that they will be rewarded with 
entry into the united states 
what good is it for us to keep one or two american mia 
prisoners asks can what good is it for us to hold remains if 
we return to the united states nearly 600 pows living prisoners of 
war are much more valuable if we choose to use them as leverage 
schneider and mrs griffiths both say that since retired gen 
john w vessey jr president reagans emissary held highlevel 
talks with the vietnamese in hanoi in august 1987 there has been 
increased cooperation 
that is evident in the field where vietnam has allowed more 
american searchers to come in including forensic anthropologists 
but still there is a long way to go vietnam laos and china 
have turned over the remains of fewer than 300 americans no 
remains have been returned from cambodia where 83 americans are 
listed as missing like vietnam the united states has no 
diplomatic relations with cambodia whose government is under the 
control of the vietnamese 
can says the vietnamese have been trying to settle the issue as 
fast as they can but vietnams speed depends on the cooperation 
the vessey mission pledged in helping the country obtain 
humanitarian aid from nongovernment organizations for disabled 
veterans and children 
on their part can says they will have to help us in 
solving the humanitarian concerns of vietnam 
by law the united states is forbidden to give vietnam any 
financial or material assistance but it does contribute indirectly 
by keeping nongovernment charitable organizations informed of 
vietnams needs and by making it easier for the organizations to 
satisfy complicated regulations in sending goods and people to 
vietnam 
for the families of the missing the vigil is never ending some 
of their children are now older than their fathers were when they 
were lost 
one family rosella and walter fitts have stayed close to their 
home in abington mass near boston for nearly 20 years except to 
attend meetings of the national league of families in washington 
and to speak in new england to keep alive the miapow issue 
we havent been out socially in over 18 years says fitts a 
66yearold bulldozer operator we never go anywhere im afraid 
a phone call will come or a car will come in the driveway with some 
information 
the fittses son richard a special forces green beret 
sergeant has been missing since nov 30 1968 he was only 21 at 
the time married and a father now his only son is 22 older than 
his father was when he was reported missing his wife didnt 
remarry until a year ago 
in march the call the fitts had waited for came military 
officials told mrs fitts that a us excavation team had uncovered 
an undetermined number of human remains at a site in laos where a 
helicopter believed carrying her son and six other military men had 
crashed in november 1968 the remains have been sent to the us 
central identification laboratory 
but marian shelton rosella and walter fitts and others like 
them resist the finality of death 
ive had that feeling right from the beginning that he was 
alive says mrs fitts i just cant get rid of that feeling i 
had a dream of seeing him in a cave alive way back 
fitts says he had hopes his son was alive and suspected he was 
being held in laos by the communist laotian government theyre 
not dashed he says we play the waiting game again 
even if the central identification laboratory confirms the 
remains are those of his son fitts says he would get a second 
independent opinion i would hate to give up and then have him 
walk up the driveway 
fitts clings to the green beret his son sent him for fathers 
day in 1968 shortly before he left for vietnam and to an 
accompanying letter on a piece of yellow lined paper 
when you hold that beret in your hands you hold me 
because we are part of each other please take care if it dad 
treat it like your own son dad because believe it or not 
the beret you hold in front of you is your son 
every morning and every evening the fittses hold the beret in 
their hands 
the minute you pick it up you just feel him that hes right 
there says mrs fitts

hollywood of late has been preoccupied with 
reliving the vietnam war but at least one of the central players 
in that controversial conflict says he hasnt been the least bit 
interested in reviewing any celluloid versions of those turbulent 
times 
i was there says nguyen cao ky i know what happened 
ky who was prime minister of south vietnam in the mid1960s 
made this observation recently in an interview at his seafood 
packing plant next to the dark sluggish waters of bayou caillou 
it is in this remote little cajun community he says that he 
hopes to end an exile odyssey which began nearly 35 years ago when 
he and 1 million of his countrymen fled south following frances 
defeat at dien bien phu in 1954 
i grew up in north vietnam near hanoi he said when i 
was 20 i was recruited by the french colonial government to fight 
the communist insurgents i began my military career in 1949 as an 
infantry officer in north vietnam and later received flight 
training in algeria and paris 
kys flight to saigon in 1954 marked the first stop of the 
odyssey two decades later after losing again to the communists 
ky went into exile for the second time this time in the united 
states 
now he says he hardly ever thinks about those days when ho 
chi minh city was still called saigon and he was the supreme 
commander of south vietnam 
i am a confucian he adds by way of explanation we 
believe there are times of joy and times of sadness what will be 
will be but its true that i did have absolute power when i was 
made premier after ngo dinh diem was forced out in 1965 you may 
recall there was no congressional body in south vietnam at that 
time for more than two years my word was the absolute law 
at that time ky who still is slim and younglooking at 59 
was a dashing young fighter pilot he favored flashy flight suits 
carried a pair of pearlhandled pistols and frequently appeared 
thus garbed in us news magazine photo layouts 
in fact ky and his wife then a glamorous airline hostess who 
was fond of cowgirl outfits often were depicted as a fun 
couple who were representing our side in an unpleasant little 
usbacked adventure that would contain communism in southeast 
asia history proved otherwise of course and kys government 
since has been given mixed reviews as has the us involvement in 
vietnam 
asked about reports of civil rights abuses during his time as 
premier ky smiles sadly but the smile quickly disappears when he 
is asked about rumors he stashed millions of dollars worth of gold 
and jewels during his tenure as premier 
my wife and i had only about 30000 when we came to this 
country in 1975 he says and when i left south vietnam on the 
day saigon fell i took nothing with me except my uniform and the 
helicopter which i flew to a us warship i had managed to get my 
wife and family on a flight out just two days earlier while nguyen 
van thieu who had succeeded me as premier in 1967 fled with his 
family weeks before saigon fell 
he adds that is why i am the only south vietnamese leader 
today who is able to go freely among our people in exile they know 
i was a patriot who fought to the last 
author neil sheehan whose book on the vietnam war a bright 
shining lie recently won the pulitzer prize remembers ky and 
thieu as corrupt young turks who rose to power in south vietnam 
as us involvement dramatically increased ky flatly denies the 
characterization 
i have a clear conscience he says its true i had power 
but im proud to be able to say that it did not corrupt me if i 
had stolen millions of dollars i could live like a king in this 
country but obviously i dont live like a king believe me i was 
a soldier fighting for freedom not a politician interested in 
power and money 
former gen william c westmoreland who commanded the us 
forces in vietnam throughout most of the 60s says he remembers ky 
as an honest soldier who was revered by his pilots and officers in 
the south vietnamese air force

i saw ky a few months ago in new orleans at a reunion of 
soldiers who fought in vietnam westmoreland said when contacted 
recently at his home in charleston sc i always thought of gen 
ky as a committed military man and its obvious that the men who 
served with him still hold him in very high regard 
westmoreland concedes he had heard rumors of gold being shipped 
out of south vietnam but says he never heard of ky being connected 
with any such stories 
in dulac ky is the president of southern gulf seafood 
processors inc the operation consists of a small packing plant 
which processes shrimp and tuna caught by vietnamese fishermen 
ky who moved to dulac several months ago leases the processing 
plant from a bank in nearby houma his earlier business venture in 
this country a small liquor storedelicatessen in orange county 
calif ended in bankruptcy 
ky has generally tried to keep a low profile since coming to 
this country he says he has gotten some financial support from 
other vietnamese here and in turn works in behalf of vietnamese 
refugees 
i have spent most of my time working with and trying to help 
the vietnamese people who came to the united states as refugees 
he says thats why i am in louisiana i found i like the fishing 
business and have an opportunity to help my people here and make a 
living at the same time 
in 1984 his association with refugee groups led columnist jack 
anderson to brand ky whose wife and family still live in 
california as a leader of vietnamese criminal elements in this 
country anderson said ky had smuggled 8 million in gold and 
jewels from south vietnam 
i was stunned ky recalls there was absolutely no truth 
in that column if there had been the us government would have 
taken some action by now dont you think 
ky says he had considered suing anderson for libel but was 
advised against it by westmoreland who participated in an 
unsuccessful libel suit against cbs several years ago 
westmoreland said he found libel suits are hard to prove and 
you end up spending a lot of money ky says 
ky has found contentment in dulac a fishing community 80 miles 
southwest of new orleans he says the south louisiana climate 
reminds him of southeast asia complete with frenchspeaking 
natives mosquitoes and plenty of vietnamese to socialize with 
right now im busy trying to make a living with this 
processing plant and a fishing boat i bought three years ago he 
says im also involved in an effort to form a fishing coop that 
would benefit the shrimpers in this area 
since ive been here ive tried to help the vietnamese 
fishermen with marketing their catches and with personal details 
such as housing obtaining proper licenses and insurance and such 
i feel i can be a liaison between them and the established 
community here 
he also spends part of his time commuting back and forth between 
dulac and southern california where his youngest daughter recently 
graduated from law school 
my five children have made the adjustment very well he 
says they have become americanized and my oldest son has married 
an italian girl but coming to this country has been harder for my 
wife who stays in california to be near her children and 
grandchildren 
ky says he enjoys associating with the vietnamese fishermen who 
now comprise 65 percent of the shrimpers in the area 
they see me not as a general but as another fisherman and 
as a friend he said 
asked whether he still dreams of returning to vietnam he 
replies yes sometimes but i realize its not possible the way 
things are now 
he said his main regret was not coming to this country during 
the war to promote and explain south vietnams cause to the 
american people 
i have found the american people to be very fair and 
openminded he says but i had no idea how the american public 
opinion was turning against the war i only knew what the generals 
and the us ambassador and the cia were telling me back then to 
me they were america

editors note since it was built almost two centuries ago the 
white house has been slathered with at least 39 layers of paint 
hiding intricate carving in its stone and causing the stone itself 
to deteriorate that plus age weather and some clumsy restorations 
efforts in the past have left the presidents mansion in bad need 
of repair now theyre trying to get this old house spruced up in 
time for its 200th birthday

on a muddy hilltop in rock creek park vincent 
palumbo picks his way among the mossy broken blocks of sandstone 
that once were part of the nations capitol 
brush grows over the weathered pile a fallen tree blocks his 
path 
with a hammer and a chisel palumbo breaks off a sample from one 
stone then shakes his head and turns away he tries another this 
time marking it with a bold splash of orange dye 
this stone will now become part of the white house 
palumbos work this day is one step in the complicated process 
of restoring the stones of the presidential mansion some of them 
intricately carved to their original glory in time for the white 
house bicentennial in 1992 
the 24 million project includes the removal of at least 39 
accumulated layers of paint that have been slathered onto the 
building over almost two centuries 
the national park service which maintains the white house and 
its grounds awarded the contract to stone carving and restoration 
enterprises inc of washington 
overseeing the work as technical adviser is palumbo master 
carver of washington cathedral the seat of the capital diocese of 
the episcopal church and one of the citys landmarks 
palumbo who came to this country from his native italy at age 
26 has worked on the unfinished cathedral as a stonecarver since 
1961 he succeeded his father as master carver after his fathers 
death in 1966 
several years ago rex scouten then the head usher of the white 
house asked palumbo to repair a fireplace later he was asked to 
restore the columns of the north portico when it was repainted in 
1984 the east wall of the building had been restored in 1980 
in the current project the remaining sandstone walls are being 
exposed for the first time since 1797 when the white house was 
first painted 
in an interview in his shop at the cathedral surrounded by 
gargoyles and blocks of marble palumbo says its a national 
thing there is some kind of pride in being involved in restoring 
the residence of the president of the great nation here you have 
this immigrant who came over with almost nothing and to be called 
to restore the white house is a great honor 
the restoration officials say is much needed 
until 1980 the white house had been repainted about every four 
years after a study requested by scouten and the national park 
service in 1976 the bureau of standards recommended that all the 
paint be chemically removed each section of wall is left bare for 
several months to allow the porous surface to dry in the meantime 
damaged stonework is restored 
the sandstone for the white house was quarried from aquia creek 
in northern virginia 
the cornerstone was laid in 1792 and the walls were built and 
decorated from 1794 to 1798 the work being done by 10 to 12 
stonecutters from scotland 
the walls represented the finest stonework yet produced in the 
united states and portions of them survive today the only 
examples of 18thcentury craftsmanship that remain in the 
building architectural historian william seale wrote in his 1986 
book the presidents house 
its still a good solid building palumbo says as he guides 
a visitor along a scaffolding on the north wall its just that 
the surface of the stone has been corroded 
gary walters who succeeded scouten as chief usher agrees the 
coast and geodetic survey examined the house in 1976 and attested 
that it was stable and not moving 
removal of the paint has disclosed both beauty and damage that 
were not known to be there 
there are 39 layers of paint that are identifiable walters 
says there may have been more than that they just took the 
paintbrushes and crammed the paint in there and wed find it 38 of 
an inch thick in some of this stonecarving it just hid a lot of 
this

editors note like diapers razors and even wristwatches 
contact lenses have joined the growing ranks of throwaway items 
cheaper lenses now can be worn for a week or two and tossed in the 
trash if they hurt your eye just take them out and put in a new 
pair no more expensive cleaning solutions no more tenderloving 
care

soft contact lenses those floppy pieces 
of plastic that help people see without wearing eyeglasses have 
reached a popular american culture benchmark theyve become 
disposable 
that could mean a lot of changes involving the way people view 
the little lenses that make things clearer for 23 million americans 
hundreds of thousands of people are already wearing disposable 
lenses even though up to now theyve been available only on a 
limited basis eye doctors are flocking to lectures about them and 
consumers are wondering whats going on 
theyve really captured the interest of the american public 
says dr scott macrae an ophthalmologist from portland ore who 
is also a consultant to the food and drug administration for 
ophthalmic devices 
he speaks from experience he wears a disposable lens in his 
right eye 
i dont think weve ever seen anything in my experience that 
gained this kind of acceptance says hal johnson president of 
professional products at bausch amp lomb the nations leading seller 
of contact lenses were in high gear and i mean high gear 
it hasnt been too long ago that basketball games were stopped 
while players scoured the floor for a missing contact lens most 
people still coddle and clean their lenses treating them like tiny 
treasures 
they even buy insurance policies to protect them from loss or 
damage 
now along come some lenses that can be worn for a week or two 
and tossed in the trash if they hurt your eye just take them out 
and put in a new pair no more expensive cleaning solutions no 
more tenderloving care 
is wear em and toss em the wave of the future 
probably not say officials at bausch amp lomb and other eye care 
experts 
the main reason is that most of the most of the lenses available 
can only be worn by patients who are nearsighted another negative 
factor is the cost between 300 and 500 per year 
disposable contacts were introduced in the united states in july 
1987 by vistakon inc a subsidiary of johnson amp johnson which up 
until march was the only maker of a disposable lens with national 
distribution vistakons throwaway lenses are called accuvue 
bausch amp lomb started selling disposable contacts nationally in 
march and ciba vision the secondleading maker has started 
selling disposable contacts in california that can be worn by both 
nearsighted and farsighted people 
cibas kim little says lenses called newvues should be 
available nationally later this year 
johnson says bausch amp lomb expects that between 10 percent and 
20 percent of all contact lens wearers in the country will switch 
to disposable lenses 
but even that small percentage will have astounding business 
implications for the contact lens industry 
consider that a patient who normally would have walked into an 
optometrists office and left with a new pair of lenses could now 
walk away with u to 52 pairs of lenses 
the average disposable customer using either a oneweek or a 
twoweek replacement schedule will use 39 pairs of lenses a year 
that means that instead of selling four million lenses a year to 
the roughly 2 million disposable customers eye doctors will sell 
156 million lenses a year 
bausch amp lomb is expanding its three largest contact lens 
manufacturing plants including the renovation of an area in 
rochester roughly the size of two football fields that will be 
devoted to the companys seequence line of disposable lenses 
this flurry of activity is all possible because bausch amp lomb 
and vistakon have been able to dramatically lower the cost of 
making a contact lens 
irving aarons a stock analyst for arthur d little in 
cambridge mass estimates that bausch amp lomb can make a 
disposable lens for less than 1 maybe as low as 75 cents it 
sells two lenses for 5 to practitioners who turn around and sell 
them for 7 to 10

<DOCNO> AP890501-0204 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
the companys standard lens costs about 130 to make and is 
sold for between 15 to 30 aarons says practitioners will sell 
each of those lenses for 40 to 50 
theyre selling a smaller number of lenses for a wider margin 
now but with disposables theyll be selling a huge number of 
lenses for a smaller margin aarons says 
more important than the business implications disposable 
contact lenses are going to play a key role in ushering in a whole 
new era in eye care among the many wearers of contact lenses in the 
united states 
one of the things that were seeing is that with the 
introduction of disposable lenses people are understanding that 
frequent lens replacement is a viable option says david archer 
director of marketing for bausch amp lombs professional products 
division 
the average contact lens wearer replaces one lens a year archer 
says and usually suffers some discomfort or some difficulty with a 
lens before deciding to replace it 
if people begin to think that contact lenses are expendable he 
says they will be more likely to replace them as often as every 
week or at least once a year 
the only real difference between a dailywear soft contact lens 
and a disposable lens is the recommended wearing time both are 
made of flexible plastic 
disposable lenses and extendedwear lenses are slightly thinner 
than dailywear lenses making them slightly more comfortable but 
slightly less durable 
the label on the disposable lens container notes the lenses are 
only fda approved for a maximum of two weeks at a time doctors 
were concerned that people wouldnt comply with the recommended 
wearing time but so far studies are indicating that the compliance 
rate is very high 
as far as cost bausch amp lomb has streamlined the technique used 
to make a contact lens and can now manufacture lenses 70 percent 
faster than several years ago the increased volume has allowed the 
price to fall 
bausch amp lomb also offers a frequent lens replacement program 
that allows patients to get new lenses at different intervals such 
as once a month or once every three months and requires them to 
stick the discarded lenses on a card and mail them back to the 
company to insure compliance 
archer likens it to the dental care industrys effort that 
started three decades ago to promote the benefits of regular 
checkups and teeth cleaning to prevent tooth decay 
dr augustus falcone a rochester optometrist who specializes in 
contact lenses agrees with archer 
if you tell a patient about being able to change lenses every 
week it starts the negotiation falcone says ok you dont 
want to change your lenses every week how about every month how 
about every three months whatever they pick is better than what 
they have now 
studies have shown that frequent replacement of lenses at 
intervals suggested by eye doctors can greatly reduce the risk of 
getting a severe eye injury from a contact lens macrae says 
if disposable lenses get people to change their lenses more 
often then theyve probably done a good thing he says 
but macrae and many other eye doctors still are not convinced 
that extendedwear contact lenses like disposable contacts are 
completely safe no matter how often you replace them 
he said a new study of 22000 extendedwear contact lens wearers 
indicates that they are three to five times more likely to suffer a 
serious eye injury than someone who takes his lenses out at night 
we dont know why this is but my hunch is that an 
extendedwear user doesnt get enough oxygen to the cornea and this 
can cause problems macrae says 
falcone learned about the disposability of contact lenses nine 
years ago when professional golfer calvin peete came to him in the 
middle of a golf tournament in rochester because he had torn a 
contact lens 
he could have won 24000 and he had to withdraw because of a 
little piece of plastic falcone says i mean holy mackerel 
whats a lens so i started sending him fistfuls of lenses

editors note the rev william abney remembers how the debarge 
youngsters would captivate the audience as they sang in the choir 
at his bethel pentecostal church but he says they werent able 
to cope with their rapid rise to fame as motown recording artists 
today the oncepromising debarge singing group has split up three 
having been convicted on drug charges 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
just five years ago the singing 
debarge family was at the top of the pop music world promising to 
be one of motowns brightest lights of the 1980s 
the four brothers and a sister with their silky harmonies first 
perfected while singing in their uncles church choir were often 
compared with the jackson five 
further there were five more talented siblings who also were 
either already in the music business or were waiting in the wings 
since then three of the siblings have been convicted of drug 
charges and at least two others have had other brushes with the law 
only one el debarge has remained in the musical spotlight 
etterlene debarge rodriguez the mother of 10 and grandmother of 
15 blames drugs 
in every life a little rain must fall and this rain happened 
to be drugs she says they had a calling but they deviated 
because they were young and very talented there are so many vices 
out there to destroy you 
seated next to her recently in the familys stylish grand rapids 
home was son jonathon better known as chico just two years 
after gaining national attention with his selftitled popfunk 
album on the motown label chico was on his way to prison 
last june at the same time he was planning a european concert 
tour the 22yearold singersongwriter was stopped by federal 
authorities at detroit metropolitan airport after returning from 
los angeles they found 22 pounds of cocaine in his bag and that 
of a companion 
brother robert 33 who gained notoriety in the late 1970s and 
early 80s with the nowdefunct soul group switch also was 
convicted in the case 
robert began serving a fiveyear threemonth prison term in 
february on april 12 chico began a fiveyear eightmonth 
sentence 
in the past few years mrs rodriguez also has seen son el 
convicted of creating a disturbance for the beating of a calvin 
college student after she reportedly resisted his advances 
she has seen son tommy spend time in jail for cocaine 
convictions and son robert arrested for allegedly telling a 
stewardess he was carrying a bomb 
rodriguez believes the arrest of robert was a blessing in 
disguise because of what she says was a longtime drug habit 
rodriguez says her home is a gift from son el as is the new 
cadillac in the driveway in the garage is a new black jaguar el 
has just bought for himself 
the rev william abney remembers how the family would captivate 
the audience as they sang in the choir at his bethel pentecostal 
church in grand rapids 
but he says they werent able to cope with their rapid rise to 
fame 
it was like putting an icecold piece of glass into burning 
hot water abney says itll crack 
fame came first to robert and tommy in the late 1970s and early 
80s with the group switch which had a contract with motown 
the family struck gold again with motown in the early 80s when 
siblings el bunny james mark and randy hit the top of the soul 
charts and then crossed over to pop with a series of hits time 
will reveal rhythm of the night and all this love 
with fame however came varying levels of success and the 
pressures of being in the spotlight by 1986 the group had 
disbanded and el and bunny wound up solo artists for motown 
the family is now spread across the country el commutes between 
california and michigan with brother tommy who plays bass in his 
group marty james and randy are trying to get another recording 
contract and bunny also is hoping to record again rodriguez says 
the youngest debarges 19yearold twins carol and darrell 
arent budding musicians though darrell wrote some songs on els 
new album real love which has been rising on the billboard 
charts since it was released in february 
in fact almost every member of the family had some part in the 
new album 
were still together just not marketwise chico says 
chico believes the music business and aggressive record 
companies are at the root of many performers problems 
the business is very deceitful he says it will deceive 
you and bring you up to where you cant handle things 
traci jordan vice president of publicity for motown which has 
signed chico through 1992 would not discuss chico or any other 
member of the debarge family 
dennis hunt blackmusic critic for the los angeles times was 
less reticent to critique the familys music 
as a family they never took off as people expected he 
says el seemed to be the most talented one when he left the 
others didnt seem to fare quite as well 
hunt says the debarge family problems were wellknown in the 
music community 
people knew about their strange activities he says i 
cant think of any group there were more rumors about 
hunt is pessimistic about the groups future 
there is nothing to indicate any niche for them now or in the 
future he says the main route to success for black musicians 
is through dance music and thats taken more by women than men 
chico says he intends to write songs in prison about his 
experiences but when he gets out he probably will turn to gospel 
music 
that pleases his mother 
i never wanted my children to be stars she says but they 
were young and talented and there are a lot of temptations out 
there

actress joanne woodward is turning historian 
tapping memories to recreate a revolution in american acting led 
by the late lee strasberg and the group theater 
for a long time id wanted to do something about the group 
theater she says i didnt quite know what when lee died i 
suddenly panicked and said pretty soon there wont be anybody 
left to tell the tale 
now she is hosting broadways dreamers the legacy of the 
group theater the first program in the fourth season of the 
american masters series on pbs it will be televised on june 26 
for miss woodward it is the end product of five years of 
interviews wedged into a busy career which accounts for her 
changing hair colors and styles onscreen there is also archival 
footage of the 193141 group theater 
what surprised her most about her interview subjects she says 
is their depth of involvement and how immediate it was they 
remembered everything like it was yesterday it is 50 years ago and 
theyre saying lee said this and i said this 
founders of the group theater were strasberg who taught method 
acting director harold clurman and casting director cheryl 
crawford they were dismayed at the lack of real life in the 
drawing room comedies of the 1920s so they created the group 
theater to perform original american plays which would mirror and 
they hoped would change the life of their times 
in the depression they banded together with 28 actors who agreed 
to use an ensemble approach to acting most were in their 20s 
katharine hepburn interviewed briefly during the show says 
that at 21 she attended one planning meeting for the group theater 
and declined to join she said she told them i want to be a 
star 
miss woodward says id heard that story for years i always 
kind of thought it was apocryphal 
elia kazan recalls joining as an apprentice the second year 
instead of the group theater paying him he paid 20 a week when 
he ran out of money he waited tables john garfield joined in 1934 
miss woodward is shown in 1987 directing golden boy in 
williamstown mass during the 90minute tv show the group 
theater first performed that clifford odets play in 1937 
young actors in williamstown had a hard time you had to 
explore that naive passion miss woodward says that kind of 
naivete i think disappeared in world war ii 
the person seen most in the show is robert lewis an original 
group theater member who now teaches acting bobby remembers 
everything in detail miss woodward says when in doubt we cut 
to bobby isnt he funny 
the actress studied acting with sanford meisner an original 
member of the group theater her husband paul newman studied with 
strasberg 
she would like to have made the show more theatrical i had 
visions of bobby going with me to some of the camps where they 
worked in the summer there was not time nor money 
my dream is now to do a film about the group theater im 
convinced there is a great deal more to be said i would direct it 
i think that whole period is fascinating it has never really been 
examined i would imagine one would have to dramatize it in a 
fictitious way there are still surprisingly enough quite a few 
people around who were actively involved 
the group theater did change american theater for one thing in 
1933 it presented men in white broadways first hospital play 
now hospitals have become a staple of theater film and soap opera 
after the group theater dissolved some onetime members were 
called before the house unamerican activities committee some 
careers were ruined 
the 14week american masters season presented by wnetnew 
york focuses on people in the creative arts who have shaped 
american and world culture 
miss woodward has a busy summer ahead daughter clea gets 
married then mr newman and mrs newman will rehearse their title 
roles in a james ivoryismail merchant film mr bridge and mrs 
bridge 
she also attends sarah lawrence college i went to college for 
two years i started back about 1974 its going to be the longest 
ba anybody has ever known you dont major at sarah lawrence i 
just take lots of things im taking playwriting its great fun 
returning to the subject of the group theater she says more 
than anything else it refocused the life of the american theater 
author joseph campbell talks about following your bliss they 
followed their bliss 
there may have been more brilliant theater movements like 
orson welles or more intellectually amazing like eva le 
galliennes there was none that more desired change or were more 
passionate for the truth

with a wicked smile and a wicked song 
christopher mason lampoons the ladies and gents of the upper crust 
he sings about the foibles follies and fads of highpowered 
highsociety folk like ivana trump nancy reagan david 
rockefeller brooke astor and william paley and they love it 
in less than two years the spritelike 27yearold mason has 
gone from private party entertainer to budding cabaret star now 
hes appearing through may at the fabled oak room in the algonquin 
hotel where hes singing not only about people like mrs trump and 
her yacht and mrs reagan and her new life in california but about 
such topics as the water shortage and trash tv hes a combination 
of cole porter and tom lehrer with a bit of noel coward thrown in 
for good measure 
i write the words and the music i play the piano and sing 
mason explains so if the evening is terrible its all my 
fault 
it was never hard to get mason to perform he was born in 
england the son of an opera singer and a civil servant at the age 
of 3 he saw the sound of music came home sat down at the 
piano and played every song from the show with one finger 
i used to drive all of my piano teachers crazy because id be 
playing chopin or beethoven and id always think of what i thought 
was a nicer way of finishing a phrase he says recalling his 
precocious childhood 
at cambridge mason majored in english and art history but when 
he came to new york he worked long hours for little pay in public 
relations and fundraising but he got to observe the rich at close 
quarters he also got to attend parties lots of them 
when there was nothing left to revive a party i was thrown 
toward the piano to play and sing he says people said why 
dont you do this all the time 
he finally did his big break came last may when he was hired by 
fashion designer mario the prince of chintz buatta to play for 
a society dinner at the new york public library 
mason wrote five new songs for the occasion if you are 
burning with the love of learning write a check to the public 
library he crooned in his best fundraising voice but he also 
wrote songs about brooke astor and annette reed two of the biggest 
supporters of the library the ditties suggested that mrs astor 
change her first name from brooke to book and mrs reed spell her 
last name read 
mason was a big success and people began calling to ask if hed 
appear at their parties playing original songs 
i was terrified of asking for money he says im english 
so im terrible at dealing with money 
at first mason would immediately say yes to a job and then ask 
about the fee often it was less than 500 today he has an agent 
at william morris and his price for an evenings work can go as 
high as 3000 
he serenaded mrs trump last summer aboard the trump princess 
her husbands 30 million yacht 
mason writes during regular 9to5 office hours but finds 
pressure the best tonic for nonproductivity 
the idea of a deadline and a check at the end of it is 
irresistible for writing new songs he says 
some of his best songs have been born on airplanes and trains 
for the reopening of blair house in washington mason wrote a 
song about it on a cocktail napkin while he was flying from new 
york to the nations capital 
and for his algonquin engagement mason has written different 
types of songs 
god knows not everybody is interested in societys 
darlings he says so ive written a love song or two as well 
as one number about the former president called the reagans at 
home in bel air 
mason suddenly begins reciting 
the secret service is awfully nervous 
they cant think what to do 
they are meant to take care of the reagans 
but the reagans seem awfully blue 
they are finding it hard to adjust to being ordinary folk 
and the pressures not fair 
though their friends bought them quite a swell house 
its no fun being the reagans at home in bel air 
mason also is working on a musical called how to bag a 
billionaire a look at todays version of what used to be called 
golddiggers those women who want to marry for money and not 
necessarily love 
im selfishly writing the whole thing the book and songs but 
i wont be in it he says 
the show has been delayed while mason completes his algonquin 
engagement and he tries to juggle all his offers from the rich and 
the famous 
i find myself now invited to all the big parties the 
serious social parties which is a peculiar thing mason says 
i spend time with these people they must be aware that i am 
watching them every second to see how they are behaving maybe 
people think they are flirting with danger in a very acceptable way 
by having me around

claras heart warner home video vhsbeta 8995 rated 
pg13 
 
clara mayfield is a brutally direct woman who colors her human 
relationships with a good deal of common sense 
selfrighteousness and tenacity she also has an overwhelming 
humanity about her and that specialness attracts people to her 
like a magnet 
clara is a vibrant and rich role one that critics last year 
said could easily turn around whoopi goldbergs dismal film career 
after such losers as burglar jumpin jack flash and 
fatal beauty 
robert mulligan to kill a mockingbird inside daisy 
clover restrains goldberg in his direction of this family 
melodrama allowing none of the bits and business that have become 
the trademarks of her wealth of comic stage characters that 
restraint is essential to clara herself a jamaican with a dark 
secret 
clara enters the lives of the affluent hart family from 
marylands eastern shore shortly after the crib death of their 
daughter leona kathleen quinlan and bill michael ontkean have 
gone to jamaica to help get over the tragedy clara is their hotel 
maid 
she coaxes leona out of her depression and encourages her to get 
on with life leona decides to bring her back to maryland she 
cant quite function without claras island sensibilities but son 
david takes an immediate dislike to clara and accuses his parents 
rightfully so of bringing her home so they wont have to deal 
with him the harts are in the process of a divorce 
clara eventually wins over david to the point where hed rather 
spend his weekends in baltimore with clara and her west indian 
friends than with his parents he also picks up claras island 
patois 
but his dependency on clara ultimately leads to her dark 
revelation and it is here that the movie falters there is no 
buildup to this awful experience in her life and its unfolding is 
an abrupt twist and with the tale there remain loose ends 
letters hidden in a suitcase and found by david are never 
explained the father of claras child also is a mystery 
still claras heart is a warm movie with many lessons to 
tell if one is willing to listen its a movie that works better 
on the small screen than it did theatrically its force is aided by 
goldbergs performance and a noteworthy movie debut of neil patrick 
harris as david theres also a lilting score by dave grusin but 
once again hollywood fails in geography steel music and calypso 
are products of trinidad not jamaica

running on empty warner home video vhsbeta 8995 rated 
pg13 
 
what ever happened to all those weather people from the late 
1960s and early 70s all those revolutionaries who bombed 
government buildings and corporations with government contracts 
all those radicals who may have killed innocents in the name of 
freedom and liberty 
they went underground but underground is as ordinary as the 
family next door 
running on empty looks at such a family who have been 
wanted by the fbi for their part in a bombing in which a security 
guard was accidently killed the young couple made one mistake 
though not only did they take their young son danny with them as 
they fled they also conceived another child while underground 
harry 
cut to the 80s danny river phoenix is a 17yearold musical 
prodigy what to do if he stays with his parents as they want him 
to he must give up all ambitions in music and indeed give up his 
own destiny if he leaves them and heads for the juilliard school 
he will never be able to see them again unless they surrender to 
authorities 
there is much tenderness in this movie especially from 
christine lahti as the mother judd hirschs father seems somewhat 
outmoded in his 60s politics and 60s perceptions hes also a 
little selfish hes not a very likeable man until the end and 
resolution of the movie 
naomi foner has a tight and gripping screenplay and sidney 
lumets direction is powerful 
its a nice movie for the entire family because running on 
empty is ultimately about family

the great lawn columbia ross traut and steve rodby 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
that could be a typo in the title of the debut album by the 
quasijazz duo of electric guitarist ross traut and bassist steve 
rodby the great yawn would be more like it 
the record is appealing for its sparse texture but once the 
novelty of these simple instrumental arrangements wears off 
theres little to sustain a listeners attention 
the great lawn is most reminiscent of pat metheny traut 
and rodby have both played with him but traut isnt nearly as 
inventive a guitarist he rarely strays far from the melody 
and traut and rodby seem to be waiting for each other to take 
charge as a result the energy level peaks at about a two on a 
10point scale the most animated the duo gets is when rodby 
occasionally slaps his bass 
one wonders how much the label columbia had to do with the 
artists cautious approach to their debut the company hails the 
record as spanning many musical categories jazz new age pop 
rampb and beautiful with traut and rodby trying to please so 
many audiences its a wonder they were able to come up with any 
notes at all 
the great lawn is ok as background music but bring a book 
along

mr jordan atlantic julian lennon 
 
youre julian lennon and youve got two image problems to 
dispel 
one is that youre a wimp the other is you sound too much like 
your late father 
the surprising vigor of lennons third album mr jordan 
takes care of the first problem and the new deep voice lennon 
unveils handles the second 
but now he sounds like david bowie 
really its uncanny on the songs now youre in heaven and 
i want you to know how much lennon sounds like the lateperiod 
bowie sounding too much like someone else of course is never a 
good sign for a musician 
actually you should be glad youre not julian lennon hes not 
to be envied to be the son of such an icon and emerge with your 
head on straight is a victory in itself to follow in your dads 
footsteps and have at least nominal success is quite an achievement 
but lets face it julian lennon really should find another line 
of work lennon has no real style and precious little to say mr 
jordan proves only that he can surround himself with adept 
professionals and not be embarrassed 
one wonders if the louder guitars and harsher rhythms on mr 
jordan show lennons true inclinations as a rocker or his 
zeliglike response to those who said he should toughen his sound 
i get up with lively backup vocals is the best effort 
here but even on this song lennon sees fit to include an elvis 
presley impersonation whos next 
the more aggressive approach sounds better than the ponderous 
sweetness of lennons first two albums but only nominally and 
dont look to julian lennon for any sparkling originality

kevin costner clad in his customary costume 
of jeans tshirt sweater and dayold beard arrived late for an 
interview but presented a valid excuse he had been picking up tips 
on film directing from movie giant steven spielberg 
i need all the help i can get and who could be a better 
teacher remarked costner who starts directing himself in a film 
next july 
costners modest office at raleigh studios where he once worked 
as a laborer displays evidence of the new project on the walls 
are dozens of notepad pages detailing each scene of the film as 
yet untitled next he plans to storyboard an artists concept of 
each camera angle 
i need to have that backup he explained ill leave a 
window for new things to come in during filming i need to 
communicate to many people what im trying to do those ideas can 
be built upon 
costner gave no specifics on what he had learned from spielberg 
but said both men had been dancing around each other in search 
of a mutual project the only time i worked for steven was when i 
did an amazing stories for him the actor said referring to 
the old tv show 
three years ago costner was known mostly for playing the corpse 
in the big chill then came silverado the untouchables 
and no way out for his new film field of dreams he 
reportedly was paid 25 million so why take on the added labor of 
directing his next film 
i have to maintain interest in what im doing this particular 
subject generates a certain amount of interest for me when this 
project was born it was not on the surface a very commercial 
movie yet i believe its very commercial 
the theme of it is people who want to talk to each other but 
cant because of the language barrier between white settlers and 
indians its a period piece set in the 1860s this is not a movie 
to set the record straight or to reinvent what happened its just 
a theatrical piece but its more than that too theres a lot of 
action in it 
theres not much action in field of dreams a baseball 
fantasy which some critics have described as capraesque costner 
plays an iowa farmer who heeds a mystery voice and builds a 
baseball diamond in his cornfield soon the ghosts of the infamous 
chicago black sox team show up to play 
costner acknowledged that the script based on the novel 
shoeless joe by wp kinsella was a tough sell 
writerdirector phil alden robinson worked on it for six years 
before getting it made 
i didnt have to be convinced of it costner remarked the 
minute i read it i thought that i would want to do this movie 
why i dont know i make movies and you need to have 
subjects the amount of movies ill do in my life are numbered 
its a finite number as a script passes over me it has to reach 
me emotionally i dont care what genre it is comedy or action or 
something else those dont dictate what ill do but it just has 
to have a certain amount of poignancy 
field of dreams did it also had what im always looking 
for other strong strong characters so i knew that we would be 
able to attract good actors among them james earl jones burt 
lancaster amy madigan ray liotta 
costner was born in a los angeles suburb son of a power lineman 
who was partcherokee which helps explain his next project his 
fathers work required repeated moves and costner recalls of 
school i was always on the outside he studied marketing at 
california state university fullerton but also acted in a 
community theater 
after marrying his college sweetheart cindy silva a former 
snow white at disneyland kevin quit a marketing job to try 
hollywood he spent six years as a set worker at raleigh studios 
studying at night in acting workshops after his flashback scene 
was cut from the big chill lawrence kasdan cast him as the 
hellraising gunslinger in silverado he clicked immediately 
because he believes he should support all his films costner did 
the new york media whirl for field of dreams he readily admits 
that he doesnt enjoy it he is an extremely private man yet he 
doesnt dwell on his loss of privacy 
as many doors that close to you there are others that open 
up he reasoned i dont think anybody has been able to resolve 
the privacy issue you still see people who have a certain amount 
of fame and dont know how to deal with it 
theres no good answer for when something that is unique to an 
individual their privacy is taken away when you experience 
the loss of that its something youll never ever get back in your 
life theres no reason to cry or to pout 
its something ill never get back its like my daughter as 
she grows older shell never be a baby again you have to enjoy 
those times my son just started to walk we probably will not have 
any more children so there will never be another helpless 
helpless child that phase is gone 
the costners recently bought a getaway home in santa barbara 
but their main residence is not on the trendy west side but in la 
canada a few miles from the pasadena rose bowl 
we bought our first home in pasadena he said a lot of 
our friends are out there so we can keep those relationships up

down a dusty shell road and through 
a tangle of azalea blossoms and magnolia trees the little cottage 
stands quietly these days the tempest of walter andersons life is 
over only the beauty lives on he was an amazing man and i guess 
there were a lot who didnt understand him said his daughter 
mary pickard he had a sad life in so many ways but when i look 
at his work i think he must have reached his own peace i dont see 
how he could have been sad and done such happy work 
even here in his hometown where residents once demanded that 
one of his greatest works be painted over the eccentric artist has 
finally found favor 
pickard 51 who has been the curator of her fathers work for 
the last 11 years regularly leads visitors through the cottage 
psychiatrists psychologists environmentalists scientists and 
artists come to see the massive body of work anderson left behind 
it really pleases me that such a variety of people have become 
interested in his work pickard said 
after being hospitalized in 1937 for a nervous breakdown 
anderson left his wife and four children and lived alone in the 
threeroom cottage tucked away on the family compound in this 
sleepy gulf coast town 
his love of horn island an uninhabited barrier island 12 miles 
off shore led to an intense study of the plants and animals of the 
island that he recorded in his detailed logs paintings and 
drawings 
he felt that the artist had an obligation to call attention to 
the world around him as far back as the 1940s he felt that man and 
the world around him were going in opposite directions pickard 
said 
anderson was the first to notice that the eggs of the brown 
pelican were not hatching and to blame wastes from the mississippi 
river for it pickard said 
in the last 15 years of his life he spent most of his time 
alone on horn island rowing there in a wooden skiff which he would 
turn over and use for shelter to study the creatures of the gulf 
coast more carefully anderson would submerge himself up to his 
nose in the swamps and bayous around the area staying there for 
hours while snakes and alligators swam past him and birds and bugs 
flew over him 
it was not until his death at the age of 62 in 1965 that the 
full range and immensity of his work was discovered 
an avid reader he left behind at least 9000 illustrative 
drawings he had done 300 linoleum blocks from which he printed 
drawings he would then paint and sell for 1 per foot 
most of his wood sculptures have disappeared with time anderson 
left them in the woods around his cottage and they were destroyed 
by storms pickard said most of the furniture he designed and 
built has also been lost 
he also worked in ceramics textiles and did a number of oils 
but he has become best known for the small watercolors he did of 
the plants and animals of the gulf coast area 
the paintings elaborate in detail and rich in color were done 
on typing paper and the few he sold during his life went for no 
more than 25 pickard said today they sell for 3500 to 6000 
according to courtney blossman president of the friends of walter 
anderson a group that plans to break ground for a 12 million 
anderson museum in june 
the mural which he painted on the walls of the town community 
center which many residents wanted painted over will be the 
centerpiece of the museum blossman said 
its amazing but its true some people were very upset with 
the mural when he painted it blossman said it was appraised 
for 1 million 10 years ago im sure it would be much higher now 
the mural depicts the history of the area on one side of the 
building and what anderson saw as the seven seasons of the 
gulf coast on the other 
he charged the town 1 to paint it on the thennew structure in 
1950 and worked on it for two years 
ive heard he was never paid the dollar he asked said 
pickard people treated him terribly over it he always said it 
wasnt finished he quit working on it because people would come at 
all hours and bother him make fun of it and talk about it

as the bassist and songwriting partner of george 
michael deon estus is used to playing to capacity crowds but the 
detroit native has also learned to appreciate an empty arena 
estus who now has a hit single of his own with heaven help 
me likes to arrive early for the evenings concert so he can 
pursue his favorite hobby frisbee 
on the road i carry about 40 frisbees with kneepads and 
gloves he said as they set up the equipment before the show 
either in the stadium or outside the arena there are no people 
around when we played the orange bowl in florida we had a ball 
everybody joined in 
between playing for one of the worlds most successful recording 
artists and making his debut solo album spell estus has 
needed to stay in shape he is already at work on another record 
and will collaborate with michael on the singers next project a 
double lp 
we understand each other said estus who referred to the 
singer as his best friend we get along we go out and have 
dinner its very easy to sit down and come up with a song we just 
sit down and write good music hes very professional and so am i 
hes not in competition with me 
estus whose parents both hold graduate degrees in music had 
any number of instruments to chose from as a child remembering the 
drums bass guitars and piano his father brought home he quickly 
mastered them all but admitted to having no such luck playing the 
saxophone 
i got rid of it eventually estus said it just used to 
kill me it just wasnt for me it sounded like people when they 
screech chalk on the blackboard 
estus settled on the bass and was playing professionally by age 
12 
i used to play house parties in the summer and got 20 bucks 
each time that was a lot of dough 
detroit in the 1960s was home to the motown record label and 
estus took full advantage of the local talent he became friends 
with marvin gaye but turned down the opportunity to play on the 
late singers last album midnight love released in 1982 
that was a time when i was busy recording i didnt have any 
idea hed be leaving us so fast said estus referring to gayes 
murder in 1984 i thought id see him again everybody had 
troubles but i didnt sense that anything like that would happen 
estus referred to motown bassist james jamerson as my 
teacher jamerson who died in 1983 was instrumental to the 
motown sound creating memorable bass lines on such hits as reach 
out ill be there and aint no mountain high enough 
hes the man who brought syncopation to the bass estus 
said my cherie amour listen to the bass parts on that he was 
a mindblower i just never heard bass put like that the 
expression when you listen to records today you hear his 
influence 
estus first band was brainstorm which toured in support of 
the whispers and the brothers johnson among other groups he moved 
to europe in the early 80s and lived in belgium and ireland 
before eventually settling in london his current home 
i think ive been influenced by everywhere ive been estus 
said 
dublin for instance when i first worked there id listen to 
these local bands the harmonies were really tricky i was 
listening to this rhythm and thought this was the thing closest to 
black music id heard i learned a great deal from it 
estus was the silent partner of wham the british band that 
featured michael and andrew ridgeley and had hits in the mid80s 
with careless whisper and im your man 
after wham broke up estus stayed with michael working on the 
singers bestselling faith lp he found time however to 
record spell and served as michaels opening act on the world 
tour 
heaven help me which features michael on backing vocals is 
a catchy midtempo ballad but estus rated the title song of 
spell as his favorite 
i got a chance to produce it and i like the orchestration 
its a fun song a strong song some songs on spell are more 
danceable than others some are poppy some are soulful 
he appeared unconcerned that having a hit record of his own 
could jeopardize the partnership with michael 
if i had a no 1 album and he had a no 3 album and he asked 
me to open for him i would say yes if this album sold 2 or 3 
million i would still play with him its just dealing with egos

we know virginia woolf the writer who gave us 
such groundbreaking novels as to the lighthouse mrs 
dalloway and the waves 
we know virginia woolf the feminist who wrote the influential 
essay a room of ones own and virginia woolf the pacifist who 
created thoughts on peace in an air raid 
we know virginia woolf the diarist who logged the minutiae of 
her tortured life and virginia woolf the suicide who put a heavy 
stone in her pocket and waded into the river ouse 
but until now we have known very little about the virginia woolf 
who was sexually abused throughout her youth a noted woolf 
scholar louise desalvo provides us with the first complete 
portrait of that woman in virginia woolf the impact of childhood 
sexual abuse on her life and work beacon press 2295 
that woolf had been abused was no secret she talked about it 
in speeches letters conversations and memoirs but previous 
biographers have virtually ignored its impact on her life treating 
it as an aberration in an otherwise happy victorian household or 
perhaps even a hallucination of her madness 
desalvo a professor of english at hunter college of the city 
university of new york is the first academician to thoroughly 
examine the abuse in light of modernday research on incest 
survivors 
its not as if it was hidden as a topic in any of the 
biographies that have come before desalvo said in a recent 
interview at her hunter office but the major change is that in 
the last 10 years the work on incest and child abuse as a field has 
been so monumental that it enabled someone like me to use that work 
and to read her life in the context of what we now know the effect 
of incest and child abuse are 
a brief outline of virginia woolfs family and the abuse 
suffered based on woolfs diaries letters and recorded 
conversations with others 
julia duckworth and sir leslie stephen virginia woolfs 
parents had each been married before they wed in 1878 gerald 
stella and george duckworth were children of julias previous 
marriage laura stephen was a child of sir leslies first marriage 
julia and leslie stephen had four children together vanessa 
thoby virginia and adrian 
woolfs mother died when she was 13 and about that time her 
stepbrother george 14 years her senior began sexually molesting 
her and her sister vanessa the abuse continued until woolf was in 
her early 20s and stopped only when she had a nervous breakdown 
after her father died and the household was broken up stella 
woolfs stepsister who took over the running of the household 
after their mothers death may have become her stepfathers lover 
after his wife died 
late in her life woolf in a period of intense selfanalysis 
while writing her autobiography suddenly remembered an incident 
that had apparently been repressed of being molested by her other 
stepbrother gerald when she was 6 in which he broke her hymen 
desalvo thinks woolf was devastated by the realization that the 
abuse began far earlier than she had believed 
there is plenty of other evidence of the household as a 
dysfunctional family woolf had an erotic relationship with her 
sister vanessa that lasted into their 20s woolfs stepsister 
laura whom the family considered mentally deficient was locked up 
in a distant room in the house for years before being trundled off 
to an asylum woolfs brother thoby threw himself out of a window 
when he was 15 woolf had an affair with vanessas first husband 
after her divorce vanessa took up with the homosexual lover of her 
brother adrian the list of family entanglements goes on and on 
and continues into the next generation 
desalvo reread everything that woolf wrote every novel diary 
letter essay and fragment that has been preserved in the united 
states and great britain and isolated every reference to woolfs 
childhood or her fictional depictions of children 
it was when i did that that it was all thrown into stark 
relief and i saw what she was trying to say said desalvo 
once she learned how incest survivors talk about their 
experiences desalvo said woolfs sometimes puzzling language 
suddenly made sense in a letter to vanessas husband for example 
woolf writes almost flippantly about the sexual abuse the two 
suffered desalvo said that is an example of inappropriate 
response that victims of incest often use as a defense mechanism 
the key to my own beginning to be able to figure it out was 
learning what the language of incest survivors is learning the 
verbal strategies how survivors of incest tend to create inflated 
pictures of their parents 
i couldnt figure out for example for the longest time why 
woolf wrote these revered portraits of her father if you take them 
straight thats one thing but if you read how incest survivers 
typically talk about the family constellation it makes an enormous 
amount of sense 
one of the points desalvo makes in her book is that some of the 
symptoms of the bouts of madness woolf suffered throughout her 
life depression nervousness irritability tantrums are likely 
responses to the sexual abuse rather than the congenital condition 
it is often treated as 
desalvo was asked whether she ever thought woolf with her 
history of instability was perhaps an unreliable narrator the 
memory of the abuse by gerald when she was 6 for example did not 
surface until woolf was in her 50s can her memory be trusted 
one of the biggest issues that always comes up in incestuous 
abuse is the extent to which people falsify memories the paradigm 
used to be freudian the theory that patients reports of sexual 
abuse were figments of their imaginations and based on desire 
all the recent work that has been done on incest survivors suggest 
rather the opposite that any memories are authentic and the 
reason experts say this is that it is so disastrous even today to 
be labeled an incest survivor that no one would falsify that 
desalvo is the editor of melymbrosia an early version of 
woolfs novel the voyage out which she constructed from 
manuscripts and coeditor with mitchell leaska of vita 
sackvillewests letters to virginia woolf she has also written 
a book on nathaniel hawthorne 
desalvos new book as disturbing as the subject matter is 
should be heralded for both its painstakingly thorough research and 
the delicate and fair handling of such a sensitive subject this is 
a scholarly not a titillating work at the same time it is 
enormously readable and imbued with the fascination and admiration 
that desalvo has for one of the greatest writers of this century

entertainer barbara mandrell curtailed 
her career as she recovered from the physical and emotional 
injuries of an automobile accident she also tried to forget the 
tragedy which claimed the life of a young man 
now though shes revived those memories in her upcoming 
autobiography for bantam books never say never 
until this book i have never shared these things except with 
my neurosurgeon and my attorney the 40yearold singer said in 
an interview 
other than this book i have kind of reached a point where im 
tired of being asked about it i chose to forget it but the 
tragedy was part of my life and i had to put it in in order for 
people to know me i felt i must tell the down side the chapter on 
the crash was very difficult to do 
mandrell was involved in a twocar collision north of nashville 
on sept 11 1984 she suffered a concussion and fractures to her 
leg and ankle her two children also were hurt but not seriously 
however the driver of the other car a 19yearold college 
student died 
the book is being written with author george vecsey who helped 
country queen loretta lynn write her coal miners daughter 
finishing the autobiography is just one of a multitude of 
projects for the singer whos been a recording artist for 20 years 
her second gospel album precious memories has just been 
released her las vegasstyle show regarded as one of the best 
among country musicoriented performers is undergoing its annual 
finetuning she has had one weeklong stint performing in las 
vegas this year and has two more scheduled 
my throat wont take more than a week at a time she said 
and she is selecting songs for another country album due out in 
the fall 
im working a lot more this year she said i told my 
agent that except for january and july to book me three days a 
month but some of those three days turned into a week 
shes rarely been off the tv screen since her network variety 
show that began in 1980 and lasted two seasons barbara mandrell 
and the mandrell sisters shes done a half dozen specials with 
comedian bob hope including his most recent one in march and 
shes been in countless other tv specials ranging from appearances 
with former president and mrs reagan to one celebrating the 
special olympics 
i just said no to two more recently she said 
one of them was to be taped during a week she and her family had 
set aside for camping 
my priorities were to be a mommy and wife that week she 
said 
her gospel album is a followup to her previous gospeloriented 
he set my life to music which won a grammy award in 1983 the 
new one includes such gospel standards as peace in the valley 
old rugged cross just a closer walk with thee and i love 
to tell the story 
it was hard to narrow it down to the 20 we picked mandrell 
said i had the best time doing this album for any christian 
especially one who sings for a living the feeling is very special 
these are songs that i feel are mine and you feel are yours 
they belong to each of us we grew up singing them i had so many 
memories as i recorded them of singing them in church or singing 
along to the radio 
this was a nice unexpected pleasure now ill have these on 
record for the rest of my life when im gone my children and 
grandchildren will have them 
she has a persistent passion for another hit record to join her 
others i was country when country wasnt cool married 
but not to each other only a lonely heart knows sleeping 
single in a double bed and if loving you is wrong i dont want 
to be right 
its a neverending desire my biggest goal is to stay close 
enough in tune with what the public wants in order to earn the 
career they are giving me ive never been satisfied with me i 
always want to be better and i pray i never lose that desire 
were chomping at the bit to make my show better i compete 
with me

scientists at the worlds busiest aids 
testing laboratory face not only blood samples contaminated with a 
deadly disease but peeling paint exploding lightbulbs and a sink 
with no drain 
theres even a sign on the elevator warning not to use it it 
gets stuck 
new york a leader in aids testing and research in this country 
largely because it has more aids patients than any other state 
does most of this key scientific work in a laboratory built in 1917 
potholes line the driveway leading to the threestory brick 
building where gleaming computers sit alongside equipment rusted 
with age exposed wires run along walls and paint peels from the 
ceiling 
its kind of ironic said colleen flood a bacteriologist 
who runs the program that tests newborns for presence of the 
aidsrelated human immunovirus hiv were down here doing work 
thats at the forefront when people come in here they say 
how can you work in such a dilapidated lab 
flood and her colleagues have learned to adjust to a job that 
brings with it certain measures of pride and indignity they took 
the job partly because it is more exciting than routine lab work 
but they deal with a disease that still comes with a taint and work 
in conditions that cant match private labs 
virtually any testing needed to combat a public health emergency 
in new york eventually finds its way to the new scotland avenue 
laboratory here said donald berns director of the health 
department division of clinical sciences 
when medical waste began washing up on beaches last summer it 
was bagged and sent to berns for examination when there was an 
outbreak of salmonella in eggs they were brought to new scotland 
avenue 
aids is overwhelmingly the states most pressing health 
epidemic it had 20476 confirmed cases by the end of 1988 
onefourth the national total and some 300000 new yorkers are 
thought to be infected with the related hiv virus a possible 
precursor of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
the state conducts nearly 750000 aidsrelated tests a year 
here including a halfmillion hiv tests thats more than any 
other laboratory anywhere berns said the military conducts more 
than 600000 hiv tests a year at a miami lab 
hundreds of blood vials a day are delivered by mail to the 
laboratory where theyre placed in a black bin for sorting each 
vial is assigned a number and information about the test subject is 
typed into a computer of the 138 laboratory employees 20 deal 
exclusively with aids testing 
five white freezers hum in one of many small rooms each 
contains 20000 blood serum samples part of the states research 
stockpile each sample taken since the beginning of the aids 
epidemic is kept here as a ready resource for tests done on the 
disease 
the freezers stand next to a rusted sink covered with a 
cardboard sign do not use sink no drain 
its one of dozens of little reminders of the buildings 
limitations the elevators were installed before the roaring 20s 
the ovens where glass was made for test tubes and beakers have been 
dormant for years so outdated the equipment isnt safe said russ 
toombs the labs operations director 
mold sometimes grows on the ceilings said researcher diana 
schoonmaker lights occasionally flicker and bulbs have exploded 
during power surges 
schoonmaker was one of 15 workers who tested positive in 1983 
for exposure to tuberculosis one of many viruses tested there 
each worker was treated with antibiotics for a year and none 
developed the disease but it scared them 
its frustrating to me berns said of the building its a 
real problem to have to deal with this but the quality of the 
people make up for a lot of the problems you have 
flood 28 said her fiance a high school teacher didnt want 
her to take the lab job because of fears about the aids virus 
neither did her parents 
after a while they figured that i was intelligent enough to 
know that if there was any risk involved then i wouldnt take it 
she said 
rosalyn moore who also tests blood samples for aids said she 
thinks twice about telling acquaintances what she does usually she 
just tells them she works in a laboratory without going into 
specifics 
the employees are strict about wearing rubber gloves and white 
coats and say they dont worry too much about the danger but like 
their superiors theyd like a better place to work 
with new york state and all its wealth it seems they could 
provide a little better working atmosphere said mike neal a 
bacteriologist 
theres never been an accident involving the aids virus berns 
said the hiv virus is not a hardy virus and quickly dies when 
exposed to air 
he wouldnt characterize the building as dangerous but i also 
would be dishonest if i didnt say the potential for accidents is 
far higher here 
modern laboratories are sealed so germs cant escape from floor 
to floor new scotlands ventilation system is less modern 
windows are opened often in the winter because of inconsistent 
heating and its believed this contributed to the tb virus 
exposure six years ago berns said 
gov mario cuomo has called the lab obsolete deteriorating 
and incapable of meeting modern federal standards for biosafety 
and asked the legislature for 75 million to rebuild it and six 
other buildings all built before 1949 
few people dispute that the building needs to be replaced 
its just a question of staying with it said state sen joseph 
bruno who sponsored legislation to appropriate the money the bill 
is still pending 
designs have already been drawn up for the new lab theyre 
outside berns office awaiting the governmental goahead but 
money is tight in new york this year with cuomo saying he had to 
deal with a potential 26 billion deficit as he prepared a budget 
proposal for the fiscal year that began april 1 
you stretch a rubber band as far as you can berns said 
this rubber band has been stretched to the point of breaking

a fighter plane that combines longrange 
supersonic cruise capability with a greatly enhanced ability to 
dogfight at and above the speed of sound has long been an elusive 
dream of aircraft designers 
after 5 years of research the solution to that engineering 
enigma may be near at nasas langley research center where 
aeronautical visionaries believe they have seen the future in 
something called the vortex flap 
the flap with a distinctive sharp downward angle is designed 
to improve the agility of sweptwing jets highly swept wings 
assure the speed needed for sustained supersonic flight but 
unswept wings are preferable for the lift necessary for combat 
maneuvers and short takeoffs and landings 
the vortex flap would give you the best of both worlds said 
ronald h smith a 30year veteran of the national aeronautics and 
space administration who is flight project engineer for the vortex 
flap experiment 
the acute deflection of the wings leading edge purposely 
detaches the airflow over the wing and forms a tornadolike vortex 
on the flap this creates a suction that reduces drag the force 
that resists an objects movement through the air during 
highspeed maneuvering 
this is a way to allow sweptwing airplanes to maneuver 
better said smith who has worked on x15 rocket planes the 
yf12 interceptor from which the sr71 blackbird reconnaissance 
plane was derived and the fa18 fighter 
with the vortex flap maneuverability would be significantly 
increased at speeds of 8 to 12 mach where most dogfighting is 
done he said flight tests with a deltawing f106b test aircraft 
have found the greatest reduction of drag 20 percent to 30 
percent at 9 mach 
with reduced drag a plane would need less thrust the payoff 
would be a smaller lighter engine and a plane that could faster 
and farther on less fuel such planes would not require 
afterburners needed by todays fighters to reach and maintain 
supersonic flight but which guzzle fuel 
fighters today concentrate on maneuvering smith said 
they are not aerodynamically efficient in supersonic speeds and 
dont have appreciable supersonic endurance 
he said the vortex flap could be used on the navys f14 fighter 
and the air forces f111 and b1 bombers which have wings that 
can be swept back it could not be used on the more conventional 
f15 f16 and fa18 fighters 
another application would be on sweptwing supersonic transports 
like the frenchbritish concorde or the american sst project that 
was canceled in 1971 because of its cost and noise smith said 
that isnt our main focus but it would benefit from our research 
the vortex flap would translate into noise reduction because of 
smaller engines and lack of afterburners he said 
nasa research pilot philip w brown said the first flight of the 
f106b with the vortex flap last aug 2 was about what he expected 
i was thinking it probably would be reasonably wellbehaved 
because we had done highspeed taxi tests it turned out it was 
better than predicted the simulator was a lot harder to fly 
said brown a former navy fighter pilot 
some flight stability was lost by adding the flap to the f106b 
a 1960s vintage fighter but the plane is only slightly more 
demanding to fly than without the flap he said 
flight testing will continue for another 1 years it follows 
five years of study encompassing nearly 3000 hours of wind tunnel 
tests 
a fighter with supersonic endurance and transsonic maneuvering 
ability would have a clear edge said nasa engineer james b 
hallissy the principal investigator of the flap it would be 
able to get to a target faster and the enemy would have less 
response time 
if you can fly faster than the other guy you can catch him if 
hes running from you and he cant catch you the more speed you 
can sustain the better off you are

doug ubelaker used to examine 
skeletons for clues to the way people lived thousands of years ago 
now hes trying to figure out from bodies found along highways how 
eight women died just months ago 
using calipers to measure bones and clay to reconstruct faces 
the smithsonian institution anthropologist brought here by a 
frustrated prosecutor has helped identify the victims women 
between ages 25 and 36 with histories of drug use or prostitution 
a ninth body was sent to ubelaker last week 
his work has not led to the arrest of a suspected serial killer 
but he may have cleared an innocent man sources close to the 
investigation say his conclusion that two of the women were 
murdered between midsummer and late fall led prosecutors to rule 
out a suspect who had been in jail on other charges 
an expert in the emerging field of forensic anthropology 
ubelaker 42 is one of about 40 us anthropologists who work 
regularly with police applying knowledge of ancient skeletons to 
the grisly business of solving murders 
anthropologists like myself spend their careers looking at the 
bones of people who lived long ago trying to figure out what 
diseases they had how tall they were who they were related to 
what problems they had how well they were adapted to their 
environment he said it turns out though that the techniques 
that we use to study these past populations are the same as those 
needed to analyze modern remains in criminal cases 
few anthropologists are willing to make the switch from cold 
science to cold blood which takes tremendous intestinal 
fortitude as well as keen observational skills said walter h 
birkby a professor of forensic anthropology at the university of 
arizona in tucson 
birkby a pioneer in the field got hooked when police found a 
decomposed body and took it to a university of kansas laboratory in 
1962 at first he was repulsed by the body which was so ripe 
the officers couldnt put it in their car they wrapped it in a 
plastic bag and tied it to the bumper 
he and other graduate students boiled the remains to the bone 
carefully measured the skeleton and concluded it was a young 
woman who had apparently been murdered birkby doesnt remember if 
the killer was caught he does recall thinking this is real 
detective work 
in cases in which a body is found mostly intact police usually 
call in a forensic pathologist a physician trained in 
crimesolving techniques but if the body has decomposed and little 
is left but a skeleton they increasingly turn to someone with a 
doctorate in physical anthropology 
other people may be better with flesh but when it comes to 
bones were the experts said professor alison galloway a 
forensic anthropologist at the university of tennessee at knoxville 
forensic anthropologists can measure the width of pelvic bones 
to determine sex use microscopic pieces of a thigh bone to 
calculate age and make a clay model of a face based on the shape 
of the skull 
dental records still are one of the surest ways to identify a 
body but they often are not available so birkby and others 
developed skullphoto superimposition in which they project a 
photograph of a missing person onto a skull to see whether it fits 
although many americans have mixed blood galloway said it 
often is possible to determine race black white or asian from 
the shape of the skull teeth and leg bones blacks for example 
tend to have projecting jaw bones and ridges above the eyes whites 
have receding cheek bones and narrow noses and asians have 
shovelshaped incisors and more curved leg bones 
a careful examination of a skeleton often reveals not only the 
type of murder weapon but also its precise characteristics in a 
previous massachusetts case ubelaker told police he was nearly 
certain from some oddly chipped rib bones that a young woman had 
been killed by a longbladed knife with a bent tip a knife 
matching that description was later found near the murder scene 
calculating when a person died is often trickier involving 
rough estimates of the rate of decay based on the bodys location 
and exposure to moisture sun and animals galloway said 
in about 15 percent of the cases referred to him by the fbi 
ubelaker said the remains arent even human they are bones from 
dogs or deer oddly melted pieces of plastic or something else

marine researchers hoping to boost oyster 
production in the gulf of mexico are experimenting with reefs of 
coal ash and cement 
oyster fishermen used to dump the shells back into the water 
providing a nice hard bed that the oysters could anchor to but 
they since discovered there was a market for the shells in 
roadbuilding and calcium supplements 
if the baby oyster falls on something hard then he attaches 
to it and forms a shell if he fall on the mud bottom then he 
dies said mississippi power co spokesman john hutchinson 
the utility which has a steady supply of ash is working with 
mississippi state university and state agencies on an aggregate of 
ash and cement mixed and molded into baseballsized pellets 
clusters of pellets form the reefs adult oysters were put into 
four ponds with artificial reefs several weeks ago 
results may not come for a year the time it takes for oysters 
to mature 
but in a study in delaware we saw no difference in mortality 
in oyster growth or ash and concrete versus oyster growth on clam 
shells said kent price associate dean of marine studies at the 
university of delaware 
preliminary figures also indicate the artificial beds could be 
cheaper than buying clam shells which are dredged from lakes 
pontchartrain and maurepas in louisiana a practice decried by 
environmentalists mississippi 150000 last year putting clam 
shells in the gulf and 12500 on oyster shells price said 
researchers expect the aggregate to cost 9 to 10 per ton 
compared with 15 a ton for shells hutchinson said if we cant 
beat the price of the clam shells then weve priced ourselves out 
of the market

researchers will be looking for 5000 
older recruits for a 20 million fouryear study of the causes of 
heart disease and strokes blamed for more than half the deaths of 
people aged 65 and older 
the johns hopkins university researchers funded by the national 
institutes of health will be recruiting people 65 and older in 
washington county md forsyth county nc allegheny county 
pa and sacramento county calif 
its only recently that we understand that getting older 
doesnt have to be associated with these diseases said dr linda 
fried who will lead the study there is room to prevent these 
diseases and enhance the health of older adults that is really 
what the goal of this study is 
the four sites were chosen because they had a stable population 
of people ages 65 and over and had enough trained medical 
personnel to do the tests said dr teri manolio of the national 
heart lung and blood institute 
participants will be given a physical and asked about their 
eating and health habits and medical and reproductive history 
researchers will measure heartbeats breathing blood sugar and 
cholesterol and will determine whether there is any narrowing of 
arteries linking the heart and brain participants will be 
contacted every six months by telephone and in person after three 
years they will be asked to have a followup examination 
fried said initial test results would be compiled within two 
years final research results are expected to be released in four 
years

money may not buy happiness but a study 
suggests that it certainly can reduce stress 
sheldon cohen a psychology professor at carnegie mellon 
university analyzed the results of a louis harris and associates 
inc telephone survey of 960 men and 1427 women aged 18 or older 
the harris pollsters used a perceived stress scale developed by 
cohen and colleagues 
they found that stress tends to decrease as age and household 
income increase cohen said theres a nice relationship between 
income and stress level generally the lower your income the 
higher your stress level the more money you make the less stress 
you report the people who seem to be best off are in the 45000 
to 50000 a year range 
cohens scale measures how much stress people feel based on 
their answers to multiple choice questions about how often they 
experience certain thoughts and feelings one key question asks 
in the last month how often have you felt difficulties were 
piling up so high that you could not overcome them 
the scale makes some assumptions about what stress really 
is cohen said stress is when youre overloaded and you feel 
you cant deal with the demands in your life what you think and 
feel is really what matters 
harris used cohens scale to conduct the survey for the us 
office of disease prevention and health promotion in 1983 harris 
gave cohen acess to the data about two years later and he analyzed 
the results for nearly three years 
he found that women tend to feel more stress than men 
professionals and managers report less stress than bluecollar 
workers the more educated people are the less stress they report 
white people report less stress than blacks people who are married 
or living with a mate and those whose spouse died are less stressed 
than those who are single divorced or separated 
those who reported more stress in the study also reported more 
symptoms of illness and went to the doctor and smoked more often 
cohen said married people tended to be healthier than nonmarried 
people

the government said its chief economic 
forecasting gauge took a 07 percent nosedive in march marking the 
first backtoback declines in more than a year in a portent of 
progressive weakening in the economy 
analysts said the performance thus far of the index of leading 
economic indicators is another sign that the economy is losing 
steam and that the slowdown will become more pronounced later this

a number of religious groups are creating their 
own versions of the yellow pages telephone directories that exclude 
business owners who dont belong to the faith arousing complaints 
of discrimination 
the christian pages for example looks like a slimmer version 
of the commercial advertising directories published by the regional 
phone companies and other publishers it follows the usual format 
of yellow newsprint and blackandred type 
the christian pages directory is designed to assist bornagain 
christians in locating members of the body of christ should you 
desire to do business with one another the guides introduction 
says 
the welcome invokes galatians 610 a new testament verse that 
reads as we therefore have opportunity let us do good unto all 
men especially those who are of the household of faith 
theres definitely a demand and a need for it said bob 
hover who has published the 75000circulation phone book for 300 
michigan churches since 1980 for me this is a ministry its a 
way for me to serve the lord and be a blessing to the christian 
community 
advertisers are required to sign a statement of faith in christ 
hover said business owners professing other faiths are refused 
space 
anybody whos truly a christian obviously has very high 
standards he said adding that recent scandals involving 
evangelists havent hurt business theres an advantage to doing 
business with a person who truly believes 
but others see such directories as a way of shutting out those 
who arent seen as believers 
theres no doubt that anything thats an exclusive listing is 
divisive to the public said elliot wright senior vice president 
for programs at the national conference of christians and jews in 
new york i happen to be a methodist and we put out a catalogue 
but its stuff that methodist churches need 
other than those kinds of approaches our position is its 
just not a neighborly thing to do 
the antidefamation league of bnai brith views hovers work 
more as a curse than a blessing said jill kahn assistant legal 
affairs director at the jewish groups washington dc 
headquarters 
we think that simply by advertising in that grouping theyre 
sending a very powerful buy christian message and that we find 
unacceptable she said 
a christian directory in los angeles went bankrupt in 1977 after 
a judge awarded damages to two jewish businessmen who sued after 
being denied advertising space kahn said 
that guide violated californias civil rights act which bans 
religiousbased trade conspiracies kahn said michigan and most 
other states lack such specific laws she said 
owners of some jewish business directories have been warned 
against overstepping their bounds kahn said most advertise only 
items used in religious observances 
richard lobenthal the antidefamation leagues michigan 
director said he objects to an innuendo in this sort of 
advertising that nobody is honest or reputable unless they are 
bornagain christians 
some of the solicitations are absurd lobenthal said no 
ones ever been able to persuade me that theres anything religious 
about a tuneup 
the national council of churches hasnt grappled with the issue 
of religious business directories said carol fouke a spokeswoman 
for the new yorkbased group 
baltimorebased shepherds guide which publishes christian 
directories from maine to florida is the christian pages latest 
competition in the battle for believers profits 
other religious organizations target buyers instead of sellers 
michiganbased christian consumers association promises its 14000 
members christian buying power 
churches and families pay 586 for a 20year membership 
president jerry amster said in exchange the organization hunts 
for the lowest price on everything from mattresses to marriage 
counseling 
as a group we can negotiate better prices amster said i 
think its very demeaning for a minister to go into a furniture 
showroom and haggle 
in 1988 the group served as a gobetween for more than 6 
million worth of transactions he said 
were treated differently amster said its not because 
were christians its because we spend 6 million a year

us companies appropriations for spending on 
new plant and equipment rose 33 percent in the last quarter of 1988 
from the third quarter the conference board said in a report for 
release today 
the budget authorizations rose to 537 billion in the fourth 
quarter from 403 billion in the preceding quarter and 308 
billion in the fourth quarter of 1987 the businesssupported 
research organization said 
appropriations are considered a good indicator of how high 
capital spending will be they are the first step preceding the 
ordering of equipment the letting of construction contracts and 
actual spending 
the petroleum industry led all sectors with a 157 percent 
increase in appropriations from the preceding quarter 
the best guess is that business investment this year will very 
sharply outpace the overall growth in the economy ken goldstein

the nations economy continued to grown in april 
at a somewhat faster pace than in march but at about the same rate 
as in the first quarter the nations purchasing managers said in a 
report for release today 
the levels of production and new orders both registered 
increases last month after posting declines in the rate of growth 
in march according to the national association of purchasing 
management 
inventory buying did not fuel the pace of the growth as 
inventories declined for the fourth consecutive month said the 
group based in tempe ariz 
new export orders increased at the highest rate since december 
after registering three consecutive months of lower rates of 
growth of the 67 percent of the members who said they export 28 
percent reported better export orders in april up sharply from 22 
percent in both february and march 
the 4 percent who reported lower export orders is down sharply 
from the 9 percent who said so in march 
the economy entered the second quarter on a higher note than 
it ended the first quarter said robert j bretz chairman of the 
industry group 
a surprising increase in new export orders appears to have 
fueled the brisk rebound from marchs sharply lower growth 
nevertheless most other indicators signal a moderate rate of 
growth in the economy in the months ahead he said in a statement 
the groups purchasing managers index climbed to 53 percent in 
april a healthy increase from 504 percent in march this was the 
33rd consecutive month this leading indicator registered over 50 
percent a reading above 50 percent indicates the economy is 
generally expanding below 50 the economy is generally contracting 
bretz said the index averaged 524 percent in the first four 
months of 1989 if that average continues the rest of the year it 
would be consistent with real rate of growth in gross national 
product of about 25 percent he said

two dots converge on a computer screen in the 
cockpit and a voice warns climb climb in a mandatory 
anticollision system planned for the nations airliners 
the little round computer screen to be added to airliner 
cockpits with its pingpongball images and its limited 
vocabulary may not look like much to a generation numbed by 
nintendo computer games 
but tcasii is the latest acronym in aviation safety 
at more than 100000 each the second generation of the traffic 
alert collision avoidance system is also the latest pricey option 
for the corporate jet 
the system allows pilots to see the proximity of up to 30 
aircraft around them warns verbally when one gets too close and 
even announces in a computer voice exactly what the pilots should 
do to avoid a collision climb climb or descend descend 
the collision avoidance system operates independently of 
groundbased air traffic control operations and would serve as a 
backup to warn pilots of any problem that might be missed by the 
controller 
attention has been focused on possible midair collisions 
recently with nine operational errors involving closeflying 
aircraft handled by a major southern california facility which 
brought national transportation safety board warnings last week and 
reports of two near misses by airliners flying over new york 
only the smallest planes with no radar beacons to show their 
location would be invisible to the new system 
in a recent demonstration in the skies over northern virginia a 
sabreliner 65 piloted by tommy littlejohn flight operations 
director for tcas manufacturer bendixking came within a quarter 
mile horizontally and 600 feet vertically of an oncoming beechcraft 
baron that was part of the demonstration 
passengers inside the plane saw the baron flash by after 
littlejohn followed the voice command and climbed several hundred 
feet for a safe separation 
once you fly with it you dont want to fly without it said 
m ace card bendixking program manager for tcas who was aboard 
the sabreliner 
systems built by honeywell inc tested successfully in two 
northwest airlines planes according to pilot robert g buley 
for the most part the results turned out to be more than 
acceptable to the crews that will have to use the system day to 
day buley said in a report for a trade publication 
congress has required installation of tcasii in all us 
airliners built to carry more than 30 passengers by the end of 1991 
rep ron packard rcalif introduced a bill last week to phase 
in the installation starting with 25 percent of each airlines 
fleet by the end of 1990 50 percent a year later and the rest by 
the end of 1993 it would order the federal aviation administration 
to analyze operation of the system in the first year in case any 
changes are needed 
but airline industry officials say they need at least until the 
end of 1994 to install the systems in 4500 domestic airliners 
more than 1200 foreign airliners that fly us skies also would be 
required to have the anticollision device 
the timetables too tight said tim neale spokesman for the 
air transport association which represents the airline industry 
weve got so much going on that the airlines dont feel they can 
get all the planes done in that time without tremendous disruptions 
in service 
he noted pending requirements to replace parts on aging 
airliners a law that orders installation of equipment to warn 
against strong wind changes around airports increases in air 
travel and a limited number of airline mechanics to do the work 
we think you need to crawl before you can run neale said 
adding that no test of the system has determined what will happen 
when large numbers of airliners all with the units filling their 
cockpits with a chorus of traffic advisories are flying in the 
same area you might get a domino effect he said 
neale said the airlines support the idea of phasing in the 
systems and having a oneyear test period but he said they would 
oppose the bill which is to be the subject of a congressional 
hearing on thursday if it requires full installation by the end of 
1993 
carriers have begun placing orders for the anticollision system 
with three manufacturers competing in a potentially 700 million 
market alliedsignal aerospace cos bendixking air transport 
avionics division the air transport systems division of honeywell 
inc and the collins divisions of rockwell international 
new orders are expected to be announced within the next few 
days according to industry sources 
the tcasii system consists of a sophisticated transponder that 
has already been installed on some aircraft antennae and a 
computer that analyzes and displays the movement of nearby planes 
the transponder sends out a signal to other aircraft as well as 
ground controllers 
the system has no bugs said don dodgen of honeywell 
if two computers meet he said orders to the pilots will be 
reconciled automatically if one plane is told to climb the other 
will be advised to descend or stay on course 
while industry experts believe tcasii with its climb and 
descend commands offers enough to prevent nearly all midair 
collisions an even more complex system has been developed 
tcasiii that also will include horizontal capabilities 
dodgen said that even though honeywell is testing such a system 
on an faa airliner it is not likely to be approved for 
installation on commercial planes for several years and then only 
on models off the assembly line since it would require major 
modification for older airliners

a coal company seeking more than 42 million 
in refunds on arizona state taxes it paid for mining operations on 
the navajo and hopi indian reservations lost a supreme court appeal 
today 
the court without comment let stand rulings that arizonas 
transaction privilege tax properly was imposed on the peabody coal 
cos onreservation mining 
lawyers for peabody which is based in flagstaff ariz argued 
that the tax infringes on tribal sovereignty and is preempted by 
federal law 
state courts rejected those arguments after finding that the 
taxes imposed no burden on the tribes 
under lease agreements peabody mines coal from navajo tribal 
land at the kayenta mine and from the navajohopi jointuse tribal 
land at the black mesa mine 
virtually all of the coal mined at the two sites is sold to 
electric power consortiums under contracts that reimburse peabody 
for all state privilege taxes it pays 
from 1970 through 1979 peabody paid the state tax without 
protest 
but the companys lawsuit against the state and its department 
of revenue sought refunds for taxes paid from 1980 through 1985 
under protest 
lawyers for the coal company said that by 1986 the amount in 
controversy was about 42 million with interest that sum has 
grown 
the case is peabody coal vs arizona 881399

the supreme court today agreed to review a 
challenge to the partial merger of detroits two daily newspapers 
the justices said they will judge the validity of former 
attorney general edwin meeses decision to allow the newspapers to 
form a joint operating agreement 
a decision is not expected until sometime in 1990 
the partial merger is being challenged by a group of michigan 
readers and advertisers 
the federal newspaper preservation act of 1970 law authorizes 
the attorney general to give financially failing newspapers an 
exemption from federal antitrust laws 
under the joint operating agreement the detroit free press and 
the detroit news would combine their business advertising and 
production departments but maintain separate news and editorial 
staffs 
the high court by a 72 vote cleared the way for the deal 
march 20 when it set aside an earlier postponement ordered by 
justice william j brennan 
only justices harry a blackmun and john paul stevens voted in 
march to continue the postponement but it takes the votes of four 
justices to grant review to a formal appeal 
after the march vote lawyers for the newspapers said they would 
await the outcome of the formal appeal which was acted on today 
a federal appeals court panel here voted 21 last january to 
uphold meeses decision to allow the partial merger the full 
appeals court split 54 last february in refusing to review the 
threejudge panels ruling 
opponents to the joint operating agreement calling themselves 
michigan citizens for an independent press contend that the free 
press owned by knightridder inc is not a failing newspaper even 
though it lost 10 million a year between 1981 and 1986 
the opponents say the free press and news which lost 50 
million in the same period were unprofitable solely because both 
papers cut prices in an unsuccessful effort to force each other out 
of business 
the losses the papers have suffered are the product of 
vigorous competition said the appeal acted on today 
it contended that the detroit deal threatens the independence 
of papers in the 25 cities that have competing dailies since it 
provides a roadmap for profitable papers to obtain a joa and the 
monopoly profits that can be obtained in a noncompetitive market 
but in urging the justices to reject the challenge bush 
administration lawyers cited the variety of considerations that 
went into meeses decision 
a newspaper in another city could hardly use this case as a 
guide for obtaining the attorney generals approval for a joa 
the government lawyers said 
gannett co which owns the news is the nations largest 
newspaper publishing group knightridder is the second largest 
knightridder has said it might close the free press if the 
joint operating agreement is not consummated 
this process has been an extraordinary lesson in patience 
free press publisher david lawrence said after the court acted 
today the people of the free press have already waited more than 
three years to assure this newspapers future 
i remain confident that what is at stake is vital to the 
people of michigan and confident that what is proposed is fully 
justified 
news publisher robert giles referred calls for comment to 
gannett headquarters in arlington va where spokeswoman sheila 
gibbons declined comment 
were delighted said david vladeck attorney for public 
citizen an advocacy group that handled the legal work on the 
challenge to the business agreement 
public citizen had not only argued the agreement would threaten 
newspaper competition in other cities but that a lower courts 
ruling had set precedents for administrative law that would greatly 
restrict judicial review of executive actions 
i suspect that the fact that this case presented both issues 
made it doubly appealing to the court vladeck said 
under the 100year agreement the news would receive 55 percent 
of the merged companys profits during the first year but that 
percentage would drop to 50 percent by the seventh year 
thereafter the profits would be evenly divided 
the case is michigan citizens for an independent press vs 
thornburgh 881640

ben amp jerrys homemade inc has reached a 
definitive agreement with dreyers grand ice cream inc to have 
some of its ice cream made at dreyers indiana plant the companies 
announced monday 
james miller general manager for ben amp jerrys said the 
company has exhausted its capacity and that demand for the ice 
cream is far outstripping supply he said the company is not 
interested in building a third plant in the state right now 
under a threeyear agreement dreyers will manufacture ben amp 
jerrys products at dreyers fort wayne ind plant using vermont 
dairy products 
dreyers an oaklandcalifbased company makes and distributes 
ice cream and other dairybased products including ben amp jerrys 
in midwest and west coast markets 
by 1992 miller said about 35 million gallons of ice cream 
will be produced in indiana the waterburybased company currently 
sells 5 million gallons annually and projects it will be selling 8 
million gallons a year by 1992 
the company currently operates two vermont plants one in 
waterbury and one in springfield the waterbury plant built in 
1985 produces ice cream in pint packages and bulk ice cream for 
franchise shops the springfield plant makes ice cream novelties 
miller said it would not be economically feasible for the 
company to convert parts of the plant for producing pints 
since partners ben cohen and jerry greenfield opened shop in an 
old filling station in burlington in 1978 ben amp jerrys has grown 
into a 40 million corporation 
miller said the company is not moving any of its vermont 
operations to indiana the decision reflects the current limits of 
both its factory and management staff he said 
because of our rapid growth we didnt have the strength up 
and down our management to take on another plant he said 
mnaufacturing staff at the new plant will be dreyers employees he 
said but quality control staff will be hired by ben amp jerrys 
the new arrangement will also help ben amp jerrys marketing 
strategy enabling the company to move more easily into major 
markets west of the mississippi especially california

a sharply divided supreme court ruled today 
the burden is on employers to disprove sexual stereotyping when 
they are accused of discriminating against women 
by a 63 vote the justices ordered further lower court hearings 
in a suit against the accounting firm price waterhouse by ann 
hopkins who said she was denied a partnership because of macho 
attitudes that she did not behave sufficiently ladylike 
todays ruling also is a partial victory for price waterhouse 
the court overturned a lower court ruling that would have placed an 
even heavier burden of proof on the company 
moreover only four of the justices agreed on the standards that 
should govern lawsuits alleging sexual stereoptyping 
the absence of a court majority enunciating clear guidelines is 
likely to sow confusion among lower courts when deciding such cases 
justice william j brennan in the courts main opinion said 
when someone proves that her gender played a motivating part in 
an employment decision the defendant may avoid a finding of 
liability only by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that 
it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken the 
plantiffs gender into account 
joining his opinion were justices thurgood marshall john paul 
stevens and harry a blackmun 
justice sandra day oconnor in a separate concurring opinion 
agreed that in the case of price waterhouse the burden of 
persuasion should shift to the employer to demonstrate by a 
preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same 
decision concerning ann hopkins candidacy absent consideration of 
her gender 
but oconnor said she does not favor the strong medicine of 
forcing employers to bear the burden of proof in all such cases 
justice byron r white also concurred in todays result but in 
a separate opinion he said he would not require an employer to 
submit objective evidence to disprove sexual bias in such cases 
as long as the employer credibly testifies that the action 
would have been taken for legitimate reasons alone this should be 
ample proof white said 
the three dissenters are chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy they voted to kill 
ms hopkins suit 
kennedy in his opinion for the three said there was ample 
evidence that price waterhouse did not discriminate against her 
intentionally 
ms hopkins quit price waterhouse one of the nations socalled 
big eight accounting firms after she was denied promotion to 
partnership in 1983 a move that would have made her a part owner 
she later became a consultant to the world bank 
in other actions today the supreme court 
agreed to review a challenge to review to the partial merger of 
detroits two daily newspapers the justices said they will judge 
the validity of former attorney general edwin meeses decision to 
allow the newspapers to form a joint operating agreement 
agreed to hear a bush administration apeal aimed at allowing 
the government to collect potentially hundreds of millions of 
dollars in taxes from multinational corporations 
refused to hear an appeal by hawaii officials seeking to 
recover from asbestos manufacturers the cost of removing the 
product from public schools in the state 
in the sex bias case ms hopkins had joined price waterhouse in 
1978 and was nominated for parntership in 1982 the only woman 
among 88 candidates for partnership that year 
she had been very successful in getting business for the 
company winning government contracts worth between 34 million and 
44 million 
both her critics and supporters at price watershouse said she 
sometimes was overly agreessive too harsh impatient with her 
staff and very demanding 
one critic suggested she needed to take a course at charm 
school 
a partner who supported her for promotion told her she would 
stand a better chance of getting ahead if she would walk more 
femininely talk more femininely dress more femininely wear 
makeup have her hair styled and wear jewelry 
ms hopkins sued price waterhouse on grounds it violated title 
vii of the 1964 civil rights act prohibiting onthejob 
discrimination she said sexual stereotyping unconscious or 
otherwise cost her a partnership 
professinal partnerships are covered by the 1964 law under a 
1984 supreme court ruling 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled in 1987 that while 
there appeared to be mixed motives in denying ms hopkins a 
partnership price waterhouse was unable to prove that 
impermissible bias was not the determinative factor for the 
decision 
the appeals court said an employer must show by clear and 
convincing evidence they did not practice bias 
the supreme court today did not go that far 
the clear and convincing standard usually means that to 
successfully defend against a lawsuit a company must show that the 
overwhelming evidence is in its favor

some of the people getting nearly 
17 an hour to mop up the largest oil spill in us history are 
unhappy with how the mess is being handled and 20 quit their jobs 
we dont even know who our supervisors are said chris 
christoffersen who had been staying aboard the uss juneau 
the vessel serves as a floating hotel for the more than 300 
cleanup workers laboring sometimes one rock at a time to get 
oil off smith islands oncepicturesque shoreline 
christoffersen was one of 20 workers taken back to valdez during 
the weekend after quitting as they lined up to leave new workers 
arrived 
valdez has been the center of the cleanup since march 24 when 
the exxon valdez went aground in prince william sound and spilled 
more than 10 million gallons of crude 
the oil which has spread across hundreds of square miles 
during the weekend reached the beaches of katmai national park a 
brown bear refuge about 275 miles southwest of valdez 
authorities said today they are shifting a large cleanup dredge 
southward from prince william sound to follow the drifting oil 
they also plan to bring in highpowered warmwater guns to cleanse 
the rugged shoreline 
over the last two days weve discovered a very large 
amount of oil debris inside of shelikof straits park 
superintendent ray bane said the 30milewide strait lies between 
kodiak island and the alaska peninsula 
the impact stretches from shaw island on the north side of 
cape douglas all the way to our southern boundary and now weve 
had reports its been found in wild bay south of us bane said 
today was the deadline for exxon to provide the state with a 
plan for waste disposal and the cleaning of gulf of alaska 
shorelines 
we want to see a documented plan a welldocumented plan with 
the equipment and people showing how they are going to dispose of 
that oil said barbara holian spokeswoman for the alaska 
department of environmental conservation we want to know what 
they are going to do with that oily waste 
there is some talk of using a hazardous waste incinerator on a 
barge brought up from washington she said there are different 
kinds of incinerators and a hazardous waste incinerator has more 
safeguards built into it we are trying to safeguard the air 
quality 
meantime some people like christoffersen are getting fed up 
with what they see as an exercise in futility he also said people 
are getting bored by being stuck on the ship 
an exxon official said any mistakes or confusion were a natural 
part of getting the vessel into operation 
the juneau a 569foot amphibious dock landing ship armed with 
guns 3 inches in diameter is anchored at an estimated cost of 
150000 a day 
the navy ship arrived last week with more than 1000 crew and 
workers aboard operations started thursday but fizzled friday 
when seas rose to 7 feet and winds were to 38 mph work resumed 
saturday 
several workers remained aboard unable to go ashore for lack of 
equipment one group that labeled itself the forgotten 14 had 
not worked since wednesday 
the workers spoke on condition of anonymity 
they said they would fire us said a 25yearold fishing 
guide 
he and the others said they were being paid overtime at 25 an 
hour saturday to do nothing we get paid the same as the people 
out there working 
im here because i dont know if ill have a fishing season 
he said i thought id get my money now i dont know where my 
fish are 
others complained about the lack of activity 
at first the days started out like weeks and now theyre like 
years said one worker 
the juneaus captain ted willandt said that after the first 
day exxon reported a section of beach measuring 300by45 feet was 
about 30 percent cleanedthey have to go over it at least two 
more times to get it clean willandt said 
the company has promised to clean 300 miles of coastline within 
prince william sound by sept 15 
workers are putting in 12hour days working 14 days and getting 
seven off exxons victor blanco said from his office aboard a 
barge tied alongside the juneau 
blanco who is heading the smith island effort attributed the 
complaints to startup problems 
it was hard the first day the conditions out here are 
tough he said its tough work 
he said exxon was trying to make the crews happy aboard ship he 
said in addition to televisions the company planned a free store 
and had paid for double rations of food 
to have happy campers you have to feed them well he said

the supreme court today refused to hear 
eastman kodak cos appeal of a federal court ruling that the 
company infringed on instant film and camera patents held by 
polaroid corp 
kodak argued that the 1985 ruling should be thrown out because 
us district judge rya zobel who presided over the trial had a 
conflict of interest in the case 
a federal appeals court that earlier heard kodaks appeal noted 
that zobel announced to both companies in 1981 that her 
motherinlaw owned kodak shares and that kodak raised no 
objection the appeals court said that it was not until 1988 well 
after zobels liability ruling against kodak that the company 
objected 
since the supreme court refuses to hear the case the federal 
appeals court ruling against kodak is the final word 
in boston opening arguments began today in the trial to 
determine the damages kodak must pay polaroid 
by copying polaroids technology kodak forced its rival to sell 
some cameras below cost and enormously damaged the instant 
photography market polaroid lawyers said 
the trial before judge a david mazzone in us district court 
is expected by many securities analysts to result in kodak paying 
polaroid about 1 billion which would be the largest patent damage 
award in history 
the trial is expected to take four to six months 
you start talking and ill start listening and as the famous 
saying goes i hope you finish before i do mazzone told the 
kodak and polaroid lawyers 
polaroid attorney herbert f schwartz argued that polaroid was 
entitled to 39 billion in lost profits because of kodaks sales 
of instant cameras and film between 1976 and 1986 
in addition schwartz argued that polaroid is entitled to 
interest and triple punitive damages bringing the total to just 
under 12 billion 
in a previous trial a judge ruled in october 1985 that kodak 
had violated seven of polaroids key patents on instant film and 
cameras and booted kodak out of the instant photography business 
saddling it with 600 million of losses and an estimated 200 
million worth of useless manufacturing equipment 
the only issue in the current trial is the value of the damage 
caused by kodak 
rochester nybased kodak argues that the most polaroid should 
get is 177 million representing a 5 percent royalty on all the 
instant film and cameras that kodak sold from 1976 to 1986 
lawyers said the record award in a patent infringement lawsuit 
was approximately 200 million that hughes tool co received from 
dresser industries in 1986 
a multibilliondollar verdict could force kodak to make layoffs 
take on huge debt and sell subsidiaries to raise cash it could 
leave the company unable to make the investments it needs to 
compete with japanese film makers 
if the award is near the top of the possible range it could 
even force kodak into a chapter 11 bankruptcy just as texaco inc 
was forced to reorganize when a jury ordered it to pay 103 
billion to pennzoil co four years ago texaco emerged from chapter 
11 a year ago after paying pennzoil 3 billion in cash to settle 
the case 
but securities analysts say a chapter 11 filing is unlikely 
most wall street brokerage houses are predicting an award of about 
1 billion and traders say the stock prices of both companies 
already reflect that expectation 
were not going to see another texaco here said peter 
enderlin an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co 
polaroid which recently spent 11 billion to buy back stock 
and fend off a hostile takeover by shamrock holdings inc is 
expected to use part of any award to lower its corporate debt 
alex henderson an analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc said he reckoned polaroids stock price probably will rise or 
fall about 1 for every 100 million of the award that is above or 
below wall streets expectations

opec is expected to raise its production 
quota in june to help return bloated prices to the cartels 
18abarrel target level iraqs oil minister said monday 
the middle east economic survey quoted issam abdulrahim 
alchalabi as saying that an increase in the output ceiling should 
end overproduction by some of the organizations 13 members 
chalabi said that the increase is expected to be formalized at a 
june meeting of opec ministers and take effect in the second half 
of the year a new output level has not been decided the minister 
said however industry observers expect an increase of about 15 
million barrels a day 
last november the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
set a production quota of 185 million barrels a day in an effort 
to raise world oil prices which had fallen to 10 to 12 a barrel 
at the time the cartel was producing in excess of 22 million 
barrels far more than the market could absorb 
since then oil prices have nearly doubled although several 
opec members are producing above their quotas putting the cartel 
above its selfimposed limit opec does not want to see prices too 
high lest they encourage nonopec producers to increase production 
kuwait and the united arab emirates have both demanded higher 
quotas and the uae has consistantly been overproducing since 
november oil sources have reported 
chalabi warned however that there could be no going back on 
the principle of equal quotas for iraq and iran which fought an 
eightyear war ending in ceasefire last august he said iraq will 
not even discuss the matter 
we watch very closely whatever production figures come out of 
iran he said 
if in actual terms there is going to be any production 
increase or quota violation by iran then that will be treated 
differently by iraq 
chalabi said iraqs current refining capacity is 600000 barels 
a day and internal consumption is running at about 300000 barrels 
a day

voters rejection of gov buddy roemers 
tax plan will mean the likely closures of hospitals and 
universities and the layoffs of thousands of state employees the 
governor said today 
we dont have all the specifics yet well let you know as 
soon as we can an obviously weary roemer told reporters at an 
impromptu news conference 
the governor was closeted late into the night sunday with 
advisers to decide how to approach a budget that is now 700 
million short of balance for the new fiscal year beginning july 1 
voters on saturday rejected the plan by 55 percent to 45 
percent according to unofficial returns 
roemer who traveled around the state for six weeks trying to to 
sell the plan faces questions about his political future just 13 
months after he took office as a reformer promising a new 
louisiana 
im not worried about that im concerned about this state 
roemer said fielding questions on the capitol steps there will 
be a referendum on buddy roemer in 2 years 
roemers plan would have shifted the tax burden away from big 
business putting more of a load on individuals through the income 
tax it would have reduced sales taxes and given businesses 
incentives to move to louisiana and expand 
the plan also included a 14 billion program to improve 
highways airports and shipping ports funded by a gasoline tax 
increase of 4 cents a gallon 
roemer touted his plan as a way to bring jobs to louisiana 
which has the nations highest unemployment rate at 96 percent 
and to end the states dependence on the oil industry 
the oil gas and chemical industry paid more than half of the 
state taxes for nearly 50 years until its collapse in 1982 
since then state government has hovered near bankruptcy 
i never worked harder in my life to try to turn this around 
the democratic governor said were going to keep building but 
not as fast as i wanted to 
this plan will tell america that weve changed that were 
ready to pay our way roemer said repeatedly during his trips 
around the state 
opponents condemned it as nothing more than a huge tax increase 
and said roemer had not reduced spending as promised during his 
1987 campaign when he unseated edwin edwards 
rep david duke an outspoken critic of the plan said its 
defeat was going to make a real change in louisiana he called 
on roemer to work with legislators in tightening spending and 
making major changes in its welfare programs 
duke a former ku klux klan leader elected as a republican to a 
suburban new orleans seat on an antitax plank in february 
compared the referendums outcome to his own victory every day 
that passes im more and more in awe of the intelligence and the 
good sense in our state he said 
even with passage of the plan the legislature would have been 
forced to cut spending by 200 million to keep the budget balanced 
roemer met all day sunday with his closest advisers on how to 
cut the budget 
the people want closures i really believe that rep robert 
adley chairman of the house appropriations committee said as he 
left the meeting at the governors mansion they sent us a signal 
that we havent done enough 
it could be from one to several universities or more 
hospitals could be from three to five the democrat said right 
now were trying to find every way in the world that a degree of 
services can be rendered 
louisiana has 18 public universities and eight charity hospitals 
the people sent a signal that they want more cuts added 
steve cochran roemers chief of staff im not sure what goes 
through the minds of citizens when they think of budget cuts they 
think of waste of extras unfortunately to live within the 
limitations set here well probably have to do more than the 
average citizen expects 
cochran said thousands of the states 80000 employees likely 
would lose their jobs the administration would determine within a 
week all specific cuts he said 
when you close institutions that means people lose jobs he 
said 
as for roemers political future political consultant and 
pollster ed renwick of loyola university said the governor was 
badly wounded but not critically wounded 
silas lee a loyola university political scientist said 
roemer couldnt sell his plan to bluecollar whites many of whom 
think david duke is on the ball and he couldnt sell it to blacks 
who didnt think there would really be thousands of jobs for them

the oil and gas rig count continued its seesaw 
pattern dropping by 16 this week to total 751 baker hughes inc 
reported 
last week the number of working oil and gas rigs had increased 
by nine to 767 the company said monday a year ago the count 
totaled 880 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively 
producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oil producing states oklahoma was the big loser 
this week with its count dropping by 14 last week oklahomas 
count had increased by 11 
texas north dakota and kansas each lost two rigs while 
colorado new mexico and louisiana all lost one 
californias count increased by five ohio gained two and 
wyomings rig count increased by one

construction spending hit by a sharp drop in 
the highway category suffered its third consecutive monthly 
decline in march the first time building activity has shown such 
weakness since just before the last recession the government said 
monday 
the commerce department said that spending on public and private 
building projects declined by 03 percent in march following even 
larger declines of 08 percent in february and 07 percent in 
january 
the february decline represented a sharp revision from the 
original report a month ago when the government had reported that 
construction spending was unchanged from the january level 
the three consecutive declines pushed activity down to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4135 billion 
it marked the longest string of setbacks since five months of 
declines from february through june of 1981 right before the start 
of the 198182 recession 
construction because of its sensitivity to high interest rates 
has often been one of the sectors leading the country into a 
downturn 
michael sumichrast an economist and publisher of a construction 
newsletter said that history could well repeat itself unless the 
federal reserve soon relents and stops pushing interest rates up in 
an effort to fight inflation 
economists have been looking for building activity to be weak 
this year because of the feds campaign to push interest rates 
higher as a way of fighting inflation by dampening economic 
activity 
there is no strength anywhere in construction sumichrast 
said we have problems with overbuilding high interest rates and 
a sharp runup in prices of singlefamily homes 
the weakness in march resulted from a 91 percent plunge in 
public construction which fell to an annual rate of 741 billion 
much of that decline reflected an 188 percent drop in spending for 
highways and streets the biggest government category 
construction of new housing units was down as well dropping 14 
percent to an annual rate of 1433 billion spending on 
singlefamily homes fell by 17 percent to an annual rate of 1201 
billion while multifamily construction was up 09 percent to a 
rate of 233 billion 
nonresidential construction rose by 41 percent to an annual 
rate of 1019 billion reflecting strength in factory 
construction which surged by 121 percent and hotel construction 
which was up 7 percent 
but sumichrast said he believed this was a temporary spurt in 
activity for the year as a whole he predicted that construction 
in the nonresidential category would drop by about 6 percent from 
the 1988 level led by continued weakness in office construction

federal home loan bank board chairman m danny 
wall said monday that reports of the savings and loan industrys 
death have been greatly exaggerated 
dont get caught up that the industry is some sort of a 
dinosaur he told the society of american business editors and 
writers the industry is doing well within the healthy sector 
speaking in typical optimistic fashion wall said that 88 
percent of the nations 3000 sampls representing 92 percent of the 
industys assets are considered solvent and congress is working 
to dispose of the rest 
troubled thrifts accounted for the bulk of the 121 billion in 
industrywide losses in 1988 with texas institutions again emerging 
as the biggest losers 
the future of the industry is being made ever clear as 
legislative discussion continues wall said congress continues 
to be supportive of the thrift industry and in its purpose 
he said that he expected a thrift bailout bill to pass through 
congress by midjune 
last week the senate overwhelmingly approved a record 157 
billion bailout and reform bill for the sampl industry after 
toughening provisions that would require sampl owners to put more of 
their own money at risk to stay in business similar sampl 
legislation is pending in the house

the supreme court today turned away a cable 
television dispute from dallas in which the city was held liable 
for violating the freespeech rights of a nonfranchised company 
the justices without comment refused to hear the citys appeal 
in a case still pending in a federal trial court 
video international productions inc vip sued the city and 
warneramex cable communications inc the sole franchised cable tv 
company in dallas for allegedly trying to put vip out of business 
a federal court jury awarded vip 44 million in damages but 
major portions of that judgment were overturned by the presiding 
judge 
us district judge sidney fitzwater threw out all claims 
against warneramex and claims that the city had interfered 
improperly with a contract to sell vip 
but the judge upheld the jurys findings that the city violated 
vips freespeech rights and federal antitrust law he also ruled 
that the city was immune from punitive damages 
in all the dollar amount of vips legal victory was cut to 
200000 
both vip and dallas city officials appealed and the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals last oct 31 ruled that the city was 
legally liable to vip 
but the appeals court sent the dispute back to fitzwater for a 
new trial on the amount of damages to be paid 
we are unable to discern a reasonable explanation for the 
jurys wideranging verdicts the appeals court said 
the case is dallas vs video international productions 881488

the car which was equipped with only two rear seat belts 
his lawsuit scheduled to go to trial oct 9 contends that if 
he had had a seat belt he would not have been injured 
biss admitted that he turned over to a producer for the abc news 
program last summer an internal document from gm that was under a 
protective court seal 
as an expert witness in the mcguire trial biss was allowed to 
view the document during the period in which lawyers gather 
information from the other side 
the document contained the results of a 1976 test by gm that it 
said showed that passengers strapped in rear lap belts undergo four 
times the force required to cause serious injury in headon 
collisions 
the 2020 program used the document in a july 1988 broadcast 
in which it said gm and other automakers failed to install shoulder 
belts in the back seats of automobiles even though the companies 
knew that shoulder belts were safer than lap belts alone

the supreme courts decision monday to review 
the partial merger of two detroit newspapers will force 
knightridder inc to determine how much longer it can absorb 
losses from its detroit free press analysts said 
by agreeing to hear arguments on the proposed joint operating 
agreement joa the court set the stage for its first review of 
the 19yearold newspaper preservation act a decision is not 
expected until next year 
the detroit news owned by gannett co inc and the free press 
agreed in 1986 to merge the newspapers production circulation and 
business operations and to split profits and losses equally for 
most of the 100year arrangement 
knightridders president and chief executive officer james k 
battn said the organization would plan over the coming days what 
to do next 
batten said knightridder continues to believe strongly in the 
fairness and justice of our case on behalf of a joa in detroit 
gannett through spokeswoman sheila gibbons said it was 
reviewing the decision and would have no further comment 
both newspapers have been losing money for years and 
knightridder has said it will close the smaller free press unless 
the partial merger goes through 
knightridders decision would be based upon its reading of 
the length of time and the likelihood of this thing 
happening said john s reidy communications industry analyst 
with the new york brokerage house drexel burnham lambert inc 
clearly from their point of view they would like to 
eliminate the cash drain of the free press on the other hand 
if they wait it out then theyll have half interest in a joa 
which will earn considerably more for them than the loss last year 
so it is a tough decision reidy said 
the free press lost 185 million in 1988 knightridder said in 
court filings earlier this year gannett has released no annual 
loss figures for the news but knightridder in testimony has 
estimated the news losses at 75 million from 1979 through 1987 
the newspapers have said closing the free press would cost 2200 
jobs while a joint operating agreement would mean a total of 600 to 
800 jobs lost at the two papers 
free press employees at a staff meeting took news of the supreme 
courts decision with a calm patience 
weve been punched around so many times its like okay 
well waltz with it again said neal rubin a feature writer 
the partial merger designed to retain newspaper competition 
through an exemption to federal antitrust laws was approved by the 
justice department last year but was tied up by court challenges 
from an organization of newspaper readers and advertisers michigan 
citizens for an independent press and the washingtonbased 
advocacy group public citizen 
they argued that the newspapers losses resulted from management 
decisions rather than being inherent in the detroit media market 
and that if the deal were approved any welloff newspaper 
publishing group could deliberately create conditions for an 
antitrust exemption 
bush administration attorneys countered that a variety of 
considerations had been behind the justice departments decision 
a newspaper in another city could hardly use this case as a guide 
for obtaining the attorney generals approval for a joa the 
government lawyers said 
william schultz a lawyer for public citizen predicted 
farreaching results from the courts decision to hear arguments 
it is the first test the court has heard under the newspaper 
preservation act it is likely it will decide the meaning of the 
act and the scope of the act for the future schultz said 
a federal appeals court panel in washington voted 21 in january 
to uphold the justice departments decision to allow the partial 
merger the full appeals court then split 54 in february in 
refusing to review the threejudge panels ruling 
the supreme court by a 72 vote cleared the way for the deal 
march 20 when it set aside an earlier postponement ordered by 
justice william j brennan 
only justices harry a blackmun and john paul stevens voted in 
march to continue the postponement the votes of four justices are 
needed to grant review to a formal appeal 
when the courts stay was lifted knightridder proposed 
proceeding with the partial merger gannett declined to do so 
no stay is in effect and the newspapers would have the option 
of merging while awaiting the supreme courts decision on the case 
gannett based in arlington va is the nations largest 
newspaper publishing group knightridder headquartered in miami 
is the second largest

grain and soybean futures prices rose strongly 
monday on the chicago board of trade in reaction to longrange 
forecasts of belowaverage rainfall in several grainproducing 
states 
the national weather service on friday released 30 and 90day 
forecasts that predicted a return to dry conditions in the western 
half of the farm belt including iowa and illinois 
the forecasts fueled talk of a return of drought conditions 
pushing up prices across the board 
it was a very typical weatherrelated price movement said 
ted mao a grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in new 
york there is a lot of uncertainty in the market and the market 
should reflect that uncertainty into the summer 
wheat was strong because of severe weather conditions and 
despite continued uncertainty over the bush administrations 
position on continuing subsidized grain sales to foreign countries 
prices were helped by rumors that the bush administration could 
make a decision soon that would allow the soviet union to purchase 
up to 3 million metric tons of grain 
at the close wheat was 4 cents to 6 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 423 a bushel corn was 4 cents 
to 5 cents higher with may at 274 a bushel oats were 4 cents to 
6 cents higher with may at 184 a bushel soybeans were 12 
cents to 17 cents higher with may at 735 a bushel

atlantic richfield co said monday its profit 
rose 76 percent in the first quarter due largely to gains from the 
sale of a half interest in its lyondell petrochemical co 
without that gain and other onetime charges against earnings 
net income in the quarter would have risen only 35 percent said 
lodwrick m cook arcos chairman and chief executive officer 
for the threemonth period ended march 31 arcos net earnings 
totaled 704 million or 4 per share up from 401 million or 
220 a share in the first quarter of 1988 revenue fell to 396 
billion down 14 percent from 461 billion a year earlier 
the results included a 634 million aftertax gain from the sale 
of 5375 percent interest in lyondell in january 
cook who reported the results at the companys annual 
shareholders meeting said that discounting onetime gains and 
charges profit would have been 415 million 
the gains were partially offset by 345 in aftertax charges for 
unspecified environmental expenses anticipated losses on the 
planned sale of arco solar inc and a charge related to the sale of 
the companys aluminum operation in 1985 
cook also said that the march oil spill in alaska which forced 
a temporary halt to shipments from the port of valdez cost the 
company about 10 million after taxes 
arco spokesman albert greenstein said the loss stemmed from a 
combination of reduced production and lower oil flow through the 
alaska pipeline over a 12day period after the march 24 spill 
about 32 million barrels net to arco was not delivered 
said albert greenstein so when you look at reduced deliveries to 
arco and reduced production we had to reduce production in one of 
our refineries the overall aftertax loss was 10 million most 
of that relates to loss of delivered crude

the dollar wound up higher against all major 
currencies in a thin market monday as an unexpectedly strong 
economic assessment from the nations purchasing managers triggered 
buying 
gold prices barely budged republic national bank of new york 
quoted a bid of 37745 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 pm edt 5 
cents lower than fridays late bid 
victor polce a vice president at bear stearns amp co said 
intervention by a few central banks had little lasting effect on 
the dollars movement 
trading volume was light in the united states most major 
european financial markets were closed for a holiday individual 
transactions have more of an impact on exchange rates in a market 
in which relatively fewer trades are taking place 
foreign exchange dealers attributed part of the dollars 
strength to a monthly survey by the national association of 
purchasing management which suggested economic growth regained 
momentum in april 
the purchasing managers index which measures new orders 
production vendor deliveries inventory and employment went up to 
53 percent in april after falling to 504 percent in march last 
months growth rate was roughly the same as the first quarters 
pace 
an implication of the purchasing managers survey was that 
economic activity may not be slowing enough to induce the federal 
reserve to ease its grip on credit this would mean interest rates 
would remain at current levels 
rising interest rates in the united states this year have 
enhanced the appeal of dollardenominated investments 
here are late dollar rates in new york compared with fridays

midwest department store operators carson pirie 
scott amp co and pa bergner announced monday they have agreed to 
merge with bergner acquiring carson for about 454 million 
this merger fulfills our longterm objective to have a major 
presence in the chicago area said alan r anderson bergners 
chief executive officer and board chairman 
the announcement wraps up a monthlong courtship of 
chicagobased carson that began in midapril when bergner made a 
282 million buyout offer worth about 20 a share that bid was 
rejected as was the sweetened offer one week later of 24 a share 
together the bergner family of stores bergners boston 
store and carsons will constitute one of the largest 
departmentstore operations in the midwest and will be no 1 in 
sales said anderson who added the carsons stores would 
continue to operate under the carson pirie scott name 
at an afternoon news conference however he said some of 
carsons subsidiary stores including the county seat and arcadia 
stores will be offered for sale 
anderson also said there were no plans to release any of 
carsons employees but that peter s willmott carsons chairman 
and chief executive officer would resign 
willmott called the linkage of the two retail chains the 
beginning of another stage in the companys ongoing 135yearold 
history and said it would serve shareholders best interests 
it had been my strong personal preference to continue the 
twoyear restructuring program we began in 1987 and to remain an 
independent focused retailer said willmott 
the company fended off a 1986 takeover attempt by chicagobased 
baytree investors inc 
carson lost 388 million in the fiscal year that ended in 
january partly because of problems integrating the donaldsons 
stores it bought in 1987 in minnesota two years ago the company 
finished 267 million in the red 
willmott said the merger with bergners will combine two 
companies with similar strategic objectives and will give carsons 
and bergners a stronger position in the highly competitive midwest 
market carson pirie scotts valuable name and position in the 
retail industry will be maintained 
carson pirie scott operates 33 stores under its own name they 
are located in chicago central illinois northwest indiana 
minnesota and iowa it also operates 391 county seat specialty 
stores mostly in midwest and sunbelt states and 23 arcadia shops 
primarily in chicago 
with the acquisition bergners a swissowned chain that has 
operated in the midwest for 100 years and has 33 stores in illinois 
and wisconsin will become one of the top 15 us departmentstore 
operations with consolidated revenue of about 1 billion bergner 
owned by the maus and nordmann families of switzerland has 
headquarters in milwaukee for its us holdings 
under the agreement approved by boards of both companies a 
bergners subsidiary will begin a tender offer within five business 
days for all the outstanding carsons shares for 2750 each based 
on 165 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis the 
takeover will cost 45375 million 
shares not acquired in the tender offer will be acquired in cash 
in a subsequent merger 
merrill lynch capital markets is advising carsons and shearson

grain and soybean futures prices rose strongly monday on the 
chicago board of trade in reaction to longrange forecasts of 
belowaverage rainfall in several grainproducing states 
on other markets gasoline and crude oil prices rallied cattle 
and hogs were up and gold and silver prices gained moderately 
wheat settled 4 cents to 6 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in may at 423 a bushel corn was 4 cents to 5 cents 
higher with may at 274 a bushel oats were 5 cents to 6 cents 
higher with may at 184 a bushel soybeans were 12 cents to 17 
cents higher with may at 735 a bushel 
the increased grain and soybean prices came on the heels of the 
30 and 90day forecasts released friday by the national weather 
service which predicted a return to dry conditions in the western 
half of the farm belt including iowa and illinois 
the forecasts fueled talk of a return of drought conditions 
pushing up prices across the board 
it was a very typical weatherrelated price movement said 
ted mao a grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
new york there is a lot of uncertainty in the market and the 
market should reflect that uncertainty into the summer 
wheat finished strong despite doubt over the bush 
administrations position on continuing subsidized grain sales to 
foreign countries 
mao noted that a lot of people are questioning the export 
subsidy program which finances cheap wheat sales to certain 
nations in the light of its costs and the prospect of a poor wheat 
crop 
bush spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday that bush will soon 
have a decision of a new grain sale to the soviets 
petroleum prices on the new york mercantile exchange closed 
mixed in light trading because of the may day holiday celebrated in 
europe and asia 
crude oil and gasoline moved up as buyers took advantage of 
lower prices while heating oil prices dropped in a selloff 
jim ritterbusch an analyst with carson petroleum co in 
chicago said traders who sold their gasoline contracts last week 
were buying the fuel and selling heating oil betting that gasoline 
prices would rise 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 24 cents 
higher with june at 2066 a barrel heating oil was 18 cent to 
31 cent lower with june at 4946 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 45 cent to 139 cents higher with june at 7261 cents a gallon 
cattle and hogs were up and pork bellies down on the chicago 
mercantile exchange in moderate trading 
theres little i can tell you about the market said charlie 
richardson an analyst with lindwaldock amp co in denver it has 
given no clear direction 
richardson said some traders are selling because they expect 
more cattle and hogs will be brought to market while others are 
buying because they expect a decrease in deliveries 
live cattle settled 02 cent to 37 cent higher with june at 
7145 cents a pound feeder cattle were 22 cent lower to 10 cent 
higher with may at 7630 cents a pound hogs were 02 cent lower to 
30 cent higher with june at 4692 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 13 cent to 2 cents lower with may at 3087 cents a 
pound 
gold and silver futures settled slightly higher on new yorks 
commodities exchange as traders cashed in on what is thought to be 
an oversold market 
despite the rise in prices the market remains bearish because 
of the lowering of the inflation mentality said james steel an 
analyst for refco inc in new york 
without the threat of inflation there is little reason for 
investors to buy gold 
gold settled 20 cents to 80 cents higher with may at 37820 a 
troy ounce silver was 45 cents to 6 cents higher with may at

consumer confidence in the us economy remains 
strong despite growing indications of a slowdown caused by rising 
interest rates the conference board business research group 
reported monday 
its monthly consumer confidence index which tracks the spending 
plans and perceptions about the economy in 5000 households 
nationwide totaled 1163 points in april down only slightly from 
the 1177 figure in march the index is calculated on a 1985 base 
year of 100 points 
an analysis of the latest index showed 288 percent of 
respondents believe current business conditions are good unchanged 
from a month earlier and 347 percent believe jobs are plentiful 
slightly higher than the march percentage 
respondents were slightly less optimistic about the next six 
months however only 165 percent anticipate an improvement in 
business conditions vs 18 percent who said so a month earlier 
the index also showed only 31 percent of respondents plan to 
purchase a home unchanged from march reflecting continued concern 
with rising interest rates and the resulting higher cost of 
financing a mortgage 
nonetheless the conference board said in its analysis the 
index showed consumer confidence remained resiliently high

tenneco incs earnings soared 73 percent in the 
first three months of 1989 and officials said monday the results 
reflected favorably on the companys decision last year to get out 
of the risky oil business 
the houstonbased company earned 109 million or 82 cents per 
common share in the 1989 first quarter on revenues of 33 billion 
for the same period last year tenneco earned 63 million or 38 
cents per share on revenues of 32 billion those results 
included 53 million from discontinued operations 
tenneco sold its oil and gas operations last year to a number of 
firms for a total of 73 billion 
during the first quarter this year the companys natural gas 
pipelines posted earnings of 112 million compared to 87 million 
in the same period last year 
the increase resulted primarily from improved earnings in the 
nonfederally regulated sectors of intrastate pipelines methanol 
and natural gas liquids and other nonjurisdicational marketing 
areas 
tennecos shipbuilding division had a decline in earnings going 
from 34 million in the 1988 first quarter to 30 million this 
quarter the company said the decline was caused by lower margins 
on naval construction 
tenneco had an overall loss in its other divisions which 
include farm and construction equipment automotive parts 
packaging and chemicals and minerals

the bush administration on monday delayed 
until oct 1 the effective date of a tough new tax provision aimed 
at ensuring that employers health insurance plans do not 
discriminate in favor of higherpaid workers 
the cost of compliance with section 89 of the internal 
revenue code as it presently stands is excessive treasury 
secretary nicholas brady told a chamber of commerce meeting the 
law needs to be changed and we stand ready to encourage support 
and work with congress to revise and improve it 
bradys announcement of the threemonth delay in the deadline 
for employers to comply with the law was greeted by loud applause 
from the business audience business has made repeal or 
modification of the section 89 law as major goal this year 
the law proposed by the reagan administration was enacted as 
part of the 1986 tax overhaul it requires employers to conduct a 
lengthy series of complex tests to demonstrate that their 
taxdeductible employee benefits especially health insurance are 
not weighted against workers making less than 50000 a year 
paperwork required by the law is so voluminous that some 
employers are threatening to withdraw health insurance coverage for 
all employees 
bradys announcement came on the eve of a public hearing on the 
disputed section by the house ways and means committee rep dan 
rostenkowski dill the committee chairman and most members of 
the committee have signed a bill to significantly relax the testing 
requirements on employers 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee also has called for overhaul of the provision 
we have asked the congress to work with the administration 
to find ways to revise section 89 to make its requirements less 
burdensome on business brady said the regulations issued by the 
internal revenue service impose unreasonable compliance burdens 
on business he added 
the section 89 rules went into effect on jan 1 but the irs 
waived compliance requirements until july 1 and agreed that no 
employer would be penalized if a goodfaith effort to follow the 
rules were made the remainder of 1989 
under rostenkowskis bill employers that provide a health plan 
would have to offer coverage costing workers 10 a week or less 
25 or less for a family plan to 90 percent of employees 
higherpaid workers would be taxed on the value of coverage that 
was better than provided other employees 
sen carl levin dmich said the treasury departments 
decision was only a first step in cleaning up the administrative 
nightmare associated with the tax provision 
this should give employers the assurance that the irs wont 
rush into enforcing this flawed provision and it should give the 
congress time to consider options ranging from substantial 
simplification to outright repeal levin said

the house banking committee on monday beat 
back several efforts to weaken measures demanded by the bush 
administration to make owners of savings and loan banks put more of 
their own money at risk in exchange for federal insurance of 
deposits 
as jesse jackson lobbied committee members to make sampls devote 
more of their lending for lowincome housing and innercity 
redevelopment the panel rejected attempts to continue past 
accounting techniques that had allowed many sampls to operate with no 
real tangible capital 
the key vote was on an amendment by rep thomas ridge dpa to 
give regulators authority to continue socalled good will 
exemptions from cash tangible capital requirements wanted by the 
administration and approved by the committee last week 
ridges amendment was defeated by a 2823 vote after opponents 
said good will is fake capital and said it is worthless as a 
resource to make sure that sampl owners have to pay before taxpayers 
do in any future bailouts 
also defeated on an voice vote was an amendment by rep steve 
bartlett rtexas that would have allowed the good will 
exemptions negotiated by sampl owners in pre1985 mergers to account 
for onefourth of an sampls tangible capital requirements unti 1993 
instead the committee placed new restrictions on the industrys 
ability to rapidly increase their growth through socalled brokered 
deposits one factor blamed for the 100 billion magnitude of the 
sampl crisis 
on a voice vote it adopted an amendment by rep stephen neal 
dnc requiring both banks and sampls with capital levels below 
federal standards to get prior approval before seeking brokered 
deposits in blocks of 100000 
in many instances real highflyer savings and loans attracted 
large deposits with high interest rates and used them to make risky 
loans neal said 
when those loans went bad many sampls tried to grow their way 
out of trouble by seeking more brokered deposits at even higher 
interest rates for even riskier loans and we wound up with a much 
bigger tab because of it said rep richard lehman dcalif 
assistant treasury secretary david mullins called the 
committees actions monday another good day for the 
administrations bailout plan he said the committee rejected 
resorting to acounting devices to water down bushs proposed 
capital standards 
the effort however is likely to arise again when the bill 
reaches the house floor rep claude pepper dfla chairman of 
the powerful house rules committee expressed strong support for 
good will accounting in a letter last week 
were trying to be tough and fair and not just tough said 
ridge who cited hundreds of sampls in illinois pennsylvania new 
york new jersey and ohio that lost much of their tangible capital 
in the early 1980s by taking over failed thrifts at the urging of 
the federal government 
the committee chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas who 
with a coalition of senior repubicans and young democrats on the 
committee has been leading the administrations fight for reforms 
against mostly young gop lawmakers who want to weaken them said 
good will is worthless as capital 
it cannot be converted to cash to offset losses he said 
when there is not capital or only fake capital the losses fall 
to the insurance funds and the taxpayers 
in exchange for taking over failed thrifts in the early 1980s 
and covering their losses the federal savings and loan insurance 
corp itself near insolvency granted healthy sampls more than 20 
billion in good will exemptions lasting up to 40 years from 
normal capital requirements 
but the institutions that pitched in with that aid by using much 
of their own capital to effectively rescue the governments 
insurance fund then face possible extinction by the new standards 
wanted by bush gonzalez and other reformers 
i understand that these institutions have a problem said 
rep charles schumer dny who has been carrying much of the 
administrations case but so do we 
were asking for 100 billion from taxpayers and flushing it 
down the drain schumer said and if you dont legislate 
against the 5 percent to 10 percent who would go back to the same 
practices that got us here well be back where we are today 
the bush administration originally proposed ending the 
exemptions gradually over 10 years in an effort to make sampl owners 
put more of their own money at risk 
the senate two weeks ago extended the goodwill phaseout to 25 
years but it said sampls must show that by june 1991 they have 150 
in tangible capital for every 100 of loans in their portfolios 
that could be seized before federal insurance funds are tapped to 
cover depositors losses 
the house banking committee voted to toughen that requirement 
last week saying that sampls must have at least 3 of tangible 
capital for every 100 of loans by january 1995 
jackson spent more than two hours in offices off the committees 
hearing room lobbying its members on behalf of amendments to raise 
corporate taxes to pay for the bailout and make sampls increase their 
lending to minorities and for inner city projects 
specifically jackson supports a proposed amendment by reps 
joseph kennedy dmass and bruce morrison dconn that would 
finance the bailout by raising the alternative capital income tax 
from its present 20 percent to 25 percent and tax all capital gains 
above 175000 a year at 33 percent 
the amendment has minuscule support and was not even introduced 
in the senate as an alternative to president bushs elaborate 
financing plan to prevent the cost of the bailout from adding to 
the federal deficit and aggravating the need for higher taxes 
bushs plan would raise an immediate 50 billion for the bailout 
through the creation of an offbudget bond underwriter at an 
estimated cost to taxpayers of 200 billion to 250 billion over 
the next 30 years 
this read my lips slogan that hes adhering to is the most 
costly slogan in history jackson said the reaganbush 
administration got us into trouble by disregarding their charge and 
mandate to regulate

the government on monday sued a brokerage 
firm an investment manager and several trustees of 561 million in 
teamsters union benefit funds for allegedly abusing their positions 
for financial gain through stock deals and other transactions 
among the allegations in the labor department suit is that the 
utica ny office of the brokerage firm shearson lehman hutton 
inc manipulated stock purchases for the funds to benefit other 
clients 
shearson investment manager stein roe and farnham inc and 
several of their agents were charged with violating federal pension 
laws by causing the teamsters funds to engage in prohibited 
financial transactions 
a copy of the complaint was released by labor department 
officials in washington after normal business hours monday and 
attempts to reach shearson and stein roe officials were 
unsuccessful 
a telephone call to shearsons utica office was not answered and 
a woman who answered the phone at stein roe in new york said there 
was no one available to comment 
included in the alleged abuses were stock parking schemes in 
which shearson acting through three of its employees set up an 
account in its utica office that it used to purchase stocks with 
the funds assets 
instead of immediately transferring the stocks to the funds the 
suit alleged that shearson parked them for a period of time to 
determine their shortterm profitability and used accounting tricks 
to transfer securities that had increased in value to the accounts 
of friends relatives and customers of two former shearson brokers 
who handled the teamsters account 
one of the former brokers george inserra allegedly used his 
knowledge of the funds investment plans to benefit some of his 
individual clients by purchasing stock for them just before the 
funds made large purchases of the same stock inserra then 
allegedly sold the individual clients stock at the higher prices 
caused by the bulk purchase 
shearson and stein roe also allegedly benefited through fee 
arrangements with banks issuing certificates of deposits to the 
union funds shearson allegedly concealed indirect fees on assets 
invested in the certificates stein roe allegedly was paid to 
manage those investments but performed no services 
the funds involved are the new york state teamsters conference 
pension and retirement fund the upstate teamsters pension and 
retirement fund and the new york state teamsters council health and 
hospital fund together they have about 65000 participants and had 
561231396 in cumulative assets as of the end of 1985 the labor 
department said 
eight current and former trustees of the funds were named as 
defendants for allegedly violating their fiduciary responsibily to 
the plans 
the suit filed in us district court in syracuse ny seeks 
a court order requiring the defendants to determine and restore 
with interest all losses incurred by the funds because of improper 
activities 
it also seeks courtappointed monitors to review the practices

rep james j florio dnj suggested monday 
that president george bush safeguard national security by blocking 
the proposed acquisition of american mineral interests by a south 
africanlinked company but government lawyers said the president 
lacks the authority to intervene 
by allowing this takeover we are undercutting the 
effectiveness of our countrys antiapartheid policy florio 
wrote in a letter requesting that bush act under a provision of the 
1988 trade bill that the new jersey congressman coauthored with 
sen j james exon dneb 
florio asked that bush investigate a 6 billion takeover offer 
made by minorco a luxembourgbased holding company controlled by 
south african interests 
minorco wants to acquire consolidated gold fields plc a 
londonbased mining company whose american holdings include 
associated minerals usa and the newmont mining co producers of 
gold rutile zircon monazite and other strategic minerals with 
military and nuclear applications 
florio said hes concerned the deal could increase south 
africas control over production of the minerals 
i believe this takeover raises important security questions 
for the us which may not have been adequately considered 
previously when this matter was under review by the interagency 
committee on foreign investment in the united states said 
florio chairman of the subcommittee on commerce consumer 
protection and competitiveness 
however steve canner staff chairman of the interagency 
committee said the panel had fully reviewed the merger and decided 
against proceeding with an investigation 
if the committee decides not to go forward thats it he 
said 
according to documents supplied by the treasury department 
government attorneys reviewed the deals potential impact on 
strategic metals as well as antiapartheid laws before concluding 
the transaction posed no threat to the us national security 
government attorneys said monday that based on the legislative 
history that accompanied the trade bill and the executive order 
implementing the bill once the 30day review period ended without 
a decision to proceed to an investigation action under exonflorio 
had concluded and the president had no authority to resurrect the 
issue 
minorco which is 60 percent owned by anglo american corp of 
south africa and de beers consolidated mines ltd is the largest 
producer of gold in the noncommunist world gold fields is the 
worlds secondlargest gold concern

the energy futures market turned mixed in light 
trading monday with gasoline and crude oil rising in price and 
home heating oil continuing to decline 
on the new york mercantile exchange the june contract for 
wholesale unleaded gasoline settled 139 cents higher at 7261 
cents a gallon the may contract which expired on friday had lost 
391 cents 
the june contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude rose 24 cents to 2066 a 42gallon barrel 
after falling 50 cents on friday 
june heating oil which gained 034 cent friday closed 031 
cent lower at 4946 cents a gallon heating oil has been on the 
decline in reaction to the warmer weather 
andrew lebow an energy analyst at edampf man international 
futures inc attributed the rise in gasoline to strong 
fundamentals which in turn helped push up crude prices 
were motoring into the driving season and approaching the 
memorial day holiday he said 
gasoline has been the markets star performer recently due to 
concerns of tight supplies for the summer driving season those 
concerns escalated following the exxon oil spill off the alaskan 
coast in march and a north sea explosion recently 
in a related move monday bp exploration raised the price of 
north slope alaskan crude by more than 2 a barrel pushing the it 
to its highest level in more than three years 
the increase is partly attributable to the prince william sound 
oil spill and interruptions of production in the north sea said 
chuck lodgsdon alaskas chief petroleum economist 
bp set its may contract price at 1977 on the gulf coast and 
1933 on the west coast the difference reflects a variation in 
transportation costs 
the prices represented a 225 a barrel increase on the gulf 
coast and 220 more on the west coast 
bp is the only north slope producer that makes its prices 
public but other north slope producers usually follow bps lead

repealing the barriers to interstate banking 
would remove handicaps on the industry in the national and 
international marketplace a member of the federal reserves board 
of governors said monday 
a repeal of such barriers could do much to level the global 
playing field and to restore american banks to prominence around 
the world h robert heller told the bankers association for 
foreign trade at its annual conference 
heller also said repeal of the glasssteagall act which bars 
banks from engaging in securities activities would benefit 
investors and borrowers and give customers better access to the 
securities markets 
he said american banks are retrenching in the world market 
while those in japan and western europe keep enlarging their share 
american banks international lending is down almost 15 percent 
to about 100 billion from its 1983 peak of 121 billion while 
japanese lending has gone from 28 billion to 129 billion german 
and swiss lending has more than doubled and british lending has 
expanded by nearly 50 percent he said 
in addition heller said japanese dominance has extended to the 
us market to no small extent because no bank is permitted to 
have a nationwide presence in the united states 
he said it might be argued more accurately that california and 
new york banks are competing against japanese and german banks 
at yearend 1987 111 japanese banks held over 40 percent of 
the deposits in the 500 largest banks in the world ninety us 
banks were in the top 500 but they accounted for only 11 percent 
of total deposits 
no us bank is among the largest 25 banks in the world and 
japanese banks occupy the top 10 positions he said 
heller said removing the barriers to interstate banking also 
would result in more diversified and safer instutitions a 
highly desirable result in these difficult times 
he said that while the presence of american banks abroad has 
decreased the reverse is true in this country where 259 foreign 
banks operate through subsidiaries branches and agencies with 
combined assets of more than 600 billion about 20 percent of 
total united states banking assets 
he said international banking has increased twice as fast as 
world trade over the past 25 years and four times as fast as world 
gross national product 
he said a new agreement on riskbased capital signed by a dozen 
major industrial nations known as the basle accord should help 
redress inequities among banks incorporated in different nations by 
establishing uniform capital standards for banks that are 
internationally active 
as for the banking and securities issue heller said the fed 
will review the situation within a year with an eye toward 
allowing bank holding companies to engage in underwriting and 
trading equity securities 
the fed recently granted limited securities powers to bank 
holding companies 
he said fulfillment of europes move toward a unified banking 
market and a uniform regulatory environment could mean the 
creation of the largest unified banking market in the world 
however a top european commission official told the group 
separately monday they need not fear a fortress europe or 
reciprocity that would shut them out when the european communitys 
trade barriers fall in 1992 
sir leon brittan vice president of the commission said the 
commissions objective is a liberalized competitive market as open 
as possible to the world 
as long as european community institutions are not discriminated 
against and genuinely have access to american markets bankers in 
this country have nothing to fear he said 
but a west german banking official said the ec should consider 
imposing reciprocity sanctions on japan to put pressure on that 
country to open its banking markets and to liberalize trade much 
as american and british banks have done with some success 
martin kohlhaussen a director of commerzbank in west germany 
said reciprocity is of absolutely no problem to american 
institutions in his country because of good banking relations 
our relations with japan however have not always been of this 
character he said 
kohlhaussen said west germany has used the reciprocity argument 
against japan to press japan for access to its market 
he said that japan often bring up the image of fortress 
europe probably to divert attention from fortress japan 
washington have been assuaged of their fears about a european 
fortress 
but he added that the united states represented a fortress 
where the doors were open but when you came in there were a whole 
lot of compartments a whole lot of rooms that were locked up one 
against the other

the chicago board of trade on monday said it has 
hired a university professor to study dual trading at the worlds 
largest commodites futures exchange 
sanford j grossman of princeton university will conduct the 
dual trading study in connection with the board of trades own 
review of trading practices 
dual trading which refers to a trader buying or selling futures 
contracts for himself and for customers has come under attack as a 
conflict of interest 
the announcement comes three months after disclosures of a 
federal investigation into suspected fraud at the board of trade 
and the chicago mercantile exchange 
the chicago board of trade has dedicated itself to evaluating 
all aspects of trading practices and market surveillance said 
karsten cash mahlmann chairman of the exchange 
commissioning this study is another step in this process 
one complaint is that dual trading creates a situation that 
allows a trader to first trade his own account in a way that would 
profit from price swings resulting from filing the customers 
order that action would violate law 
grossmans study of dual trading will be conducted in two parts 
officials said with the first explaining how the practice works 
completed by july the second study based on observing traders 
in the pits making dual trades is due in 1990 
grossman was a contributor to a report on the 1987 stock market 
crash commissioned by the new york stock exchange 
mahlmann said the board of trade has received many letters and 
other expressions of concern from commercial customers in our 
markets requesting that we maintain the practice of dual trading 
they understand the benefits it provides 
the exchange at the request of the commodities futures trading 
commission had conducted its own study of dual trading the study 
concluded the practice results in a better price for customer and 
adds to the liquidity of the market 
the study also contended that customers can choose to trade with 
a broker who does not trade for himself 
brokers and traders at the merc and the board of trade have been 
under investigation for two years by federal agents who suspect 
customers may have been defrauded of millions of dollars no 
charges have resulted from the investigation
