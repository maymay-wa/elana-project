in a move that reportedly shocked attorney 
general edwin meese iii the justice departments no 2 official 
and the head of the departments criminal division abruptly 
resigned tuesday as the nearly yearold criminal investigation of 
meese expanded into a new area of possible impropriety 
deputy attorney general arnold burns said in a letter to 
president reagan unfortunately i have regretfully concluded 
that i must return to private life at this time he did not 
elaborate 
william weld who as an assistant attorney general oversees all 
federal criminal investigations resigned effective at the close of 
the business day tuesday despite a personal plea from other 
department officials that he remain on for several weeks 
two of burns aides and two of welds aides also quit 
simultaneously 
meanwhile independent counsel james mckay subpoenaed payroll 
records and other documents of the washington chapter of the 
multiple sclerosis society in connection with a job meeses wife 
ursula got with the group 
washington attorney james bierbower legal counsel for the 
society and a board member said the records were delivered to 
mckay on monday 
the independent counsel is trying to determine whether longtime 
meese friend e robert wallach used his influence to help get mrs 
meeses 40000ayear job with the society in washington said 
several sources familiar with the probe speaking on condition of 
anonymity they confirmed a report carried by cbs news 
wallachs lawyer san francisco attorney george walker was 
quoted as saying in wednesday editions of the washington post that 
wallach played a peripheral role in meeses taking her position 
at the society 
however bierbower said the idea for hiring mrs meese came from 
the chapters executive director jean bradley 
bierbower said mrs meese had done volunteer work for the group 
since coming to washington in 1981 and we were delighted to be 
able to employ her to supervise a program that involves placing ms 
victims in jobs 
bierbower said mrs meese took the ms job instead of an offer to 
conduct a public service job on a radio station owned by the bender 
family the family operates a foundation which is contributing the 
40000 a year for mrs meeses salary said bierbower 
another top justice department official solicitor general 
charles fried said that the resignations were leading him to 
reconsider his future at the justice department 
the possibilities include my departure or that this is just a 
tempest in a teapot or many other things as well fried said 
fried who represents the government in the supreme court said 
he learned about the resignations on monday the day before meese 
was told 
despite the departure of the top aides meese said tuesday night 
he has no plans to resign no he responded to reporters who 
asked him whether he was about to step down 
after receiving a standing ovation from his staff at a final 
meeting tuesday afternoon weld told his aides that the continuing 
investigation involving the attorney general and wallach was 
casting a cloud that was having a negative impact on the 
justice department according to department sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
wallach is a san francisco attorney who is at the center of the 
criminal investigation with meese weld also told his aides that he 
was leaving at the end of the day because he didnt want to get 
into 50 fights and blood on the floor 
weld who publicly declined to discuss his reasons for 
resigning said he wasnt quitting because he might be upset over 
possible new information uncovered by mckay who has been 
investigating meese since last may 11 
another source familiar with events leading to the resignations 
said the precipitating factor at this time was an internal fight 
over the successor to stephen trott as associate attorney general 
the departments no 3 post 
burns quickly denied that however telling reporters tuesday 
night at the justice department that it was very silly to 
suggest such a scenario another department source who is close to 
meese said that the loss in the job fight was an irritant to 
burns and weld but certainly not the reason for their resignation 
burns unsuccessfully supported weld for this post according to 
this source weld was willing to stay on if he got the job but was 
unwilling to do so when he lost it in part because his two 
predecessors as criminal division chiefs lowell jensen and trott 
both had won the same promotion 
asked whether his departure had anything to do with the 
independent counsel probe weld said im not going to go into 
that 
weld said he had informed white house chief of staff howard 
baker at 7 am tuesday of the reasons for his resignation and 
informed meese an hour later i prefer that those matters remain 
confidential he added 
however meeses continuing legal problems have everything to 
do with why the two men quit said a department source familiar 
with the reasons for the resignations who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the unexpected resignations were the result of the fact that 
major things arent getting done at the justice department 
nothings moving because meese is under this cloud said another 
informed department source 
sens arlen specter rpa and carl levin dmich demanded 
that meese explain why the officials quit 
my thought is its absolutely necessary that the american 
people be told why these six burns weld and their aides have 
resigned specter said it appears to be unprecedented in the 
history of the justice department the department isnt operating 
when six resign together 
specter a member of the judiciary committee said it may be 
necessary to convene hearings if an explanation is not forthcoming 
meese first learned the two would step down when burns and weld 
walked into the attorney generals office at 8 am tuesday and 
informed him of the decision 
several department sources characterized meese as absolutely 
shocked by the decision 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president reagan 
accepted the resignations with regret and thanked burns and 
weld for serving with distinction 
fitzwater said reagan continues to have full confidence in 
meese and the justice department and that the resignations did not 
cause any particular concern among the president and his advisers 
we have people resigning all the time especially late in the 
administration he said 
meese has been under investigation for nearly 11 months by 
mckay who last may 11 began looking into meeses involvement with 
the scandalplagued wedtech corp the investigation has expanded to 
include his involvement in a 1 billion iraqi pipeline project 
mckays investigators are trying to determine whether meese may 
have been paid off by wallach or others in exchange for meeses 
assistance to wedtech or the pipeline 
meese has predicted repeatedly that he wont be indicted and has 
said he wont resign

the school board voted tuesday night to 
withhold a salary increase in the 198889 school year for joe 
clark the toughguy principal at innercity eastside high school 
after meeting in executive session for an hour the board voted 
61 to deny clark an increase on the grounds that he expelled 
students from the high school without due process was 
insubordinate in refusing to readmit the students when directed to 
do so and failed to maintain proper records and proper reporting 
procedures 
board member elease evans said she voted against the resolution 
because she thought the evidence was insufficent 
clark was not present but his attorney vickie donaldson met 
with the board for about 30 minutes and emerged saying she had 
spoken her peace she did not elaborate 
reached at home after the meeting clark said he would direct 
his attorney to work to reverse the boards decision 
but he also said the dispute was all worth it because the 
entire nation knows what buffoons exist on boards of education if 
it means that i lose an increment raise to make sure the nation 
is aware of the deficiencies pertinent to education then i 
think it only fitting and proper that i accept that outlandish 
punishment 
the board is still negotiating salary levels for next year so it 
is not clear how much money clark would stand to lose 
clark gained fame and plaudits from the reagan administration 
and most of his schools students and parents for his nononsense 
approach which included roaming the halls with a baseball bat and 
a bullhorn 
earlier the board had considered more severe action against 
clark such as suspending him

a japanese mathematicians widely publicized 
attempt to solve one of the most famous problems in mathematics 
appears to have failed a prominent american mathematician says 
i think its wrong said gerd faltings of princeton 
university who has examined a 20page manuscript prepared by 
yoichi miyaoka 
faltings who has won the disciplines prestigious fields medal 
for work related to the problem said monday he thought the error 
was fundamental enough that the proposed solution would have to be 
abandoned 
the problem is to prove fermats last theorem named for the 
french mathematician pierre de fermat who lived from 1601 to 1665 
fermats theorum states that if x to the nth power plus y to the 
nth power equals z to the nth power there is no solution for which 
n is a whole number greater than two 
nth power means the accompanying number is multiplied by 
itself n times the theorem assumes that x y and z are positive 
whole numbers 
fermat wrote in the margin of a notebook that he had devised a 
proof for his theorem but it was never discovered coming up with 
a proof has bedeviled mathematicians ever since 
miyaokas proposed proof was widely reported earlier this month 
after he presented it at west germanys max planck institute 
it looked pretty good to start out with but now it looks 
like the details are probably not going to go through said peter 
renz associate director of the mathematical association of america 
still its a very good way to go at the problem and the 
approach based on geometric work by soviet mathematician a 
parshin may still pay off renz said 
previous work has proven the theorum for cases in which n is 
less than 150000 he said for higher values no proof is yet 
available 
faltings had expressed doubt about the new work in the march 30 
issue of the chronicle of higher education

at 92 val browning piles his two 
dogs into a car each day and drives 17 miles to keep alive the name 
and reputation of the most prolific firearms inventor in history 
browning is the former president and now honorary chairman of 
the board of the firearms company named for his father john m 
browning who designed more than 80 military and sporting arms 
a list of john brownings inventions could serve as the 
framework for any history of firearms over the last century it 
includes the winchester model 1886 leveraction repeating rifle 
americas first smokelesspowder sporting rifle the automatic 
shotgun the colt 45 automatic pistol and all the machine guns 
used by us troops on land sea or air from world war i to the 
korean war 
he was a most unpretentious man you would never know he was a 
man of any renown to meet there was never any kind of show says 
val browning whose description of his father could apply equally 
to the son 
respected firearms inventor himself with 48 patents generous 
benefactor of colleges and hospitals decorated by belgian royalty 
val browning nevertheless has lived his life in the shadow of a 
giant 
he was such an extraordinary genius and accomplished so much 
that there wasnt much left to do in firearms design except to take 
advantage of modern materials and methods val browning said of 
his father during an interview at corporate headquarters 
indeed val brownings two most satisfying inventions were 
improvements to his fathers designs a quickloading feature for 
the automatic shotgun and a singletrigger mechanism for the 
overunder doublebarrel shotgun 
vals son john val browning 62 was president of browning for 
14 years until just before it was acquired in 1977 by fabrique 
nationale darmes de guerre of belgium he speaks with insight 
about the challenge his father faced as a son of the great inventor 
its a very difficult problem for him the younger browning 
said but i think that he always understood it he was always 
striving to do something on his own he just didnt sit down and 
live off the fame of his father and what he could do he did 
two years ago father and son returned to belgium where val 
browning had charge of his fathers firearms interests from 1920 to 
1935 and to northern france where as a young second lieutenant in 
1918 he instructed american troops in the use of two john browning 
inventions the 30caliber watercooled machine gun and the 
fabled browning automatic rifle or bar 
i was up at the front to keep track of them and to report on 
their performance val browning said 
his fathers 50caliber machine gun was produced too late for 
use in world war i a conflict triggered in 1914 when a john 
browningdesigned 32caliber pistol was used to assassinate 
austrian archduke franz ferdinand and his wife sophie at sarajevo 
eight years after the war at the fabrique nationale plant at 
liege john browning 72 suddenly took ill val browning who was 
with him recalls the moment 
he said son i think im dying i said no i dont think 
so i was of course trying to encourage him but he was and he 
did 
returning to his native ogden utah in 1935 val browning 
became president of the jm amp ms browning co and browning arms 
co a post he held until 1962 when he was succeeded by his son 
john 
but today only val browning remains associated with the 
sporting arms company formed the year after his fathers death 
thats one reason why i stayed on so there would be somebody 
with the name connected with it he said 
like his father val browning is a habitual walker and was 
before injuring his shoulder four years ago an avid hunter of 
duck pigeons and small game 
if i didnt eat what i shot i wouldnt shoot it he said 
touching on reasons he believes the sporting arms business has a 
rocky future 
population growth dwindling wildlife habitat and the general 
feeling against firearms in this country make it so that its 
rather an undesirable business to be in he said 
his son puts it another way the idea of going out hunting is 
considered somewhat reprehensible the same sensitivity does not 
seem to extend to fish 
val browning father of four and a widower since 1975 embraces 
life with an avidity and humor that belie his years his dogs beau 
and jill join him as he drives up weber canyon to company 
headquarters at mountain green he keeps busy there for three or 
four hours a day sometimes testfiring brownings latest line 
an early riser who walks two miles a day he quit smoking 50 
years ago when an errant cigarette ash ruined a good suit 
also i used to like a cocktail very much indeed and 
sometimes three of them but hes learned to sort of listen to 
what my system was trying to tell me and a single cocktail every 
couple of months in social settings to ease a natural shyness is 
all he allows himself 
he has the blood pressure of a 16yearold says his cook 
nancy clifford 
more refined than his frontier father he reads constantly has 
a substantial art collection and loves music 
im trying to understand atonal music but i think im a 
little bit too old for that he says in the deadpan that sets up 
the punchline in other words i cant whistle it

a rare first edition of edgar allan poes first 
book a collection of poetry written when he was 14 is to be 
auctioned by sothebys which calls it the most exciting book 
discovery in many years 
in the 161 years since its publication only 11 other copies of 
tamerlane and other poems have been found published in 1827 by 
an obscure boston printer when the poet short story writer and 
critic was 18 it could bring as much as 300000 at auction on 
june 7 
this 12th copy of the book was discovered in a bin of early 
20thcentury pamphlets on fertilizers and farming machines by a 
massachusetts book collector while he browsed at an antique barn in 
new hampshire the price was 15 
recognizing the title from an article he had once read the 
collector contacted sothebys for an inspection and appraisal 
it was quite a thrill said jay dillon an assistant vice 
president in sothebys rare books department god it was 
thrilling heres a fabulous rarity famous to anyone whos 
ever taken more than two courses in american literature 
the massachusetts man who collects books on local history said 
he suspected it might be an original when he found it though he 
wasnt sure he had the book only one night before turning it over 
to sothebys 
i knew i had found something great a piece of americana 
said the man who spoke in a telephone interview on 
condition of anonymity i knew it was valuable but never dreamed 
that it would mean this much money 
actually i didnt handle it real carefully when i first got 
it he said i thumbed through it i never read anything by 
poe in my life i really dont know too much about books 
poe who was born in boston in 1809 orphaned when he was 11 and 
raised in richmond va had the volume published during a short 
visit to boston 
the literary importance of the 40page book which names the 
author only as a bostonian is considered negligible rather 
the works value has to do with the fact that its the first work 
of one of americas greatest writers and a limited number of copies 
were printed 
how many were printed 
one can guess but they are all wild dillon said i think 
the range would be from 50 to 250 i would be amazed if more than 
500 were printed 
the softbound book has its original teacolored paper wrappers 
and is in unrestored condition the wrappers are frayed as one 
would expect in a 161yearold pamphlet dillon said theres 
also a light stain on the front cover running through first few 
pages 
but the condition of a book like this is not a matter of great 
importance among connoisseurs the question with this book is how 
can you get one at all i would prefer it to be in better 
condition i also would prefer to have poes signature on it 
nine of the other copies are in public institutions one is 
owned privately and the others whereabouts is unknown dillon said 
the first copy didnt surface until 1859 when an antiquarian 
bookseller in boston sent it along with a consignment of books to 
an agent in london who promptly snatched it up for the british 
museum a second copy turned up 23 years later in a bookshops 
sidewalk box it cost 15 cents and later sold at auction in 1892 
for 1850 
other copies have surfaced over the years through collections 
and dealers the 11th copy was discovered in 1954 and was auctioned 
by sothebys in 1974 for 123000 
the poems included in the book are tamerlane and a group poe 
called the fugitive pieces they are to dreams 
visit of the dead evening star never again printed 
imitation stanzas poem a wilderd being the 
happiest day and the lake 
the adolescent collection was not exactly the literary hit of 
the day one critic noted a book the critics read without 
praising and the ladies praised without reading 
however the complex and tortured artist was vindicated in later 
years through his sinister and compelling stories such as the pit 
and the pendulum and the masque of the red death and his 
musical and sensuous poems such as annabel lee and the 
raven 
he published two other volumes of poetry after tamerlane in 
1829 and 1831 poe died in 1849

on feb 15 1986 the amsterdam news printed a 
frontpage editorial calling upon mayor edward i koch to resign 
koch ignored it 
he also ignored the next weeks editorial and the one after 
that he has now ignored 110 consecutive editorials on the front 
page of new yorks oldest black newspaper each broadside demanding 
that he leave office 
the amsterdams weekly diatribe has become as much a part of new 
yorks clockwork as billy martins hiring and firing as yankee 
manager as the daily ebb and flow of commuters as 
alternatesideofthestreet parking 
mr koch is incredible every week he gives me something new 
something outrageous something wrong to write about says 
wilbert a tatum author of the editorials and editorinchief of 
the 40000circulation weekly 
while the amsterdam news generally comes down on the left side 
of the political spectrum it is considered the establishment black 
newspaper less radical than some others published in the city 
tatum has written antikoch editorials while traveling in 
zimbabwe sweden britain ethiopia he has focused on corruption 
racial tensions homelessness all of them blamed on the weak 
and fading koch 
koch is meanspirited and vindictive tatum wrote march 8 
1986 he postures preens and pontificates as he poses and 
pretends to be mayor of all the people of new york city tatum 
declared jan 3 1987 
certainly the business and social leadership in this town must 
realize that this city is going to hell in a basket under the 
leadership of koch how long will this outrage be allowed to 
continue he asked dec 6 1986 
koch plays it cool the mayors not commenting hes just 
going to let tatum have his say said a koch spokesman larry 
simonberg 
but in the course of a letter to the editor of the amsterdam 
news written earlier this year koch mentioned the newspapers 
incoherent diatribes against me each week written by a 
nonjournalist 
the first editorial was occasioned by the start of corruption 
scandals just months after kochs overwhelming reelection to a 
third term 
tatum along with much of the rest of the black community 
already had a difficult relationship with koch they had repeatedly 
accused him of insensitivity to the poor and minorities in 1984 
tatum debated the mayor on the radio in a confrontation that 
generated more heat than light 
but tatum said he was so shocked by the scandals that he was 
forced to take a stand on the front page when koch was still mayor 
a week later he wrote another editorial and resolved to keep 
writing them until koch left office he said he did not think he 
would still be doing it 109 issues later 
i thought it would take three weeks for the times the news 
and the post to realize there was a real danger of what would 
happen to this city due to the polarizing tactics of the present 
mayor tatum said 
tatum is saddened by the failure of the citys major dailies to 
join him he speculates that the awesome power of the mayor has 
something to do with it alluding darkly to tax abatements city 
contracts and the like 
though the common wisdom is that koch is safely ensconced in 
city hall tatum is convinced that he is making headway he says 
the citywide papers seem to be edging his way he says he is often 
accosted by people of all races who say keep it up 
he writes his editorials each wednesday at 5 am 2 hours 
before his deadline i am not able to do other things like this 
i type it myself and its done in a matter of minutes its 
that powerful 
he intends to keep at it i cant allow any fool to destroy 
what little relationships remain between the people of this city 
he says 
how long will he do it for as long as it takes he says

the imminent demolition of hong kongs 
86yearold synagogue to make way for highrise apartments has 
split the jewish community and enraged preservationists 
a group of local jews has sought the help of rabbis in israel 
and britain to save the synagogue and joined lastditch efforts to 
go to court to stop the wreckers ball 
im sorry that it has become such a controversial issue i 
never imagined that it would said robert dorfman chairman of 
the committee that manages the daytoday affairs of ohel leah 
synagogues 230family congregation which includes 23 different 
nationalities 
ohel leah has been the center of jewish life in this british 
colony since 1902 it was built by sir jacob sassoon an iraqi jew 
who came to hong kong from shanghai 
the stately white building with two short towers and an arched 
portico is set in a serene garden on a hillside above hong kongs 
central business district sassoon bequeathed the synagogue and 
surrounding land to the jewish community and set up a trusteeship 
to manage the property 
the plan to redevelop the site comes from the four jewish 
trustees who are led by lord kadoorie an influential tycoon with 
vast utility and hotel holdings the proposal calls for replacing 
the synagogue with a replica and putting up two apartment towers 
about 40stories high that will include a new jewish club 
supporters of the redevelopment plan argue that the old 
synagogue is unsafe and that bigger and better facilities are 
needed for a growing jewish community they maintain that the vast 
majority of the congregation supports the proposal 
opponents dispute the claims that the building is dangerous and 
argue that alternative redevelopment plans are viable under which 
the existing synagogue can remain 
the hong kong government already has overturned a vote by its 
antiquities advisory board to declare the building a proposed 
landmark and has approved a demolition permit for the developers 
but a loosely knit group of dissident congregation members 
banded under the name save our synagogue hope lord immanuel 
jakobovits the chief rabbi of england will issue a ruling that 
could halt the project 
in a letter to the englishlanguage south china morning post 
newspaper the synagogues general committee promised that the 
trustees intend to take his jakobovits advice on religious 
questions connected with the rebuilding of the synagogue 
jakobovits has yet to respond 
three years ago three rabbis from israel signed an opinion that 
quoted ancient commentaries and maimonides a 12th century jewish 
legal scholar in concluding that the synagogues destruction is 
strictly forbidden 
the rabbis ruled the building is one of the worlds city 
synagogues which maimonides said cannot be destroyed because they 
are for the use of all jews and become the property of all jews 
the synagogues trustees contend however that opinion is based 
on erroneous information 
save our synagogue members also are working with nonjewish 
preservationists in trying to save the building through 
bureaucratic and legal channels 
william meachem a member of the antiquities advisory board 
said he is raising 100000 hong kong dollars 12820 for legal 
fees to for action to require the government to put a hold on the 
project 
he described hong kongs overall preservation record as 
atrocious horrible maybe one of the worst in the world 
alan goldstein a member of the synagogues congregation has a 
photograph made of hong kong in the 1920s showing the synagogue as 
the only recognizable building still standing 
much of hong kongs architectural heritage has been replaced by 
commercial skyscrapers and highrise apartments that crowd around 
the territorys famed harbor 
every civilized society in this world today recognizes the 
importance of their cultural heritage and they have certain laws 
and regulations to protect the best examples of their heritage 
said david russell a senior lecturer of architecture at the 
university of hong kong 
our only hope is to try to persuade the government of its 
responsibility said russell although he held out little hope of 
success 
but dorfman insists the issue is for the jews alone 
who are these people who are they to get involved in this 
he said this is our synagogue this is our community

guerrilla leaders say they will not join any settlement of the 
war without meeting directly with the soviets whom they describe 
as the only other real party to the conflict 
how can the outcome of these agreements be binding on us 
when we have not participated as a real side said ahmad shah 
a moslem fundamentalist designated as president of the guerrilla 
regime 
pakistan said the question of symmetry a simultaneous end 
to soviet military assistance to the government and us aid to the 
guerrillas was the last unresolved issue 
zain noorani acting foreign minister said symmetry was a 
major concern for the united states and pakistan although 
outside the formal scope of the talks the united states and soviet 
union are the designated guarantors of the peace but washington 
has said it will accept the role only if there is a balance of 
obligations 
guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 1978 
and the soviet union sent military forces in december 1979 the 
estimated 115000 soviet soldiers in afghanistan would be withdrawn 
under terms of a peace agreement 
shah did not give a location for the proposed governments 
mountain headquarters if the jets come we can go from place to 
place no problem he said at guerrilla headquarters in 
peshawar pakistan 
he said the government would name a 14member cabinet within 90 
days consisting of two representatives from each of the seven 
guerrilla factions 
shah and zabiullah mojaddedi a moderate chosen as vice 
president are the designated administrators but real power would 
rest with the seven party leaders in an executive council directing 
the cabinet 
a third tier of government would be a council formed from a 
crosssection of society presumably including noncommunist 
members of the current kabul government 
according to shah the interim government would hold elections 
six months after the last soviet soldiers left afghanistan 
when we are convinced there is not a single russian man or 
woman civilian or military then we can say they are gone he 
declared 
none of the negotiating parties at geneva has taken a stand on 
the guerrilla vision of an islamic republic but none appears likely 
to embrace it 
pakistan speaks for the insurgents at the talks and has urged 
them to form a broadbased government possibly including 
communists to prevent another civil war when the soviets are gone 
gulbaddin hekmatyar chairman of the guerrilla alliance says 
neither washington nor moscow wants an islamic government in kabul 
he claims the united states sold out the guerrillas by striking a 
secret deal with the kremlin on peace in afghanistan 
shah said islamic rule is misunderstood largely because of 
irans example 
it is unfair for the world to judge that the real picture of 
an islamic government is ayatollah ruhollah khomeini he said 
an individual does not represent the real islam 
other countries should not be afraid shah said we will 
be busy for 100 years to reconstruct our country we will have no 
time to bother people

some contra fighters oppose the 
ceasefire accord signed by their leaders and the government and 
reports reaching the capital say renegade rebels are staging 
attacks in violation of a fragile truce 
the division between contra leaders and the fighters was evident 
monday at talks to work out the mechanics of a formal 60day 
ceasefire to begin friday 
after mondays session in sapoa diogenes hernandez membreno a 
rebel military commander told reporters 
i want to tell the nicaraguan people and the world that the 
combatants are not going to put down their arms until nicaragua is 
a democracy 
both the leftist sandinistas and the rebels declared an informal 
truce on march 21 the start of three days of talks that ended with 
a document designed to end the more than sixyear war mondays 
meeting was to discuss the location of zones where the contra 
fighters will gather during the official ceasefire 
the ceasefire agreement does not say whether the contras must 
lay down their weapons that issue seemingly would be one of the 
topics to be resolved during the technical meeting that was to end 
today in sapoa the same southern border post 90 miles south of 
managua where last weeks meeting was held 
on monday a source who has been reliable in the past told the 
associated press that an evangelical pastor enrique morales said 
there was fighting friday in the village of juste in central 
chontales province when rebels engaged sandinista troops two 
soldiers reportedly were kidnapped 
the same source said radio 15 de septiembre the clandestine 
rebel station broadcast from honduras to nicaragua reported that 
contras knocked down electric posts friday in southern zelaya 
province 
the radio also said there was fighting saturday in paiwas in 
the easternmost part of the central province of matagalpa 
the defense ministry said it did not have any official reports 
of combat but an officer who spoke on condition he not be further 
identified said its possible we know there are some contras 
not in agreement 
witness for peace the americanbased organization that 
documents contra abuses said on monday night it had heard of no 
truce violations 
on sunday interior minister tomas borge said pressure from the 
some sectors of the united states and dissident groups within the 
contra ranks were attempting to obstruct the ceasefire agreements 
a violation of the truce during last weeks ceasefire talks was 
written off by both sides as a result of poor communications 
in sapoa maj gen joaquin cuadra deputy defense minister and 
army chief of staff said on monday there had been violations of 
the truce of a minor character but we understand that they are due 
to the communications problem 
a rebel commander attending the sapoa talks walter calderon 
said it was difficult for both sides to explain the ceasefire 
agreement to their troops 
the contra fighters reportedly were caught off guard by the pact 
signed by rebel leaders who live in miami most of the combatants 
supplied with us goods ranging from uniforms to weaponry live 
the rough life of guerrillas roaming in the northern mountains and 
down through the central plains 
during the past year they garnered some degree of public support 
in the hinterlands where peasants sold food to the rebels and 
passed on sandinista troop information the war was described by 
military experts as stalemated 
the contras military ability grew enormously in 1987 with 
airdropped us supplies that were part of the 100 million 
package approved by the us congress in june 1986 the funding ran 
out feb 29 and no agreement has been reached on additional aid 
the loss of american support was said to be one of the main 
reasons the rebels agreed to the ceasefire the contras agreed in 
the pact to accept only nonlethal aid from a neutral organization 
such as the red cross but the contras also obtained promises from 
the sandinistas for democratic liberties 
for the sandinistas the agreement offers a chance to rebuild a 
shattered economy and calm widespread discontent over chronic 
shortages and mandatory military conscription 
the pact calls for the 10000 or so contras to move into special 
zones during the first 15 days of april the ceasefire is to last 
until june 1 conversations to work out final details were to be 
held during that time the first to be april 6 in managua 
the sandinistas also agreed to gradually release 3300 political 
prisoners the first 100 were freed sunday

a quick trip across the border on april 15th 
no longer will bring procrastinating taxpayers an automatic 
twomonth extension on their income taxes the internal revenue 
services says 
traveling taxpayers now must leave the country for at least two 
weeks including april 15th to qualify for the automatic extension 
which previously was available to those who fled the country for 
even a portion of tax day the irs said monday 
the irs had been considering such a change for about a year but 
hastened its decision after seeing airline advertisements that 
encouraged people to leave the country to delay their filing 
deadline said spokesman jeff krasney he said the ads also 
inaccurately suggested the irs was endorsing such behavior 
we didnt know if the ads would cause an abundance of 
individuals to take this extension krasney said we felt 
this would be one way to combat those ads 
the new ruling is effective for taxes due next month 
since the instructions already distributed to taxpayers say the 
extension is available to travelers who are out of the country on 
the 15th the irs will use some discretion in deciding who 
qualifies this year krasney said 
if people submit the proper documentation such as a trip 
notice we will take a look at it and determine if in fact that 
particular situation is legitimate he said the irs will weigh 
different types of factors to determine what is considered 
extenuating 
but no more of those quickie trips across the border he warned 
prior to this ruling if you lived in el paso texas and 
decided to travel to juarez mexico for lunch on april 15th 
you would be given an automatic extension he noted 
krasney said the crackdown wasnt being undertaken as a 
revenueenhancing step but rather to avoid possible abuse 
caused by the advertisements he had no estimate on how many 
taxpayers have taken advantage of the travelers extension 
provision in the past 
under the irs rules on travel some us territories are 
considered part of the country and others are not travel to puerto 
rico for example will not qualify taxpayers for the extension 
but a twoweek trip to guam american samoa or the virgin islands 
will net procrastinators two more months

the federal fund that insures deposits in 
commercial banks may lose money this year for the first time in its 
history but any shrinkage likely would be less than 5 percent the 
head of the fund says 
whether the federal deposit insurance corp loses money depends 
on how much it costs the government to rescue first republicbank 
corp of dallas fdic chairman l william seidman told reporters 
monday 
the deterioration of texas banks hard hit by losses on real 
estate and energy loans has raised concern about the health of the 
fund which backs deposits of up to 100000 in 13700 commercial 
banks 
earlier this month the fdic pumped 1 billion into first 
republicbank the largest bank company in texas to stem a run on 
deposits 
seidman said in a luncheon speech it is too soon to tell how 
much more it will cost to fully restore the banks health but he 
said published estimates of 5 billion to 6 billion are far 
higher than anything likely to be required 
a better guide he said would be the 17 billion it cost the 
government in 1984 to rescue continental illinois bank amp trust co 
which was about the same size as first republicbank 
if the bailout is in that range and if banks as expected fail 
at about the same rate as last year then the fdics 1988 loss 
would be something under 5 percent certainly under 1 
billion seidman said 
he said he did not see any prospect for what he termed a 
substantial loss one approaching 20 percent or about 35 billion 
last year the fdic posted a slight increase even though a 
postdepression record of 184 banks failed fortyfour banks have 
failed so far this year and seidman said he expected the 1988 total 
to be roughly the same as 1987 
as failures have increased the steady growth of the fdic fund 
from 46 billion in 1970 to 116 billion in 1980 and 179 
billion in 1985 has slowed the fund finished 1986 with 182 
billion and 1987 with 183 billion 
seidman contrasted the relatively healthy condition of the fdic 
fund with that of the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
which insures deposits in 3170 savings institutions 
fslic was insolvent until last fall when money began flowing 
from congressionally authorized bond sales it has had to keep 
bankrupt sampls open because it lacked the money to pay off 
depositors

lamb production is at a seasonal peak because 
of this years earlier religious holidays and will ease down 
somewhat in the next few months says an agriculture department 
report 
with easter and passover coming up this weekend lamb production 
in the first quarter may reach about 80 million pounds and then 
drop back to around 78 million pounds in the second quarter 
according to the departments economic research service 
lambs on feed for the slaughter market were up 18 percent on 
jan 1 1988 the report said these supplies should be 
available during the first half of the year and could push 
production up about 6 percent 
lamb and mutton take a farback seat with american consumers but 
are still an important part of the us food and agricultural 
sector this year for example per capita consumption may be about 
14 pounds compared with an average of around 83 pounds of 
poultry 72 pounds of beef 63 pounds of pork and 15 pounds of 
veal 
the jan 1 inventory of all sheep and lambs in the united states 
rose 4 percent from a year earlier to 108 million head which 
agency economists said represented the second year of expansion 
following several years of profitability in the sheep business 
the west showed the biggest increases in the ewe flock about 
6 percent above a year ago they said in the april issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine in the great plains sheep 
inventories increased a little over 2 percent from a year ago most 
of this expansion occurred outside of texas which has the largest 
inventory of any state 
analysts said they were surprised by a decline in the sheep and 
lamb inventory east of the rocky mountains including a 4 percent 
drop in the north central states the southeast was down 5 percent 
on jan 1 after a 12 percent increase a year earlier 
but the declines in the inventories were not sharp enough to 
offset larger numbers elsewhere which the west and the great 
plains made up most of the breeding flock 
lamb prices averaged about 78 per 100 pounds liveweight last 
year up from around 69 in 1986 market prices may decline 
somewhat in 1988 however according to usda projections 
although lambs are a major part of the sheep business so is 
wool and the rise in inventories boosted shorn wool production in 
1987 to 858 million pounds up 1 percent from 1986 that was the 
first yeartoyear increase since 1981 when shorn wool output rose 
to 1098 million pounds from 1054 million in 1980 
wool output peaked at 388 million pounds in world war ii before 
beginning its decline reflecting the longterm slide in us sheep 
production

agriculture department scientists are hopeful 
that one of the costliest crop pests of farmers and home gardeners 
may one day be curbed by a natural enemy a microscopic killer worm 
that searches the soil for the corn rootworm 
the tiny worm or nematode is called steinernema feltiae after 
infecting the rootworm the nematode releases a bacterium that 
kills the pest then said usda entomologist jan j jackson the 
nematode uses the larvas body as a place to reproduce while it 
feasts on bacteria and larva tissue 
about 10 days later hundreds of new nematodes emerge and start 
searching for more rootworms 
that gives you an advantage over chemical controls he said 
monday in a report by the departments agricultural research 
service a chemical just sits there and waits for the rootworm to 
come to it the nematode doesnt wait 
but jackson found that the nematodes dont persist in the ground 
long enough to eliminate a rootworm infestation in one field trial 
where he works at the departments northern grain insects reseach 
laboratory brookings sd jackson applied 100000 nematodes to 
the base of each of several corn plants reducing rootworm damage 
11 percent 
jackson said that is not an acceptable level of control but he 
expects further research could lead to protection as good as from 
chemical insecticides a separate test with a chemical reduced root 
damage 44 percent 
rootworm larvae destroy corn roots and adults feed on the 
leaves tassels and ears jackson said us corn producers spend 
nearly 350 million a year to fight the rootworms nematodes 
probably could be produced at about the same cost without the risk 
of chemical injury to farmers and the environment

agriculture department to market a genetically engineered vaccine 
to control pseudorabies in swine a contagious disease that can be 
deadly to newborn pigs 
the vaccine will be marketed by syntrovet inc lenexa kan 
said james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service he said monday the new vaccine is 
the third live genetically engineered product licensed by the 
department for pseudorabies vaccination 
we have concluded the new vaccine is both safe and 
effective glosser said our scientists have reviewed and 
analyzed the procedures used to develop the vaccine its biological 
and safety characteristics and the safety and effectiveness data 
gathered during field trials in three states 
further he said an environmental assessment concluded that use 
of the vaccine would have no significant impact on the human 
environment 
during field trials the new vaccine was administered to more 
than 400 swine including baby pigs weaned pigs and sows 
glosser said no adverse reactions were noted 
pseudorabies also known as aujeskys disease or mad itch does 
not affect humans although the disease caused an estimated 22 
million in losses to the swine industry last year it is not a 
public health problem he said

elders of the assemblies of god on 
monday began debating how long tv evangelist jimmy swaggart should 
be barred from preaching 
the 232member general presbytery meeting in a twoday 
closeddoor session will have the final say on punishment against 
the fireandbrimstone preacher accused of hiring a prostitute to 
pose naked for him 
this is not a meeting to determine the guilt or innocence of 
jimmy swaggart he has already confessed said church spokeswoman 
juleen turnage they are here to make a decision on what will be 
done with his credentials 
the presbyters met for about six hours monday the was no 
immediate word on the progress of the deliberations 
swaggart who did not attend mondays meeting tearfully stepped 
down from his pulpit feb 21 admitting to unspecified sin 
published reports have said he paid a prostitute to pose naked 
the churchs louisiana district has proposed a threemonth 
suspension from the pulpit despite a request by the churchs 
national leaders to reconsider 
church leaders noted that every other assemblies minister who 
has confessed to moral failure has been barred from the pulpit for 
at least a year 
the churchs board of directors kept off mondays agenda a 
compromise proposal put forward by an arkansas church member said 
mrs turnage 
the compromise reportedly would bar swaggart from the pulpit for 
a year but allow him to give personal testimony about what he has 
learned from his sin it would also cut the assemblies of god out 
of an estimated 12 million a year in swaggartraised funds 
mrs turnage said the rev g raymond carlson general 
superintendent of the assemblies and chairman of the meeting would 
brief members on swaggarts transgression and members would also be 
given documentation 
no witnesses will be called and the case will be decided by 
majority vote she said 
a new orleans tv station reportedly had been asked to show 
assemblies officials a videotape of an interview with a prostitute 
who claims to have posed naked for swaggart 
mrs turnage said carlson and others had seen a videotape 
monday she would not comment on the nature of the tape and said it 
would not be shown to the board 
the springfield newsleader reported monday that a little rock 
ark lawyer and assemblies member had helped work out a plan that 
would bar swaggart from preaching for a year attorney cliff 
jackson told the newspaper that the plan would allow swaggart 
during that yearlong period to give personal testimony 
under the plan the assemblies of god would no longer accept 
funds from swaggarts multimilliondollar ministry to avoid the 
appearance of conflict of interest 
swaggart contributes an estimated 12 million a year to the 
assemblies foreign missions programs which had a total budget of 
about 142 million last year 
jackson who met with assemblies officials sunday said the 
proposal had been endorsed by both swaggart and louisiana church 
officials 
mrs turnage said the executive presbytery the churchs board 
of directors decided not to put jacksons proposal on the general 
presbyterys agenda 
she would not comment on what the board thought of the proposal 
saying only that procedures do not allow for outsiders to get items 
put on the agenda for such meetings 
however she said jackson sent copies of the 10page proposal 
to every member of the general presbytery and any one of them 
could bring the proposal up for a vote

with those words gordon satch carlson an english teacher 
and newspaper columnist from anchorage alaska won the 11th 
international imitation hemingway competition on monday at where 
else harrys bar amp american grill 
the hairs kept coming his entry continued tiny hairs and 
black and there was nothing for it nothing for it at all but 
shaving 
carlsons winning parody of the late novelist ernest hemingways 
manly prose went on and on for 350 words discussing the hirsute 
portions of a mans body then an estranged woman then more 
shaving drinking wine and then drinking more wine 
the dozen judges fortified with their own glasses of wine 
muttered things like holy cow as they pored over the entries 
then argued spiritedly and after some mysterious process decided 
upon the winner among the 21 finalists 
author barnaby conrad one of the judges said carlsons entry 
contained qualities lacking in others namely a beginning middle 
and an end the hemingway cliche and the pun 
the punny last paragraph of carlsons piece read as follows 
she turned lifting her thin american lip over those thin white 
perfect american teeth and that thin american sneer its only a 
nick adams she said 
nick adams was a character in several hemingway stories 
carlson gets a round trip for two to italy with dinners at 
another harrys bar in florence 
in a brief biography provided to judges carlson claimed that he 
was once thrown out of reading class and that he moved to alaska 
about 20 years for reasons that remain obscure to him he gave 
his profession as social gadfly 
carlson who was not present for the judging did not 
immediately return a telephone message monday 
at the anchorage daily news where carlson writes a weekly 
column on state and local issues city editor pat doughterty said 
he can be both very funny and quite acerbic and opinionated he 
basically is a humor columnist 
carlson who doughterty guessed was 41 also writes a column for 
the national magazine auto week and teaches english at bartlett 
high school in anchorage 
he and the other 20 finalists were among 2432 entries from all 
50 states and more than a dozen foreign countries despite the 
authors globehopping exploits none of the entries bore a foreign 
postmark 
the judges were to include jack hemingway son of ernest but he 
did not attend because of illness other judges were newspaper 
columnist herb caen authors ray bradbury and cyra mcfadden and 
poet lawrence ferlinghetti 
the entries went the rules of the contest had to sound like 
hemingway read like hemingway they know that funny is good and 
very funny is very good 
entrant 66 wrote there were many cows but no bulls i 
respect this place nick said it is an honest place this 
could be the capital of the world 
in entry 366 the president looked at the woman he called 
nancy other men also called her nancy 
sticking to the political season finalist 287 told how in 
spring a fellow named gary took the young woman to the bahamas 
avoiding reporters and living on rum and sun and the catch of the 
day he had not taken his wife 
number 1400 dealt with a farewell to arms legs feet and 
neck while 923 sought glitter in a farewell to lunch 
in another nick adventure entrant no 1507 portrayed the hero 
gazing into a plate of trout amandine his eye lingered over a 
big twobreasted capon all the while leaning on a wall of pasta

a private task force is recommending a series 
of actions to provide fit livable and affordable housing for all 
americans by the year 2000 starting with a firstyear 
appropriation of 3 billion 
the report of the national housing task force issued monday 
urges that half the money go to the states as matching funds and 
the remaining 15 million go to cities with no matching 
requirement and few bureaucratic rules on how it is to be spent 
the task force said housing for most poor americans is 
unavailable unaffordable or unfit it said the 3 billion seed 
money should stimulate state and local efforts to develop renovate 
and conserve lowincome housing and to produce 150000 to 200000 
units 
james w rouse a nationally known developer and chairman of the 
26member task force called attention to the growing percentages 
of women and children among the homeless 
this isnt your typical hobo this isnt a person who is a 
drug addict or alchoholic or lazy rouse told a news conference 
these are people who want a place to live and in our country 
think of it theres no place to live i dont think this has ever 
before happened in our country that people like this have nowhere 
to live 
the report recommended that the governments rental assistance 
program be increased by 200000 units instead of the 100000 in the 
1989 federal budget the added cost would be 380 million a year 
it said 
samuel r pierce the secretary of housing and urban 
development issued a statement saying that fresh ideas on low 
income housing always were welcome but the statement went on to 
say that several of the recommendations call for significant 
increases in federal spending and will require require difficult 
budget decisions by the administration and congress 
the national association of realtors praised the report as a 
step in the right direction 
sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the subcommittee on 
housing and urban affairs said the report is of historic 
importance and copies will be sent to all presidential candidates 
sen alfonse m damato of new york the subcommittees ranking 
republican said a decent place to live is no longer the problem 
of the poor and homeless but the call comes from millions of 
families particularly young families 
the report said that from 1973 to 1983 45 million units half 
occupied by lowincome households were lost to the rental market 
either through demolition or structural conversion 
those who struggle with modest or minimal incomes represent a 
cross section of america said the report they are young 
middle aged elderly disabled they are single parents and intact 
families they are working 
the task force recommended that substantial new capital be 
raised by establishing benevolent loan funds accepting deposits at 
low interest rates from socially motivated investors and 
lending it at belowmarket rates to lowincome housing developers

there must be greater emphasis on preserving and improving 
existing lowincome housing and renovation of thousands of units 
the report said and it called for use of taxexempt financing and 
a commitment by the federal government to adequate rental 
assistance it also said the government should allow the federal 
housing administration to offer mortgages to more moderate income

homelessness is a problem that cant wait and recommended that

as vice president george bushs grip on the 
republican presidential nomination tightens more and more people 
are asking the no 2 question 
whom will he choose as his running mate 
bush says its too early to think about it 
former president richard nixon suggests white house chief of 
staff howard h baker jr baker says he doesnt expect to be asked 
because he wouldnt bring the right strength to the ticket 
others propose california gov george deukmejian deukmejian 
says he couldnt accept because he would leave his state in the 
hands of a democratic lieutenant governor 
nixon in a forthcoming london sunday times political column 
says the ideal formula is to pick your principal rival as 
president reagan did with bush but he suggests maybe the 
campaign between bush and senate minority leader bob dole has been 
too bitter for that 
some have another idea not principal rival but wife of 
principal rival how about secretary of transportation elizabeth 
dole 
and so it goes 
nixon argues that baker a tennessean and former senate 
republican leader would be helpful in southern states and in 
dealing with congress 
in a recent television interview baker said george bush 
needs to find someone who will bring strength to the ticket on a 
regional and political basis and i think that is not going to be 
me 
he didnt say he would turn it down if someone asked me to do 
it he said i would have a very difficult time trying to 
figure out what i was going to say but he added i do not 
wish that to happen 
baker has mentioned former tennessee gov lamar alexander 
deukmejian of california new jersey gov thomas kean and former 
pennsylvania gov richard thornburgh as good choices for the vice 
presidential slot 
if deukmejian left office in midterm lt gov leo t mccarthy 
a democrat would become governor of the nations largest state at 
a news conference in sacramento recently the california governor 
said even if they did ask me to accept the vice presidential 
nomination i wouldnt be able to take it later he added 
that doesnt mean i wouldnt like to be vice president 
another possibility rep jack kemp of new york who ran as a 
conservative alternative to bush for the presidential nomination 
but fared poorly 
also mentioned is sen nancy kassebaum of kansas she was on a 
long list of potential reagan running mates in 1980 but took 
herself out of consideration because as a freshman senator she 
said she didnt have enough experience she has eight years more of 
it now 
if bush should decide to choose a midwesterner to strengthen 
the ticket in a region that could be crucial to republican hopes 
another possibility would be illinois gov james thompson who 
endorsed the vice president and campaigned for him in the illinois 
presidential primary 
other names that have been mentioned include sen alan simpson 
of wyoming doles deputy in the senate leadership secretary of 
education william j bennett sen phil gramm of texas an 
architect of the congressional deficitreduction mechanism and 
colin powell the presidents national security adviser and one of 
the topranking blacks in the reagan administration 
all of this of course assumes that the vice president wins the 
nomination he is way ahead and dole said last week i think 
its probably a foregone conclusion whats happening on the 
republican side 
bush asked whether he would consider dole as a running mate 
said its too early for me to start thinking about any running 
mates that would project a certain arrogance or presumption that i 
dont want to do

fund raising for a proposed 4 million 
memorial to black revolutionary war patriots will begin soon since 
president reagan has approved placing the monument in the citys 
main tourist district 
project coordinator maurice a barboza said the memorial would 
be the first prominently displayed monument in washington dedicated 
to blacks 
barboza said monday that the president signed legislation friday 
permitting the proposed memorial to the 5000 black veterans to be 
placed in area i which includes the mall stretching from the 
capitol to the lincoln memorial the grassy ellipse behind the 
white house lafayette park and west potomac park 
the next step will be to study specific site plans being 
developed by three architectural firms and submitting the best one 
to the national capital memorial commission barboza said 
the commission and other agencies must recommend a site before 
it goes to the secretary of interior for final approval 
barboza a virginia lawyer who has devoted himself fulltime to 
the memorial project said he hoped to have the interior department 
approval and start work on a design competition in six months 
construction of the memorial must begin by the end of 1991 under 
an authorizing measure signed into law in late 1986 barboza said 
july 4 1991 is the target date for construction to begin 
barboza predicted the memorial would cost about 4 million and 
said he hoped to announce a major fundraising effort within 
several months 
barboza said he hopes to built the black patriots memorial on 
the mall near the lincoln memorial washington monument and 
constitution gardens 
legislation allowing the construction of the memorial was 
enacted in 1986 but another measure was needed to allow it to be 
built in the citys monumentcrowded area i that complex procedure 
was established by officials who worried that the citys prime 
tourist areas would become cluttered with memorials 
the black patriots legislation was pushed through congress by 
rep nancy l johnson rconn whom barboza enlisted in his fight 
several years ago he is formerly of plainville conn in mrs 
johnsons district

richard gephardt did so poorly in michigans 
caucuses that he knew his race was over but he wasnt ready to 
announce it yet and one of those ugly scenes of modern politics 
unfolded 
in the death throes of his campaign gephardt attracted a large 
press contingent an aide to a rival muttered something about a 
death watch and said to the reporters stay away from us for 
a while 
gephardt ended his speech and headed for a hotel room with his 
wife jane the crowd pursued some walking backward in front of 
him television lights glaring down a maze of corridors finally 
gephardt reached the sanctuary of an elevator 
one elderly man caught up in the stampede fell on his face 
onto the concretehard floor the crowd stepped around him 
reporters pressed gephardt to say he would get out of the race 
did that do you a lot of good senior aide dick moe snapped 
bitterly at one reporter who has covered gephardt throughout the 
campaign 
one television reporter perhaps not realizing gephardt was at 
the end of his candidacy persisted in asking the congressman how 
he expected to do in wisconsins primary 10 days later 
gephardt press secretary ali webb was carrying a pair of red 
boxing gloves a gift from supporters presented two days earlier 
congressman i have some boxing gloves here if you need 
them she said 
i knew you brought those along for a reason said jane 
gephardt

on the eve of his victory in michigan jesse jackson spent one 
of those campaign days a candidate hopes for the crowds were 
overflowing and raw emotion was evident 
scores stayed outside the door at a church rally in flint even 
after the fire marshal said the building was too full 
always appealing to the nations downtrodden jackson even 
campaigned among those who are arguably the most disaffected and 
certainly his most captive audience inmates at the wayne county 
jail 
only those jailed on misdemeanors were allowed to meet him 
since the inmates werent felons they could vote and while his 
real audience may have been the television cameras jackson 
reminded the inmates they could cast absentee ballots 
the next day in milwaukee jackson appeared humbled by the 
dimensions of his win he spoke of a lot of poetry a lot of 
history 
what did he think he was asked of calls by party elders for 
democrats to nominate the candidate who leads in delegates at the 
end 
having just scrambled the democratic race probably assuring no 
one will win a majority through the primary season jackson paused 
and smiled 
at the end he said simply

at the macedonia missionary baptist church in flint jackson 
urged his mostly black audience to raise its expectations 
doors shut in your face i understand he said i was

contribution and referred to the expensive designer clothing some 
wore 
i want you to give tonight like you dress give guccily

vice president george bush saying one of the 
best things that happened to me was getting my brains kicked out in 
iowa is moving to consolidate his mounting republican support 
while vowing to whip the democrats 
with an unassailable lead for the gop presidential nomination 
bush on monday picked up the endorsement of rep jack kemp and 
with the expected withdrawal of distant rival sen bob dole 
looming bush talked of smooth sailing ahead for his campaign 
here for three days of campaigning in advance of the april 5 
wisconsin primary bush told an invitationonly rally in a high 
school in nearby cedarburg late monday i dont put too much 
stock in the polls but they do look good 
i will not project an arrogance i will not project 
overconfidence he added 
but bush brimmed with optimism saying kemps endorsement was 
good because what we want to do is to have this party unified 
together so we can whip the democrats 
one of the best things that happened to me was getting my 
brains kicked out in iowa bush told his audience got beaten 
beaten fair and square and came in third 
everybody had me dead and buried but we were resurrected 
right there in new hampshire so people say now things are going 
pretty well for you and they are 
earlier monday kemp joined bush at a news conference in 
milwaukee to announce his support george bush is going to be the 
nominee of the republican party hes earned it kemp said 
the new york congressman dropped out of the race earlier in the 
month after poor showings in new hampshire south carolina and in 
super tuesday contests 
both kemp and bush said discussion of a possible vice 
presidential bid did not come up 
kemp said my support is unequivocal for bush even though he 
had felt he himself was the best candidate for republican 
conservatives 
the voters believed otherwise kemp said 
as to a dole withdrawal bush said that was a decision for the 
senate minority leader to make on his own im just going to keep 
on campaigning bush said 
later he told reporters im not in a position to be telling 
dole what to do 
he said the general election contest will be close it will be 
tough i cannot act like i have this nomination in the bag 
however bush suggested a victory in wisconsin would do just 
that and his sights were clearly set on the general election 
contest beyond repeatedly speaking of the importance of party 
unity 
bush said he would take his case to the american people 
reflecting efforts to lay a groundwork for the general election 
campaign 
its a national messsge he told the rally in cedarburg 
this time im going all the way to the white house he 
said noting he had spoken at a campaign appearance in the town in 
1980 in his thenunsuccessful presidential bid 
as he has done before bush blamed democrats in congress for the 
nations 150 billion budget deficit vowed to work to reduce the 
tax on capital gains and echoed president reagans pledge to veto 
allencompassing stopgap spending legislation 
and also taking a cue from reagan bush declared im not 
going to raise your taxes period

as sandinista government and rebel 
negotiators met to work out details for a 60day ceasefire a 
contra commander vowed the rebels wont lay down their arms until 
nicaragua adopts democratic reforms 
the negotiators who met monday are considering the areas where 
the rebels known as contras will gather during the ceasefire 
which is to begin friday under the peace accord signed last week in 
sapoa 
after about two hours of discussions monday the talks were 
recessed until today and rebel leaders said there remained 
obstacles 
highlevel talks aimed at reaching a more permanent truce are 
scheduled for april 6 in managua the capital 
the leader of the sandinista delegation maj gen joaquin 
cuadra deputy defense minister and army chief of staff told 
reporters on monday we come with the same spirit will and 
decision of the first meeting 
leading the usbacked contras was aristides sanchez a 
director of the umbrella nicaraguan resistance alliance he told 
reporters the rebels presented their plan to the government 
the rebel representatives included walter calderon a former 
national guardsman now known as commander tono luis moreno payan 
who uses the name commander mike lima and is chief of contra 
military intelligence luis fley or commander johnson chief of 
rebel operations in northern nicaragua and diogenes hernandez a 
commander whose units operate in central nicaragua 
after mondays meeting hernandez told a news conference i 
want to tell the nicaraguan people and the world that the rebel 
combatants are not going to put down their arms until nicaragua is 
a democracy 
he said defense minister humberto ortega proposed last week that 
a marxist democracy be established but hernandez said the contras 
want a real democracy like costa rica 
cuadra declined to respond to hernandezs remarks and said 
mondays talks dealt with the mechanics of the meeting he said 
the rebels made no proposals to define the zones where the contras 
would gather under a truce 
we are hoping for an agreement before april 1 he added 
a temporary ceasefire has been effect since march 21 
cuadra said there had been violations of the truce of a minor 
character but we understand that they are due to the 
communications problem 
sanchez said that in a few days the rebels will free the 
sandinistas they are holding captive he did not give details 
others in the sandinista delegation were deputy foreign minister 
victor hugo tinoco and military intelligence chief maj ricardo 
wheelock roman 
on sunday the leftist sandinista government fulfilled the first 
part of the ceasefire accord by freeing 100 political prisoners 
under an amnesty program most of them were accused of activities 
linked to the contras 
under the sapoa agreement rebel forces are to gather without 
interference from sandinista forces in specified zones inside 
nicaragua during the first two weeks of april mondays talks 
between special commissions of the two sides could be extended and 
were to define the location size and modus operandi of those 
zones according to the text of the sapoa accord 
nothing is said in the sapoa agreement about the contras laying 
down their arms in past talks the rebels insisted on keeping 
their weapons until all provisions of an accord were carried out 
once rebel fighters have moved into the truce zones the contra 
leadership can send up to eight delegates to participate in 
national reconciliation talks on april 6 
last weeks pact provides a gradual amnesty for nicaraguas 
3300 political prisoners guarantees freedom of expression and 
permits all exiles to return home and participate in the political 
process

jackson is my third name im adopted the 
candidate told the overflow church audience 
never slept in my fathers house one night never watched him 
shave stayed with my grandmother till my mother got on her feet 
i understand 
doors shut in your face i understand 
born in the slum i understand 
then jesse jackson drove home the point with his own life as an 
example of hope 
i was born in the slum but the slum wasnt born in me 
jesse jackson this time was speaking in flint mich where he 
won a runaway victory in saturdays primary election but the 
message is about the same everywhere he goes he tells those 
listening 
dont give up on yourself we the people can win 
that emotional message and jacksons campaign theme of 
economic justice have served him well in his 1988 presidential 
campaign with a string of wins in eight states and several 
secondplace finishes making him the popular vote frontrunner and 
in a virtual tie with michael dukakis in the delegate count 
as crowds flock to hear him around the country it is apparent 
that jacksons compelling oratory and celebrity status generate 
excitement not only among the downtrodden but also in affluent 
communities like georgetown the nearly allwhite domain of 
washingtons welltodo 
on a recent visit jackson emerged from his limousine to find 50 
squealing school children who grabbed for his hands and begged him 
to visit their classrooms 
after he led the captivated group in a chant of i am 
somebody my mind is a pearl down with dope up with hope an 
eighth grader giggled that he had kissed her forehead 
her friend bubbled it was great 
students from nearby georgetown university rushed out to their 
porches to shake his hand jackson was the spontaneous toast of the 
most elite neighborhood of the nations capital whose residents 
have included presidentstobe diplomats and senators 
it is a long way from the textile town of greenville sc 
where an illegitimate son was born to a teenage girl and the 
married man next door on oct 8 1941 
that child grew up to be a fiery civil rights leader an 
electrifying orator a presidential candidate who says he knows 
the american people better than anybody running 
i know slave and slave master he told an audience in his 
hometown of greenville 
he recalls growing up in a segregated south where he had to ride 
in the back of the bus and sell soft drinks in a whitesonly 
stadium 
his mother who married the man who adopted him and gave him the 
name jackson worked as a maid for whites 
but his background was not cause for despair jackson tells his 
audiences 
i was born in the underclass i know how to get out because i 
got out 
from greenville he went to university of illinois on a sports 
scholarship after a year he transferred to north carolina aampt 
where he was the student body president star quarterback and civil 
rights leader 
after graduating he entered the chicago theological school but 
dropped out to go south in the mid 1960s and join dr martin luther 
king jr in the struggle for civil rights 
jacksons actions in the aftermath of kings death have led to 
speculation that he set himself up as kings heir apparent 
manipulating the spotlight to himself by showing up in chicago in a 
shirt he claimed was stained with kings blood 
while he was present at the memphis motel where king was felled 
in 1968 others who were there have contradicted jacksons claim 
that he cradled the slain leader in his arms 
jackson has never held elective office but his career since 
then has kept him in the public eye almost continuously 
he founded the chicagobased operation push which battled a 
number of corporations over hiring practices and franchise 
arrangements that jackson said were racist 
by 1984 jackson was ready to run for president spurred on by 
the chants of black audiences across the country who urged him to 
run jesse run 
his powerful eloquence fired up audience after audience as he 
raced around the country and the world on a shoestring budget and a 
chaotic campaign 
he flew to cuba to meet with fidel castro and nicaragua to meet 
president daniel ortega 
he infuriated jews by using the term hymie and hymietown and by 
associating with nation of islam leader louis farrakhan who called 
judaism a gutter religion 
he took on the democratic party attacking party rules as 
exclusionary and unfair 
jackson emerged from the campaign with more 3 million votes 
then supported the democratic ticket and went on to help register 
large numbers of voters in the south 
his approach in 1988 has been one of fencemending and reaching 
out to new constituencies aware that democrats saw him as a 
polarizing and divisive force in 1984 he has set himself up as a 
peacemaker 
he refrains from attacks on his opponents and encourages them to 
focus on issues not attacks 
and jackson urges americans to look at his example to see what 
is possible in life he told a crowd of union workers in detroit 
many of you are doing less than your best because your spirit is 
broken 
you think i cant win because you think you cant win i can 
win and you can win expect your child ought to have a 
firstclass education expect you should live in a decent house 
you raise your expectations hold your head high know youre 
somebody

nasa is taking a slow cautious 
approach in returning space shuttles to flight but a leading 
shuttle engineer says that doesnt mean anyone at the agency is 
afraid to fly 
i dont see anybody in the decisionmaking process who is 
reticent about pressing on and lets get back in the air 
personally i have no hestitancy about returning to flight john 
thomas said monday 
thomas is manager of the team that has redesigned and is testing 
the solid fuel booster rocket that caused the shuttle challenger 
explosion 26 months ago the accident killed the seven crew 
members and the remainder of the fleet has been grounded while 
nasa tests the redesigned booster joint 
workers here have begun assembling the first of the two booster 
rockets intended to propel the shuttle discovery into space when 
flights resume nasa has set a launch date of aug 4 
weve been very careful with our design and test programs and 
weve been very cautious in the assembly process thomas said at 
a news conference at the marshall space flight center in 
huntsville ala which was monitored by reporters here 
thomas said the redesign test program has gone so well that the 
stacking of the rocket segments could proceed with confidence even 
though three critical test firings remain for the overhauled model 
of the rocket 
were well on our way in the test program he said 
everything is going well with the processing at the kennedy space 
center 
on may 1 the two boosters are to be mated with the huge 
external fuel tank and on may 14 discovery will be attached to 
the stack rollout to the launch pad is set for may 24 and a 
20second onthepad firing of the shuttles three main engines is 
scheduled for june 15 leading to the aug 4 launch with a crew of 
five 
thomas said three more fullscale tests of the redesigned 
booster must be accomplished successfully before discovery can fly 
they are scheduled for april 20 june 3 and midjuly at the brigham 
city utah facility of the manufacturer morton thiokol 
asked if there was anything that could delay the august launch 
date thomas said we have a very ambitious processing flow down 
at the cape and we could always stub our toe someplace along the 
way or have something unusual turn up in the test program 
but i dont see anything now that would prevent an august 
launch

the attorney general of colombia 
alfredo gutierrez marquez resigned after news media reported an 
airstrip at his brothers ranch was used by drug runners a source 
at president virgilio barcos office said

the exit of richard gephardt from the race for 
president gave president reagan the opportunity to contend the 
public has no appetite for protectionist legislation such as the 
trade bill pending in congress 
i think the american people have decided that one great 
depression is enough and they arent going to give the trade 
demagogues a second chance reagan said monday during a speech at 
reynolds metals co in richmond va 
protectionism isnt just bad economics its bad politics 
the president said 
he pointed to the march 8 super tuesday presidential delegate 
selection contests and said those who had predicted that 
protectionism would be embraced in the south were proven wrong 
gephardt dmo who had made the nations trade woes an 
important part of his campaign for the democratic presidential 
nomination announced monday he was ending his bid gephardt had 
done poorly in more than twodozen states including the southern 
super tuesday states 
reagan long has advocated a policy of free trade and fair trade 
at the same time he has resisted protectionist legislation even 
as the merchandise trade deficit climbed to a record 17122 
billion in 1987 
reagan derided an international trade bill that is under 
consideration by a housesenate conference committee and threatened 
to veto it unless it is drastically changed the panel is working 
out compromises in the widely varying versions of the 1000page 
measure 
theyve got a trade bill before congress that could squelch 
productivity destroy american competitiveness and make all their 
doomsday myths a reality reagan said 
he accused his critics of predicting economic disaster and 
ignoring the fact that the economy is in the 64th month of recovery 
from the recession of 198182 
he said the bills mandatory retaliation provisions could 
require me and future presidents to take actions that would be in 
direct violation of the general agreement on tariffs and trades 
and seriously harm the national interest 
if enacted they could weaken the international trading system 
and could require the president to start trade wars reagan said 
but senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas 
reacting to reagans remarks told reporters i dont think he 
has really studied the bill and doesnt have a full knowledge 
bentsen is vice chairman of the housesenate conference 
committee ironing out differences in the two versions of the trade 
legislation 
bentsen said reagans remark that provisions of the bill could 
lead to violations of international trade rules is just not 
correct 
what the president is concerned about is that it makes him 
accountable bentsen said most presidents dont like 
accountability this legislation requires him to do something he 
cant just do nothing 
bentsen said the plant closing provisions would not cost 
companies any money and merely reflect practices that most 
corporations already are following those provisions would require 
the firms to provide their employees with advance notice of 
closings and largescale layoffs 
reagan objects to many provisions in the trade bill including 
an amendment named for gephardt that would require the president to 
reduce excess and unwarranted surpluses run up by japan and a 
few other countries in trade with the united states if 
negotiations failed the president would be required to use import 
curbs to lower the surpluses at a 10 percent annual rate 
the president could waive such action if he found it contrary to 
the national economic interest or if the offending country were 
wrestling with serious debt but critics say the plan is a long 
step toward protectionism and invites retaliation against us 
industries 
you may have been reading lately that the trade bill is making 
good progress that a lot of protectionist provisions have been 
jettisoned he said and there is some truth to that but 
theres a long way to go before the legislation does more good than 
harm to the us economy 
only wholesale elimination of the objectionable provisions 
will produce a bill i can sign

sen albert gore jr saying his approach to 
homelessness is more responsible than jesse jacksons has 
taken a rare if mild poke at jackson in the race for the democratic 
presidential nomination 
the point was one of the few areas of disagreement at a forum on 
urban policy in the bronx attended monday night by gore jackson 
and sen paul simon all three called for a broad spectrum of 
improved social programs 
jackson urged emergency assistance for the homeless but 
gore said the cost of an emergency shortterm response is often 
far greater than the cost of a more responsible longterm effort to 
respond to this problem 
gore of tennessee said his approach would include community 
mental health care programs and permanent housing for the homeless 
simon said to the audience at fordham university i ask you 
who is best prepared for the presidency 
the other democratic leader gov michael dukakis of 
massachusetts did not appear at the forum aides said he had a 
longstanding commitment to attend two fundraisers in washington 
if it had been possible to rearrange the schedule we would 
have done so dukakis said earlier 
dukakis gore and simon of illinois made separate campaign 
appearances monday in new york city an indication of the increased 
importance of the states april 19 primary when the selection of 
255 delegates is at stake 
polls have indicated a lead for dukakis in the connecticut 
primary today a dead heat between dukakis and jackson in the 
wisconsin primary april 5 and a lead for dukakis in the new york 
contest two weeks later 
at the 1hour bronx forum jackson gore and simon agreed on a 
need for more spending for education and housing a greater effort 
to combat aids and stronger measures to fight drugs 
gore urged an allout war on drugs noting that it is vice 
president george bush the likely republican presidential nominee 
who heads a federal antidrug effort that gore described as failed 
jackson criticized the administrations drugfighting efforts 
the most forcefully he said in latin america its becoming 
clear in this administration while the focus was on communism it 
was fascist drug lords that in fact were overthrowing governments 
there and infiltrating our government and killing our people at 
home 
he did not elaborate on the infiltration assertion 
in a similar vein gore called cia involvement with panamanian 
strongman gen manuel antonio noriega a disgrace simon added 
we talk about a war on drugs its been mostly public relations 
thats the grim reality 
on aids the three criticized what they said was an 
uncoordinated government response but gore lauded the efforts of 
surgeon general c everett koop and said koop should be considered 
for renomination in a democratic administration

investigators have taken two suspects into 
custody in the shotgun slaying of an indian activist who was 
running for judge the county sheriff said early tuesday 
we do have a suspect in fact we have two suspects at this 
time robeson county sheriff hubert stone said shortly after 1 
am 
i cant tell you a whole lot more about it right now because 
you never know how these things will work out but we feel pretty 
good about it right now stone said adding that no charges had 
been filed yet 
on monday commissioners in the racially troubled county called 
for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the 
slaying of 42yearold julian pierce 
stone had said earlier that informants had provided 
investigators with two or three names of possible suspects he said 
a hotline set up to receive tips on pierces death had received 
more than 50 calls 
we are checking with all of our informants that we have 
working for us throughout the county the telephones been busy 
were getting a lot of tips from individuals throughout the 
county stone said at a news conference 
meanwhile pierces supporters said they would seek to change a 
state law that would automatically make his opponent in the primary 
the winner of the election 
pierce a lawyer and lumbee indian was slain at his rural home 
over the weekend by three shotgun blasts in what sheriff hubert 
stone called an assassination 
commissioners adopted a resolution asking district attorney joe 
freeman britt pierces primary opponent to ask the state attorney 
general for a special prosecutor the resolution is not binding 
said commissioner wayne oxendine 
telephone calls to britts office monday were not immediately 
returned 
backers of pierce also said they will seek a special legislative 
session to allow a substitute candidate in the may 3 primary for 
superior court judge 
harvey godwin pierces campaign manager said the 25member 
committee to elect julian pierce decided sunday night to ask gov 
jim martin to call a special legislative session to change the law 
to allow a substitute candidate in the may 3 primary for superior 
court judge 
state law says if a candidate dies 30 days or more after the 
filing period closes in that election the opposing candidate is 
declared the winner 
under that provision britt a white would be declared the 
democratic primary winner and since there is no republican 
candidate in the county britt would become judge automatically if 
the law isnt changed or waived 
this is a special case said godwin this death does not 
come under the law which says death but doesnt involve political 
assassinations this whole assassination was to get him as a person 
and a candidate 
jim sughrue a spokesman for the governor said martin would 
meet thursday with those requesting the special session 
meanwhile stone said a hotline set up to receive tips on julian 
pierces death had received more than 50 calls pierce was found 
dead early saturday 
we are checking with all of our informants that we have 
working for us throughout the county the telephones been 
busy were getting a lot of tips from individuals throughout the 
county stone said at a news conference 
britt who had reported receiving threats after pierce was 
killed and his family were in seclusion under police protection 
he issued a statement after the killing calling it sad and 
tragic 
state rep sidney locks a black minister said he also 
supported the call for a special session he described the 
situation in the county monday as unsettled because of the slaying 
but he doubted violence would occur 
things are very tense but we hope cooler heads prevail 
said locks 
robeson county which borders on south carolina is 37 percent 
indian 37 percent white and 26 percent black it is one of the 
states poorest counties and has long been torn by racial 
animosity 
anger at what the indians call corrupt local government and 
entrenched racism boiled over most recently feb 1 when two lumbee 
indians took hostages at the robesonian newspaper in lumberton the 
county seat eddie hatcher and timothy jacobs said they engineered 
the siege in order to attract attention 
james davis a member of a us justice department team sent to 
the county said monday that his team had met with residents and 
will continue to meet with them 
the tension in the community has caused the entire community 
to express real concern davis said were here to try to evade 
that tension and bring calm back to the community to do whatever 
we can to bring confidence back to law enforcement 
i dont believe any of the minority groups are contemplating 
violence they are just griefstricken 
godwin said the committee will ask for special legislation to 
delay the primary for this office only and set up a way for us 
to find another candidate 
the reason why we chose to do this was because julian as a 
candidate and a person was not a quitter he didnt belive in 
giving up godwin said i dont think julian wouldve wanted 
his death to go in vain 
lonnie revels chairman of the state commission of indian 
affairs said he is not sure if the lgislature can legally change 
the law retroactively but he said he and legislators from the area 
were looking into the possibility of a special session

gem cutter john robinson of plano texas said the sapphire 
could surpass the 1154carat 4 million star of america sapphire 
in both size and value 
robinson is cutting and polishing the crystal trying to 
determine if it will display a sixray star when exposed to light 
it has a good potential for starring said robinson who 
also cut the star of america if that happens it will be an 
important gem 
peden said that even if the sapphire doesnt star its 
probably worth a couple of hundred thousand dollars

the stone about 5 feet underground just before christmas

summer he said monday and we got lucky

movie producers dueling for the rights to 
the jessica mcclure rescue will pitch their proposals to a 
committee charged with deciding who will tell the dramatic story 
mayor carroll thomas said monday he will appoint a citizens 
committee to intervene in the squabble between two rescuers groups 
about which producer will film the story of the girls rescue from 
an abandoned well 
the fiveperson committee will review all proposals from 
producers who have submitted them although only one deal has been 
made so far 
thomas said the commitment that one rescuers association has 
with los angeles producer larry spivey president of highland 
communications group inc will not mean that his proposal gets 
preferential treatment from the committee 
the only consideration is that highland will be one of the 
companies considered the mayor said monday 
those involved in the rescue have formed two associations one 
of mostly municipal workers and another of volunteers each with 
its own idea about who should film the story 
the other two committees have indicated that they will yield 
to the citizens committees decision thomas said both 
groups have been saying they want whats best for the community 
the jessica mcclure rescuers association a group of more than 
30 volunteers committed to a contract with spivey that includes an 
initial payment of 200000 plus future revenues to be divided 
among members said kragg robinson the associations president 
the other 11member group the mcclure rescue association has 
not yet made a deal with a producer but says it doesnt want to 
work with spivey 
jessica who turned 2 years old this past saturday was pulled 
from the well last october after being wedged inside it for 58 
hours the rescue was televised live nationwide 
the mcclures attorney darrell smith of midland again said the 
family wont stand in the way of a movie 
they also wouldnt insist on making one if it wasnt in the 
best interests of the town he said

there were about the same number of accidents 
reported in the nations commercial nuclear power plants in 1987 as 
there had been for a slightly smaller number of plants the previous 
year according to a report by a group critical of the industry 
the critical mass energy project of public citizen a group 
founded with the help of ralph nader said in a report issued 
monday there were 2810 accidents in commercial nuclear power 
plants in 1987 as compared with 2836 for 1986 
at the end of last year there were 105 nuclear plants in 
commercial operation against 99 at the same point a year earlier 
the project which publishes a compilation of nuclear regulatory 
commission reports annually noted this year as the ninth 
anniversary of the accident at the three mile island plant in 
pennsylvania 
however the findings of this study suggest that the lesson of 
three mile island has been forgotten by the nuclear industry and 
its friendly watchdog the nrc said kenneth boley one of the 
authors of the report 
the report said 1987 figures could rise slightly as additional 
reports come in from the plants

the house has approved a bill that would make 
it easier for a parent to recover a child who is abducted and taken 
to a foreign country even when taken by the other parent 
the measure passed by voice vote on monday and sent to the 
senate would enable the us government to implement an 
international treaty intended to overcome complex timeconsuming 
legal issues blocking the prompt return of abducted children from a 
foreign country 
the united states signed the treaty in 1981 although it was 
approved by the senate in october 1986 the united states has not 
ratified the pact because the state department said implementing 
legislation was needed first 
the treaty provides for the prompt return of children abducted 
from their country or wrongfully kept in a foreign country and 
provides for visitation rights across international borders 
the bill provides for accelerated procedures by the courts of 
nine foreign countries that have ratified the treaty for returning 
abducted children to their us parents 
the bill would direct state courts when petitioned by foreign 
parents to order children returned to their habitual residence 
abroad even if there is no legal order establishing custody

state and local governments increasingly are 
considering whether men and women should be paid the same for jobs 
that are different but of similar value to an employer according 
to a private study 
the survey released monday by the national committee on pay 
equity said more than 1500 local governments school districts 
and community colleges have taken steps to identify or eliminate 
race or sex bias in the wages of civil service employees

district of columbia have taken some action to address the issue of 
pay equity the report said 
americans are rejecting compensation systems that unfairly 
penalize women and people of color eileen m stein chairwoman 
of the washingtonbased coalition of womens labor and civil

about 200 dartmouth college faculty members 
endorsed a statement by the college president accusing a 
conservative student newspaper of poisoning the intellectual 
environment of our campus 
during a special faculty meeting monday dartmouth president 
james freedman branded the staff of the offcampus weekly the 
dartmouth review as ideological provocateurs posing as 
journalists 
chris whitman a junior who became the reviews editor on 
monday called freedmans criticisms unfair 
the review has been at the center of controversy since it was 
founded in 1980 it has been attacked as antiminority antiwomen 
and antihomosexual and has been championed by such conservatives 
as william f buckley jr and former white house communications 
chief patrick buchanan 
freedmans public criticism of the review the strongest to date 
by any high dartmouth official came weeks after three review 
staffers were suspended and a fourth was put on probation for their 
role in an angry confrontation with a black professor described by 
the review as incompetent 
freedman who became dartmouths president eight months ago 
said he decided to speak out against the paper because i now see 
that the review is dangerously affecting in fact poisoning the 
intellectual environment of our campus 
the president said the college must not stand by silently when 
a newspaper maliciously engages in bullying tactics that seem 
virtually designed to have the effect of discouraging women and 
members of minority groups from joining our faculty or enrolling as 
students 
what the review has done on this campus has not been decent 
what it has done has been irresponsible meanspirited cruel and 
ugly he said 
about 200 teachers at the faculty meeting gave freedman a 
standing ovation and approved a resolution endorsing his remarks 
whitman said the review is not antidiversity he said 
students of many races and persuasions are or have been on the 
staff 
i think were aggressive we pursue investigative stories but 
i do not consider us ideological provocateurs or meanspirited 
whitman said i think we have an unquestioned right to evaluate 
the faculty n a consumeradvocacy role 
as freedman spoke college spokesmen handed out a statement 
saying that dean edward shanahan had denied the four review 
staffers requests for reconsideration of their disciplinary cases 
stemming from the feb 25 confrontation with professor william cole 
the students were charged with harassment invasion of privacy 
and disorderly conduct after they confronted cole in his classroom 
to offer him a chance to rebut an article that had harshly 
criticized him 
the colleges statement also noted that review staffers in 1986 
were involved in a nighttime sledgehammer attack on symbolic 
antiapartheid shanties on the college green

editors note the writer was arrested monday during a military 
raid on the marriott hotel in panama city here is his account 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for three hours monday i was 
detained by soldiers who stormed the marriott hotel to arrest 
opposition leaders and journalists during that time my notes were 
seized and i was herded into a sports field with other reporters 
for a lecture on panamas crisis 
i was arrested at the hotel after covering a protest march that 
was broken up monday by panamanian defense forces troops shooting 
shotguns and tear gas 
after getting mildly tear gassed i returned to the hotel and 
heard soldiers had arrested opposition leader carlos ernesto de la 
lastra whom i had interviewed during the march 
i ran upstairs in the hotel to call the local associated press 
office but neither i nor the operator could get a line out 
when i went downstairs i found the lower two floors of the 
hotel in chaos armed troops had occupied the ground floor and 
civilian security agents were running around the second floor 
where the national civic crusade a leading opposition coalition 
is headquartered 
an agent spotted me grabbed me by the back of my belt and 
marched me down the stairwell and out into a van eventually 10 
people some of them beaten on the back with chains were crammed 
into the small van 
we were taken to the g2 intelligence division next to the 
headquarters of the defense forces which is headed by gen manuel 
antonio noriega we were told to be quiet and stand with our arms 
against the wall which we did 
we were searched and the interrogators displayed great interest 
in notes from the demonstration i had on sheets of paper still 
stuffed in my shirt pocket as well as my notebook they took all 
my notes and my passport and told me they were going to be 
photocopied 
the wall i was standing against was decorated by strident 
promilitary local newspaper clippings that spoke about the 
martyrdom of those who died in 1964 antiamerican riots 
an unidentified man who ran the offices asked me do you ever 
write anything good or just bad things 
eventually my notes and passport were returned just as a group 
of several other journalists arrested in and around the hotel 
arrived at g2 
without being told anything we were packed into another van and 
taken to what turned out to be the military baseball field 
that chilled me and abidel vivancos a mexican with abctv we 
remembered that many of those who had disappeared in chile after 
the 1973 military coup were taken to the local soccer field 
beforehand 
the first thing i thought of was chile vivancos said 
at the field about 40 detained people were being interviewed 
none of the top crusade leaders were there but i later found out 
many of them had been arrested as well two panamanians were caked 
in blood from apparent beatings 
after half an hour standing in line the military officials 
separated the foreign journalists 
eight of us were put in a line together vivancos alfredo 
gudino a mexican with nbctv thomas haley a us photographer 
with the sipa agency jb diedrich a miamibased photographer 
with contact photos and maria cortina a mexican with mexican and 
spanish radio jose manuel pintada and eduardo herrera mexicans 
with spanish television and myself 
then in a bizarre pseudonews conference in spanish maj 
felipe camargo complained to us about the disinformation of the 
international press and how we were responsible for panamas 
disastrous situation 
he told us to tell the world that it was only the upper class 
protesting not the common people even though those of us who had 
attended the protest march earlier had seen many workingclass 
people joining the ranks 
tell the truth said camargo this is a class struggle 
he also told us strict instructions had been given not to arrest 
journalists but all of us told him we had identified ourselves and 
been arrested anyway which he shrugged off 
many of us then complained that if the defense forces did not 
feel its side of the story was being told its soldiers should not 
harass the press and routinely refuse interviews 
officials in noriegas regime have frequently accused the press 
of misinforming and conspiring with the reagan administration and 
panamanian opposition to bring noriega down 
camargo agreed and said he would do something about it he then 
told us we were not under arrest and that we would not be expelled 
from the country 
he said he would read the newspapers to see if we told the truth 
about the incident 
camargo then apologized for not having a taxi to take us back to 
the hotel and asked if we would mind riding in a police van 
we agreed quickly and by 9 pm three hours after i was 
arrested the eight of us were dropped off in front of the hotel

a judge ordered a wealthy heroin dealer to pay 
22 million in restitution to the citys drug users in what is 
considered the first such use of a state law that allows crime 
victims to be compensated 
the money will be given to a drug rehabilitation agency chosen 
by mayor edward i koch said state supreme court justice lewis 
douglass 
the judge said after the monday court hearing in brooklyn that 
the 22 million figure was based on the cost of treating about 900 
heroin addicts for one year 
douglass said it was the first time a section of the state penal 
law that allows restitution to be paid to crime victims was used in 
a drug case although the practice occurs on the federal level 
i hope this sets a precedent he said 
when the defendant agapito lopez was arrested in 1985 police 
officers seized six ounces of heroin 
according to the judges calculations if those six ounces had 
made it to the street the drugs would have been used by 898 heroin 
addicts who would have bought 20 bags each of heroin 
douglass said he contacted numerous drug rehabilitation agencies 
to find out what the least expensive cost per person was for 
treatment he was told it was 2400 annually for outpatient care 
the judge multiplied the cost by the number of drug users to get 
the restitution figure 
defense attorney frank ortiz said in court he would appeal the 
order he argued that when the state legislature approved the 
restitution law it only contemplated crimes where there was a 
specific victim like robbery or rape 
he also argued that the law requires a hearing to be held for 
any payment more than 10000 
lopez 44 was convicted march 5 1987 of numerous counts of 
drug sale and possession according to nancy young a spokeswoman 
for brooklyn district attorney elizabeth holtzman lopez sold 2200 
bags of heroin to an undercover officer for 26000 between june 
and august of 1985 
douglass sentenced lopez in may 1987 to 25 years to life in 
prison and fined him 52000 twice the amount of the actual heroin 
sale 
young said lopez owned two houses in brooklyn at least one 
house in staten island a car dealership in aguas buena puerto 
rico and other real estate in puerto rico she said lopez also had 
in excess of 60000 in bank accounts in the united states and 
puerto rico 
the district attorneys office would seize the assets needed to 
meet the restitution young said 
holtzman said in a statement released by her office that she was 
pleased with the judges order because there is a desperate 
need for drug treatment

most american taxpayers say the 
muchballyhooed tax reform they are experiencing for the first 
time has made the system worse not better according to a 
nationwide poll published today 
fiftyfive percent of those interviewed in the washington 
postabc news poll expressed that opinion compared to just 31 
percent who said the new system is better 
the poll also showed that about 3 out of 5 expect to pay more 
this year than they did under the old system 58 percent said they 
believed their taxes are higher compared to just 22 percent who 
said they will pay less twelve percent said they expect their 
taxes to be about the same 
when the tax changes were passed in 1986 members of both 
political parties and president reagan promised that the new law 
would make the system fairer and simpler but the poll showed that 
most americans wrestling with the tax changes in the first year 
they have taken effect disagree 
the poll was based on interviews with 910 people who said they 
had filed or plan to file federal tax returns this year results 
had a margin of error of 3 percentage points in either direction 
the post did not give the dates the interviews were conducted but 
said just under half of those questioned had completed their tax 
returns 
of those 51 percent said their taxes are now higher as a result 
of the changes 
sen bob packwood rore one of the chief supporters of the 
tax changes said that many of the people complaining about the 
system may not understand it he told the post that they may be 
receiving smaller refunds this year but are paying less overall 
without realizing it 
sen bill bradley dnj who was one of the principal 
architects of the tax changes maintains that the system is more 
fair but has acknowledged that the final result did not 
significantly simplify the tax system bradley blames this on 
lastminute tinkering done with his proposal to eliminate the great 
majortiy of deductions available to taxpayers

latin american nations met in 
emergency session at panamas request and were asked to denounce 
foreign intervention in panama and call on the united states to end 
economic measures aimed at toppling gen manuel antonio noriega 
a formal regional position on the crisis in panama is to be 
drawn up later at the extraordinary meeting of the 26member latin 
american economic system 
the organization based in caracas was founded in 1976 as an 
economic forum for latin american countries 
the organization is expected to reject any foreign intervention 
in panama while urging that panamanian military and civilian 
leaders abide soon with the promise of free national elections 
delegates at the meeting monday said 
individual nations including mexico and venezuela already 
indicated their opposition to outside interference in panamas 
affairs without specifically mentioning the united states by name 
noriega who as military chief also is panamas strongman was 
indicted on federal drug trafficking and moneylaundering charges 
in the united states and president reagan says noriega must go 
noriega denies the charges the reagan administration also has 
frozen panamanian government funds in us banks denying this 
country a supply of dollars the official panamanian currency 
in an hourlong speech monday panamanian foreign minister jorge 
abadia arias asked the delegates for support against us 
economic aggression which he claimed is meant to keep the 
panama canal under us control 
panama is suffering the most cruel economic strangulation seen 
on our continent within a strategy of domination with which the 
us hopes to replace the wars of annexation that the world thought 
were long gone abadia said 
manuel rodriguez arriaga mexicos subsecretary of international 
cooperation rejected any act of foreign intervention to 
influence the destiny of panama 
we cannot permit that someone tells us from outside what is 
good or bad today it is panama yesterday many others and 
tomorrow anybody rodriguez said he called for us economic 
measures against panama to cease 
venezuelas acting foreign minister horacio arteaga rejected 
foreign intervention in panama but reiterated venezuelan support 
for revitalization of democracy in panama 
we fervently hope that when panama assumes full sovereignty 
over the canal its people will have consolidated their democratic 
institutions arteaga said 
he said venezuela would like panamas government to make good 
very quickly its promise of free national elections 
delegates from other countries asked panamana to call for free 
elections this year rather than next sources at the meeting said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
one delegate also speaking on condition of not being 
identified said most latin americans would like gen noriega to 
leave not to be toppled in general latin american nations have 
rejected the interference of the panamanian military in the 
civilian government and called their ambassadors home for 
consultations the meeting was expected to end today

six people apparently injured by mustard 
gas allegedly used in iraqi attacks on kurdish villages arrived 
here today for medical treatment more than 30 others were to be 
taken to other cities 
dr gerhard freilinger department head of viennas university 
clinic plastic surgery said after talking with some of the 
patients their injuries appeared to be from mustard gas that may 
have been mixed with a nerve gas 
freilinger who since 1984 has treated about 30 victims of 
alleged chemical weapons attacks in the 7yearold persian gulf 
war said the effects on the lungs of the patients indicated they 
suffered from the effects of mustard gas 
freilinger spoke to reporters at an airport where the injured 
arrived aboard an iran airlines ambulance plane 
it was possible the mustard gas was in combination with a 
light nerve gas because they all have bad headaches are dizzy and 
some may have been unconscious he said 
mustard gas is heavier than air which would explain how it 
seeped into cellars where the patients said they had been hiding 
during the march 16 and 17 attacks freilinger said 
iran has said the iraq dropped cyanide and mustard gas bombs on 
three kurdish towns in iraq killing 5000 people and injuring 
5000 the attacks on the towns which were captured in an iranian 
offensive occurred march 1617 
freilinger said two of the patients a child and a severely 
wounded iranian soldier were to be placed in the intensive care 
unit at his university clinic the four others three women and a 
man were to be brought to private clinics in vienna 
the remaining kurds on board the plane were to be carried on to 
geneva frankfurt london and then new york 
freilinger said about 50 percent of about 30 patients he has 
treated since 1984 survived but added that patients only arrived 
for treatment after 10 or 15 days meaning that the damage done by 
the gas could not be reversed 
an iranian soldier freilinger had removed from the plane in 
vienna was originally to go on to new york however freilinger 
said the mans injuries were so severe that he could not continue 
the trip 
freilinger said poison gas penetrates everything including 
clothes they cant run away from it because if they do they 
breath it in even deeper he said he said mustard gas causes 
changes in the lungs that can lead to suffocation he said it could 
also destroy the bone marrow and causes burns on the skin 
freilinger said in 1984 he had visited areas allegedly bombed 
with chemical weapons and had taken a sample of the gas for 
verification and testing 
in the past iran has sent soldiers allegedly poisoned by mustard 
gas to vienna and other european cities for treatment in july 
iranian civilians were brought for treatment for the first time 
on board the plane patients with burns on their hands backs 
and faces coughed violently or lay motionless on stretchers 
one child of six who iranian and kurdish officials said had lost 
her entire family in the attack sobbed constantly and called for 
her parents 
irans ambassador to austria hossein noghrehkar shirazi was at 
the airport when the plane arrived as were representatives of 
several kurdish groups 
in downtown vienna on monday police arrested 60 people at a 
kurdish demonstration in front of the iraqi embassy against 
chemical weapons attacks

women black and hispanic police officers who 
said the department discriminated in hiring and promotion practices 
have been offered 92 million in back pay and an upgrade in 
seniority officials say 
the consent decree signed by the city and the federal government 
and announced monday by the justice department must be formally 
approved by us district judge prentice marshall 
the settlement which ended a 15year legal battle calls for 
the city to give back pay to 729 women blacks and hispanics and to 
adjust their seniority dates 
attorney richard gutman who has represented two women in the 
case since 1974 called the settlement recognition that peoples 
rights were violated but even today there are only 30 female 
sergeants out of about 1200 on the force 
the current training class will yield only the first female 
lieutenant in the history of the department gutman added that 
speaks for itself 
city corporation counsel judson miner said the settlement was 
fair 
there were many components to this case that had to be tried 
over a period of years he said one of the priorities of this 
office has been to resolve longstanding cases and still protect the 
interests of the city 
police chief leroy martin will withhold comment until he has 
reviewed the decree said spokeswoman jackie kimber 
before 1973 women were not hired for the departments patrol 
force prompting a spate of individual legal actions black and 
hispanic males had charged in similar lawsuits that police 
department hiring and promotion tests had a discriminatory effect 
the federal government consolidated the complaints in 1973 
making itself the plaintiff 
marshall who presided over the case ruled in 1976 that the 
city violated the equalopportunity provisions of the civil rights 
act of 1964 
the proposed decree requires the city to establish an 
interestbearing fund of 92 million for reimbursements to 
discrimination victims 
the decree covers 
233 women on the 1972 policewoman eligibility list who were 
hired or reclassified as police officers and who passed probation 
or who were employed before march 24 1972 as policewomen or 
matrons and were subsequently reclassified as police officers 
455 black and hispanic men who applied for the 1968 or 1971 
patrol officers eligibility lists and were hired from march 24 
1972 to dec 31 1978 as patrolmen or police officers from those 
lists and who paased probation 
the first three women promoted to sergeant after march 24 
1972 who served as policewomen or matrons in 1968 or before that 
time

to sergeant in 1968 and who were promoted to that rank from march

evening came and then the people were in 
the little room apart drinking wine and reading drinking and 
reading for hours that night it was good wine and good reading 
it was not exactly ernest hemingway but a spirited review of 
loving parodies of the famed novelists crisp masculine style 
one of the literary lampoons chosen from 21 finalists by a 
dozen welllubricated judges won the eleventh international 
imitation hemingway competition on monday 
it was now morning and he was in the bathroom shaving 
shaving for the first time that day but not the last no never 
the last begins the winning entry which ends with a groanworthy 
pun 
the parody by gordon satch carlson of anchorage alaska met 
the key rule of the lighthearted contest to sound like hemingway 
and read like hemingway to know that funny is good and very 
funny is very good 
carlson a high school english teacher newspaper and magazine 
columnist and selfdescribed social gadfly said in a telephone 
interview that he had no trouble imitating hemingways distinctive 
style 
actually ive been accused of writing hemingway parodies when 
im not trying he said 
carlsons work continued the hairs kept coming tiny hairs 
and black and there was nothing for it nothing for it at all but 
shaving 
the 350word parody went on and on discussing the hirsute 
portions of a mans body it then described an estranged woman 
then more shaving drinking wine and then drinking more wine 
the climax came when the man cut himself 
she turned lifting her thin american lip over those thin 
white perfect american teeth and that thin american sneer its 
only a nick adams she said 
nick adams was a character in several of hemingways short 
stories 
carlson maintains that hemingways short stories rather than 
his novels are key to the writers work he said most of the lines 
for his parody came from his favorite hemingway story the short 
happy life of francis macomber 
carlson who was vacationing in seattle when he learned he won 
gets a round trip for two to italy with dinners at harrys bar in 
florence 
the other 20 finalists each straining the language to produce 
literary lookalikes of hemingways terse manly style were among 
2432 entries from all 50 states and more than a dozen foreign 
countries 
the judges included authors ray bradbury barnaby conrad and 
cyra mcfadden and poet lawrence ferlinghetti it was the first time 
the contest was held outside los angeles 
one wouldbe hemingway wrote the president looked at the 
woman he called nancy other men also called her nancy 
sticking to the political season another contestant told how in 
the spring a fellow named gary took the young woman to the 
bahamas avoiding reporters and living on rum and sun and the catch 
of the day he had not taken his wife 
another competitor was taken with a large fellow named jose a 
fellow who could laugh in such a large way when the bird sat on his 
cigar a cigar the size of a monkeys arm 
one entry dealt with a farewell to arms legs feet and 
neck while another sought glitter in a farewell to lunch

iraq today said its warplanes attacked 
two supertankers off iran in the persian gulf and threatened to use 
chemical weapons against major iranian cities 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia quoted a 
military spokesman as saying iraqi warplanes hit two very large 
maritime targets or supertankers off the iran coast during the 
night 
there was no immediate confirmation of the report which 
provided no other details news of iraqi raids in iranian tankers 
are difficult to verify because of an iranian news blackout on such 
incidents 
nuri nayef director of the cairo office of the iraqi news 
agency today said an authorized iraqi spokesman told him 
iraq might choose a number of large iranian cities to be the 
targets of chemical weapons as a deterrent and punitive measure 
nayef who spoke to reporters in cairo said the unidentified 
spokesman said iran deployed chemical weapons in iraqs 
northeastern kurdistan region and that iraq may respond to stop the 
iranians from doing so again 
iran claims iraq dropped cyanide and mustard gas bombs on three 
towns in kurdistan killing 5000 kurds and injuring 5000 the 
attacks on the town of halabja and the nearby villages of khormal 
and dojaila reportedly began march 16 and continued over the next 
few days 
western reporters have seen victims of chemical weapons at 
hospitals in halabja which they visited with iranian guides and 
in tehran survivors told them chemical bombs were dropped by 
iraqi not iranian planes 
kurdistan is where the majority of iraqs 35 million kurds 
live most of them have been fighting the baghdad government for 
autonomy in the mountainous region they are backed by iran 
baghdad has neither confirmed nor denied the use of the outlawed 
weapons but a statement by iraqs ruling revolutionary command 
council on saturday said iraq has the right to defend itself with 
all available weapons 
on monday the official islamic republic news agency also 
monitored in nicosia said irans revolutionary guards had killed 
or wounded 300 iraqis in the latest battle of an iranian thrust 
into the kurdistan region 
the news agency quoted revolutionary guards minister mohsen 
rafiqdoust as saying the iranians have overrun 540 square miles of 
the region 
the iranians also have pushed 15 miles into the darbandikhan 
region east of iraqs kirkuk oilfields communiques said 
iran claims to have killed or wounded nearly 13500 iraqis 
captured more than 5000 and destroyed 225 tanks and armored 
vehicles since march 16 
iraq has admitted losing territory in kurdistan 
but if the iranian claim is confirmed it would mark iraqs 
biggest military setback since the iranians battled to within six 
miles of the southern city of basra early last year and occupied 
wetlands east of it 
iran also claimed its air force fighters downed two iraqi 
warplanes in the kurdistan battle zone monday iraq admitted losing 
only one aircraft 
in another development rebels fighting irans government with 
backing from iraq said monday their national liberation army 
launched a major offensive on a 15mile front in irans 
southwestern khuzestan province near the town of shush 
iran acknowledged the attack but said more than 1000 iraqi 
soldiers and nla counterrevolutionaries were killed and the 
advanced was foiled

scientists seeking to explain the longer 
lifespan of rats fed lowcalorie diets are not recommending that 
people follow such a strict regimen but merely that they eat 
sensibly 
i think the studies support the wisdom of what is commonly 
referred to as a prudent diet said dr richard weindruch of the 
national institute on aging dont overload yourself with 
calories 
scientists from a range of disciplines gathered monday at the 
university of notre dame to analyze a study in which about 200 rats 
fed 30 percent fewer calories than a similarsized group lived an 
average of 20 percent longer the conference continues through 
today 
while the link between a restricted diet and longer life is 
longestablished the researchers are trying to find out why diet 
tends to slow down the aging process 
an immunologist suggested suggested lower food intake kept the 
animals immune systems strong other results were less conclusive 
but weindruch cautioned against issuing hasty advice 
the studies at present do not justify a recommendation to the 
general public of severe caloric restriction or even moderate 
caloric restriction because there are so many difficulties in 
translation between the animal model and the human situation he 
said 
immunology researcher dr yoon kim of chicago speculated that 
the restricted diet may have exposed the rats to fewer antigens 
or diseasecausing agents in the food to which the immune system 
reacts by producing antibodies 
in a restricted diet the tendency is not to use up the 
immune systems ability to fight disease said kim life and 
healthy life is due to restriction of diet maintaining the 
potential of the defense system not using it unnecessarily 
thirtytwo researchers in the united states and canada were sent 
tissue samples for analysis from the 400 rats raised at notre 
dames lobund laboratory in a study supported by the chicagobased 
nonprofit retirement research foundation 
the study involved 400 rats half of which were fed 12 grams of 
food per day or about 70 percent of normal with fat limited to 5 
percent 
animals on restricted diet lived an average of 38 months an 
increase of nearly 20 percent above the control group scientists 
said 
the rats on restricted diets were healthier in their old age and 
developed fewer cancers of the prostate and liver the rats also

two unarmed tomahawk cruise 
missiles flew 800 miles over rural florida and alabama in a 
simulated shiptoland attack then parachuted down to a test 
range a navy spokesman said 
the missiles 18 feet long and 21 inches around were fired from 
navy destroyers in the gulf of mexico according to bob holsapple 
a spokesman for the cruise missile project in washington 
these were the eighth and ninth successful tests over the 
florida and alabama test range he said monday the flight 
route took the missiles over sparsely and nonpopulated areas 
only 
the exact course of the missiles and the identity of the ships 
they were fired from was classified he said 
the missiles fired at 10 am cst sunday and 3 pm cst monday 
traveled at 500 mph at altitudes varying from 500 to 6000 feet it 
took one hour and 45 minutes to complete the tests holsapple said 
seconds after being launched from the destroyers the missiles 
dropped their solidfuel rocket boosters and switched to their 
cruise missile engine 
they flew a fullyguided test flight over approximately 800 
miles over portions of florida and alabama and then terminated at 
the eglin air force base test range he said

horacio martinezbaca was a labor union 
lawyer in argentina when the military took control there 12 years 
ago six days after the coup martinezbaca was arrested and began 
a fouryear nightmare of imprisonment and torture 
they laid me down on a table they tied my arms and legs they 
put electric shocks on my genitals and my gums and they asked who 
were my friends martinezbaca testified monday 
a few feet away in the hushed courtroom sat carlos suarez mason 
64 a former general who oversaw the military prisons in which 
martinezbaca was held 
the prisoners used to call him the lord of death and life 
martinezbaca said 
the former prisoner testifying in a 10 million lawsuit against 
suarez mason said the 90minute torture session occurred about a 
month after he was arrested in march 1976 and was repeated several 
times before his release in april 1980 
there were also beatings freezing showers death threats and 
probably the worst torture solitary confinement in an 
unheated windowless cell for days at a time he said 
suarez mason former commander of the first army corps in buenos 
aires was arrested in january 1987 at his home in foster city 
just south of san francisco more than three years after fleeing 
argentina 
he faces extradition on charges of 43 murders and 23 
kidnappings allegedly committed by soldiers under his command from 
1976 to 1979 during a military campaign against suspected leftists 
the civil suit by martinezbaca is one of three by argentinians 
now living in the united states who say they were imprisoned and 
tortured or their relatives were killed by suarez masons forces 
us courts have allowed suits against foreigners in their 
jurisdiction for certain types of human rights violations 
including torture prolonged detention and summary execution 
us district judge samuel conti declared a default march 15 
after the former general failed to respond to the suit or answer 
pretrial questions claiming he had spent his last 100000 on 
lawyers in the extradition case the judge ruled that the trial 
would be limited to the amount in damages suarez mason must pay 
at mondays session san francisco attorney ray archuleta 
appeared and said he was representing suarez mason who declared he 
was now willing to answer questions but conti said suarez mason 
had no right to take part in a hearing after a default and ordered 
archuleta to the back of the courtroom 
martinezbaca a former local government official in mendoza 
argentina said his nearly blind father a former state governor 
was arrested along with his mother and brother on the day the 
military took power six days later two plainclothes police 
arrested him in his apartment 
he said he was never told why he was beng held 
one of the most frightening events of his imprisonment was being 
flown from one military prison to another he had heard about other 
prisoners thrown out of helicopters alive martinezbaca said 
another time when he was led away for interrogation and torture 
his jailers told him to say his last words and acted as if he would 
be killed he said 
the military finally allowed him to leave the country in 1980 
just as argentinas supreme court was about to order his release 
martinezbaca said he arrived at the home of a sponsoring 
presbyterian minister in berkeley speaking no english separated 
from his family and about 70 pounds lighter than when he was 
imprisoned he said 
though he still fears retaliation from the argentine military 
he said he filed the suit as a deterrent for people who think 
they are the master of life and death

the army today sealed the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip in the toughest crackdown since 
demonstrations began four months ago palestinians tossed gasoline 
bombs and set tires ablaze in protest 
the army rounded up palestinians after the threeday closure 
went into effect arresting 600 israel radio said the army 
confirmed it was making mass arrests but declined to give figures 
israeli troops set up roadblocks to bar nearly all journalists 
israeli civilians and arab visitors from the territories seized by 
israel in the 1967 war the army said it wounded seven palestinians 
on the west bank 
the crackdown was seen as a test of the militarys ability to 
control the territories where according to un figures 119 
palestinians and one israeli soldier have been killed since dec 8 
it was most severe in the gaza strip where the 650000 arab 
residents were ordered confined to their homes from 10 pm monday 
night until 3 am friday telephone links were also cut 
in the west bank where 850000 arabs live the bridges to 
jordan were left open for incoming traffic telephones were 
operating and residents were allowed to travel within their towns 
or villages no arabs were allowed to go to jordan however 
the closure ordered by the cabinet on sunday night did not 
affect the 65000 jewish settlers living in the occupied 
territories 
robert slater president of the foreign press association said 
the group appealed today to the supreme court to overturn the 
closure order 
slater said the association and israels 2000 member 
journalists association had decided not to participate in 
armyprovided news pools into the territories 
but an american television network and some israeli newspapers 
agreed to take part in pool coverage today 
one israeli reporter and foreign television crew accompanied the 
army into the west bank and another into gaza 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said the measures were taken to 
forestall largescale palestinian demonstrations on land day on 
wednesday the day marks the 12th anniversary of a clash over land 
confiscation six arabs were shot to death by soldiers on march 30 
1976 
many israelis say they believe news coverage of the palestinian 
unrest gives a onesided view and hurts israels image there have 
been calls to restrict television coverage by those who contend the 
presence of tv cameras incites the protesters 
in the west bank village of zaita today 40 miles northwest of 
jerusalem hundreds of palestinians threw gasoline bombs and 
clashed with soldiers the army said an army spokesman reported 
seven arabs wounded by army gunfire 
in the gaza strip violent protests broke out as soon as 
palestinians learned of the curfew israel army radio said in 
jabaliya refugee camp troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets to 
disperse youths who set tires ablaze the radio said 
troops turned away the car of save the children director chris 
george at a roadblock outside ramallah despite an army annoucement 
that the closure would not affect international relief workers 
george said the restrictions had seriously disrupted his 
agencys operations with half the jerusalem staff of 10 relief 
workers denied entry into the city 
mona rishmawi an attorney at law in the service of man a human 
rights group founded by palestinian lawyers said israeli troops 
had forcibly closed the major west bank markets in jenin and 
jericho as well as in gaza city 
in ramallah soldiers today forced merchants sometimes at 
gunpoint to close their stores 
the action was done to defy the plo which had ordered the 
stores opened for three hours a day in earlier protests the plo 
had ordered the markets closed at that time israeli soldiers 
forced them open 
three days is nothing we can go three months one 
70yearold man told the associated press as he watched the 
soldiers he declined to give his name 
lt gen dan shomron the armed forces chief of staff was 
quoted by the stateowned israel radio as saying the closure order 
may be extended beyond three days if necessary 
rabin said the territories were declared a closed military 
zone 
the meaning is to bar all those who dont have to be there 
or theres no vital reason why they have to move around there he 
told soldiers in remarks aired monday by israel army radio

as vice president george bushs grip on the 
republican presidential nomination tightens more and more people 
are asking the no 2 question 
whom will he choose as his running mate 
bush says its too early to think about it 
former president richard nixon suggests white house chief of 
staff howard h baker jr baker says he doesnt expect to be asked 
because he wouldnt bring the right strength to the ticket 
others propose california gov george deukmejian deukmejian 
says he couldnt accept because he would leave his state in the 
hands of a democratic lieutenant governor 
nixon in a forthcoming london sunday times political column 
says the ideal formula is to pick your principal rival as 
president reagan did with bush but he suggests maybe the 
campaign between bush and senate minority leader bob dole has been 
too bitter for that 
some have another idea not principal rival but wife of 
principal rival how about former secretary of transportation 
elizabeth dole 
and so it goes 
nixon argues that baker a tennessean and former senate 
republican leader would be helpful in southern states and in 
dealing with congress 
in a recent television interview baker said george bush 
needs to find someone who will bring strength to the ticket on a 
regional and political basis and i think that is not going to be 
me 
he didnt say he would turn it down if someone asked me to do 
it he said i would have a very difficult time trying to 
figure out what i was going to say but he added i do not 
wish that to happen 
baker has mentioned former tennessee gov lamar alexander 
deukmejian of california new jersey gov thomas kean and former 
pennsylvania gov richard thornburgh as good choices for the vice 
presidential slot 
if deukmejian left office in midterm lt gov leo t mccarthy 
a democrat would become governor of the nations largest state at 
a news conference in sacramento recently the california governor 
said even if they did ask me to accept the vice presidential 
nomination i wouldnt be able to take it later he added 
that doesnt mean i wouldnt like to be vice president 
another possibility rep jack kemp of new york who ran as a 
conservative alternative to bush for the presidential nomination 
but fared poorly 
also mentioned is sen nancy kassebaum of kansas she was on a 
long list of potential reagan running mates in 1980 but took 
herself out of consideration because as a freshman senator she 
said she didnt have enough experience she has eight years more of 
it now 
if bush should decide to choose a midwesterner to strengthen 
the ticket in a region that could be crucial to republican hopes 
another possibility would be illinois gov james thompson who 
endorsed the vice president and campaigned for him in the illinois 
presidential primary 
other names that have been mentioned include sen alan simpson 
of wyoming doles deputy in the senate leadership secretary of 
education william j bennett sen phil gramm of texas an 
architect of the congressional deficitreduction mechanism and 
colin powell the presidents national security adviser and one of 
the topranking blacks in the reagan administration 
all of this of course assumes that the vice president wins the 
nomination he is way ahead and dole said last week i think 
its probably a foregone conclusion whats happening on the 
republican side 
bush asked whether he would consider dole as a running mate 
said its too early for me to start thinking about any running 
mates that would project a certain arrogance or presumption that i 
dont want to do

another genetically engineered pesticide is 
jumping through the usual regulatory hoops and the usual opponent 
of the technology jeremy rifkin is throwing up a novel argument 
against it 
rifkin whose campaign against genetic engineering has delayed 
some field tests of the organisms says the proposed biological 
pesticide will cause a decline in corn yields 
the decline he claims is an adverse environmental effect and 
reason to deny the developer crop genetics inc of dorsey md 
permission to run field tests 
the company says its planned product is unique among biological 
and genetically engineered pesticides in that it aims to 
vaccinate the plant against attack by the target pest the 
corn borer a kind of caterpillar it works inside the plants 
vascular system and does not change the plant or the pest 
genetically 
for that reason the company calls it the incide technique 
in a sign of the increasing importance of genetic engineering 
techniques in farming the agriculture department said monday it 
would license syntrovet inc of lenexa kan to market the 
nations third genetically engineered vaccine to control 
pseudorabies in swine a contagious disease that can be deadly to 
newborn pigs but does not affect humans 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said safety and effectiveness had 
been shown in field trials on 400 animals in three states and 
there is no significant impact on the human environment 
when crop genetics told reporters last week that its organism 
causes no significant change in yields they lied and you can 
quote me rifkin said 
the companys chief scientist peter carlson was asked about 
rifkins assertion and statements in support of it carlson said 
rifkin did not quote the relevant sections of the companys 
application for testing permits 
some tests using the carrier organism without the pesticide have 
shown crop declines notably of 17 percent in florida test plots 
but the usual statistical tests that scientists use show there is 
not a significant difference from untreated corn carlson said 
and even if there is a decline the company insists thats not 
an environmental effect or a reason to deny permits if we cause 
a significant decline in yields no farmer is going to buy our 
product carlson said rifkin is grabbing at any argument he 
can 
it may well be true that corn will show a small decline in 
yields he said but a farmer might accept that if he could achieve 
a large decline in costs 
the corn borer causes 400 million in crop damage even after 
farmers spend about 50 million on chemical pesticides the company 
said the borer can reduce yields 20 percent in some corn belt 
areas 
the companys technique uses a harmless bacterium to carry the 
toxin that kills the borer carlson has selected one thats found 
normally only in bermuda grass clavibacter xyli subspecies 
cynodontis or cxc cows have been eating it for centuries 
the toxin is produced by a gene in another bacterium that gene 
using the techniques of recombinant dna is inserted into cxc the 
modified cxc is injected into the seed and will exist in the corn 
plants vascular system its new gene directing the manufacture of 
the protein toxin in the cell 
when the borer eats the corn leaf or stem tissue it also 
gobbles the toxin 
if the environmental protection agency and the agriculture 
departments animal and plant health inspection service approve 
the company hopes to run field tests in queen annes county 
maryland and at the departments beltsville md research station 
this year it also has applied to test in france 
the company has asked that epa waive some suggested toxicity 
tests tests it says are not necessary in the light of results from 
other tests rifkin is attacking the application on this grounds 
too arguing that all the tests should be performed 
in its campaign for public understanding and acceptance of the 
field experiments crop genetics has lined up heavyweights on an 
advisory board that include two former administrators of the 
environmental protection agency william ruckelshaus and douglas 
costle and elliot l richardson a former attorney general and 
secretary of several cabinet agencies

troops firing shotguns tear gas and 
water cannon routed thousands of antigovernment marchers then 
stormed a hotel to arrest opposition activists and journalists 
several people were injured and dozens were arrested witnesses 
said 
mondays march through the city shut down by a general strike 
was one of the largest protests in months against gen manuel 
antonio noriega about 10000 people turned the city center into a 
sea of waving white handkerchiefs the trademark of those demanding 
the strongmans ouster 
a few hours after the march was broken up plainclothes agents 
army troops and police burst into the lobby of the marriott hotel 
in the southeast part of the city firing shots in the air they 
came in the front and the back smashing one of the glass doors 
leaders of the opposition national civic crusade which 
sponsored the march and has been using the hotel as a headquarters 
scattered down hallways and up stairwells but the troopers caught 
many of them and hustled them out 
the hotel is also the headquarters for most of the international 
press corps the security agents forced their way at gunpoint into 
the offices there of nbc cbs abc and cnn tapes including 
footage of the days march were confiscated and several 
journalists were detained 
an officer on the scene said about 40 people were taken from the 
hotel most appeared to have been crusade members or journalists 
richard cole an ap reporter was one of eight foreign 
journalists detained and taken to a downtown military intelligence 
center they spent three hours being searched questioned and then 
lectured to by maj felipe camargo 
the seven others were abidel vivancos a mexican with abctv 
alfredo gudino a mexican with nbctv thomas haley a us 
photographer with the sipa agency jb diedrich a miamibased 
photographer with contact photos maria cortina a mexican with 
mexican and spanish radio and jose manuel pintada and eduardo 
herrera mexicans with spanish television 
we were all extremely worried because of the military campaign 
attacking the international press as disinformers said cole 
my notes including interviews with pro and antigovernment 
figures were taken and photocopied 
the notes were returned upon his release 
during the demonstration the crowd chanted justice and 
noriega tyrant your end is near as it progressed through the 
shopping district 
more than 90 percent of the stores were closed in support of a 
general strike now in its second week the strikes organizers say 
it will last until noriega leaves the country 
about 1000 marchers had set out from the meeting place a 
church in the city center their ranks swelled rapidly with people 
from buildings lining the route those who remained in their 
apartments leaned out windows waving white towels clapping and 
chanting 
suddenly panicked marchers shouted an incongruous warning 
smurfs smurfs they cried pressing backward turning and 
running back down the avenue 
panamanian police water cannons are inexplicably adorned with 
3foottall depictions of the elfin cartoon character known in 
spanish as pitufos 
the vehicles sped toward the crowd spraying a mixture of water 
and harsh irritant that blinds those it hits for up to 10 minutes 
and burns the skin it also provokes convulsive coughing 
within minutes the street was empty except for gasmasked 
troopers and a few stumbling sputtering individuals police fired 
tear gas and birdshot down the avenue and side streets even though 
almost everyone was in flight 
a middleaged woman sitting on the sidewalk called to this 
reporter her leg was snapped just above the ankle the shattered 
shinbone pierced her skin 
a passing taxi was stopped and the woman who had tripped and 
been trampled was placed in it for transport to the hospital the 
street was lined with scores of shoes shed as the crowd fled police 
denia quintero de morales another middleaged woman who had 
taken part in the march emerged from an alley a few minutes later 
blood dripping from her gashed head she too had stumbled and been 
trod on in the panic 
witnesses said they saw at least 10 people injured in the 
stampede some of the slower runners were beaten with rubber 
truncheons by pursuing riot troops 
the current phase of panamas 10monthold political and 
economic crisis began feb 26 when noriega orchestrated the ouster 
of president eric delvalle hours earlier delvalle had tried to 
fire noriega 
washington continues to recognize delvalle who is in hiding 
the reagan administration has frozen panamanian government funds in 
us banks denying this country a supply of dollars the official 
panamanian currency 
because banks have been closed for almost four weeks currency 
has become precious and many people are doing without essentials 
some go hungry 
nearly 20 crusade leaders were arrested monday either just 
after the march was broken up or at the hotel opposition spokesmen 
said they had not been released by midnight some panamanian 
reporters apparently remained in detention past midnight

the state supreme court threw out a death 
sentence against a vietnam veteran because the sentencing trial 
omitted testimony that the killer of two young girls may have been 
driven by trauma caused by his wartime experiences 
the court ruled unanimously monday that the jury might not have 
sentenced phillip lucero to death if it had been allowed to hear 
the assessment of a veterans counselor 
the ruling ordered a new penaltyphase trial with the previously 
excluded evidence to decide whether lucero should be sentenced to 
death or life without parole 
justice stanley mosk in a separate opinion went further and 
said the court should forbid a death sentence for lucero 
as his patriotic duty he killed our enemies efficiently 
wrote mosk unfortunately after returning home he irrationally 
killed again this time two innocent children there is macabre 
irony in the fact that the society on whose behalf lucero took an 
undetermined number of lives is now seeking to take his life 
in the penalty phase of the trial psychiatrist edward conolley 
testified that lucero suffered posttraumatic stress including 
flashbacks to incidents in which he killed a grenadewielding 
soldier who proved to be an ally and carried rotting corpses from 
the battlefield 
conolley attributed the murders to luceros mental impairment 
compounded by flashbacks that may have been touched off by the 
sound of police helicopters and the cackling of a goose outside his 
home because agitated animals in vietnam often foreshadowed the 
approach of unfriendly forces 
however thensuperior court judge joseph campbell barred 
testimony by thomas wulbrecht a veteran who runs a counseling 
program for vietnam vets at a veterans hospital based on a 
3hour conversation with lucero that did not include the 
circumstances of the murders wulbrecht said he would have 
testified that lucero probably had been driven by the same stress 
syndrome 
justice allen broussard in writing for the court said the jury 
should have been allowed to consider the testimony as an argument 
favoring leniency he said it could have been more persuasive than 
conolleys testimony the prosecution sought to discredit the 
psychiatrist as a hired gun for the defense but could not have 
used the same attack on wulbrecht broussard said 
the court also ruled that campbell wrongly prevented conolley 
from answering questions about whether lucero was likely to repeat 
his crimes or could adjust to prison broussard said 
luceros is the fifth death sentence the court has reversed out 
of 16 it has considered since conservatives gained a majority last 
year all of the reversals have been unanimous 
lucero now 42 was convicted of murdering 7yearold chris 
hubbard and 10yearold teddy engliman his neighbors in the town 
of yucaipa in san bernardino county 
the girls were last seen at the back of luceros lot on an 
afternoon in april 1980 a neighbor heard luceros goose cackling 
and heard lucero tell the girls as they entered his yard that the 
goose would not hurt them after helicopters were called in and a 
fire broke out in luceros house the girls bodies were found in a 
nearby trash container one beaten the other strangled 
the supreme court upheld the murder convictions saying luceros 
approach to the girls and their accompanying him into his yard 
would allow the jury to conclude reasonably that the killings were 
premeditated 
after a turbulent childhood lucero lied about his age joined 
the army at 16 and served three tours of combat in vietnam 
receiving a purple heart and a combat infantry badge

offtheroad users of diesel would be exempted 
from payment of the 151cent federal tax on april 1 under a senate 
finance committee amendment offered today 
the committee had approved the exemption last week but because 
of budget restrictions made the change effective oct 1 that 
would have required farmers fishermen and other offroad users to 
pay the tax for six months and then apply for a rebate early next 
year 
most of these users traditionally have been exempt from paying 
the tax a 1987 law that goes into effect april 1 requires that 
they pay the tax and later apply for a refund 
in introducing the new proposal today sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas chairman of the finance committee said that exempting 
offroad users april 1 instead of oct 1 could be paid for by 
revising the requirements for corporations to make estimated 
incometax payments 
it is up to the house ways and means committee where tax bills 
must originate to determine whether the diesel provision is 
changed that panel has given no indication when it will consider 
the proposal meaning there is little chance it could become law by 
april 1

a us attorney said city police officers can 
be trusted to help investigate charges of corruption on their own 
force 
affidavits released in federal court here last week revealed 
that fbi informants have accused several new orleans police 
officers working in the french quarter of crimes including drug 
dealing accepting bribes and burglary 
some officers will be deputized as federal marshals as part of 
an effort to investigate the charges us attorney john volz said 
at a news conference monday 
police superintendent warren woodfork wouldnt say who among his 
investigators would be deputized but both he and volz said they

residents of a disputed region in the republic of 
azerbaijan shut down their main city for a second day today to 
protest the governments refusal to transfer the region to 
neighboring armenia a newspaper said 
my report today will be short p gutiontov a correspondent 
for the government newspaper izvestia wrote from stepanakert 
city enterprises are at standstill people are home 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov also told a 
regular news briefing that some workers in stepanakert stayed home 
from their jobs 
certain enterprises are not functioning or are partially not 
functioning he said 
stepanakert is the biggest city in nagornokarabakh a region in 
azerbaijan which armenians want annexed to armenia activists said 
a general strike began last wednesday in the mostly armenian area 
in a separate report the afternoon newspaper izvestia provided 
the first breakdown of casualties in sumgait an azerbaijani city 
where ethnic rioting broke out feb 28 it confirmed the official 
death toll of 32 and said 26 of them were armenians while six were 
azeris 
activists have claimed the death toll was much higher 
gerasimov said residents of yerevan the armenian capital went 
to work as usual he reiterated that the government would not be 
forced into appeasing armenian demands to annex nagornokarabakh 
we cannot solve the problem by mechanically transferring this 
region as some armenian officials want he said the more you 
study this problem the more you will see the whole thing is not as 
simple as that as merely saying nagornokarabakh must be part of 
armenia 
also today a moscow dissident said police on monday evening 
broke up a demonstration by more than 50 people who demanded 
freedom for a jailed armenian activist and carried signs saying 
we dont believe in perestroika 
the dissident tamara grigoryants said she received her 
information about the protest in a telephone conversation with 
members of a committee promoting armenian selfdetermination in 
yerevan 
police did not interfere with an earlier demonstration monday in 
yerevan by more than 100 people but dispersed the second group 
she said 
she said her telephone call was interrupted and she could not 
find out other details including whether there were any arrests 
both groups demanded freedom for jailed nationalist leader 
paryur arikyan she said 
arikyan was arrested in yerevan after being detained by police 
in moscow where he had provided information to foreign journalists 
about events in armenia dissident sources say they have learned he 
has been charged under a law prohibiting spreading false 
information about the soviet union 
the signs against perestroika were a challenge to soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev and his broad effort to restructure soviet 
society the soviet government last week declared armenian 
agitation for annexation of nagornokarabakh intolerable but 
released a plan to improve economic and social conditions in the 
region 
gorbachev has appealed for patience and said that the 
policymaking communist party central committee will discuss the 
dispute in an upcoming meeting on relations between the soviet 
unions more than 100 nationalities 
officials have pledged a cultural and economic development plan 
for nagornokarabakh apparently instead of meeting the armenian 
demand to annex the territorty 
the newspaper sovietskaya kultura said today the plan would cost 
up to 640 million 
these millions which are so necessary now for restructuring 
the country is giving to karabakh it said in a frontpage 
article tracing the unrest to poor social and economic conditions 
sovietskaya kultura backed the soviet leaderships plan to 
improve conditions even though armenian activists have said 
specifically that improvement of education cultural facilities and 
economic conditions will not solve the problem 
the newspaper said there is almost a complete absence of 
schoolbooks in the armenian language no teaching of armenian 
history and that residents of nagornokarabakh could not receive 
armenian television 
it said each resident of the area would have a separate 
apartment or home by the year 2000 and that the government would 
build two reservoirs to improve the water supply to stepanakert

a bomb planted in a jeep killed at 
least four soviets in kabul and an afghan politburo member 
narrowly escaped assassination when a bomb blew up a bridge 
western diplomatic sources said today 
the politburo member was wounded and two of his bodyguards died 
the diplomats said 
the violence in the afghan capital coincided with reports of 
clashes in northern and eastern afghanistan between sovietbacked 
government forces and anticommunist moslem guerrillas the 
diplomats said they spoke on condition of anonymity 
in moscow a soviet spokesman denied that soviets had been 
killed in the attack sunday 
this is not true nothing of this kind has happened said 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov the spokesman said 
he had talked with the soviet ambassador in kabul 
diplomats said the bomb blew up a jeep and killed at least four 
soviets it also gutted a shop blew over a tree and hurled debris 
several hundred yards the explosion occurred in a shopping 
district of the afghan capital that is frequented mainly by 
soviets diplomats said 
earlier sunday two bombs were defused near the central post 
office and ministry of communications the diplomats said two 
other bombs were discovered and defused in midmarch in the 
ministry of the interior they said 
the diplomats said other incidents in the capital indicated a 
new flareup of factionalism between the mainly urban parcham wing 
and the rural khalq wing of the ruling peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan 
the sources said a car bomb exploded march 23 on a bridge 
spanning the kabul river as khalqi politburo member saleh mohammad 
zeary was driving by wounding him and killing two bodyguards 
riding in a separate car 
on march 19 national police of the interior ministry and secret 
police of the state security ministry got into a firefight that 
killed several interior police the diplomats said 
both forces are charged with maintaining security in kabul but 
the secret police are aligned with the parchamis of president 
najib former intelligence chief while the national police are 
predominantly khalqi as is the military 
despite the violence in kabul the sources said the traditional 
battlefield in paghman west of the city has become quiet as 
guerrillas apparently have concentrated on resupplying with the 
spring thaw 
the diplomats said it was unclear whether the latest pattern in 
fighting reflected expectations of a soviet troop withdrawal which 
moscow has said could begin in late spring 
the soviets sent troops to afghanistan in december 1979 to help 
the government battle moslem insurgents some 115000 soviets 
remain

vice president george bush was likely to 
win handily in connecticuts republican primary today while jesse 
jackson hoped to give regional favorite michael dukakis a run for 
his money in the democratic contest 
there are 52 democratic delegates and 35 republican delegates at 
stake in the connecticut contest voter registrars around the state 
reported a surge of lastminute registrations before the noon 
monday deadline 
but early reports from polling places indicated light turnout 
its very very slow waterbury deputy democratic registrar 
gloria keaveney said state officials predicted about a third of 
the voters would turn out 
dukakis the massachusetts governor has won all five new 
england contests so far 
a hartford courant newspaper poll conducted march 920 gave 
dukakis the support of 50 percent of democrats likely to vote 
tuesday jackson had 16 percent and paul simon and albert gore jr 
each had 3 percent twentyseven percent were undecided the poll 
of 558 democrats had a margin of error of 5 percentage points 
thirman milner jacksons connecticut chairman estimated 
jackson would win at least 24 percent and possibly 30 percent 
dukakis has the support of connecticuts top democrats 
including gov william a oneill sen christopher j dodd and 
state chairman john f droney 
droney who is nominally supporting dukakis said his loss to 
jackson in michigan made a strong showing 50 percent or better 
even more crucial in connecticut dukakis rejected the thesis 
look a victory is a victory dukakis said at a news 
conference 
droney said the results today will depend largely on voter 
turnout 
if you had all 650000 democrats in the state vote then i 
think dukakis would have 50 or 60 percent of the vote droney 
said but only 33 or 35 percent of them are going to vote and of 
that a third of them are going to be jackson people 
bush grew up in connecticut and still retains strong links here 
he was the son of a popular us senator from the state and his 
mother and brother still live in greenwich 
bush beat ronald reagan in conecticuts 1980 primary 
the newspaper poll showed bush with the support of 64 percent of 
the 432 likely gop voters tuesday while sen bob dole of kansas 
had 20 percent and pat robertson had 2 percent the remaining 14 
percent were undecided the poll of republicans had a margin of 
error of 6 percent 
bush has the support of virtually all the gop hierarchy in 
connecticut including its fourmember congressional delegation and 
state chairman robert s poliner

lastminute registrations before the monday noon deadline in new 
haven officials said hundreds signed up while the estimate in 
hartford was 400 and in bridgeport 200

soviet and american doctors participating in 
an international satellite teleconference differed today on whether 
cancer patients should be informed of their medical condition 
in an exchange between specialists at the national institutes of 
health near washington and soviet specialists at a studio in 
moscow the russian doctors said they believed cancer patients 
should not be told they have the disease 
doctors on the american end of the satellitelinked 
teleconference strongly disagreed 
the soviets presented an informal survey in which soviet 
citizens repeatedly said they would prefer not to be informed if 
they are diagnosed with cancer 
dr nikaolai p napalkov president of the oncological society 
of the ussr said patients usually are not informed in the soviet 
union of such a diagnosis because of the widespread belief that 
cancer automatically means death 
only in rare cases when a patient refuses treatment does the 
doctor have an obligation to tell the patient that he has cancer 
napalkov said 
he said generally soviet doctors believe that it is hardly a 
good idea to tell the patient directly that he has cancer 
dr natalya peredodchikova another soviet cancer specialist 
said that unless there is an acute necessity such as their 
refusing treatment there is no need to tell the patient 
but dr steven a rosenberg chief of surgery at the national 
cancer institute said he feels compelled to tell patients precise 
details of their condition in order to maintain a solid 
patientdoctor relationship 
the sense of trust that exists between doctor and patient is 
very important he said 
its improbable for me to imagine treating a patient without 
that free exchange of information rosenberg said 
the television exchange between cancer specialists of the two 
countries lasted just over two hours and begand with prerecorded 
remarks from president reagan and his wife nancy 
mrs reagan who has undergone surgery for breast cancer said 
that cancer is bigger than any one country it is a problem of 
all mankind 
the first lady said that she had always thought cancer would 
strike someone else another family 
then her husband and she both developed cacers which were 
surgically removed 
we have been fortunate recipients of advanced medical 
science she said 
reagan struck the same theme in his brief remarks telling the 
doctors of both countries we are depending on all of you in your 
combined wisdom to win the battle over this disease and in doing 
so to improve the length and quality of human life for all 
mankind 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in a statement read during the 
telecast said cancer is an enemy that is striking humans in 
countries everywhere 
though there has been progress he said the enemy is far from 
routed he is not retreating and is threatening everybody and the 
fight calls for vigorous and concerted action 
a spokeswoman at nci said the cancer researchers wanted to 
exchange ideas on treatment diagnostic techniques and methods of 
prevention 
organizers arranged for the conference to be broadcast to about 
1500 us hospitals and health care facilities on the hospital 
satellite network the us information agency also arranged to 
carry the conference on its worldnet system to 57 cities in europe 
africa and the middle east in the soviet union an edited version 
of the conference will be broadcast to an estimated 150 million 
people

a ban on statefunded abortions for poor 
women has been put off at least until voters decide the issue this 
fall 
the ban had been scheduled to take effect wednesday but 
attorney general frank kelley on monday postponed it until after 
the nov 8 election 
we simply have to accept his decision we would like to 
emphasize that the law was a duly enacted law passed by 
overwhelming majorities in both houses of the legislature and we 
felt very strongly that it should go into effect said barbara 
listing president of right to life of michigan 
kelley said the law should be delayed because prochoice forces 
apparently gathered enough signatures to put the issue on the fall 
ballot under the state constitution getting a law put to a vote 
suspends it 
the signatures arent expected to be certified until next month 
but kelley said because the petitions appear to meet legal 
requirements the signatures must be presumed valid 
his opinion carries the weight of law unless overturned by a 
circuit court 
we have to be pleased that there will be no cutoff and that 
health care for poor women will continue and were pleased that 
their health is going to be protected at least until november when 
voters go to the polls and settle this issue said judith frey a 
spokeswoman for the peoples campaign for choice 
the measure easily passed the legislature last year and because 
it had been initiated by a petition drive it escaped the 
gubernatorial veto that has scuttled 17 previous efforts to cut off 
the funding 
after the law was passed antiabortion forces contended it 
should take effect immediately but prochoice groups sued and the 
courts ruled that it would take effect 90 days after the end of the 
1987 legislative session 
meanwhile the prochoice forces started their own petition 
drive leading to the delay until voters decide the issue 
michigan is one of 14 states that uses taxpayer money to finance 
abortions for the poor in 1986 the most recent year for which a 
final tally is available michigan paid 58 million for 18600 
abortions

the king county council has approved an ordinance 
requiring sex offenders give up blood samples which will provide a 
genetic fingerprint 
under the law which was passed monday and takes effect oct 1 
people convicted of sex offenses will be required to surrender a 
blood sample police will build a genetic library for future 
investigations 
it will be a huge step forward in our ability to apprehend and 
prosecute rapists said king county councilman ron sims one of 
eight council members taking part in the unanimous vote 
a spokesman for the american civil liberties union endorsed 
parts of the law but urged the council to delay final action 
this would be the first in the nation and we therefore are 
responsible to be sure all issues are understood and agreed to 
take time to analyze dont be hasty jerry sheehan said 
but the king county prosecutors office urged the council not to 
be intimidated by being first 
the fact that we may be the first jurisdiction to adopt the 
genetic fingerprinting legislation gives us a sense of 
responsibility but we should not shy away from its extreme 
value said jeffrey baird a deputy prosecutor 
baird said identifying offenders is often the most difficult 
part of prosecuting rape cases this evidence will help resolve 
the question of identity he said 
the ordinance established a technical committee to guarantee the 
accuracy and reliability of the genetic process a separate 
committee will study how to store and retrieve genetic data

an african national congress official who recently 
told authorities she had received death threats and was being 
followed was shot and killed today while entering her office 
the body of dulcie september 45 was found in her northeast 
paris apartment building which also served as an office for the 
group 
mrs september had represented the anc in france switzerland 
and luxembourg since 1984 the antiapartheid group is outlawed in 
south africa 
an anc colleague said mrs september recently told interior 
ministry officials that she had received threats and was being 
followed 
no group or individual immediately claimed responsibility for 
the attack but anc officials blamed south africa south africa 
denied involvement 
the french news agency agencefrance press reported mrs 
september was shot in the face while entering her office about 9 
am her body was found surrounded by shells from a 22caliber 
rifle 
she was holding letters in her hand and a key was in the door of 
the fourthfloor office afp reported sources at the scene said 
her attacker apparently was waiting when she arrived to begin her 
normal working day 
maurice cukierman an anc treasurer in the office said mrs 
september had informed the ministry of the interior that she had 
received threats and that she had been followed during the last few 
days 
it is with anger that i learned of her assassination 
especially since we had advised french authorities that south 
africa was ready to commit assassinations in europe he said 
eddy amkongo representative in france for the southwest african 
peoples organization told reporters at the scene of the killing 
that he had also been threatened and had requested protection from 
the french government 
but until today we have received no response he said 
the interior ministry declined to confirm or deny whether it had 
received requests for protection from the african groups 
police speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
assassination looked like the work of a professional 
at anc headquarters in lusaka zambia spokesman tom sebina 
called the killing part of a deliberate south african campaign to 
assassinate anc members and anc leaders 
without citing any evidence sebina linked mrs septembers 
killing to a recent series of attacks carried out by the south 
african military against what the south african army called anc 
terrorists 
since friday the south african army has killed 11 people in 
raids in botswana near the botswana border with south africa and 
in the black homeland of venda 
sebina said he did not know whether any of the 11 people killed 
in the raids were affiliated with the anc 
south african foreign minister roloef pik botha suggested the 
death may have been the result of an internal quarrel within the 
anc 
pretoria cannot be held responsible for this death the 
foreign minister said in a statement issued through the south 
african embassy while details concerning the assassination are 
not yet known the south african government must stress that 
serious quarrels exist within organizations which use violence to 
attain their political objectives 
the anc the main black guerrilla group fighting to overthrow 
the south africa government maintains a worldwide network of about 
20 information offices including several in europe to lobby 
for support and receive aid 
the anc was banned by south africa in 1960 for its 
antiapartheid activities since then it has waged a bombing a 
sabotage campaign to wrest control from the government in pretoria 
the soviet union is the ancs chief military supplier anc 
leader nelson mandela has been jailed in south africa since 1962 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

the senate met today in an unusual closeddoor 
session called by conservatives who say the soviets are lying about 
their nuclear forces but supporters of the ussoviet arms treaty 
said the charges already have been refuted 
were going to examine the evidence that there are over 1000 
ss20s that the cia has attempted to cook the books on the issue 
and that the soviets have deliberately falsified their data said 
sen steven symms ridaho one of the chief critics of the treaty 
banning mediumrange missiles 
but sen william cohen rmaine vicechairman of the 
intelligence committee said the charges are the same old stuff 
which has been considered and rejected by the panel as it endorsed 
the treaty last week 
the soviets have declared that they have 650 ss20s and all 
those missiles will have to be destroyed when the pact takes effect 
but symms and other critics say the soviets have up to 350 
ss20s more han they have declared and the critics have said us 
intelligence estimates of the higher numbers have been hidden 
in the opinion of this seantor the cia has cooked the numbers 
of ss20s and im prepared to prove it said sen malcolm wallop 
rwyo another critic of the pact 
sen patrick leahy dvt a supporter of the treaty said 
these arguments have been heard and rejected i dont expect to 
hear anything i dont know 
the old senate chamber where the meeting was held has only 
rarely been used for business meetings since the senate moved to 
its present quarters in 1859 it was used this time because the 
regular senate chamber is laced with modern broadcasting and 
electric cable that could make eavesdropping possible 
it is the first secret senate meeting since oct 7 1986 and 
one of six in the past six years 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said today that the 
closeddoor meeting was sought by conservatives and he noted that 
senate rules permit such a session at the request of any two 
senators 
supporters of the ussoviet treaty say the senate foreign 
relations committee is likely to approve it by a margin similar to 
the 182 endorsement given monday by the senate armed services 
committee 
the foreign relations panel is scheduled to vote wednesday on 
whether to send the pact to the floor of the full senate where 
approval is expected next month 
when the foreign relations committee finally votes i expect 
the treaty will be endorsed by a substantial majority said sen 
claiborne pell dri chairman of the panel 
sen richard lugar rind a chief treaty supporter among panel 
republicans agreed with pell there is strong bipartisan 
support lugar said 
the only opposition votes in the closeddoor armed services 
meeting monday were cast by sens gordon humphrey rnh and 
symms according to senators who were present 
however armed services chairman sam nunn dga said there are 
still a number of questions which should be answered about the 
treaty 
nunn told the foreign relations committee that during his 
panels hearings serious concerns were raised that the treaty 
was unclear on futuristic systems and whether they would be 
banned by the pact 
examples of those systems could include laser weapons particle 
beam weapons or other advanced technologies he said 
byrd said today that when the treaty reaches the floor he wont 
seek a vote until the issue is resolved i think thats a very 
important matter thats going to have to be settled he said 
the treaty bans weapons delivery vehicles with a range of 
400 to 3400 miles nunn noted but there was disagreement on 
what that meant 
there has not been any final word from the reagan administration 
on how the united states is defining the term and the armed 
services committee thinks it is critical that the question be 
answered nunn said the white house has been asked for a report 
providing that answer he said 
the senate must be very clear in defining which type of 
futuristic weapons will be allowed and which will not nunn said 
sen daniel quayle rind a member of the armed services 
committee said the panel thought it was easier to define what 
weapons or technologies are covered now instead of waiting until 
the next decade 
sen john warner rva ranking republican on the armed 
services panel said he thought the questions can be answered 
within two or three days

an indian judicial candidate was slain by 
a youth who blamed him for a romantic problem not for political 
reasons authorities said today one suspect was jailed the other 
committed suicide they said 
julian pierce a 42yearold lumbee indian who was running 
against the robeson county district attorney for superior court 
judge was gunned down saturday at his home it had been speculated 
that the killing was the work of someone who objected to an indian 
being a judge in the racially tense county

worked as a security guard in raleigh was the triggerman in the 
slaying

gone to the house after eluding police who tried to arrest him 
goins died from a selfinflicted gunshot wound to the head said 
stone his father was not home at the time 
neither goins nor chavis had prior criminal records other than 
minor traffic violations 
the murder weapon was a 12gauge pump shotgun said stone the 
killers came to pierces home broke a window pane in the back door 
and shot him once in the chest and again in the side as he turned 
stone said they then entered the house and shot him a third time 
later goins went to the home of ruth locklear pierces 
girlfriend and the mother of 16yearold shannon bullard and 
talked with her 
he didnt tell her he had killed mr pierce stone said 
commissioners in the troubled county had urged the appointment 
of a special prosecutor to investigate the killing because of fears 
it was racially linked 
in addition pierces supporters said they would try to change a 
state law that would automatically make district attorney joe 
freeman britt the winner in the may 3 democratic primary 
the county of about 100000 people in southeast north carolina 
is 37 percent indian 37 percent white and 26 percent black the 
lumbee indians who are native to the region are not a federally 
recognized tribe 
anger at what the indians call corrupt local government and 
entrenched racism boiled over feb 1 when two lumbees took 
hostages at the robesonian newspaper in lumberton the county seat 
county commissioners on monday adopted a resolution asking britt 
to ask the state attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor 
pierces campaign manager harvey godwin also said the 
25member committee to elect julian pierce decided sunday to ask 
gov jim martin to call a special session of the legislature to 
delay the primary and extend the filing period to allow another 
minority candidate to run 
state law says if a candidate dies 30 days or more after the 
filing period closes the opposing candidate is declared the 
winner the filing period for the judicial race ended feb 1 
under the law britt would be declared the winner since there 
is no republican candidate in the county winning the primary is 
tantamount to winning the judgeship 
governors spokesman jim sughrue said martin would meet thursday 
with pierces supporters he said martin would not make a decision 
before consulting with other state leaders 
about 15 black and indian attorneys from the area met behind 
closed doors monday to select a candidate to take pierces place 
after the meeting godwin said one to four attorneys were being 
considered 
stone said he felt better about the investigation than he did 
saturday because of the way people were responding to his plea for 
help and because no violence had erupted 
no ones interested in any more violence the sheriff said 
ray littleturtle a lumbee activist said he urged fellow 
indians to stay calm 
however he said many were frustrated that pierces death had 
hurt their chances of achieving change from within the system 
this happens in third world countries not the united states 
political candidates getting assassinated littleturtle said

surrogate mother mary beth 
whiteheadgould testified today that baby m has a right to see her 
and would benefit from spending time with her and her family 
its her right more so than anybodys right for her to see 
me mrs whiteheadgould told superior court judge birger m 
sween on the second day of a hearing to determine how much time she 
can spend with the child she bore under a 10000 contract but then 
refused to give up 
speaking calmly mrs whiteheadgould 30 asked for immediate 
visits at her home and eventual overnight stays with expansion of 
her time with the child now 2 to include half the summer and some 
holidays mother and child now visit once a week for two hours 
supervised at a social services center 
mrs whiteheadgould said she has much to offer the child now 
legally melissa stern she said the child could benefit by the 
support of mrs whiteheadgoulds family including her husband 
accountant dean gould and her children by a previous marriage 
ryan 13 and tuesday 12 
she said the visitation schedule initially must be carefully 
spelled out by the court to make it easier for both sides in the 
bitter dispute to get along 
on monday the childs father william stern 42 in bitter 
testimony that ended in tears said mrs whiteheadgould is 
untrustworthy and could undermine the childs relationship with him 
and his wife 
in the final legal phase of the baby m case stern asked the 
judge to halt visitation for several years perhaps until her 10th 
birthday saying contact with mrs whiteheadgould could 
emotionally harm the child 
im afraid that she will never let melissa be her own 
person he said in 2 hours of testimony mary beth is a liar 
i cant trust her 
in later testimony sterns wife elizabeth said she and mrs 
whiteheadgould were poles apart 
i dont have any respect for her id never choose her as 
my friend and quite simply too much has gone on mrs stern 
said 
stern said he feared mrs whiteheadgould who lost a highly 
publicized custody battle would exploit melissa to promote her 
book about the case 
the hearing was ordered by the new jersey supreme court in its 
landmark feb 3 decision that declared surrogacyforpay illegal 
and restored mrs whiteheadgoulds parental rights but awarded 
sterns custody 
the sterns paid mrs whiteheadgould 10000 to bear them a 
child because they feared 42yearold mrs stern who suffers a 
mild form of multiple sclerosis would suffer complications during 
pregnancy mrs whiteheadgould was artificially inseminated with 
sterns sperm 
under crossexamination the sterns acknowledged that melissa 
does not seem to have been harmed by her contact with mrs 
whiteheadgould 
when the judge asked him what kind of religion melissa would be 
exposed to stern who is jewish and whose relatives other than his 
parents all died in the holocaust wept after composing himself 
he said he expects to expose her to the unitarian church mrs 
stern is not jewish

dj smith feels hes been placed in 
double jeopardy because the tv game show jeopardy wont pay him 
the 5000 he won and has banned him from the program 
the problem was that when smith appeared on jeopardy less 
than a year had passed since he had played wheel of fortune 
game show rules enacted after a 1958 scandal prohibit contestants 
from appearing on game shows more than once a year 
smith won 1200 on wheel of fortune on thanksgiving day 
and was disqualified from 5000 in jeopardy winnings 
i feel like im in double jeopardy said smith 55 a 
business analyst they wont give me my money and they wont let 
me be on the show again 
a representative for jeopardy produced by merv griffin 
enterprises and broadcast on abc affiliates invited smith to los 
angeles in january to play in a seniors jeopardy tournament 
smith said he told the representative thats great i was 
just on the wheel of fortune a little while ago 
but no one apparently caught the remark 
smith said he mentioned his earlier appearance again when he 
filled out a registration form for jeopardy 
prizes in the seniors tournament were awarded according to how 
many rounds each contestant survived smith said he compiled enough 
points for a berth in a semifinal contest and an automatic prize of 
5000 
but the next day he said he was told his appearance on 
wheel disqualified him 
we didnt enjoy having to do that said george vosburgh 
jeopardy producer even though the network stressed the 
rules it got by him and it got by us 
game show officials withheld the 5000 prize awarding him the 
1000 quarterfinalist prize instead 
the networks established the oneyear waiting period for game 
shows in the aftermath of a 1958 scandal in which answers to the 
64000 question were given to contestants before the show

business day of johannesburg probusiness it has been 
a widespread belief that the us is not ready for a black 
president the support michigan gave jackson on saturday raises the 
intriguing possibility that this may not be true 
it is more than 30 years since brown vs board of education 
ended segregation in american schools and racial causes have 
steadily declined in influence could it be that many young 
americans nurtured in an environment of equal rights have 
outgrown racial prejudice

the nobel foundation after 
recordbreaking profits is raising the amount of the annual nobel 
prizes by 15 percent to 428000 the head of the foundation said 
tuesday 
executive director stig ramel said the foundation established by 
alfred nobels 1896 testament saw its profits rise by 29 percent 
yielding 56 million to finance the five prizes and the 
arrangements for awarding them 
last years prize was worth 362000 up 8 percent from 1986 
the foundation administers the endowment which finances the 
nobel prizes in literature physics chemistry and medicine the 
riksbank the central bank created and funded the nobel memorial 
prize for economics in 1968 
the laureates are chosen independently by the swedish academy of 
sciences the academy of arts and letters and the karolinska 
institute the nobel committee of the norwegian parliament awards 
the prestigious peace prize 
the prize money is awarded in the currency of the winners 
choice according to the exchange rate on dec 10 the day of the 
annual award ceremony the prize is divided if there is more than 
one laureate in a category last year nine winners shared the six 
prizes 
ramel told the associated press the jump in the value of assets 
was largely due to floating the foundations real estate company on 
the stockholm stock exchange last year 
ramel said the foundations capital this year for the first 
time is substantially worth more than when the prizes were 
created after nobels death the first prizes were awarded in 1901 
nobel who invented dynamite bequeathed the equivalent of about 
150 million in his will to those who have conferred the greatest 
benefit on mankind 
but nobel stipulated the capital be invested in what he 
considered safe fixedincome bonds which later proved 
unprofitable for 50 years the foundation lost money and the prize 
progressively shrank 
the foundation lost about twothirds of the capital he said 
since 1953 the regulations surrounding the nobel capital has 
gradually loosened enabling the foundation to be more active in 
the swedish economy 
that is why we started the real estate company last year 
ramel said fortunately we were unharmed by the stock market 
crash last october

democratic officials from around the country 
some wary of the prospect of jesse jackson heading their 
presidential ticket will meet with jackson on wednesday to discuss 
what one party chairman called how to win in november 
florida democratic chairman charles whitehead said a small group 
of party officials arranged a meeting with jackson in washington 
whitehead would not say who called the meeting or what the 
specific purpose was beyond how to win in november 
dissent is building within the democratic party about efforts to 
strengthen jacksons rivals in the wake of his stunning michigan 
caucus victory 
alabama democratic chairman john baker suggested in a letter to 
party leaders around the south that they form a group of unpledged 
convention delegates who will commit themselves to the most 
electable presidential candidate 
weve got to keep one eye if not two eyes on the november 
general election im tired of the democratic party having a ticket 
that cant carry but one or two states said baker of montgomery 
ala 
others were dismayed by bakers effort 
the party cant afford that said jim ruvolo state chairman 
in ohio jesse jackson is not where he is by some sleight of 
hand he got there by winning votes 
jackson overwhelmed massachusetts gov michael dukakis in the 
michigan caucuses on saturday winning the industrial state by 
nearly 2to1 that victory stalled dukakis momentum and boosted 
talk that jackson could be the first black to win the partys 
presidential nomination 
baker denied his effort is aimed at jackson 
im not trying to stop anybody he said but he insisted 
jacksons views do not fall within the party mainstream 
a white candidate espousing what rev jackson is espousing 
wouldnt have a chance at being elected baker said hes the 
most liberal candidate running i wonder if he were white if he 
would have any delegates at all 
bakers move did not get a positive response from john henry 
anderson georgias party chairman 
i dont want to look at anything as a stop jesse jackson 
movement all i want to be looking at is electing a democrat to the 
white house said anderson who supports dukakis 
and democratic national committee chairman paul kirk would have 
no part of a stop jackson movement 
i cant imagine that if he runs through the process and comes 
out on top they could take away from him i would refuse to be part 
of that kirk said i havent heard of one starting and i 
wouldnt be a party to it 
as the party chief kirk promised to back the winner 
weve still got the biggest primaries coming up to settle who 
the candidate will be and ill support that process and its winner 
whoever it is kirk said 
the dnc chairman said jackson has won his victories with a 
positive message 
i think hes earned credibility trust and respect perhaps 
more than any of the other candidates he has stayed on the high 
road with a unifying message and appeal for those looking for 
strong leadership kirk said the success of his candidate 
offers an opportunity not a problem 
ruvolo of ohio called jackson the frontrunner in the race and 
brushed aside questions about electability 
you win in the fall by getting the votes of the people not by 
justing getting the votes of those in the backrooms he said 
the professional politicians may worry about electability but 
the results so far show the people are not worrying about it 
rep richard gephardt as he left the presidential race on 
monday agreed saying i believe jesse jackson can be nominated 
and i think he can be elected 
ruvolo said that the current discussions about jackson are 
premature he said the partys nominee could easily be decided by 
the primary lineup of new york pennsylvania and ohio in late april 
and early may 
if one candidate wins all three he is the nominee ruvolo 
said if no one candidate does then well go to the brokered 
process

a former white house aide said tuesday that 
the reagan administration either ignored or hid the fact that 
panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega was dealing in drugs 
but assistant secretary of state elliott abrams disputed that 
assertion saying the government acted legally against noriega as 
soon as it could 
the former white house official norman a bailey told the 
house select committee on narcotics abuse and control that noriega 
and other highlevel officials of the panama defense forces had 
been engaged in drug trafficking gun running and money laundering 
since the mid1970s 
bailey an economic consultant who formerly was a special 
assistant to the president for national security affairs until oct 
13 1983 said noriega and the panamanian military have engaged 
in the past in activities which represent and have represented a 
clear unquestionable and obvious multiple threat to the national 
security in a narrow sense and the national interests in a broader 
sense of the united states of america 
it is also a story of how clear and incontrovertible evidence 
was at best ignored and at worst hidden and denied by many 
different agencies and departments of the government of the united 
states in such a way as to provide cover and protection for these 
activities while at the same time assuring that they did the 
maximum damage to those very interests that the officials involved 
were sworn to uphold and defend bailey said 
bailey said the information available to the us government on 
noriega and the panama defense forces was not only a smoking gun 
but rather a 21cannon barrage of evidence 
but abrams told the committee there has been uncorroborated 
allegations of illegal drugrelated activity by noriega for many 
years 
we were not unaware of these he said until recently 
however there was no substantiated evidence of his narcotics 
involvement 
abrams said however that when the justice department unveiled 
evidence against him noriega was indicted by two grand juries in 
florida earlier this year since then the united states has 
applied economic and diplomatic pressure to drive noriega from his 
post as head of the defense forces 
abrams said he has heard about general corruption in panama 
since he came into office in july 1985 not only drugs but 
anything that can be done for money he said 
in answer to a question by rep benjamin a gilman rny 
abrams said he would not be surprised to learn that noriega was 
either a double or triple agent 
noriega is loyal to no one he said he has dealt with our 
intelligence agencies he has dealt with cuban intelligence he has 
dealt with everyone he took what information he could get and 
passed it on or sold it 
following the hearing abrams told reporters im unaware of 
any documentation of drug trafficking during the past five 
years 
when asked about baileys charges he replied why do you 
think were going after noriega

price support loans for some oldcrop corn and 
sorghum will be extended for a year longer than their normal 
maturity dates agriculture secretary richard e lyng said tuesday 
the oneyear extensions were approved for 1984crop corn and 
sorghum held in the farmerowned reserve program and for 1985 and 
1986 corn and sorghum under price support loan he said no 
extensions will be allowed for 1983 and older corn and sorghum 
loans 
lyng said the announcement on 1985 and 1986 corn and sorghum 
loans reversed a previous decision announced on jan 29 
the change was made to alleviate grain movement problems due 
to a rail car shortage grain congestion at some country 
elevators and other logistical problems he said 
but the agriculture department will reserve the right to call 
at any time the 1985 and 1986 crop loans lyng said grain in the 
farmerowned reserve program can remain until prices rise enough to 
trigger its release 
the loans are extended to farmers by the departments commodity 
credit corp which uses the grain as collateral if prices rise 
significantly farmers usually repay the loans and sell or use the 
grain as they choose 
but farmers have the option of not repaying the loans in which 
case ccc takes over the grain when the loans mature or come due 
by extending the loans farmers continue to own the grain and 
retain their ccc options 
parts of the jan 29 order still stand including the decision 
not to extend loans on 1987crop wheat feed grains and soybeans 
also loans that already had been extended on 1985 and 1986 wheat 
feed grains and soybeans will not be extended further when those 
mature

more than 80 percent of americans favor a 
federal program to provide longterm home care for the chronically 
ill and disabled according to a poll released tuesday 
the survey by louis harris amp associates also found that more 
than 70 percent would support paying for the program by increasing 
medicare payroll taxes for people who make more than 45000 a year 
rep claude pepper dfla released the survey in conjunction 
with a hearing on his fiveyear 25 billion proposal for longterm 
home care house leaders have promised him a floor vote on the bill 
although it has not gone through the usual committee scrutiny 
many members have criticized the plan as too expensive to pass 
this year rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the 
taxwriting house ways and means committee has said congress 
cannot enact both peppers plan and another medicare expansion 
shielding the elderly and disabled against catastrophic healthcare 
costs 
catastrophiccost bills already have passed both houses and 
negotiators are working out differences between the two versions 
rep edward roybal dcalif chairman of the house select 
committee on aging and a cosponsor of peppers bill said 
virtually no medicare or insurance coverage is available to 
millions of people with a chronic illness 
we have long believed we were seeing a rising tide of public 
support for a federal longterm care program and the harris poll 
shows us americans are evne more enthusiastic than we imagined 
roybal said in a statement 
the harris survey found that americans of all ages professions 
party affiliations and income levels supported financing a new 
homecare program through an increase in the 145 percent medicare 
payroll tax on upperincome workers 
more than 70 percent of people earning above 50000 supported 
that method of financing although they would bear the brunt of it 
the survey found 
of those questioned 82 percent said they could not afford to 
pay for the costs of providing longterm care either at home or in 
a nursing home including more than 60 percent of those making 
above 50000 a year 
and nearly 80 percent of those polled said they would prefer 
longterm home care to care in a nursing home 
the harris survey questioned 1500 adults across the country in 
telephone interviews feb 1823 the margin of error is plus or 
minus three percentage points 
the survey echoes an earlier poll last fall that found americans 
by an overwhelming majority were willing to pay higher taxes to 
finance longterm care for the elderly 
sixtyeight percent of those questioned in the survey by rl 
associates were willing to shoulder 10 to 60 a month more in 
taxes to pay for the program 
that survey was commissioned by longterm care 88 a coalition 
of senior citizens groups and other organizations hoping to make 
the issue a top priority with presidential candidates 
on a related matter a government report released tuesday said 
the number of elderly americans confined to nursing homes is 
remaining stable even though the raw numbers are rising because of 
an aging population 
there were 13 million nursing home residents at least 65 years 
of age in 1985 up 200000 from 1977 when the last nursing home 
figures were collected 
the report by the department of health and human services said 
the 1985 nursing home population reflected about 1 percent of 
americans 6574 years old being confined to institutions and about 
22 percent of those 85 years and older both percentages were 
essentially unchanged from the 1977 survey

common sense and firefighting basics have 
won a navy achievement medal for an 18yearold marine 
pfc neil r wadley won the medal for his idea that could make 
troops invisible to enemy heatdetecting devices the award was 
presented to wadley by gen am gray commandant of the marine 
corps 
wadley of st maries idaho who is stationed at the quantico 
base suggested that combatants wear a special lightweight shield 
that would neutralize the enemys sensors 
he said he got the idea from his work fighting forest fires with 
the department of lands in idaho before he became a marine 
everyone was issued a fire shelter a fivepound sheet of 
material capable of reflecting severe temperatures he said 
wadley said he wasnt prepared for what happened after he wrote 
a letter to the marine corps gazette outlining his idea for the 
ponchotype shield 
the editor of the gazette forwarded a copy of the letter to gen 
gray and gray immediately wrote wadley a personal letter 
im really excited by your idea and am taking the 
liberty of initiating immediate measures to ensure that its 
possibilities are thoroughly explored i commend your creative 
intellect for perceiving an innovative approach to a tough problem 
your idea certainly merits further research and development 
wadley said modestly i dont think i really deserved the 
medal it would have been enough just to get the letter and to meet

unlikely green thumbs are sprouting at an 
innercity housing project where a vegetable garden is fast 
becoming a model of determination and hope in a depressed area 
it all started last november when a team of 38 residents of the 
nickerson gardens housing project decided to turn an ugly vacant 
lot into a haven of leafy foliage and vegetables 
the garden in the citys southcentral area already has produced 
enough carrots onions tomatoes broccoli cabbage and cauliflower 
to supply residents and just about anyone else who cares to sample 
the homegrown food 
word has spread to transients and gang members alike that the 
food is available for the taking just as long as takers ask first 
it took awhile for it to sink in but all the kids and the 
gang members are letting the garden be said gardener tauheedah 
karim 32 
it shows you that if you believe in something and you work at 
it it can be done said wilma jean powns 46 cocaptain of the 
gardeners as she stood among her sprouting cabbages in one of the 
gardens 20 boxed plots 
ms powns and her neighbors got help from the end world hunger 
organization and budget rentacar which have sponsored urban 
gardens in other cities the groups supplied seeds training and 
some supplies while agriculture advisers from the university of 
california trucked in rich soil and fertilizer 
this comes from love long as we keep at it this gardens 
going to be here a long long time ms powns said 
neighbors keep a watch from their homes and shoo away 
trespassers 
even local school kids are getting into the act a class from 
the housing projects head start program shows up several times a 
week to help the gardeners water taking turns using a faucet to 
fill plastic jugs 
the jugs are doing double duty said ms powns when dogs began 
rooting through the plants last winter she said she put to use an 
old trick that her grandmother taught her about vegetable 
gardening she filled the jugs with water and ammonia and left them 
out for the scavengers 
we had a few dogs running around sneezing like crazy she

when american and japanese children got 
together tuesday to compare prizewinning inventions one side 
brought most of the frivolous fanciful toys while the other 
displayed nononsense solutions to everyday problems 
but in a reversal of stereotypes it was the japanese kids who 
brought the marionette and robot on skis and the americans who 
produced door guards portable seat belts and diapers with builtin 
disposable bags 
the meeting was arranged by a program to spur creativity among 
american students called invent america and the japan 
institution of invention and innovation which has sponsored 
competitions for japanese schoolchildren since 1941 
the japanese students inventions included the mechanized 
marionette of takakiyo katami 11 of gufu city a robot that can 
slalom back and forth on skis by yasushi nishiyama 15 of nagoya 
and an illuminated constellation model made from 2000 optical 
fibers by takahiro tsurita 14 of toyota city 
tomoyuki imura 15 of miki city japan came up with a ball 
retriever that consists of several tennis cans open at both ends 
and taped together 
sally mallison 12 of wilmington del who devised her 
bagadiap to help her parents cope with messy diapers on car 
trips said i think from the japanese ive learned that 
inventions can be mechanical and they can also be like mine 
where they dont have anything mechanical to do with them 
yasushi nishiyama maker of the slalom robot said through an 
interpreter after observing all these inventions i notice 
japanese students inventions seem to be more like toys something 
kids can play with 
most of the americans inventions he added seemed more 
practical something in your daily life that you can actually use 
how does that square with the image americans have of japanese 
students spending endless hours in school or studying 
there are some people who study hard but there are some who 
just enjoy playing nishiyama said they stay away from that 
work instead they try to create something more interesting so 
they can enjoy themselves 
two of the young japanese inventors devices did have a 
practical tilt hiroshi aoyagi 12 of tokamachi built a door that 
can slide up or swing out 
and yoshitaka tanimoto 13 of takayama city won top honors 
the prime ministers prize for inventing a device to help his 
grandfather regain use of his hand after a stroke tanimotos hand 
rehabilitation machine consists of two crescent shaped handles 
attached by strong rubber bands that can be stretched apart 
the americans all honored last june in an invent america 
competition included maurice scales 8 of suitland md who came 
up with a plexiglas shield to keep doors from slamming on his 
sisters fingers the portable seat belt for school buses by 
michelle cardin 10 of fairfield conn an artificial reef to 
help young fish by brian lloyd 15 of jacksonville fla and a 
scheme for solar energy from space by sachin patel 7 of flatonia 
texas 
the us patent model foundation launched invent america in 
december 1986 with corporate financing and moral support from the 
reagan administration it expects 8 million students in 35000 us 
elementary schools to take part in this years competition 
kazuhiko hoshino president of the japan institute of invention 
and innovation said the visit will help the japanese youths 
develop new ideas and high creativity 
in order to cope with the current trend toward 
internationalization we consider it important for japanese school 
students to visit overseas at every opportunity he said

a witness for gov evan mecham today told 
senators considering whether to remove the governor from office 
that a fund mecham is accused of misuing was not public money nor 
controlled by state law 
political consultant and lawyer robert lecuyer testified that 
mechams inaugural committee chairman lacked the authority to bind 
the governor to restrictions on how the money could be used 
mecham a firstterm republican is being tried by the arizona 
senate on three impeachment counts including alleged misuse of 
80000 from a protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership 
the defense has contended the fund created with proceeds from 
inaugural activities was not public money while the prosecution 
contends it was 
lecuyer testified today that because the protocol fund was not 
public money in his opinion mecham was not restricted by state 
laws that govern the use of public funds 
he said he thought the loan was legal but stupid 
inaugural committee chairman william long had told the maricopa 
county attorneys office in a 1987 letter that the fund would be 
used to either benefit the state or to promote citizen 
participation in state activities 
the june 26 letter from william long to the county attorney 
was of absolutely no force or effect in relation to the mecham 
inaugural committee funds because the fund already had been 
turned over to mecham and long no longer chaired the inaugural 
committee lecuyer said 
lecuyer also described a meeting in may 1987 in which he 
agreed despite misgivings to advise the governor on mechams 
plans to publish a tabloid touting his administration 
the governor and i started off with a shouting match 
lecuyer said the two of us yelled at each other for the better 
part of the hour he said adding that if the tabloid was used as 
a campaign tool to attack lawmakers that could become a 
violation people could go to jail for that kind of a violation 
he did not elaborate 
the governor cooperated with lecuyer on campaign finance 
matters after that meeting the consultant said 
lecuyer was hired by mecham last fall to provide legal opinions 
on the propriety of the governors failure to report a 350000 
campaign loan the consultant said last fall that mecham properly 
reported the loan by lumping it in with other amounts 
mecham faces a charge of concealing the 350000 loan in both 
the impeachment trial and criminal court the senate already has 
heard testimony on another charge that he tried to thwart an 
investigation on an alleged death threat 
on monday senators indicated they were taking a dim view of 
mechams proposal that they vote now on two of the impeachment 
articles concerning the death threat and the protocol fund 
against him and promise to drop the third regarding the campaign 
loan 
the chances of that happening are about as good of me jumping 
off the top of the highest building i can find in the 
neighborhood said senate majority leader bob usdane who like 
mecham is a republican 
also monday the governors lawyer jerris leonard said monday 
that mecham has a firm agreement to sell the land and buildings 
of his mecham pontiac dealership for about 4 million 
leonard said he did not know who the prospective buyer was when 
the deal would be closed or whether mecham was keeping his pontiac 
franchise 
during his own testimony monday on the protocol fund mecham 
angrily disrupted the proceedings after house prosecutor william 
french compared his actions to embezzlement 
i have to make a statement mecham declared ignoring orders 
from arizona supreme court justice frank gordon to refrain from 
comments beyond answering questions asked 
i resent so highly the word embezzlement in my presence 
mecham said im insulted by it 
gordon admonished mecham again telling him i hope you 
believe the rules are for you sir as well as everybody else 
mecham responded hotly i have seen no witness who has been 
insulted as i have been 
in his testimony monday the governor suggested that the senate 
drop the third charge and vote right away on the first two counts 
if you want to say well call this game at the end of six 
innings and do it vote then with the fact that that is the game 
why i dont suppose we could argue with you on that one mecham 
said 
however senate minority leader alan stephens a democrat 
agreed with usdane that it would be ridiculous to expect the 
senate to drop the 350000 loan allegation 
a twothirds vote of the 30member senate on any one of the 
counts is required to convict the governor automatically removing 
him from office a similar twothirds vote would be needed to 
change the rules to allow an early vote on the first two 
impeachment counts 
mecham who also faces a may 17 recall election is the first 
us governor to be impeached in six decades

the seventh national conference on humor is 
no joke 
to tell you the truth it may be excruciatingly boring 
victor raskin a purdue university english professor coordinating 
the weekend conference said tuesday 
there will be one lecture on the peanuts cartoon i have no 
idea how that will turn out said shaun fd hughes an associate 
professor of english who is helping raskin coordinate the 
conference there will be one on the theory of humor that tends 
to be more deadly 
the theme is midwestern humor there will be some papers on 
mark twain said hughes there will be one from northwestern 
university on chicago political humor 
hughes will present a deadly paper its called physician 
humor thyself its icelandic medical humor icelandic people 
they say have no sense of humor and this tends to bear that out 
he said 
raskin said in a recent university statement in the last 
decade humor has been increasingly recognized as an essential and 
universal human facility and as such has become the subject of 
highpowered and widely interdisciplinary research 
the conference at purdues west lafayette campus will be about 
80 percent academic says raskin the last six such conferences 
were held at arizona state university always on april fools day 
during the breaks there may be a lot of laughter said 
raskin then on sunday night there is a public joketelling 
contest they can tell jokes juggle anything to elicit laughter 
the winner gets a purse of maybe 60 or something 
but the point or punchline is quite serious 
psychologists want to know why we appreciate humor says 
raskin sociologists are interested in humors role in society 
anthropologists want to know why what is funny to one society is 
not funny to another 
luckily some parts of it will be funny says hughes 
sometimes they insert jokes into the lecture

michigan welfare clients may get free condoms 
from their pharmacists in a new program to provide birth control 
and help stem the spread of aids 
ohio wisconsin illinois new york and pennsylvania already 
provide condoms for medicaid recipients by prescription for 
accounting purposes some state rules require prescriptions for 
many items given medicaid recipients by pharmacists 
but michigan apparently will be the first state to provide the 
condoms without prescriptions state and federal officials say 
the state department of social services is notifying medicaid 
recipients and pharmacists about the program scheduled to begin 
june 1 chuck peller a spokesman for dds said monday 
the condoms can be obtained by men or women presenting a 
medicaid card to a pharmacist peller said 
there is no specific budget for the program the state has not 
estimated its cost and the dss has no idea of the anticipated 
usage peller said 
the latest state budget bill included the requirement for free 
condoms to medicaid recipients peller said 
richard chambers a spokesman for the us department of health 
and human services said from washington that he knows of no other 
state that authorizes free distribution of condoms without a 
prescription 
the federal government reimburses states for 90 percent of the 
costs of family planning services chambers said 
to guard against fraud including what peller called the

the house republicans conference in houston 
last weekend was supposed to be a retreat but lawmakers joked that 
it was more like an advance 
they led an invading army that included 42 us capitol police 
officers police dogs the house physician the house clerk office 
assistants reporters camera crews and the staff of the national 
republican congressional committee which helps run their 
campaigns many brought their families 
they traveled with a legion of lobbyists many of whom helped 
finance the three chartered jetliners lawmakers hotel rooms and 
banquets paid for under the auspices of the congressional institute 
inc a taxexempt corporation set up for these occasions 
sam richardson a spokesman for the conference said the total 
cost had not yet been calculated he said one of the banquets 
canceled later because of a bomb threat cost 12000 reporters 
each were charged 413 for travel and meals with hotel bills extra 
one of the goals of the threeday conference was for the 70 
lawmakers attending to let their hair down but the program listed 
suitandtie or womens business attire for three straight days 
even at a texmex dinner 
theyre going to think were all a bunch of stuffed shirts 
complained one member who got no argument from his wife nearby 
while in houston the republicans sought some hightech themes 
for their national agenda they sought camaraderie they sought a 
strategy in their marathon battle to take control of the house back 
from the democrats for the first time in 34 years 
the thing they surely found which isnt in evidence much in 
washington was some humor 
during the threeday meeting the gop squad traveled back and 
forth across the city in bus motorcades along the way police 
blocked side streets and freeway ramps while frustrated local 
motorists didnt know whom to blame 
there is only one thing to do at a time like this one of 
the gop lawmakers said staring at a line of blocked traffic 
put a big sign on the bus that says mickey leland reelection 
committee jim wright chairman he said referring to the local 
democratic congressman and the house speaker 
the house republicans didnt use police escorts at their last 
gettogether a year ago in new york 
they had asked the nypd how long it would take to get from their 
midtown hotel to federal hall for their meetings 
thirtyfive minutes was the answer and if they used an 
escort 
forty minutes came the reply 
at the houston hotel a lobbyist from one of the regional phone 
companies was handing out complimentary pens remember if it 
breaks we only fix the outside you have to go to atampt for the 
inside he warned 
the conference was held in a lovely four seasons hotel but 
houstons already summersticky weather prompted a reporter to dub 
it the one season 
perhaps the highlight of the trip was a spectacular laser and 
fireworks show at the johnson space center 
the climax came when the doors of a huge hangar opened up and 
the spectators wandered into a misty night sliced and diced by 
lasers stretching across the horizon 
i thought a big clamshell was going to open up and wed walk 
in and fly away one lawmaker quipped about the eerie scene 
another seemed concerned that the laser beams were hitting the 
nearby hilton hotel 
i just cant help but thinking he said that theres some 
poor salesman up in one of those rooms thinking about fooling 
around on his wife and then hes zapped by a green light beam 
hell never try that again the congressman predicted 
by the end of three days the lawmakers were eager to return to 
washington and to finish this years business early so that they 
can hit the reelection campaign trail 
we have to go home and tell our constituents this mess isnt 
our fault one explained

house negotiators working on aid for the 
nicaraguan rebels tried today to resolve a dispute over whether 
president reagan should be able to command quick congressional 
action on any military aid request 
we still have significant debate over how a future request 
from the president for military aid would be treated rep dick 
cheney of wyoming chairman of the house republican conference 
said after gop congressional leaders met with the president 
cheney said one possibility discussed was that instead of 
spelling out the procedures in the bill the house would rely on a 
promise by speaker jim wright dtexas that there will be a speedy 
vote on such a request 
i think if the speaker would give his word we would find that 
acceptable he said if we can work out an arrangement whereby 
the speaker would commit in advance to give us timely consideration 
for the vote and he would bring it up under a fair rule i think 
that would solve the problem 
rep trent lott the house republican whip said we would be 
willing to take the speakers word but we are going to have to 
have a clear understanding of what that word means 
when asked whether such a gentlemens agreement could be 
sold to house republicans lott said it would be very difficult 
because while they the democrats say they are suspicious of the 
presidents request for expedited procedures we dont trust 
them either 
he said however that he believed house republicans would 
support such an agreement if it were worked out between wright and 
house gop leader robert michel of illinois wright and michel were 
in new jersey today attending the funeral of democratic rep james 
howard 
lott said reagan didnt sign on to the idea of such an 
agreement but i know the president has a lot of faith in 
michel cheney and rep mickey edwards rokla the principal 
negotiators 
if they can get something that they can accept and work with 
i am sure that will carry a lot of weight with the president 
lott said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the dollar amounts 
of aid mentioned in the negotiations ranging from 30 million to 
less than 50million were acceptable to reagan 
the issue is not money but how fast we can get it to help 
assure the survival of the nicaraguan contra rebels as a fighting 
force fitzwater said we want it as fast as we can get it he 
said 
he added that the issue of an acceptable means of delivering aid 
to the contras is still an open question to be worked out by 
the negotiators subject to proposals for ceasefire zones in 
nicaragua 
leaders of the chamber worked for five hours monday on the 
package and roughed out a sixmonth 40 million aid bill that 
would send strictly humanitarian aid food clothing medicine 
and shelter while the rebels negotiate a permanent peace with the 
countrys leftist sandinista government 
we reached some general understandings in a number of areas 
but there were some stumbling points said house democratic whip 
tony coelho of california who added that meetings would resume 
today 
coelho held out hope that an agreement still could be forged in 
time to bring the matter to the house floor on wednesday and permit 
the senate time to act and get the aid flowing before easter he 
cited reports that the rebels may exhaust their basic supplies 
within a week or two 
the 40 million would keep supplies flowing to the rebels as 
they wait out the continuing negotiations in ceasefire zones 
inside nicaragua the aid would flow at a rate comparable to that 
provided before feb 29 when the last us support ran out the 
package also would include 10 million to pay the expenses of a 
commission to verify compliance with the peace accord 
for this peace effort to work theres got to be this aid 
said adolfo calero a leader of the rebel political directorate 
who met with wright and other congressional leaders on the aid 
package 
any new aid for the contras would have to conform to the 
requirements of a 60day truce reached last week between the rebels 
and the managua government 
that agreement said the contras would receive only humanitarian 
aid and that the aid would be routed through neutral 
organizations the cia has delivered past us aid supplies to 
the contras 
calero said he told wright and house minority leader robert 
michel rill that the term neutral organizations meant a 
commercial transport company acceptable to the rebels and not a 
relief organization such as the red cross which wright had 
previously mentioned as the delivery agent 
other details of the package remained to be determined such as 
whether it would include communications gear for the rebels or 
special programs such as a 14 million effort to help children who 
are victims of the nearly 7yearold civil war which has claimed 
some 40000 lives 
republicans wary of sandinista promises have sought to give 
reagan the right to a quick guaranteed vote in congress on a later 
request for new military aid to the contras if the peace process 
breaks down as expected that was proving to be the most difficult 
issue 
wright and michel were seeking a compromise that would indicate 
continued us backing for the rebels during the ceasefire but 
would give congress the final say on the nature of any future aid 
package 
after meeting monday with the contra leadership secretary of 
state george p shultz told reporters it would certainly be 
desirable to have assurances of quick action on additional aid to 
the contras if the peace talks break down and calero agreed 
in last weks agreement the sandinistas promised a general 
amnesty for the rebels which began with the release sunday of 100 
prisoners they also committed themselves to a restoration of the 
rights of free speech and political participation in return for 
the 60day ceasefire and the relocation of contra forces into 
special zones 
representatives of the two sides are meeting this week to work 
out the details of a longterm ceasefire including when the 
rebels will lay down their weapons

rep richard gephardt took an aggressive tack 
in his democratic presidential bid but he bowed out of the race in 
a mellower mood with family and friends at his side he filed for 
reelection to his house seat today declaring himself happy 
i have no complaints today im the luckiest guy in the 
world gephardt said monday after announcing his withdrawal at an 
upbeat news conference that contrasted with the grim economic 
tidings he purveyed in his campaign 
we did the best we possibly could he said we made our 
mistakes and we lost 
in jefferson city mo today the missouri congressman filed 
for reelection to the 3rd congressional district seat from st 
louis a seat he has held since 1976 
i am very happy to be here its a good thing i didnt wait 
another day gephardt quipped referring to the fact that today 
was the filing deadline 
gephardt was accompanied by his wife and mother 
on monday he said he intended to be back in the thick of house 
business on wednesday and in a variation on his campaign message 
to the economically disadvantaged pledged that your fight will 
always be my fight too 
gephardt 47 ran some of the most negative tv ads of the 
campaign against massachusetts gov michael dukakis but he was 
pushing party unity on monday 
i think our candidate is going to come from the people that 
are running now for the presidency and i think were going to put a 
democrat in the white house in 1988 said gephardt who is 
chairman of the house democratic caucus 
he declined when asked to give advice to dukakis noting the 
governors delegate lead and ruefully admitting that michael 
dukakis has sure done a lot better than i did i dont think its 
my place to tell him what to do 
as for jesse jackson who trounced both gephardt and dukakis 
last saturday in the michigan caucuses gephardt commented i 
think jesse jackson can be nominated and i think he can be 
elected 
gephardt refused to endorse anyone in the race but said he might 
do so later asked about the prospects of him running again in the 
future gephardt said he expected a democrat to be elected this 
fall and reelected in 1992 nineteenninetysix is so far off i 
cant even see it he said 
most of gephrdts 167 delegates went into the uncommitted 
column but missouri state party rules mandate that the atlarge 
and public official delegates are redivided among the active 
candidates when a contender drops out 
according to the latest ap delegate count jackson had 60655 
dukakis 60555 sen albert gore jr 3628 sen paul simon 1685 
and uncommitted 5156 
gephardt began campaigning in iowa the leadoff caucus state 
some two years ago on the theory that an iowa victory would 
translate into momentum and his campaign would take off he did win 
iowa as well as south dakota and his home state but his candidacy 
never developed broad appeal 
looking back gephardt attributed the failure to a lack of 
resources and said that where he was able to get his ideas across 
we did connect but he added i have no alibis we lost no 
question about that 
he said he did not blame his defeats on either his position as a 
house member a difficult jumpingoff place or press coverage that 
some considered unduly negative 
by and large the press has been fair to dick gephardt i 
didnt like every article that was written but im not supposed 
to he said 
gephardt was a pragmatic consensus builder in the house and many 
news stories focused on his transition to antiestablishment 
populist with controversial ideas on trade and farms 
gephardt was an insider trying to run as an outsider and he 
got creamed for it said robert lichter a media analyst logging 
all election stories on the three networks evening news shows this 
year 
gephardt was also vulnerable because he had switched positions 
on issues ranging from abortion to reaganomics over the years 
the wellheeled dukakis ran a television ad showing a man 
flipflopping through the air and another with a list of gephardts 
corporate contributors sen albert gore jr of tennessee not only 
attacked gephardt on his changes of heart but appropriated the 
same populist theme 
after michigan gehpardt had less than onethird the delegate 
totals amassed by dukakis and jackson and fewer than even sen paul 
simon of illinois who didnt compete in the 20 contests on super 
tuesday march 8

the no 2 official in the justice department 
and the head of the departments criminal division abruptly 
resigned today amid continuing legal problems for their boss 
attorney general edwin meese iii 
deputy attorney general arnold burns and assistant attorney 
general william weld announced in letters to president reagan that 
they were stepping down with welds resignation effective at the 
close of business today 
the first meese knew of their plans was when burns and weld 
walked into the attorney generals office at 8 am and announced 
they were stepping aside said a department source speaking on 
condition of anonymity the news was announced to department 
officials at the morning staff meeting a half hour later both have 
served since oct 17 1986 
two assistants to burns randy levine and boykin rose and two 
assistants to weld mark robinson and jane serene also resigned 
the officials provided no explanation for their sudden actions 
but the source said meeses continuing legal problems were 
definitely a factor in the resignations 
meese has been under criminal investigation for nearly a year 
neither burns nor weld mentioned meeses legal problems in their 
resignation letters 
questioned about the resignations sen strom thurmond ranking 
republican on the senate judiciary committee said i am greatly 
concerned about morale at the department of justice as indicated by 
the resignation of these two men and of four additional officials 
who i am informed have also resigned 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said he was surprised to see 
them leaving at this period of time and added it certainly 
doesnt signify a great deal of confidence in the attorney 
general but the senator said he did not know why the officials 
quit 
assistant republican floor leader alan k simpson rwyo who 
also serves on the senate judiciary committee said if you 
believe in fairness you have to wait and see what caused the 
resignations 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said white house 
officials were informed of the resignations on monday he said 
reagan accepted them with regret this morning and thanked burns 
and weld for serving with distinction 
fitzwater said he didnt believe the two departing officials 
spoke directly to reagan and he said he was only aware of the 
reasons they gave in their resignation letters the spokesman said 
reagan continues to have full confidence in meese and the 
justice department 
fitzwater said the resignations did not cause any particular 
concern among reagan and his advisers we have people resigning 
all the time especially late in the administration he said 
burns resignation is effective april 22 welds temporary 
replacement will be john keeney a deputy in the criminal division 
the resignations combined with the departure of associate 
attorney general stephen s trott to become a federal judge leave 
a leadership vacuum of major proportions in the justice department 
burns letter to reagan said that under your leadership i 
believe we have made important contributions to the administration 
of justice unfortunately i have regretfully concluded that i 
must return to private life at this time 
weld a former us attorney in boston who has prosecuted a 
number of important public corruption and whitecollar crime cases 
told reagan that i am grateful to have been charged with the 
responsibility of seeing that justice be done without fear or 
favor 
another department source also speaking on condition of 
anonymity said that neither burns nor weld acted in the belief 
that meese is about to be indicted 
however said the source both men are concerned because the 
justice departments image continues to be damaged due to the 
ongoing criminal investigation of meese the nations top law 
enforcement officer 
terry eastland a justice department spokesman pointed out that 
it is not unusual for political appointees to leave government in 
the last year of an administration 
eastland said that burns weld and trott who was confirmed as a 
judge last week were sworn into their jobs in 1986 and that this 
is 1988 this happens to be a year when people are leaving and they 
all happen to be leaving at the same time 
meese has been under investigation for 11 months independent 
counsel james mckay launched the probe last may 11 to look into 
meeses involvement with the scandalplagued wedtech corp the 
investigation has expanded to include his involvement in a 1 
billion iraqi pipeline project 
meese got involved in both wedtech and the pipeline through his 
longtime friend e robert wallach 
this morning former national security adviser william clark was 
testifying before a federal grand jury in connection with the 
pipeline project mckays office is presenting evidence to the 
grand jury 
mckays probe is in its final phase say sources familiar with 
the investigation but it could continue for at least another month 
or two

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge climbed 09 percent in february a sharp rebound following 
several months of weakness after the october stock market collapse 
the commerce department reported today 
the gain in the index of leading economic indicators was the 
biggest increase since last june it followed declines of 11 
percent in january 01 percent in october and 12 percent in 
november 
only a 04 percent rise in december kept the index from posting 
consecutive declines for three or more months the traditional 
signal of an impending recession 
but with the big february increase analysts said they believe 
the leading index is accurately signaling that the economy slowed 
in the early part of 1988 but the country will avoid a recession 
this year 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the index shows 
that the economy is very promising 
the size and broadbased nature of last months index of 
leading indicators are encouraging fitzwater said 
the 09 percent february increase was led by a big jump in 
applications for building permits which provided over half of the 
strength last month 
in all five of the available nine indicators were positive 
forces on the index after building permits the biggest 
contributors were a drop in new unemployment claims a rise in 
stock prices an increase in the growth of the money supply and 
higher orders for consumer goods 
four of the indicators held the index back the biggest negative 
factor was a decline in the length of the average manufacturing 
workweek followed by a decline in orders for plant and equipment 
a change in raw materials prices and a speedup in business 
delivery times considered a negative because it is often a sign of 
dropping demand 
the various changes left the index at 1906 percent of its 1967 
base of 100 
the jump in the february index was one of a string of recent 
reports showing betterthanexpected strength in the early part of 
1988 
many economists believe the strong reports have all but 
eliminated the chances of a recession this year 
right now the economy is looking a lot better than we thought 
it was going to look three months ago said david wyss an 
economist with data resources inc of lexington mass 
at the end of last year economists were worried about a huge 
buildup of unsold products which they feared would lead to 
declines in factory orders and rising unemployment as businesses 
scaled back production plans 
while there have been some production declines notably in the 
auto industry employment has risen sharply in the first two months 
of the year pushing the jobless rate down to an 8year low of 57 
percent in february 
these job gains along with other economic reports have eased 
recession worries good news for republicans hoping to hold onto 
the white house this year 
the reagan administration is predicting that the overall 
economy as measured by the gross national product will expand at 
a modest 24 percent rate this year a forecast which is only 
slightly more optimistic than the predictions being made by many 
private economists 
the governments first look at overall economic growth will not 
come until next month when the commerce department releases its 
first estimate of the performance of the gnp during the 
januarymarch quarter 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said he 
believed the gnp grew at an annual rate of 13 percent in the first 
quarter and will drop to a rate of 1 percent in the apriljune 
quarter before picking up strength in the last half of the year 
while this would represent sluggish growth it is a significant 
improvement from evans earlier forecast that the country would be 
in a recession in the early part of this year 
the economy is sluggish but not declining and by the second 
half of the year we should see better growth evans said

journalists have special protection against 
courtordered disclosure of notes photographs and other 
information gathered on a nonconfidential basis new yorks 
highest court ruled tuesday 
in a 60 ruling the state court of appeals formulated for the 
first time a test to be used when courts are asked to require 
disclosure the test the court said protects reporters more than 
other people against divulging information 
the autonomy of the press would be jeopardized if resort to 
its resource materials by litigants seeking to utilize the 
newsgathering efforts of journalists for their private purposes 
were routinely permitted judge stewart hancock jr wrote for the 
court 
hancock added that because journalists typically gather 
information about accidents crimes and other matters of special 
interest that often give rise to litigation requiring routine 
disclosure of those materials would be widespread 
the ruling said courts can order journalists to turn over 
nonconfidential information only if it is highly material to 
the litigation critical to the claim being brought in court 
and not otherwise available 
the case before the court involved attempts by a man injured in 
an auto accident at a construction site to sue the contractors a 
photographer for the gannett rochester newspapers took 58 
photographs of the accident scene one of which was published in 
the rochester democrat and chronicle 
lawyers for the man sought copies of all the pictures in the 
process of building its case 
gannett refused but two state courts state supreme court in 
monroe county and the appellate division of state supreme court 
ruled that since the photographs were gathered on a 
nonconfidential basis their disclosure wasnt protected under the 
state shield law 
peter danziger who filed a brief with the court in the case on 
behalf of the new york state newspaper publishers association and 
several news organizations called the ruling a tremendous 
victory for the public and the press

president reagans chief spokesman expressed 
outrage today at violence against antigovernment marchers in 
panama and said there are limits to our patience 
while restating that it has been us policy not to intervene 
militarily spokesman marlin fitzwater also said it has always 
been a principle that we will protect american citizens as best we 
can 
meanwhile ousted panamanian president eric arturo delvalle 
asked the united states and other democracies to send a military 
force to panama to remove strongman manuel antonio noriega 
delvalle who has been in hiding since he was deposed from 
office a month ago relayed the message through ambassador juan b 
sosa who said he will formally convey the request to the state 
department 
we are all angry at this latest demonstration at people being 
beaten and threatened fitzwater said 
i just want to express the outrage of all of us about this 
incident fitzwater said 
fitzwater said the noriega regime is showing its true colors 
it is desperate and afraid of its own people and the free press 
the people of panama as well as the leaders arrested yesterday 
have demonstrated their determination to take on the noriega 
regime despite these heavyhanded efforts at intimidation 
fitzwater said 
the thousands of panamanians who braved tear gas skin 
irritant sprays and birdshot yestrerday show that intimidation will 
not solve noriegas problems 
the spokesman said the united states continued to recommend that 
american citizens defer travel to panama and that those who do go 
there avoid political gatherings and exercise caution 
we continue to consider options for dealing with the 
problem he said 
i think its clear that there are limits to the activities of 
mr noriega and limits to our patience and our policy endurance 
he said it has always been a principle that we will protect 
american citizens as best we can and while we have said that we 
dont plan to go in militarily its also important to note that 
there are limits 
troops firing shotguns tear gas and water cannon routed 
thousands of antigovernment marchers monday then stormed a hotel 
to arrest opposition activists and journalists 
several people were injured and dozens were arrested witnesses 
said in one of the largest protests in months against noriega 
security agents forced their way at gunpoint into the offices of 
nbc cbs abc and cnn tapes including footage of the days march 
were confiscated eight foreign journalists including americans 
were detained for several hours before being released 
when asked if any action was expected today fitzwater replied 
i cant say in advance that anything is expected today but i 
would remind you that our concern and monitoring is on a daily 
basis 
he was asked whether the president had any meetings on the 
subject today and answered no not that i can comment on 
he said the us troops stationed at the panama canal had not 
been placed on special alert but are in a position to respond 
appropriately 
they are there and they are our troops and they are available 
for whatever needs might arise he said 
we are certainly concerned by this threat to americans and 
find it a very difficult turn of events and one that is contrary to 
assurances that we have received in the past fitzwater said 
i do want to say when i say that our endurance is not 
unlimited that we certainly are willing to take a look at all the 
hard options but our policy remains the same and our intention 
that we would not be using military force fitzwater said 
declaring that panama is being held hostage by noriega sosa 
told a news conference the united states and other nations must 
join together to force the removal of noriega 
were asking the international community to help sosa said 
were paying the price but weve got no weapons give us 
weapons 
state department spokesman charles redman called the raid on the 
hotel a shocking demonstration of the antidemocratic nature of 
the noriega regime and noriegas alarming willingness to use brutal 
tactics as his position in panama deteriorates 
he had no comment on sosas appeal for an international force 
in previous days the administration has sidestepped that issue 
declining to say what options it has under consideration

president reagan looked so old and careworn 
after he was told of the challenger explosion in which seven space 
pioneers died that spokesman larry speakes refused to release a 
photograph of him to the press 
speakes account of the scene in the oval office on jan 28 
1986 is one of a number vignettes of the reagan white house that 
the former chief presidential spokesman provides in a new book 
speaking out scheduled for publication may 1 by charles 
scribners sons 
a white house photographer rushed in to record the moment 
speakes writes the president had the saddest look on his face i 
have ever seen he also looked extremely old that photograph was 
so unflattering that i refused to release it to the press 
speakes who became vice president for communications at merrill 
lynch after leaving the white house in february 1987 writes as an 
admirer of the president but adds that he is not blind to the 
mans flaws and weaknesses 
during the first year or two of the administration he says 
aides failed to keep reagan abreast of what was going on in the 
news 
when there was a lapse of much time between press interviews 
or news conferences he would be totally out of the swim on what 
was in the press and what had happened two weeks ago and it would 
be like reinventing the wheel to get him prepared the former 
spokesman says 
he said reagan does not read many newspapers thoroughly and 
his habit is to read the comics first 
although the president frequently uses sports metaphors and 
stories speakes says reagan is not really an avid fan 
he talks baseball at world series time and football at super 
bowl time but does not follow those sports regularly and he knows 
next to nothing about sports other than baseball and football 
the former spokesman writes 
when the irancontra arms and money affair broke says speakes 
my own advice to the president which i gave him several times 
was to admit that he had made a mistake reagan never quite 
brought himself to do that 
discussing whether reagan knew of the diversion of iran arms 
sale profits to nicaraguas contra rebels the former white house 
aide says frankly i dont believe the man can tell a lie the 
man can make a mistake and the man can hear something so many times 
that he believes something is true when it really isnt but he 
simply isnt a liar i have no doubt that indicted former national 
security council aide oliver north thought the president knew what 
was going on but north was wrong 
speakes has pungent words for members of the presidents 
personal and official families although in his six years as the 
principal white house spokesman he presented a glowing portrait of 
them and turned aside reports of bickering and dissension 
in the book coauthored with robert pack he writes of the 
presidents daughter maureen you didnt want to stir her up 
maureen is a straightforward punchyouinthenose type her 
husband dennis revell seems to live in mortal fear of her ive 
seen her cut him down one side and up the other and he just stands 
there and takes it 
of first lady nancy reagan he writes mrs reagan is more 
circumspect more likely to stab you in the back 
elaine crispen the first ladys press secretary said mrs 
reagan had not read the book and would have no comment susanne 
rich an aide to the presidents daughter did not respond to a 
request for ms reagans reaction 
speakes successor at the white house marlin fitzwater said 
reagan heard a number of comments about the book from reporters 
during a speaking trip to richmond va on monday but in an 
amazing show of discipline and selfdetermination the president 
said nothing 
i dont think i want to comment on larry speakes book 
fitzwater added 
writing of john poindexter norths boss who also has been 
indicted speakes says that when he showed poindexter a message 
saying the first news of the iran arms deals had broken in the 
press in iran he maintained a poker face betraying no emotion 
at all in retrospect he gave an academy awardwinning 
performance 
of vice president george bush speakes says the popular image 
may be accurate that he does not have a strong philosophical base 
that he is not decisive that he is not willing to take stands on 
the big issues 
as for former secretary of defense caspar weinberger he was a 
hardliner a small man a whiny type of guy with a green eyeshade 
he would have looked just like an accountant instead of the head of 
our largest governmental department

michael dukakis battled jesse jackson as 
well as increasing doubts about his democratic presidential 
candidacy in the connecticut primary on tuesday vice president 
george bush coasted on the republican side as vanquished rival bob 
dole readied to quit the race 
massachusetts gov dukakis and bush both aimed to cement 
sixstate new england sweeps but their similarities ended there 
dukakis led jackson the man with momentum in the race as well 
as sen albert gore jr and sen paul simon with about 50 percent 
of the vote in one preelection poll 
the governor hoped for a victory big enough to reassure the 
skeptics after his landslide loss to jackson in the michigan 
caucuses last weekend and his thirdplace finish in the illinois 
primary on march 15 
jackson aimed for a strong secondplace showing that would 
embarrass dukakis in his own back yard and give fresh impetus to 
the campaign that has been the democratic surprise of the year 
gore spent an estimated 75000 on television advertising in 
hopes of demonstrating strength in the northeast 
in contrast to the democratic disarray bushs super tuesday 
spectacular showing on march 8 turned his campaign into a stately 
march toward the nomination dole his oncestrong tormenter 
arranged a withdrawal speech in washington while the polls were 
open in connecticut 
that left pat robertson as bushs only surviving challenger but 
he has signaled that he is a candidate in name only and is 
spending the time between now and the gop convention developing a 
network of supporters for 1992 
connecticuts primary offered 35 delegates to the republican 
national convention and 52 on the democratic side 
before the returns from connecticut were read the associated 
press delegate count looked this way 
bush had 788 delegates to 17 for robertson it takes 1139 to 
claim the nomination 
jackson and dukakis both had 6065 with 2082 needed to gain 
the democratic nomination gore had 365 and simon 169 
simon made little effort in connecticut and rep richard 
gephardt dropped out of the democratic race on monday 
but dukakis was still suffering the effects of wounds received 
in illinois and michigan and anything less than an overpowering 
victory in nextdoor connecticut would do little to quell the 
complaints that his candidacy lacks spark 
thus connecticut looked merely like a prelude to bigger 
democratic battles to come 
gore and simon were planning costly television advertising in 
wisconsin ahead of next tuesdays primary there jackson was 
running virtually even with dukakis in polls there taken before 
the former civil rights leader scored his michigan landslide 
further away were the two big industrial state battles in new 
york and pennsylvania thus despite gephardts withdrawal the 
democratic race seemed as muddled as ever 
even before doles speech bush had begun turning his attention 
toward the fall campaign campaign officials said he had decided to 
name business executive fred v malek to oversee his activities at 
the republican national convention 
in a sign of gathering republican unity former contender jack 
kemp returned to the campaign to endorse bush at a news conference 
in wisconsin 
doles withdrawal came less than two months after he handily 
defeated bush in the leadoff iowa caucuses but he then lost new 
hampshires primary and three weeks later was shut out in all 17 
super tuesday states 
the democratic race couldnt have been more confusing 
michigan gave the momentum to jackson but he is a black 
liberal candidate whom many party officials believe cannot possibly 
win the white house and thus should not be nominated 
his enhanced standing in the race prompted an extraordinary 
public debate among party officials about the possibility or 
desirability of organizing a stopjackson movement 
jackson campaigned vigorously in connecticut as he tried to 
build on the momentum he received from his win in michigan he 
sometimes seemed to aim his message at the partys bigwigs around 
the country as well as at the voters of a single state 
if at the end of california we have the most popular votes 
and the most delegate votes becoming the nominee is logical and 
proper he said on monday 
he challenged the notion that party leaders could turn to 
someone else at the convention 
they would not have given me the nomination i would have 
earned it from the people he said 
dukakis had spent considerable energy in recent days 
constructing a bandwagon designed to carry him to the nomination 
he was winning endorsement after endorsement to go with campaign 
organization and financing that is the envy of other contenders 
and was backed in connecticut by gov william oneill and sen 
christopher dodd 
but his poor showing in michigan prompted several party leaders 
to publicly question his ability to generate support and it has 
raised anew speculation about a deadlocked party convention casting 
about for a noncandidate to be its nominee 
dukakis aides were confident their man would win connecticut 
but penciled in a few additional campaign appearances on monday 
after the results of michigan had sunk in 
for his part dukakis was reluctant to take on jackson directly 
im not running against jackson and he is not running 
against me we are running for the presidency he told one 
questioner 
gore initially said he hoped to surprise dukakis in connecticut 
but he seemed to have shifted his focus to wisconsin and the new 
york primary on april 19 in his bid to show he can attract votes 
outside his native south 
simon a favorite son winner in illinois on march 15 decided to 
stay out of connecticut and point instead toward wisconsin aides 
said he might reassess his campaign shorthand for withdrawal if 
he did poorly there

some merchants in this beach city 
say the loss of the richard m nixon presidential library will hurt 
tourism so much they may be forced to close 
but one historian suggests a museum dedicated to the president 
who once lived here could be the answer 
nixon was here for 11 years and cannot be neglected said 
san clemente historical society president charles ashbaugh its 
not a case of apathy in the city its just that everyone has 
thrown their hands up and said what can we do now 
a 13acre blufftop property owned by the lusk co was targeted 
for several years as the future home of the library but it was 
tied to a private development and after numerous delays nixon 
decided to put the library in yorba linda where he was born nixon 
now lives in saddle river nj 
with the library and its estimated 40 million pages of official 
documents photographs videotapes recordings and gifts from 
foreign leaders went merchants dreams of tourist dollars 
im going to close my business said mike lazarus who has 
owned a shop called jeans alley for 13 years now that the town 
blew it and lost the library that really killed the town 
businesswise the city had expected it to bring anywhere from 
300000 to 600000 people here a year 
a group called citizens for a responsive council tried 
unsuccessfully to recall three city council members after the loss 
of the library 
i think there are some people who are bitter out there who 
have invested some time and money into the city becoming a resort 
center and who thought they were going to make some money on the 
tourist thing said tom davis spokesman for the chamber of 
commerce 
the historical society holds such trinkets as presidential 
matchbooks and playing cards toothpaste from china and menus from 
state dinners 
meanwhile ashbaugh is trying to establish a museum in honor of 
the nations 37th president and olen hanson the citys founder 
it would be located in hansons former home a 20room villa called 
casa romantica 
the homes current owner george welsh wants to sell but does 
not want the estate bulldozed for development interested buyers 
include two developers one of whom would give the house to the 
historical society and build condos nearby and the city which 
would provide half the house for a museum

sen alfonse m damato rny said tuesday 
he has evidence that gen manuel antonio noriegas troops are 
trying to sabotage the panama canal and he called on president 
reagan to quickly take whatever steps necessary to bring about 
noriegas removal 
damato while declining to specify his sources said he has 
obtained information that the panama defense forces are now 
actively looking to sabotage the canal 
he said he knows of one attempt to cut the wires to disable 
one of the locks and of other episodes in which canal employees 
were threatened and beaten 
with sen john kerry dmass and panamanian ambassador juan b 
sosa a noriega opponent at his side damato declared at a news 
conference that the crisis in panama is becoming more and more a 
danger to the security of the united states 
many cuban intelligence officers and technical people are 
being flown into panama he said the strategically important 
canal is the next step it would be tragic if the canal fell into 
cuban president fidel castros hands 
neither senator called directly for armed intervention by the 
united states but damato declared that decisive action is 
imperative the longer we delay the cubanization of panama becomes 
a very real threat and we run the risk of losing the support of 
the people of panama 
im not going to specifically suggest the means said 
damato but we have the force necessary to bring about the legal 
removal of noriega 
kerry agreed saying he cannot understand why part of the 
administration is working on a policy that says noriega must go 
and part of it is working on how we deal with him if he manages to 
stay on 
damato said he had expressed his views earlier in the day to 
defense department officials and expected reagan to get the 
message via the media we have not seen the decisive action from 
the president that this situation calls for he said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater in decrying the use of 
violence by noriegas forces restated tuesday that it has been 
us policy not to intervene militarily but he also said it has 
always been a principle that we will protect american citizens as 
best we can

soviet doctors participating in an 
international teleconference said tuesday they routinely conceal 
the truth from patients diagnosed as having cancer and they 
questioned the american practice of fully informing patients of a 
tumorous condition 
its hardly a good idea to tell a patient directly that he has 
a cancer said dr nikolai napalkov president of the ussr 
oncological society and a leading cancer researcher in the soviet 
union only in rare cases when the patient refuses treatment 
does the doctor have the obligation to tell the patient 
american doctors taking part in the conference strongly 
disagreed 
the sense of trust that exists between a dcotor and patient is 
very important said dr steven a rosenberg chief of surgery at 
the national cancer institute its impossible for me to imagine 
giving quality care without telling the patient the full story 
the exchange came during a twohour conference which used a 
satellite to link researchers at the national institutes of health 
near washington with soviet experts at a studio in moscow 
the conference called the cancer summit included 
prerecorded comments from president and mrs reagan both of whom 
have been treated for cancer and the reading of a statement by 
soviet general secretary mikhail s gorbachev 
mrs reagan who has undergone surgery for breast cancer said 
that cancer is bigger than any one country it is a problem of 
all mankind 
the first lady said that she had always thought cancer would 
strike someone else another family but she said both she and 
her husband developed cancers that were surgically removed 
we have been fortunate recipients of advanced medical 
science she said 
reagan who has been treated for colon cancer struck the same 
theme in his brief remarks 
the president told doctors of the two nations we are 
depending on all of you in your combined wisdom to win the battle 
over this disease and in doing so to improve the length and 
quality of human life for all mankind 
gorbachev in a statement read during the telecast said cancer 
is an enemy that is striking humans in countries everywhere 
though there has been progress gorbachev said the enemy is 
far from routed he is not retreating and is threatening everybody 
and the fight calls for vigorous and concerted action 
much of the twohour teleconference featured films and slides 
illustrating cancer research and treatment under way in the two 
countries with rosenberg presenting the only report of new 
scientific findings 
rosenberg said that a new treatment under study uses what he 
calls tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes these are natural 
cancerfighting cells that are extracted from the patients tumor 
and then purified concentrated and reinjected into the patient 
the lymphocytes then attack the tumor 
the technique is in the infancy of development and still far 
from ready for general clinical use said rosenberg but he 
reported that eight out of nine patients who have received the 
treatment have been helped 
napalkov brought up the question of how much to tell cancer 
patients about their condition he introduced an informal filmed 
persononthestreet poll in which most soviet citizens asked said 
they would prefer not to be told if they have been diagnosed as ill 
with cancer 
napalkov said soviet doctors believe it best to keep secret a 
cancer diagnosis in order to preserve the peace of mind of the 
patient he said most people regard a cancer diagnosis as a death 
sentence and it could interfere with internal processes if the 
patient is fully informed 
natalia i perevodchikova head of the chemotherapy department 
at the allunion oncology center of the ussr academy of medical 
sciences agreed with napalkov and said that soviet doctors felt 
secrecy of diagnosis was the best policy for the patient 
unless there is an acute necessity such as a refusal of 
treatment there is no need to tell the patient she said 
asked bluntly why american doctors insist on being open with 
patients both rosenberg and dr vincent t devita jr director of 
the national cancer institute said it was a matter of maintaining 
trust between physician and patient 
the teleconference was to be broadcast to about 1500 us 
hospitals and health care facilities on the hospital satellite 
network the us information agency also arranged to carry the 
conference on its worldnet system to 57 cities in europe africa 
and the middle east in the soviet union an edited version of the 
conference will be broadcast to an estimated 150 million people

a former conrail engineer was sentenced today 
to the maximum term of five years in prison and fined 1000 for 
causing 16 deaths in amtraks worst train accident 
rick l gates 33 of essex pleaded guilty feb 16 to the 
single misdemeanor manslaughter count and admitted in a statement 
of facts to smoking marijuana on the train and failing to make 
several safety checks that might have prevented the accident 
baltimore county circuit court judge joseph p murphy said i 
didnt think he was under the influence of marijuana 
but what he did in terms of failure to follow procedures was 
to show us that he didnt give a damn he just didnt care the 
judge said 
gates and family members in the courtroom wept as prosecutors 
read five victim impact statements from relatives of those killed 
in the crash 
in return for the guilty plea baltimore county states attorney 
sandra oconnor agreed to consolidate the names of all 16 victims 
into one count which reduced the maximum sentence from 80 years 
and 16000 in fines to five years and a 1000 fine 
the plea bargain provoked sharp criticism from families of 
victims and leaders of a new safe travel lobby group safe travel 
america 
i am grossly disappointed that he can cause tens of millions 
of dollars in damage and kill 16 people and still face only five 
years on a misdemeanor charge said dr roger horn whose 
16yearold daughter ceres was killed 
mrs oconnor urged the judge to give gates the maximum penalty 
more than 175 people were injured in the jan 4 1987 crash 
when gates missed a track signal and drove three linked conrail 
locomotives in front of the 660passenger amtrak train traveling 
about 120 mph the impact trapped riders in the wreckage for hours 
in bitter cold weather 
gates was unhurt and his brakeman edward cromwell suffered a 
broken leg 
oconnor said at the time of the plea that the manslaughter 
verdict would send a message that transportation workers cannot 
work under the kind of negligence that mr gates did 
the agreement was announced as jury selection for the gates 
sixweek manslaughter trial was scheduled to begin cromwell who 
had been granted immunity from prosecution was expected to testify 
that he and gates fabricated a story to cover up their drug use on 
the train 
tests performed on blood samples taken from both men after the 
accident showed traces of marijuana and possibly alcohol in their 
systems according to a report by the national transportation 
safety board 
however defense attorneys said no experts could conclude gates 
was impaired from the marijuana lawyers also were expected to cite 
a january ruling by the 9th us circuit court of appeals against 
postcrash drug testing 
mrs oconnor acknowledged that prosecutors had considered the 
court ruling in deciding to accept the plea the ruling has been 
appealed to the supreme court

evangelist jimmy swaggart today was 
barred from the pulpit for at least a year and ordered not to 
appear on his television show for a year in connection with 
allegations he hired a prostitute to pose naked 
the assemblies of god suspended swaggart as a minister for two 
years effective immediately said a church spokeswoman that means 
he cannot preach until he has undergone at least a year of 
rehabilitation and may be required to limit his preaching longer 
she said 
swaggart was ordered to undergo rehabilitation for two years 
the pentecostal churchs general presbytery had the final say on 
the fiery preachers punishment its decision was more severe than 
the threemonth suspension recommended by the louisiana branch of 
the church 
gus weill a spokesman for jimmy swaggart worldwide ministries 
in baton rouge la declined immediate comment 
people approved by the church would supervise swaggarts 
rehabilitation the rev g raymond carlson general superintendent 
of the church said at a news conference he provided no other 
details about the sanctions 
the rehabilitation period would begin when swaggart agreed to 
the terms in writing he has 30 days to respond 
carlson said he had notified swaggart of the decision 
he thanked me carlson said he expressed thanks and i 
had prayer with him over the telephone 
a member of the general presbytery h maurice lednicky said 
most of the discussion in its twoday meeting was over the power of 
the 13member executive presbytery to impose punishment 
the louisiana district had imposed a threemonth suspension from 
the pulpit for swaggart and had refused to reconsider that on 
request of the executive presbytery which sought a stiffer 
penalty the executive board noted that every other assemblies of 
god minister who has confessed to moral failure has been barred 
from the pulpit for at least a year officials said 
at the meeting it was agreed that the executive presbytery had 
constitutional authority in the case and the punishment given 
swaggart was the same that the executive presbytery had originally 
recommended said lednicky president of the assemblies of god 
central bible college in springfield 
the 206 presbyters present from the 232member body reconvened 
at 9 am after working late monday and ended their meeting two 
hours later 
this is not a meeting to determine the guilt or innocence of 
jimmy swaggart he has already confessed church spokeswoman 
juleen turnage said earlier they are here to make a decision on 
what will be done with his credentials 
the assemblies of god the nations largest pentecostal 
denomination is headquartered in springfield 
swaggart tearfully stepped down from his baton rouge la 
pulpit feb 21 admitting unspecified sins published reports have

chancellor franz vranitzky of austria postpone a visit to prague 
and there were reports tuesday that a government shakeup was 
planned 
there have been rumors that premier lubomir strougal a leading 
advocate of reform in czechoslovakia is on his way out 
vranitzky told austrian journalists monday that the czechoslovak 
leadership had asked him to postpone a visit set for april 1720 
the austrian press agency reported the reason given for the 
postponement was a planned government shuffle in prague 
the czechoslovak government spokesman told journalists in prague 
that a bill would be presented at a national assembly meeting april 
19 for the abolition of some ministries by merging them with others 
however the austria press agency quoted sources close to 
vranitzky as saying that austrias charge daffaires in prague was 
called to the czechoslovak premiers office monday 
the news agency said an official in strougals office asked that 
the visit be postponed because the country was in a delicate 
situation in view of pending government changes 
it quoted the sources as saying the czechoslovak leadership did 
not want vrantizky to have to meet with negotiating partners when 
we dont know how long they will remain in the government 
there have been increasing rumours that strougal was on his way 
out since gustav husak stepped down as communist party chief in 
december and was replaced by milos jakes husak retained the

states seeking to cope with rising prison 
costs may not seize social security benefits received by inmates 
the supreme court ruled tuesday 
the court unanimously struck down an arkansas law that permitted 
authorities to use an inmates social security benefits for state 
purposes 
similar laws have been enacted in michigan ohio oklahoma and 
tennessee the justices had been told 
the arkansas law allowed seizure of veterans administration 
benefits as well although the courts decision did not discuss va 
benefits its rationale appeared to bar seizure of those federal 
payments as well 
the justices in an unsigned opinion said federal law 
unambiguously rules out any attempt to attach social security 
benefits 
noting that the arkansas law allows such attachment the court 
said this amounts to a conflict that the state cannot win 
federal laws creating the social security and veterans 
administration programs bar any legal action aimed at diverting 
benefits from the designated recipients 
the court rejected arguments by arkansas officials that the 
federal laws do not apply to seizures of prison inmates benefits 
because the inmates are being provided with care and 
maintenance 
the impact of tuesdays ruling has been blunted somewhat by laws 
passed by congress in 1980 and 1983 withholding or limiting 
benefits otherwise due imprisoned felons 
the decision also does not affect state laws that require prison 
inmates to reimburse the state from sources other than federal 
benefits for some of the costs of their incarceration 
for example the justices were told that six states require jail 
inmates serving terms for misdemeanors to make such reimbursements 
those states are alabama illinois kentucky missouri nebraska 
and north carolina 
the justices were told that eight states require reimbursement 
by inmates for certain kinds of state claims ranging from medical 
expenses to expenses incurred by quelling riots those states are 
arizona florida maine maryland mississippi nevada north 
dakota and rhode island 
the arkansas legislature in 1981 passed the states inmate care 
and custody reimbursement act under it state authorities may seek 
court approval to seize an inmates estate income from any source 
former inmate george bennett challenged the law he was serving 
11 years of a 21year sentence at a pine bluff prison for 
seconddegree murder when he turned 62 
bennett started receiving 275 a month in social security 
retirement benefits but those payments were confiscated by state 
officials he was released from prison in late 1984 but is seeking 
to recover 3600 in seized benefits 
the arkansas supreme court ruled against him but tuesdays 
ruling reversed the state courts decision 
reagan administration lawyers had opposed the arkansas law 
telling the justices that such legislation would seem to validate 
the attachment of social security and va benefits paid to persons 
confined in state mental hospitals or in other institutions where 
they are provided care by the state

the father of a young woman identified as 
the agent who lured israeli nuclear dissident mordechai vanunu to 
his capture says he was startled to hear of his daughters alleged 
espionage activities 
of course i was shocked said stanley hanin could you 
picture your daughter involved in anything like this 
hanin owner of the allied discount tires chain spoke to 
reporters monday after viewing a television program sunday that 
described cheryl hanin bentovs alleged role in the capture of 
vanunu who disclosed details of israels nuclear weapons program 
to a british newspaper in 1986 
this is the first ive heard of anything like this said 
hanin i find this totally unbelievable 
days after the sunday times published vanunus revelations he 
disappeared from a london hotel where he had been living under an 
assumed name and later surfaced in an israeli jail vanunu was 
tried in secret in israel and sentenced sunday to 18 years in 
prison for treason 
vanunus brother meir who lives in london has claimed that 
israeli secret service agents used a woman named cindy to lure 
his brother to rome with the promise of sex he says agents 
captured and drugged his brother there and spirited him to israel 
for trial 
the cbs program 60 minutes sunday identified cindy as 
mrs bentov an agent of the israeli secret service mossad and wife 
of ofer bentov a major in israeli military intelligence 
hanin said his daughter moved to israel 10 years ago at age 17 
after studying there in a student exchange program he said they 
are not close and he has not heard from her for some time and 
that he doesnt know where she lives 
i would be concerned for her safety if i thought there was a 
shred of truth to this hanin said but i dont think theres a 
speck of truth to it 
lowell boggs assistant principal at edgewater high school 
where cheryl hanin went to school said she was a good student who 
spent the final semester of her senior year studying in israel for 
about five months 
boggs said that over the past 1 years the school has been 
visited by two private detectives who asked to see her yearbook 
picture a reporter from london and another from miami asking about 
her and last spring a man with credentials showing him to be 
from the cia 
edgewater principal charles rohrer said the fbi also came by the 
school to go through her records three or four times

a 21yearold woman near delivery with 
her first child ended up jailed and in handcuffs instead of in a 
hospital all over a traffic violation 
kimberly taylor was arrested at her home at 520 am saturday 
because she had failed to appear in court march 18 on the traffic 
charge 
i couldnt believe it mrs taylor said monday after a 
visit to her doctor who said the baby could arrive any time it 
was so stupid youd think theyd have better things to do than 
bother me on a saturday morning 
mrs taylor said her doctor told her the stress from the 
incident with the police may be prolonging her labor she said the 
sac of water surrounding the baby broke saturday about an hour 
before she was arrested 
police said officer brad maerz was near the end of his shift 
saturday when he knocked on the taylors door told her to get 
dressed and took her to the police station 
mrs taylor said she was in a holding cell when she overheard 
maerz tell another officer he made the arrest because i was 
bored 
police chief henry smith said the taylors had filed a complaint 
there will be an internal investigation to look at the 
circumstances and determine whether good judgment was used in the 
matter smith said well look at any possible violation of 
procedure 
smith said mrs taylor was arrested on a bench warrant from 
jefferson county court for failure to appear at a hearing she was 
cited jan 21 for driving a car with expired license plates and not 
having a valid drivers license 
mrs taylor said that when she was taken from the police 
department to the county jail they didnt want anything to do 
with a woman whose contractions were coming about 15 minutes 
apart 
as she was being released from the county jail she said she was 
taken from her cell to the release area in handcuffs 
mrs taylors husband paul said his wife just didnt have her 
drivers license with her that day 
as for the expired plates we had just bought that car and we 
were waiting for the title to get new plates he said we have 
that all taken care of now but we forgot about the court date 
because weve been dealing with complications with the pregnancy 
for the last month weve been worried about that and we spaced 
out the court date but we think the whole thing has been handled 
unfairly and unprofessionally

the case of a 4yearold boy adopted in two 
states by sets of warring relatives after his father killed his 
mother came nearer resolution tuesday when the indiana court of 
appeals upheld the voiding of the adoption here 
the court unanimously affirmed an april 1987 grant county 
circuit court decision invalidating the adoption of phillip taylor 
by his paternal grandparents everett l and jean k taylor of 
marion 
the boy has since been adopted by celeste benigno white sister 
of the boys mother and her husband jefferson white of the new 
york city borough of staten island 
a legal fight over the child followed the nov 11 1984 murder 
of his mother teresa benigno taylor in new jersey her husband 
dr kenneth taylor was convicted in 1985 of firstdegree murder 
and sentenced to life imprisonment 
after the murder a new jersey court granted joint custody of 
the child to the whites and the taylors with the taylors to have 
custody in july and august and during the week after christmas each 
year the whites were to keep the child the rest of the year 
in late 1985 the whites filed a custody petition in new york 
and in january 1986 the taylors filed an adoption petition in 
grant county the taylors had earlier filed an adoption petition 
that wasnt acted on in new jersey 
as part of their indiana petition the taylors filed kenneth 
taylors consent to the adoption however according to court 
records the whites werent notified of the proceeding and the 
petition didnt mention that the boys father had been convicted of 
murder or that a new jersey court had acted on the childs custody 
during a visit to indiana in august 1986 phillip was formally 
adopted by the taylors in a telephone call to mrs white mrs 
taylor said that the taylors had adopted phillip and that the 
whites would never see him again court records said 
the whites challenged the adoption by arguing that their consent 
and that of the new jersey court was required 
the taylors contended that because they had the consent of their 
son phillips only living parent they needed no one elses 
consent 
the lower court held and the appeals panel confirmed tuesday 
that consent of all parties involved including the other court 
and custodial parents must be obtained before indiana law permits 
an adoption 
a decree of adoption may be entered only if the required 
consents were obtained judge william garrard wrote for the 
court as the taylors failed to obtain all the required consents 
the judgment of the adoption was voidable 
the taylors have not said whether they will appeal tuesdays 
ruling to the indiana supreme court

west virginia university administrators 
set up a committee tuesday to explore the ethical obligations of 
students who do corporate espionage for companies under the 
auspices of the university 
the announcement made by frank franz vice president for 
academic affairs comes one week after the wall street journal 
reported that graduate students in the business school divulged 
sales and inventory figures gained in a study to competitors of the 
businesses they surveyed 
the article points out that the confidentiality of respondents 
was promised but not observed franz said 
the key problem is that the students were put in a very 
unfortunate position by the sponsors of the project and i think 
inappropriate things were asked of them 
franz said the sevenmember committee will consider whether 
students should be required to disclose routinely the sponsor of a 
study its purpose and who will receive the information obtained 
he said the committee also will suggest ways to avoid conflicts 
of interest in internships research projects and other 
opportunities that arise through consulting performed by faculty 
members for private companies 
the journal reported that two groups of students who conducted 
competitive analyses for two caterpillar heavyequipment dealers 
were asked by the dealers to identify the competitors they 
interviewed 
several students said they did one of those involved likened 
the work to spying 
representatives of two of the dealerships interviewed for the 
1987 study said they would not have given out the information if 
they had known the students were working for other dealers 
i feel the way they went about it was very underhanded gary 
clark executive vice president of clark co one of the companies 
in the study told the daily anthenaeum the student newspaper 
now i will probably be on my guard whenever i talk to 
students but i dont blame the students i blame the professor 
terry wilson professor of the marketing 321 class told the 
journal that the students should not have divulged confidential 
information to their clients 
franz said there is no evidence that wilson who is a consultant 
for caterpillar encouraged the students to give the information to 
the dealerships 
wilson who is on a yearlong sabbatical from the university did 
not return telephone messages left with his office

the plo lifted its ban on a meeting between 
arabs from the occupied territories and us secretary of state 
george p shultz a palestinian said tuesday 
us officials said they hoped such a session expected to take 
place next week in jerusalem would help breathe life into a us 
peace proposal for the region 
the shift in policy came after shultz met three days ago with 
two palestinianamericans linked to the palestine liberation 
organization 
that meeting was great it was a big step forward and paved 
the way for us to meet with shultz next week said said kenaan a 
prominent nablus businessman 
the plo issued two declarations this week one via a plo 
representative in cairo and the other from its headquarters in 
tunis approving palestinian attendance at a meeting with shultz 
next week kenaan said 
but kenaan said arabs from east jerusalem and the occupied 
territories would not attend the jerusalem meeting unless the plo 
approval was well publicized and plo chief yasser arafat came out 
publicly behind it 
otherwise we fear for our lives he told the associated 
press in a telephone interview 
shultz is to arrive in jerusalem on sunday and also will visit 
jordan syria saudi arabia and egypt 
we want a chance to discuss our grievances and to tell him 
the plo must be a party to peace talks on equal footing with all 
other parties kenaan said 
when shultz visited the region in february palestinians from 
the territories heeded a call from the plo and refused to meet him 
the refusal was viewed by american officials as a setback for us 
peace proposals 
the climate has changed because of shultzs meeting saturday 
with edward said a columbia university professor and ibrahim abu 
lughud of northwestern university 
both men are members of the palestine national council the 
plos selfdescribed legislative body 
israeli officials including prime minister yitzhak shamir 
denounced the talks as a violation of a us commitment not to meet 
with the plo 
but other officials close to us efforts to start negotiations 
in the region said the meeting was intended to pave the way for 
further involvement of the palestinians in the peace process 
shultz has always viewed palestinian participation as very 
important one us official said privately it was hoped that 
this move would improve chances for that involvement and thus for 
the success of the us peace plan 
in tripoli libya hardline palestinian leader george habash 
urged palestinians to boycott the shultz peace mission 
i call upon the revolutionary leadership and plo leadership to 
boycott the shultz visit as they did the first time said habash 
leader of the marxist syrianbacked popular front for the 
liberation of palestine which is affiliated with the plo 
if the american administration is sincere in finding a just 
solution for the middle east it must recognize the plo as the sole 
legitimate representative of palestinian people it must 
recognize legitimate rights of palestinian people that is 
selfdetermination and an independent palestinian state and reject 
the nation that were a second class people he told a news 
conference

the proportion of women enrolled in schools 
for health professions has skyrocketed in recent years according 
to a federal statistical analysis issued tuesday 
the most striking increase was in dental schools where women 
made up only 1 percent of enrollment in the 197172 school term by 
the 198586 term the figure was 25 percent 
enrollment of women in medical schools jumped from 11 percent to 
33 percent over the same period and in pharmacy schools from 24 
percent to 56 percent 
those are among figures contained in the 207page health 
united states 1987 a report issued annually by the department of 
health and human services 
most of the figures were released previously as they were being 
compiled by one or more of the dozens of agencies within hhs and 
tend to lag a year or two behind the volumes publication 
the national center for health statistics an arm of the centers 
for disease control organizes the material into an annual report 
as required by law to provide a central storehouse of statistical 
data 
the 1987 volume documents that life expectancy at birth has 
increased dramatically since 1900 for all americans regardless of 
race or sex 
for example a black female born in 1900 could expect to live 
only 335 years compared with 627 years for one born in 1950 and 
735 years for one born in 1985 
although there have been life expectacy gains across the board 
the smallest increase 25 years was among white males a white 
male born in 1900 could expect to live 466 years compared with 
719 years for one born in 1985 
some other highlights 
infant mortality declined only 2 percent between 1984 and 1985 
the smallest drop since 1965 the black infant mortality rate 182 
per 1000 live births is almost twice as high as for white 
infants 93 per 1000 
births to unmarried mothers doubled between 1970 and 1985 from 
11 percent to 22 percent 
between 1970 and 1985 mortality from cancer the second 
leading cause of death increased slightly overall however lung 
cancer deaths among women more than doubled heart disease remains

republican sen bob dole quit the presidential race today three 
weeks after being buried in george bushs super tuesday landslide 
calling himself bloodied but unbowed as the poet says on the 
democratic side michael dukakis sought a connecticut primary 
victory to slow jesse jackson 
dole offered his congratulations to bush who beat him in a 
solid majority of primaries and said keeping the white house 
republican thats the bottom line 
flanked by his wife former transportation secretary elizabeth 
dole and his daughter robin dole said i know and my family 
knows that im a fighter and i dont like to lose 
ive been beaten before and no doubt will again but i have 
never been defeated and never will be the kansas senator said 
as supporters and fellow senators applauded 
white house chief of staff howard h baker jr a former 
presidential hopeful himself as well as a former senate colleague 
of doles said hed talked to dole earlier and i told him ive 
been there i know how it feels i told him therell be life after 
this political life that he has a major role to play 
among the democrats rep richard gephardt filed for reelection 
to his house seat one day after dropping his own presidential bid 
he told reporters in jefferson city mo i am very happy to be 
here 
after updating based on final michigan results and a 
redistribution of some of gephardts delegates dukakis held a slim 
sevendelegate lead over jackson the massachusetts governor hoped 
to add to his lead today with a win in neighboring connecticut 
in new york meanwhile sen albert gore jr took a few apparent 
swipes at jackson an ordained minister known for his ringing 
speeches 
in remarks to the association for a better new york gore was 
applauded when he said that in the campaign were not choosing a 
preacher were choosing a president 
the oval office is a whole lot more than a pulpit gore said 
referring to jacksons calling himself a tree shaker not a 
jelly maker gore asserted that in the oval office some jelly 
must be made only a president who knows how big government works 
can turn soaring rhetoric and lofty goals into programs and 
policies 
among the republicans even with dole nominally still in the 
race bush was overwhelmingly favored today in his almosthome 
state of connecticut but he said he didnt want to project an 
arrogance 
dukakis was also expected to do well in the primary with 52 
delegates at stake but jackson has been drawing big enthusiastic 
crowds in the state 
theres nothing more powerful in the world than the people 
whose hope has been raised he said as he stumped in connecticut 
on monday 
jacksons stunning weekend win in michigans caucuses put 
dukakis under mounting pressure connecticuts democratic state 
chairman john f droney said that in light of jacsons gains 
dukakis had to poll better than 50 percent in the primary to 
reassert himself 
dukakis disputed whether he had to land such a knockout punch 
just to stay in the ring look a victory is a victory he 
said 
jackson meanwhile was drawing admiring comment from both sides 
of the political aisle on monday bush campaigning in wisconsin 
which holds its primary a week from today went out of his way to 
praise him 
the mans racking up delegates and thats how you get 
elected the vice president said what he has done is very 
admirable 
bushs comments came at a news conference in milwaukee where he 
picked up the endorsement of rep jack kemp a former rival kemp 
who quit the presidential race earlier this month said he would 
actively campaign for the vice president 
gephardt also praised jackson as he was closing the book on his 
own democratic candidacy he refrained from making any formal 
endorsement but said i believe jesse jackson can be nominated 
and i think he can be elected 
gephardt whose campaign slid downhill after an initial win in 
iowas democratic caucuses said he was hampered by a lack of 
funds but he added i have no alibis we lost no question about 
that 
gephardts loss was his rivals gain most of his 167 delegates 
went into the uncommitted column but missouri state party rules 
mandate that the atlarge and public official delegates are 
redivided among the active candidates when a contender drops out 
according to the latest ap count dukakis had 61155 jackson 
60455 tennessee sen gore 3648 illinois sen paul simon 1695 
and uncommitted 5086 
jackson who leads in the popular vote totals said he expects 
to emerge as the democratic nominee if he wins the most 
preconvention delegates 
appearing on abcs nightline on monday night he said if he 
were the leader going into the convention he did not expect that 
party leaders would use the votes of super delegates elected 
officials and party professionals to keep him from getting the 
nomination 
if they used their power in that way it would be unwise it 
would not be right he said 
on the republican side bush was far far ahead of either dole 
or former television evangelist pat robertson with 778 delegates 
to doles 178 and robertsons 17 
even so bush said he didnt want to get overconfident 
one of the best things that happened to me was getting my 
brains kicked out in iowa he said everybody had me dead and 
buried we were resurrected so people say now things are going 
pretty well for you and they are

the government is considering charging space 
shuttle customers up to 245 million a flight for carrying their 
cargo into space a congressional panel was told tuesday 
up to now the national aeronautics and space administration has 
charged 87 million maximum for use of the cargo bay billed to 
users according to how much space they used 
dale myers nasas deputy administrator confirmed that the 245 
million figure was discussed last week by a panel connected to the 
senior interagency group for space a toplevel advisory committee 
for the president 
that is not the final decision myers told sen william 
proxmire dwis at a senate appropriations subcommittee hearing 
on nasas fiscal 1989 budget request he did not dispute proxmires 
contention that nasa lost an 81 vote for the 245 million figure 
in the interagency group 
the total cost of a shuttle flight has varied according to the 
frequency of flights within a given fiscal year a 1985 estimate 
a year before the challenger disaster priced each flight at 150 
million at a rate of 14 launches a year 
nasa has never pressed for full recovery of its costs in the 
first flights of the shuttle beginning in 1981 the cost for 
launching a satellite from the cargo bay was about 10 million 
the agency then instituted a pricing policy of 71 million for a 
full cargo bay meaning that a satellite owner might pay 23 
millionplus if his cargo was launched along with two other 
satellites the charge per cargo bay rose to 87 million per flight 
in october 1985 
myers explained during the hearing and afterward that the 245 
million was sort of an upper limit of all the costs 
its an estimate that includes everything including the 
kitchen sink all the overhead manpower required for checkout all 
the hardware all the fuels all the contingencies that might occur 
due to delays in flights he said 
but asked if that were the amount the space agency would seek to 
recover from cargo bay users myers said no it is not in our 
view a number that would make any sense at all i cant really talk 
too much about it because this is internal planning 
a staff member of the appropriations subcommittee called the 
245 million a nonsubsidized realworld total number for a 
flight on the shuttle if you want to buy it 
the senior interagency group for space includes representatives 
of nasa the cia and the commerce transportation defense and 
state departments

the soviet union stops or delays mail to put 
pressure on dissidents former moscow activist vladimir slepak told 
a congressional subcommittee tuesday 
the goal of the soviet authorities is to isolate people from 
any contact with the outside world this is an effort to break our 
spirit and determination slepak said 
telephones mail and telegrams are all cut off or interfered 
with slepak told the house post office and civil service 
subcommittee on postal operations the subcommittee is 
investigating complaints of returned and undelivered mail sent to 
the soviet union 
the problem is not the bad work of the soviet post office it 
is because of the order of the kgb or other authorities said 
slepak 
he cited his five years in exile in siberia when he regularly 
received mail from other countries upon his return to moscow in 
1982 mail was cut off he said 
slepak was allowed to leave the soviet union last year following 
a pair of hunger strikes by himself in moscow and his son in 
washington 
rep benjamin a gilman rny noted that the subcommittee 
first started looking into the problem in 1977 
with better international relations there may be hope for 
improvement gilman said but we must not be lulled into 
believing that the problem has been or is close to being resolved 
assistant postmaster general william t johnstone said in 
prepared testimony that the rate of returned parcels has declined 
in the past year yet he added while fewer parcels apparently 
are being returned the practice remains a troublesome one 
the soviet union has a long and complex list of unacceptable 
goods johnstone said 
another problem exists with registered mail which many people 
use because the item must be signed for he added 
unlike the united states where the person receiving the mail 
must sign soviet policy is for a postal official to sign the 
receipt johnstone said 
we plan to exert every effort to try to persuade the soviet 
union to change its policy he said 
one new problem will be arising shortly johnstone added 
starting may 1 the soviet union will require customs 
declarations on parcels to be written in either french or russian 
it is common practice to require declarations in either french 
or the language of the receiving country he said but in the past 
the soviets have made exceptions to allow english 
they announced the change to only french or russian early in 
1987 but postponed implementation twice to accommodate the united 
states johnstone said

surrounded by house and senate colleagues i make no apology for 
that its simply the way i am 
but he said he also was an optimist ive been beaten before 
and no doubt will again but ive never been defeated and never 
will be 
dole who has been without a primary win for more than a month 
tipped his hat to bush 
the one thing you learn how to do pretty well in our business 
is to count you come to trust your instincts to tell you its 
over in my heart i know that time is now i congratulate george 
bush and wish him well in november the kansas senator said 
doles remarks showed none of the bitterness that has 
characterized his attitude toward bush in the past when dole took 
the microphone he cracked were not going to say anything mean 
about anybody 
dole whose last weeks as a candidate were marked by bruising 
defeats at the hands of bush said he looked forward to his return 
to the senate and his duties as minority leader 
i return to the senate as the republican leader eager to 
engage the issues that confront america doing all i can for our 
nominee george bush he said 
dole recalled his official entry to the race on nov 9 
nearly five months ago i went home to russell kan to 
declare my candidacy for the highest office the american people can 
bestow it was only natural i should begin my campaign on main 
street among those from whom i have always drawn my strength and 
my identity today here i am bloodied and unbowed as the poet 
said he said 
dole sent one message to bush the inevitable gop nominee 
my campaign has been an appeal for all republicans to 
recognize and celebrate the diversity of america no party can 
govern that is not truly representative of this nation of nations 
the senate minority leader made a fast start out of the gate 
overwhelming the vice president in the iowa caucuses feb 8 but he 
stumbled a week later in new hampshires primary dole rebounded 
with a pair of wins in south dakota and minnesota on feb 23 but 
bush stunned the republican field with a 16state primary sweep on 
super tuesday 
dole never recovered though he made an effort to revive his 
campaign in illinois he lost heavily there and appeared to be 
merely going through the motions after that 
dole campaigned last week in wisconsin where he hoped to make a 
comeback but public opinion polls indicated a 2to1 bush lead by 
weeks end dole told a washington audience that he thought bushs 
nomination was a foregone conclusion 
i can read the numbers and i probably know whats happening 
he said 
we need to keep a republican in the white house thats where 
im coming from he said and if it cant be me it will be 
george bush 
on monday he delivered a speech that stopped short of a 
withdrawal but looked and sounded like a last hurrah joined by his 
wife elizabeth and daughter robin he said he wanted to thank 
his campaign workers and outline his vision for the future of the 
gop 
doles second campaign for the republican presidential 
nomination the first in 1980 also ended in failure was flawed 
all along by internal disarray the senate leader was not inclined 
to delegate authority he finally brought on former labor secretary 
bill brock last november to run the campaign but it may have been 
too late 
bushs welloiled campaign machinery had been in place for 
years and dole struggled uphill against a rival who ran as a 
frontrunner and made few mistakes 
dole tried repeatedly to stir voters into resentment against 
bush and his upperclass background but doles argument that he 
was one of us apparently won over only iowans dole also lashed 
out often at bush for his stillmurky role in the irancontra 
armsforhostages affair but republican primary voters didnt buy 
it 
bush also had a trump card that he played often ronald reagan 
bush ran successfully as the loyal vice president to one of the 
most popular presidents in modern history 
im sort of running against the ghost of ronald reagan dole 
said recently

surrogate mother mary beth 
whiteheadgould testified tuesday that both sides in the baby m 
case should put aside their bitterness and let the child grow up 
knowing her birth mother 
life is too short said mrs whiteheadgould in the second 
day of a visitation hearing i dont know what life is going to 
bring but theres a chance that she will never know me that id 
never know her 
mrs whiteheadgould 31 visibly pregnant in a blue and white 
maternity dress spoke calmly and quietly in 2 hours of testimony 
her voice sometimes wavered but she did did not cry 
the childs father william stern and his wife elizabeth sat 
grimfaced through much of the testimony mrs stern smiled 
occasionally however when mrs whiteheadgould spoke of the 
mannerisms of the 2yearold girl legally known as melissa stern 
the sterns who have custody of melissa at their home in 
tenafly in their testimony called mrs whiteheadgould a liar who 
could undermine their relationship with the child and possibly 
exploit the girl in the media 
mrs whiteheadgould of east brunswick is seeking more liberal 
visitation with melissa she wants to see the child two days a week 
for a total of 16 hours at her home immediately with the schedule 
eventually expanded to include overnight stays half the summer and 
some holidays 
the sterns are seeking to have visitation cut off for several 
years perhaps until the child is 9 or 10 
the hearing before superior court judge birger m sween was 
ordered by the new jersey supreme court which on feb 13 restored 
mrs whieheadgoulds parental rights but left intact a ruling that 
gave custody to the sterns 
stern a biochemist and mrs stern a pediatrician have said 
they turned to surrogacy because mrs stern feared that her age and 
her mild form of multiple sclerosis would make pregnancy dangerous 
mrs stern is now 42 
mrs whiteheadgould agreed to bear them a child for 10000 by 
being artificially inseminated with sterns sperm but when the 
baby was born she changed her mind sparking the dispute 
mrs whiteheadgould who has remarried and is pregnant with her 
current husbands child asked for reconciliation with the sterns 
in the emotional tugofwar over the child 
im willing to meet them more than half way she said 
much of mrs whiteheadgoulds testimony answered charges made 
by the sterns 
she said she felt no anger toward the sterns and did not blame 
them as stern said monday for the breakup of her 14year marriage 
to richard whitehead 
i let go of custody a long time ago she said i want to 
be a mother i want to share in raising her in any way i can but i 
dont want to undermine the sterns in any way 
she said that her current visitation schedule of two hours a 
week under supervision wasnt meaningful mrs whiteheadgould 
said the child could benefit by contact with her new husband new 
york city tax accountant dean gould and her two children from her 
previous marriage ryan 13 and tuesday 12

the justice minister has resigned 
after a former policeman said the minister headed a secret 
antinarcotics police that sold confiscated drugs and weapons 
minister jose manzo gonzalezs resignation was effective monday 
he had been justice minister since 1984 
he was replaced tuesday by pedro torres agudo former head of 
the technical judicial police venezuelas principal investigative 
police corps 
the newspaper el universal reported tuesday that gonzalez 
resigned to aid a police investigation and to take legal action 
against people who allegedly injured his prestige 
manzos resignation came on the same day as the resignation of 
his counterpart in colombia alfredo gutierrez marquez gutierrez 
stepped down after reports that an airstrip at his brothers ranch 
was used by drug runners linked to colombia medellin cartel 
the cartel smuggles most of the cocaine reaching the united 
states the us drug enforcement administration says 
in a videotape played two weeks ago before the investigations 
committee of the venezuelan congress former police roberto eduardo 
dipucci ponti said manzo set up a secret police unit to infiltrate 
narcotics rings in venezuela 
dipucci ponti said the unit captured drugs and weapons from 
narcotics traffickers and then resold them 
the former officer said he was a member of the secret force and 
that he made the videotape because he feared for his life dipucci 
reportedly is in hiding in venezuela 
the president of the investigations committee paciano padron 
called for manzos removal after initial investigations indicated 
the existence of the secret unit and irregularities in its 
activities 
the committee began its investigations in february after a 
leftist politician claimed venezuelas political parties were 
financing their presidential campaigns with drug money 
padron also maintained the police unit itself was illegal since 
it depended directly on manzo rather than one of the official 
venezuelan security forces 
manzo has said that the secret force existed between 1982 and 
1986 but claimed it was a military agency 
defense minister eliodoro guerrero gomez has denied the unit 
ever operated within the military

nigerias estimated population of 100 
million will double in the next two decades unless nigerian women 
have fewer children the health minister said tuesday 
the news agency of nigeria quoted health minister ransomekuti 
as saying the military governments new population policy was aimed 
at preserving the health of the mothers and their children 
rather than simply reducing population growth 
the government has adopted a policy calling on women to limit 
themselves to four children each womens groups and christian 
churches say the policy is unfair because it would allow polygamous 
men to have many children and favors the moslem religion 
ransomekuti in detailing the policy said efforts would be 
made to counsel men on their responsibilities to their spouses and 
children 
he said the government would make family planning services 
available nationwide but would not try to force couples to limit 
births 
couples will be encouraged to have the number of children they 
can adequately care for he said 
ransomekuti said the government hopes to persuade women to 
marry after age 18 and to space births at least two years apart 
he said the policy seeks to reduce annual population growth from 
33 percent to 25 percent in 1995 and 2 percent by 2000 
nigeria is africas most populous country

harold thomas was back in his shack tuesday 
alongside the chicago river after a failed journey to new mexico in 
search of a new life but he said he was trying to find work and a 
decent home 
ive been trying to get me a decent place to stay and i got an 
interview about a regular job tomorrow he said i feel like 
ive got to make something out of myself some way or other because 
so many people were concerned 
and besides i owe it to myself said thomas who hopes to 
find a construction job with a former employer 
since his return from portales nm a week ago thomas has 
divided his time between a girlfriends apartment and the 
woodandtarpaper shack he and friend tommy ray built late last 
year on a vacant bottlestrewn lot in the shadow of the citys 
glittering downtown 
i go by and help clean it up and i stay there sometimes he 
said of the makeshift shelter by the chicago river tommy and 
them are sort of my people like family 
and thats the place where it all happened 
thomas sojourn to the southwest began when a new mexico couple 
roy and ethel gilman read an associated press story describing his 
life in the open shack during subzero weather 
they offered him a job and a place to stay 
thomas arrived in portales on jan 17 and spent two months with 
the gilmans receiving room and board in exchange for work at the 
couples wrecking yard 
but thomas said he was paid no wages until reporters raised the 
issue and the gilmans put 300 in a bank account for him 
thomas withdrew the money and bought a bus ticket home 
they were hardworking good people but the money situation 
disappointed me said thomas 
a man needs a regular wage he needs to be able to buy himself 
a cup of coffee or a sandwich and i think the gilmans got tired of 
all the attention that came with me he said 
one thing was simplified by his brief fling with celebrity 
reinstatement of the 154 a month in public assistance and food 
stamps he had been receiving before he went to new mexico 
when he attempted monday to pick up his march check thomas was 
told he would have to furnish proof he had worked the two previous 
months and that his job had ended said social worker clara 
collins with the nonprofit travelers and immigrants aid 
he went back to the shack and brought them his newspaper 
clippings ms collins said at first they said there were 
plenty of harold thomases but i guess they finally gave in 
so tuesday 154 richer and buoyed by the prospect of a job 
interview thomas picked up some italian beef sandwiches and headed 
for the hovel he still calls home sometimes 
there ray 37 and 62yearold arthur haymond another of the 
five or six men who share the rotting oftenleaky shack waited 
eagerly for his arrival 
its funny said ray after people first read about us 
they came by with a can of coffee or a loaf of bread to help out 
or talk about where we might find work 
but since then hasnt been much but the gang kids throwing 
stones and busting us up 
i guess said ray rubbing his chin and pulling up closer to 
the fire burning in an oil drum people just got short memories

president reagan on tuesday hedged his 
assertion that oliver l north is a hero with the president 
confining his contining praise to the marines combat record 
reagan also said he believes north a former white house 
national security aide charged with conspiracy in the irancontra 
arms and money affair hasnt gotten the benefit of a fair trial 
before being presumed guilty by many 
reagan saying he wanted to augment comments he made last 
week after norths criminal indictment said i think i was too 
short in my remark 
the president was referring to his defense of north as a hero 
and his prediction that the marine lieutenant colonel will be found 
innocent of irancontra charges along with rear adm john m 
poindexter the former national security adviser to the president 
and norths superior 
reagan did not reiterate that prediction but he adjusted his 
definition of norths heroism 
i should have augmented that and said why and that is look 
at the record and at the honors and the medals that have been 
awarded to him for bravery in combat reagan said in a white 
house interview with regional reporters 
i have to say those were heroic actions and he is a valid 
hero the president said 
north who intends to retire from the marine corps in may 
received a silver star and two purple hearts in the vietnam war 
reagan said the allegations about north and poindexter raise a 
sore point with me about a lot of things that have been going on 
with regard to people in our administration 
someplace along the line many of us have forgotten that you 
are innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt the 
president said 
what has a happened i think in the case of north and 
poindexter is its just everyone is accepting guilt on the basis 
of accusation reagan said i say theyve got a right to be 
presumed innocent until someone proves them guilty of the charges 
north and poindexter were named march 16 in a federal indictment 
accusing them of defrauding the government in the sale of us 
weapons to iran and the diversion of profits to the nicaraguan 
contras at a time when us aid to the rebels was banned 
in addition to north and poindexter several other past or 
present members of the administration including some of reagans 
closest confidants have been accused of improper behavior 
former aide michael deaver was convicted of perjury regarding 
his lobbying activities and reagans onetime political director 
lyn nofziger was found guilty of illegal lobbying 
attorney general edwin meese iii has been the subject of 
independent counsel investigations meese has continually denied 
wrongdoing 
north said after his indictment that he might attempt to 
subpoena the highest ranking government officials to testify in 
his defense 
reagan declined to say if he would testify on norths behalf 
i dont know what his situation will be with regard to giving 
testimony or not reagan said

the equal employment opportunity commission 
mishandled hundreds of age discrimination complaints partly because 
congress failed to give it enough money eeoc chairman clarence 
thomas said tuesday 
in testimony to the house government operations subcommittee on 
employment and housing thomas said there was no excuse for agency 
offices having let the twoyear statute of limitations expire on 
some 1600 complaints from oct 1 1986 to jan 31 1988 
but he said that in order to prevent such situations from 
recurring the agency needs more money 
i have been through the budget process seven times now and 
each time congress has appropriated less than what was requested 
by president reagan thomas said in his statement 
for example he said the agency sought 1934 million this year 
but received only 1798 million and it has been told its 
prospects for receiving a requested 1946 million in 1989 do not 
look good 
if eeoc is held to a 2 percent increase over the fiscal 1988 
appropriation we will lose 244 positions and the pending inventory 
of charges will grow by 20000 thomas said 
subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif said a recent panel 
investigation of the national labor relations board found that 92 
percent of unfair labor charges are fully investigated within 30 
days 
if the nlrb regional offices can meet a 30day time target 
why does it take eeoc regional offices more than two years to 
perform similar investigations lantos said we should not need 
repeated hearings and legislative action to ensure and to restore 
workers basic civil rights which have long since been established 
in law 
in his statement thomas said the regional offices attributed 
their problems to among other things short staffing complex and 
unprecedented cases poor case tracking heavy workload and charges 
filed six months to 18 months after an alleged violation 
he said the worst offender was the philadelphia regional office 
with 241 charges that expired followed by los angeles with 222 
baltimore with 175 new york with 150 chicago with 137 and 
detroit with 105 san francisco had no instances while atlanta and 
charlotte nc had one apiece 
helen mcdonald representing the american association of retired 
persons said the eeoc must give people realistic advice about 
whether their cases will be pursued and tell them clearly about the 
twoyear deadline 
she also said the eeoc should change its policy of refusing to 
notify people who might benefit from a class action even when the 
agency already has determined an employer has discriminated 
currently it is the responsibility of potential members of the 
class action to find out about the complaint and join it 
the house on tuesday passed a bill extending the statute of 
limitations another 18 months for people whose cases expired 
without eeoc action the senate already has passed a similar 
measure

fed up with dog bites mail carrier jim codner 
made his rounds in the company of two dog catchers from the citys 
animal control department when he delivered mail tuesday at a 
housing project 
unlike monday when three dogs were taken into custody there 
wasnt a canine in sight as codner delivered the mail with his 
companions who were armed with dog snares threefoot and 
fivefoot sticks with rubbercoated wires at the end to catch any 
pooch on the loose 
at least if the dogs come out theyll have a few more 
targets codner said when he resumed deliveries usually its 
just me and the hallway 
mail delivery to 240 households at the orient heights rojects 
was suspended march 12 after codner who has delivered mail there 
for seven years was attacked for the fourth time this year by one 
of the dogs roaming the halls 
for the two weeks codner didnt bring any mail it was left at a 
post office more than half a mile away 
it was really hard for the elderly people who needed their 
mail and couldnt get it said jackie thurston who lives in the 
project 
it feels good to have jimmy and the mail back said connie 
durbano another resident 
the escorted service will last a week if codners customers 
dont get the message by then the postal service has threatened to 
deliver mail to a single drop instead of door to door 
steven odonnell the citys chief dog catcher said he has 
eight inspectors and two trucks one currently broken to cover a 
city of 65000 dogs odonnell complained that the city wont 
invest in better dog control he also has proposed stiffer fines 
for violators 
the city requires dogs to be restrained at all times but while 
the dog owners are fined 50 if their pets are caught defecating on 
the sidewalk they are fined only 25 for dogs picked up roaming 
free 
in other carrier battlefronts of massachusetts mail delivery 
was suspended temporarily in parts of medford a few years ago to 
protect carriers and a carrier bitten in the face by a dog in 
winthrop last weekend may need plastic surgery 
every day somewhere in america a mail carrier is probably 
being bitten said delivery supervisor phil auciello codners boss

president chun doohwans younger 
brother denied tuesday that he stole millions of dollars from a 
semiofficial development agency but prosecutors said they had 
enough evidence to try him 
a close associate of chun kyunghwan 46 tried to kill himself 
while under interrogation and arrest warrants were issued for five 
other people in the growing scandal 
he keeps denying all charges passing the buck to his 
subordinates but it would not work we have enough evidence 
senior prosecutor lee chongchan said of chun 
twelve hours after questioning prosecutors gave no indication 
whether he would be put under formal arrest officials had said 
monday he was not likely to be released 
prosecutors said their initial investigation indicated chun 
embezzled or otherwise pocketed the equivalent of 14 million 
belonging to the saemaul new community movement which he headed 
for seven years 
the semiofficial organization is dedicated to urban and rural 
development chun kyunghwan was its director from 1981 until he 
resigned last year after reports that he had links with the 
underworld 
according to the prosecutors he is suspected of using the money 
allegedly taken from saemaul for such purposes as speculation in 
land and stocks 
legal experts say charges being contemplated in the case could 
result in more than five years in prison if chun is convicted 
chun was summoned by prosecutors tuesday morning for questioning 
about allegations that he abused power to get government funds for 
saemaul and cash donations from business executives 
when chun arrived at the prosecutor generals office a man 
rushed from the crowd yelling an insult hit him in the face and 
fled 
a ranking official of saemaul hwang hungsik 37 made two 
suicide attempts during interrogation once by trying to jump from 
a fifthfloor window officials reported 
hwang is accused of keeping secret ledgers on transactions 
involving money chun allegedly embezzled 
about 200 government officials and business executives have been 
questioned about allegedly helping chun either to amass a fortune 
or cover up the activity 
opposition parties demanded tuesday that the former president 
cut short a trip to the united states and state whether he was 
involved in the scandal 
chun doohwan was succeeded last month by roh taewoo who won 
the presidential election in december 
roh a former general who helped put chun in power with military 
backing in 1980 has promised to root out and end official 
corruption

a veteran antarctic researcher announced 
findings tuesday indicating that the depletion of the earths ozone 
layer could threaten the worlds food supply 
professor sayed elsayed of texas aampm university said increased 
amounts of ultraviolet light which a thinner ozone shield permits 
through to the earths surface supresses biological activity in 
microscopic marine plants in the antarctic 
elsayed said his findings the first of their kind confirm 
strong suspicions of biologists that ultraviolet light might mean 
trouble for fish animal and other life in the southernmost part of 
the world 
on the other hand i never underestimate the resilency of 
nature he said 
elsayed said it is impossible now to say whether the plankton 
microscopic singlecelled organisms called the grass of the sea 
and the organisms that feed on them might adapt to increased 
ultraviolet radiation and much work remains to be done 
plankton and the tiny shrimplike creature called krill that 
feed on them are the primary food source for the whole web of life 
in the antarctic including fish penguins and whales a baleen 
whale may eat three tons a day 
if anything happened to the krill population the whole 
ecosystem probably would collapse and you can say goodbye to the 
whales and the penguins and the seals and the fish elsayed told 
reporters at briefing arranged by the world resources institute a 
washington environmental research organization 
several nations are studying plans to harvest krill a 
550million to 770million ton reservoir of protein a 10 percent 
annual harvest would almost equal the current world fish catch 
the ozone shield over antarctica already thins greatly in 
springtime with the depletion reaching a record 50 percent last 
year scientists attribute the destruction of ozone to manmade 
chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
the environmental protection agency estimates that a 1 percent 
drop in ozone means a 2 percent increase in ultraviolet light and a 
48 percent to 75 percent increase in the most common skin cancers 
the national aeronautics and space administration on march 15 
said a depletion of ozone at midlatitudes of the northern 
hemisphere since 1969 was in all likelihood the result of those 
chemicals the du pont co said last week it plans to stop making 
them 
epa administrator lee m thomas told reporters over lunch 
tuesday that the epa and nasa would try to speed up the first 
scientific review under last falls treaty by 31 nations calling 
for a cut in cfc production by 50 percent by 1998 
thomas said he would not support bills in the senate subject of 
a hearing wednesday calling for an early 95 percent cut in us 
production 
a us cut beyond international agreement might take the 
pressure off other cfcproducing countries to act further thomas 
said and would add little to ozone protection

a time bomb in a sack of onions being 
taken to market exploded on a rural bus tuesday killing 10 
sinhalese farmers and critically wounding 15 police reported 
a spokesman said nine of the dead were blown to pieces 
police blamed the explosion in northcentral sri lanka on tamil 
militants who have fought since 1983 for a separate homeland for 
the ethnic minority in the northern and eastern parts of the island 
the bomb went off as the bus neared ratmalagawewa a village 
near anuradhpura city about 100 miles northeast of colombo police 
reported 
nine persons were blown to bits in the blast and one died in 
the hospital fifteen more are in critical condition said a 
police spokesman at anuradhpura all are sinhalese farmers taking 
their produce to towns nearby 
he said speaking on condition of anonymity that the bomb was 
the work of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the most powerful 
rebel group eelam is what the tamils would call a separate 
homeland in the parts of sri lanka where the ethnic group is 
dominant 
more than 135 people most of them sinhalese have been killed

the agreement signed last july gives some autonomy to tamil

lankas 16 million people tamils about 18 percent are

cia director william h webster told the 
senate intelligence committee on tuesday that he has reorganized 
the spy agency to improve counterintelligence and strengthen 
security at us embassies around the world 
webster told a closed session of the committee that he has 
reorganized the counterintelligence function within the cia and 
appointed a senior official to head it said a statement issued 
by sens david l boren dokla and william s cohen rmaine 
the chairman and senior republican on the committee 
boren and cohen did not name the official appointed by webster 
and the cia did not immediately return a telephone call concerning 
the reorganization 
boren and cohen said webster informed the committee of several 
new initiatives within the cia and the intelligence community 
designed to strengthen security at us missions abroad and to 
improve counterintelligence in the cia 
the reorganization will also combine the critical resources 
needed to combat the threat to us personnel and to facilities 
overseas the senators said 
in addition webster announced formation of a new independent 
office which will report to him in his capacity as director of 
central intelligence the senators said 
boren said creation of the independent office grows out of 
recommendations on embassy security submitted to president reagan 
by webster and secretary of state george p shultz in april 1987 
reagan asked for the recommendations after reports of widespread 
security leaks and espionage at the us embassy in moscow 
the report recommended that the director of central intelligence 
certify the security conditions of all existing embassies and of 
all new facilities before they are put into operation 
an earlier report by the senate intelligence committee cited a 
need for cia initiatives to improve both its counterintelligence 
efforts and its career opportunities in counterintelligence 
that report issued in november 1986 stressed what it called 
the added requirements for counterintelligence support in 
intelligence collection programs

utahs attorney general has blasted 
independent counsel lawrence walsh for asking judicial officials 
around the country for help in the irancontra case but others 
appear unconcerned about walshs activity 
i wasnt going to give lawrence walshs people the time of 
day david wilkinson the utah official said commenting on a 
letter he received from the independent counsels office 
jeffrey toobin an associate in walshs office sent a letter 
march 15 to us attorneys and attorneys general in 50 states 
seeking information about other cases involving immunity 
james wieghart walshs spokesman said monday the letter was a 
routine request to ensure that prosecutors are uptodate on the 
most recent case law 
the letter asks judicial officials for anything you think 
might be helpful established procedures transcripts briefs or 
even informal office lore the existence of the letter was first 
revealed on the editorial page of the wall street journal 
defendants in the irancontra case are expected to challenge 
walsh on immunity because they received such grants from congress 
in exchange for testifying about the irancontra case last summer 
former white house aides john m poindexter oliver l north and 
businessman albert hakim were granted immunity but richard v 
secord hakims partner was not the four are charged with 
conspiracy and theft in the irancontra case 
walsh cannot use any information from the congressional hearings 
in court and he must prove that his data was gathered 
independently walsh has hired former federal judge herbert stern 
to supervise the handling of legal challenges 
us district court judge gerhard gesell has set april 12 for a 
hearing on the immunity issue attorneys in the case must file 
their papers by april 7 
wilkinson who provided the associated press with a copy of the 
toobin letter said he considered it a little bizarre that an 
independent counsel would be seeking help from the state attorneys 
general 
wilkinson a republican noted that there is a constitutional 
dispute over the existence of the independent counsels which were 
created by congress under the 1978 ethics in government act 
the supreme court is scheduled to hear arguments on april 26 on 
a lower court decision that struck down the constitutionality of 
the special prosecutors 
wilkinson said his sympathies are with the executive branch 
not the legislative branch 
but not everyone was as perturbed as wilkinson about the letter 
leroy zimmerman the gop attorney general in pennsylvania has 
directed his staff pass along any information or experiences 
which would be helpful to walshs people according to bob 
gentzel his spokesman 
attorneys in the office of travis medlock south carolinas 
attorney general are still reviewing the letter according to mark 
dillard his spokesman 
alan ashby spokesman for california attorney general john van 
de kamp said he didnt know if his boss had received the letter 
but he said the state and federal judiciary have a pretty close 
working relationship on many issues when the jurisdictions 
overlap

the wisconsin presidential primary comes at a 
crossroads for the democratic candidates with michael dukakis 
trying to wrest momentum from jesse jackson and longshots albert 
gore jr and paul simon trying to keep their campaigns alive 
the results of michigan have increased the importance of 
wisconsin tony tsakakis a national campaign aide to dukakis 
said tuesday 
after his loss to jackson in saturdays michigan caucuses the 
massachusetts governor has stepped up his campaign schedule in 
wisconsin ahead of the states primary next tuesday tsakakis said 
dukakis won an endorsement tuesday from former wisconsin gov 
patrick lucey who said the wisconsin primary and its 81 democratic 
delegates is every bit as significant as it was for another 
massachusetts candidate john f kennedy in 1960 
weve always felt every state is a must state tsakakis 
said noting however that wisconsin now has added significance for 
dukakis candidacy 
dukakis thirdplace finish in illinois behind simon and jackson 
and his secondplace showing in michigan have tossed uncertainty 
into the democratic race 
were looking to wisconsin to continue our everbroadening 
base of support said jackson aide bob burns if we have 
reasonably good backtoback showings in large industrial states 
it will give us a head of steam going into new york on april 19 
polls indicate the race is a dead heat between jackson and 
dukakis 
jackson has won compliments from wisconsins gop governor tommy 
thompson and even from vice president george bush 
his campaign was diminished in the beginning by a lot of 
sophisticated observers politicians bush said in a wisconsin 
campaign appearance monday they never gave him much of the time 
of day and hes doing very very well taking his case to the 
people 
bush should literally walk away with the 47 republican 
delegates rival bob dole quit the race on tuesday the only 
remaining gop opponent pat robertson has made no effort here 
colorados caucuses on monday a day before the wisconsin 
primary are also shaping up as a jacksondukakis fight 
the worst jackson will do is finish second but i think he has 
a good chance of winning said mike stratton a denver democratic 
consultant who ran gary harts 1984 colorado campaign stratton 
said jacksons liberal antiestablishment message was attractive 
to many former hart supporters 
in wisconsin simon badly needs a good showing in wisconsin to 
keep his campaign alive after his win in home state illinois two 
weeks ago simon said he was pinning his hopes on wisconsin 
gore also has campaigned heavily in wisconsin and has flooded 
television airwaves with his advertisements 
gores father former sen albert gore sr said tuesday his son 
needs a respectable showing in wisconsin which he defined as a 
strong third

american builders will be allowed to bid on 
japanese construction projects under a new agreement aimed at 
ending a trade dispute that has soured relations between the two 
countries 
us trade representative clayton yeutter told a joint news 
conference tuesday he was pleased that the prolonged onandoff 
talks had reached a fruitful conclusion proving that the two 
countries through negotiations are able to manage difficult 
bilateral trade disputes 
japanese chief negotiator ochiro ozawa said he hopes us 
construction companies will take full advantage of the agreement 
by taking concrete action to obtain construction licenses in 
japan and actually participating in the japanese construction 
boom 
ozawa deputy chief cabinet secretary for prime minister noboru 
takeshita headed the talks as the personal representative of the 
prime minister in accordance with takeshitas agreement with 
president reagan in january that the construction dispute would be 
solved amicably he said 
it is my great pleasure to see a settlement that is amicable 
mutually satisfactory and fruitful ozawa said 
yeutters deputy michael smith said the agreement provides for 
the japanese government to facilitate the admittance of american 
firms to the bidding on japanese projects 
it is up to the us firms to take advantage of the 
agreement he added 
smith said the accord provides for us participation in 
construction of the kansai international airport and some other 
projects on which the two governments had basically agreed last 
year 
added to it were procedures for bidding on other public works 
projects financed by the central government he said 
smith said a third category being opened to us bidders was 
local public construction as well as private projects franchised or 
approved by the central government 
these include airport terminals which us builders said they 
have been prevented from bidding on despite very competitive 
standards 
the agreement means it will be easier in the future for them to 
enter the bidding smith said 
deputy us commerce secretary w allen moore told reporters 
our side feels fairly good about the outcome of these talks but 
the real proof of access will be in the future 
moore said commerce secretary c william verity next week plans 
to call heads of major us construction companies to washington 
and urge them to take advantage of what we sincerely believe is a 
real opportunity 
officials said that besides the multibilliondollar kansai 
airport project off osaka the agreement specifically covers entry 
of us builders into the bidding for work on such projects as the 
tokyo bay causeway the new headquarters of nippon telegraph and 
telephone public corp the tokyo haneda airport coastline 
development a new hiroshima airport the tokyo bay redevelopment 
project the akashi straits bridge the ise coastal road south of 
nagoya the new port 21 planned for yokohama and a new kansai 
research city planned for the osakakobe area

republican bob dole ended his campaign for 
president tuesday saying he was bloodied but unbowed by the 
series of bruising primary losses that finished his candidacy 
dole withdrew before a supportive audience of senate and house 
colleagues and offered congratulations to george bush the 
allbutanointed gop nominee 
my friends know that i am a fighter i dont like to lose 
the senate republican leader said i have been beaten before and 
no doubt will be again but i have never been defeated and never 
will be 
dole the kansas senator had signaled for days that he was 
ready to bow to the inevitable 
one thing you learn how to do pretty well in our business is 
to count he said in his withdrawal announcement you come to 
trust your instincts to tell you when its over and in my heart i 
know the time is now 
so i return to the senate as the republican leader ready 
to do all i can to elect republicans in november and doing all i 
can for our nominee george bush 
bush in wisconsin said he had telephoned dole to thank him for 
a very generous statement he added its been a hardfought 
campaign and i respect the tenacity of bob dole 
pat robertson in a statement distributed from his headquarters 
in chesapeake va praised dole as a magnificent competitor 
the former television evangelist with almost no delegate support 
conceded it seems obvious that bush will be the nominee but 
said anew that he wont withdraw from the gop contest 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said there was no change 
in president reagans policy of neutrality despite doles action 
dole made his exit before an audience jammed into the senate 
caucus room a historic room where john f kennedy launched his 
presidential bid and site of the senate watergate hearings 15 years 
ago and the irancontra hearings a year ago 
surveying the crowd and hearing an effusive introduction by sen 
strom thurmond rsc dole began by saying maybe i ought to 
change this 
his withdrawal came on the day of the primary in connecticut 
one of several home states for bush where another dole loss was 
certain dole had for a time hoped to hang on until next weeks 
primary in wisconsin but his outlook was hardly better there and 
bushs delegate lead appeared insurmountable 
doles candidacy took off in iowas caucuses a farm state where 
he benefited from his rural roots in neighboring kansas he won the 
leadoff delegate event leaving bush stunned with a third place 
finish behind former television evangelist pat robertson 
for almost a week dole looked like a good bet for the gop 
nomination but his chances were frozen in new hampshire 
he relied on a surge in popularity there built on his iowa 
success however in what he later conceded was a tactical mistake 
he didnt counter tough bush television ads suggesting dole would 
raise taxes new hampshire dealt him a loss from which he could not 
recover 
doles campaign was beset by internal divisions and vacillation 
critics said it was a reflection of dole himself calling him a 
consummate legislator but lacking in executive experience and 
unable to delegate authority 
his campaign was in turmoil after his new hampshire loss and 
the division between campaign manager bill brock and two 
conservative campaign consultants broke into the open brock fired 
them in full view of reporters ordering them off the campaign 
plane 
doles strategy for winning the white house was based primarily 
on winning the first two contests and when he fell short in new 
hampshire his candidacy collapsed 
he found himself far behind bush in the southern primaries on 
super tuesday three weeks later unable to focus his energies on 
his best opportunities he lost everywhere 
dole couldnt turn the race around in illinois and was 
effectively out of the running 
he campaigned last week in wisconsin but public opinion polls 
indicated a 2to1 bush lead by weeks end dole appeared to be 
weary of waging a campaign that was only going through the motions 
i can read the numbers and i probably know whats happening 
he said 
we need to keep a republican in the white house thats where 
im coming from he said and if it cant be me it will be 
george bush 
dole the 1976 vice presidential nominee in gerald fords losing 
reelection bid ran for the presidential nomination in 1980 that 
quickly ended in failure as ronald reagan won 
eight years later dole was frustrated by a feeling that he 
still had to run against reagan bush reagans loyal vice 
president inherited many of the presidents supporters despite 
doles best efforts 
im sort of running against the ghost of ronald reagan dole 
said recently 
dole attacked bush as lacking leadership qualities as having a 
full resume but no real experience and for involvement in the 
reagan administrations major disaster the irancontra affair 
none of it stuck 
dole tried repeatedly to stir resentment against bush and his 
patrician background but doles argument that he himself was one 
of us apparently won over only iowans 
he was always dogged by a reputation for meanness begun in the 
publics mind when he played the hatchetman role on the 1976 
ticket although he tried to soften that persona he sometimes 
revealed bitterness 
the night of his new hampshire loss he accused bush of 
lying about the dole record during a joint live television 
interview

fiery evangelist jimmy swaggart was 
ordered tuesday not to preach from the pulpit or his television 
show for at least a year while he is rehabilitated from moral 
failure that reportedly included paying a prostitute to pose nude 
in announcing its decision the assemblies of god elders 
disregarded a more lenient threemonth suspension recommended by 
the church in louisiana the national church included provisions 
for two years of rehabilitation and counseling to begin when 
swaggart has agreed to rehabilitation in writing 
louisiana district officials refused comment as did the jimmy 
swaggart worldwide ministries in baton rouge la but a spokesman 
said swaggarts ministry would have a statement wednesday 
swaggart is the latest evangelist to be forced from the pulpit 
his accuser marvin gorman was forced from the assemblies of god 
when he admitted to an immoral act with a woman and jim and tammy 
bakker were forced from their ptl ministry in a scandal that 
included a sexual encounter between bakker and young female 
follower 
it is hoped that jimmy swaggart will agree to this program of 
rehabilitation and that such program will be redemptive and 
restorative in the life and ministry of our brother the rev g 
raymond carlson the churchs general superintendent said in a 
statement 
people approved by the church would supervise the 
rehabilitation carlson said he provided no other details 
if he does not accept then the executive presbytery would 
take action to dismiss him carlson said at a news conference 
under the terms of rehabilitation swaggart would be barred from 
his pulpit for at least a year and would have to stop distributing 
videotaped services that have enabled him to build a worldwide 
congregation 
he will not be in the pulpit and he would not participate in 
that kind of ministry he would not address his congregation per 
se carlson said at the news conference i believe we are 
asking him to be absent from television ministry 
church officials say swaggart confessed to them in detail but 
they have refused to make his transgression public reports have 
linked him to a prostitute who says he paid her to pose naked 
carlson said he called swaggart on tuesday to inform him of the 
churchs decision but the two did not discuss whether swaggart 
would accept rehabilitation 
he thanked me carlson said he expressed thanks and i 
had prayer with him over the telephone 
swaggart has 30 days to appeal to the 13member executive 
presbytery which serves as a board of directors and which set the 
terms of rehabilitation 
church spokeswoman juleen turnage said church elders who have 
been grappling with the case since swaggart stepped down from his 
pulpit feb 21 are unlikely to change their decision 
the louisiana district had recommended that swaggart be barred 
from preaching for three months national officials say every other 
assemblies minister who has confessed to moral failure has been 
barred from preaching for at least a year 
the louisiana district refused requests from the executive 
presbytery to reconsider and apparently also questioned the 
national leaderships authority to determine discipline 
h maurice lednicky a general presbytor and president of the 
assemblies central bible college in springfield said the question 
of authorities was the focus the presbytors meeting monday and 
tuesday 
in the end the 232member general presbytory an oversight 
body decided that the executive presbytory had authority to 
discipline swaggart said carlson a member of the executive 
presbytery the presbytors later endorsed on a voice vote the 
terms of rehabilitation 
robert s king a member of the louisiana district council from 
lafayette said he disagreed with the decision 
i feel his swaggarts ministry is unique and much depends on 
it i feel god has forgiven him he has asked god and men to 
forgive him and we ought to forgive him ought to restore him to 
the pulpit quickly he said 
but lednicky and other general presbytors in springfield said 
they supported the executive presbytery i think it helps not 
only the ministers but the general public to feel that there is 
integrity he said 
frank martin a general presbytor representing the tennessee 
district said the decision showed mercy 
after swaggarts tearful confession to an unspecified sin debra 
murphree who has a record of arrests on prostitution charges said 
he paid her to pose naked in a hotel room 
in a related development the national religious broadcasters on 
friday recommended terminating swaggarts membership the 
organizations executive director said tuesday termination doesnt 
become final until approved by the groups board of directors 
which meets next february 
if they cant show the code and the logo like the good 
housekeeping seal of approval on their programs it should affect 
their donations said the rev benjamin l armstrong executive 
director of the 1400member organization

iraq accused iran on tuesday of using 
poison gas in its kurdistan offensive and threatened to attack 
iranian cities with chemical weapons 
iran which accused the iraqis of using chemical bombs in the 
same area last week said revolutionary guards were moving deeper 
into iraq territory in the northern campaign 
baghdads official news agency said iraqi warplanes raided two 
ships off iran in the persian gulf overnight but there was no 
independent confirmation about 500 vessels have been attacked by 
both sides since the war began in september 1980 
iranian rebel groups based in iraq said to include women 
fighters for the first time appeared to have pushed into the 
oilrich khuzestan province of southwest iran around the town of 
fakkeh 
there was no independent confirmation of the operation by the 
national liberation army of iran but the iranians who claimed 
monday the offensive was repulsed said their warplanes bombed 
enemy forces tuesday in the fakkeh region 
on monday the rebels said several thousand fighters with tanks 
moved into khuzestan in their biggest offensive yet alireza 
jaferzada a spokesman in baghdad claimed on tuesday they had 
killed or wounded thousands of iranian soldiers 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia said iran fired two missiles 
tuesday into mandali 70 miles northeast of baghdad iraq did not 
report the attack 
irans official islamic republic news agency said nine civilians 
were killed in iraqi air raids on four western and southern iranian 
cities tehran radio said iranian fighters shot down two iraqi 
warplanes in a dogfight iraq denied it 
nuri nayef head of the iraqi news agency office in cairo said 
tuesday an iraqi government spokesman told him the military might 
choose a number of large iranian cities to be the targets of 
chemical weapons as a deterrent and punitive measure 
he said the spokesman whom he did not identify declared that 
iran used chemical weapons in kurdistan last week and iraq may 
respond in kind 
iran says iraq dropped chemical bombs march 1617 on halabja 
dojaila and khormal three kurdish towns in iraq captured by 
iranian troops in an offensive that began march 16 iran said 5000 
people were killed and 5000 wounded 
western correspondents taken to halabja by the iranians last 
week reported seeing hundreds of dead civilians unmarked by wounds 
most of iraqs 35 million kurds live in the northeast kurdish 
separatist guerrillas now backed by iran have been fighting iraqi 
governments for decades and halabja was the scene of a kurdish 
rebellion last year 
baghdad has not confirmed or denied employing chemical weapons 
but the united nations has said four times since 1984 that iraq has 
used poison gas bombs or artillery shells 
iran has accused the iraqis of more than 100 chemical attacks in 
that period 
on saturday iraqs ruling revolutionary command council said it 
had the right to defend itself with all available weapons 
at the united nations in new york iraq criticized a un 
decision to send two experts to to investigate the iranian reports 
and urged that another team be sent to check on reports of murder 
and torture of iraqi prisoners of war in iran 
iran said its warplanes were in action tuesday to support 
revolutionary guard units it claims have penetrated about 15 miles 
into the darbandikhan region of northeastern iraq since march 16 
the iranians say the invasion force has killed or wounded nearly 
13500 iraqis captured more than 5000 and destroyed 225 tanks and 
armored vehicles 
iraq has admitted losing territory in kurdistan but has given no 
details 
if the iranian claim is confirmed it would be iraqs worst 
military setback since iranian forces drove to within six miles of 
basra the southern regional capital early last year

the house narrowly rejected a bill tuesday 
that would have awarded the states title to abandoned shipwrecks of 
historic significance lying within their waters a proposal 
strongly opposed by sport divers and some commercial salvage 
operators 
the house defeated the measure 263139 which was five votes 
short of the twothirds majority required for passage the bill 
passed the senate by voice vote on dec 19 
opponents complained that the bill was brought to the floor 
under parliamentary ground rules usually adopted for abbreviated 
debate on noncontroversial bills with no amendments allowed 
the bills supporters led by rep charles e bennett dfla 
were expected to try to return the measure to the house floor under 
different rules which would allow opponents to introduce amendments 
and would require only a simple majority for passage 
rep norman d shumway rcalif complained that under the 
bill there is no legal binding or enforceable way to ensure 
that the sport divers right to dive on these wrecks even for 
purely recreational purposes will be protected by states 
rep e clay shaw jr rfla countered that its passage will 
go a long way toward preserving these archaeological treasures 
although he agreed with shumway that the bill may discourage 
private exploration for undiscovered shipwrecks 
without the bill said rep bruce vento dminn dynamiting and 
other abuses by some reckless treasure hunters would absolutely 
guarantee for future generations that these shipwrecks these 
valuable pieces of history would be lost for all time 
vento said guidelines to be published by the national park 
service under the bill would protect historic shipwrecks in state 
waters while permitting orderly access by sport divers fishing 
enthusiasts and others 
the bill would give states title to the estimated 5 percent to 
10 percent of the shipwrecks in state waters that are considered 
historically important all others having no historic interest 
plus all shipwrecks lying beyond 3 miles offshore would be governed 
by federal admiralty law 
admiralty law awards shipwrecks and cargoes to the finders and 
permits salvage operators to claim a major portion of the cargoes 
they raise 
under the bill admiralty law would not apply to the small 
number of historically significant shipwrecks in state waters and 
indian tribes would have title to shipwrecks on their lands the 
federal government would retain title to any abandoned wrecks on 
public lands 
until now both states and federal admiralty courts have claimed 
jurisdiction over abandoned historic shipwrecks in state waters 
the submerged lands act of 1953 gave the states ownership of all 
natural resources and submerged lands up to 3 miles offshore but 
did not cover artificial objects such as shipwrecks on those lands

secretary of state george p shultz failed on 
tuesday to persuade the arab league to support his proposal for 
mideast peace talks 
but a spokesman for the 21nation group which also includes the 
palestine liberation organziation said the reagan administration 
seemed to be more sensitive to the arab viewpoint 
the 90minute meeting at the state department was part of 
shultzs preparation for his trip to the region beginning sunday 
night he will try to nudge israel and a mixed delegation of 
jordanians and palestinian arabs to open talks may 1 
shultz met with syrian foreign minister farouk alshara 
algerian ambassador mohammad sahnoun saudi arabian ambassador 
bandar bin sultan and other league representatives 
the league spokesman clovis maksoud said they disagreed with 
shultz on several issues including the leagues demand for a seat 
at the negotiating table for the plo 
we think the plo should be represented on an equal footing 
maksoud said 
shultz met saturday with two members of the palestine national 
council the legislative arm of the plo but state department 
spokesman charles e redman said monday this did not conflict with 
the us policy of not dealing with yasser arafats organization 
both the united states and israel consider the plo a terrorist 
group shultz has demanded it recognize israels right to exist and 
disavow terrorism as conditions for us acceptance 
maksoud said the league and shultz also disagreed on the scope 
of a peace conference on the middle east the arabs want the united 
states the soviet union and the three other permament members of 
the un security council china britain and france to play an 
active role in arabisraeli negotiations 
shultz would restrict the conference to launching direct 
peacemaking talks the soviet union and china do not have 
diplomatic relations with israel and provide modern arms to syria 
and saudi arabia respectively 
i cannot say we reached any conclusive agreements maksoud 
said 
still he said the secretary of state showed a measure of 
openness to the leagues views we found the united states 
perhaps more sensitive to some of our concepts 
shultz has called for an israeli withdrawal from at least some 
of the west bank and gaza which jordan and egypt lost in the 1967 
sixday war maksoud said the league wants the israeliheld 
territories evacuated completely

house speaker jim wright has filed amended 
financial disclosure statements covering the past seven years to 
list assets he held with a fort worth business partner including 
stocks real estate and precious and semiprecious stones 
wright filed the disclosures required by house reporting forms 
after failing to do so since he and developer george a mallick and 
their wives formed the venture mallightco inc in 1979 the name 
of the business is a combination of the two couples last names 
in the past the texas democrat has listed the company on his 
disclosure forms with an aggregate value category but never has 
detailed the underlying assets of the venture in some cases the 
total values given in the new forms conflict with those filed 
previously 
an aide to wright marshall lynam said the speaker had been 
simply unaware of any requirement for disclosure of the 
corporations assets until his attorneys told him about it last 
year while preparing to put the assets in a blind trust 
the corporations holdings at that time were detailed in the 
blind trust announcement but the new disclosure filings are the 
first public record of the trusts holdings and activities for 
previous years 
on march 18 wright filed amended reports with the house clerks 
office detailing those holdings for the years 1980 through 1986 
the speakers office did not call attention to the filings and the 
existence of the amended forms was disclosed tuesday by rep newt 
gingrich rga who has harshly criticized wright for alleged 
ethical shortcomings 
in each of the seven years the amended forms show mallightcos 
total value at between 100001 and 250000 the forms require 
disclosure of values only in broad ranges so it is impossible to 
tell precise amounts 
in 1980 the first year in which mallightco appears on wrights 
disclosure statements wrights onehalf share of the company 
included savings accounts and fixed assets worth less than 
5000 each stocks and bonds worth 50000 to 100000 and notes 
receivable owed by wright under 5000 his wife betty 15001 
to 50000 and marlene mallick 15001 to 50000 
the stocks included tandy corporation gulf oil american quasar 
petroleum and first national bank of weatherford valued at less 
than 5000 each and supron oil delphi oil and western co of 
north america each valued at 15001 to 50000 
the value of the ventures stock portfolio declined over the 
next three years as values dropped and some stocks apparently were 
sold at the same time wrights debt to the partnership climbed to 
the range of 15001 to 50000 
in 1983 the disclosure form adds precious and semiprecious 
stones worth 15001 to 50000 to wrights share of the assets 
also added to the assets list is a 5001 to 15000 note 
receivable from the mallick company 
wright apparently paid off part of his debt to the business in 
1985 and his debt dropped to the range of 5001 to 15000 
in the final year for which an amendment was filed 1986 the 
assets list is enlarged to include real estate near orlando 
fla with a value in the range of 50001 to 100000 
the total values for mallightco were increased in the amended 
forms for the years 1983 and 1984 when previous filings had put 
the value in the range of 50001 to 100000 
mallick has figured in news reports about wrights efforts to 
get a federal grant for the renovation of fort worths stockyards 
a project in which mallick was involved wright said he had been 
unaware of his associates involvement when he was seeking the 
grant 
after criticism about those financial dealings and others 
mounted last fall wright put his assets in a blind trust and said 
he had instructed his attorneys to sell his interest in mallightco 
wrights attorney charles m levy put the total assets of the 
speaker and his wife at the time at 187317 not counting their 
house in mclean va personal retirement funds and 57 acres of 
property in arkansas

former rep paul mccloskey jr said tuesday he 
is considering suing pat robertson to recover 400000 in legal 
fees he incurred when the republican presidential candidate sued 
him for libel 
mccloskey said his lawyers believe they can be prove that 
robertson made frivolous use of the court system in suing mccloskey 
over his statements about robertsons korean war record 
at a national press club luncheon mccloskey repeated the story 
he has told for years about being in marine officer training school 
with robertson and then being shipped to korea in 1950 mccloskey 
contends that while he and others were sent off to combat 
robertson ducked combat duty using the influence of his father the 
late sen a willis robertson dva 
mccloskey said he and others recall robertson boasting about how 
im going to call my daddy to get me out of this thing 
robertson dropped his legal suit against mccloskey earlier this 
month citing a trial opening set for march 8 the date of the 
critical super tuesday series of presidential primaries and 
caucuses in 20 states he said the trial would force him to choose 
between his campaign and the legal case 
however mccloskey contended tuesday that robertson dropped the 
lawsuit because the evidence supporting the former california 
congressmans story was unbeatable 
he said 21 former marines were ready to testify on his side and 
that letters from robertsons father supported his case 
the evidence that robertson brought suit frivolously is in a 
letter written by robertson to a california politician in 1985 in 
which robertson said that mccloskey believed he was telling the 
truth but that his memory was faulty the excongressman said 
that would negate the veracity of a suit claiming mccloskey 
willfully lied about the former television evangelists record 
mccloskey said 
now we have enough to sue him for misusing the legal 
process he said 
robertson however insisted he could have won the case 
every testimony that was to be was already in the record the 
record was closed the record was complete in the record i won 
robertson said at a news conference tuesday in chesapeake va 
unfortunately the judge gave me a hobsons choice that i could 
not abide with 
a federal judge dismissed the case on march 7 after robertston 
agreed to pay court costs but not mccloskeys 400000 in legal 
fees 
us district judge joyce hens green signed the order dismissing 
the case with prejudice which means that mccloskey was legally 
the victor in the case 
mccloskeys lawyers meanwhile asked robertson to pay 42845 
in court costs now that the libel suit has been dismissed 
in a bill of court costs that was made public tuesday in us 
district court mccloskeys lawyer george lehner aksed for among 
other things 15794 to cover the cost of taking depositions from 
witnesses and 19458 for photocopying documents 
lehner said this figure included 16000 to make largesize 
trial exhibits of 30 to 35 documents 
robertsons lawyer douglas v rigler who has 11 days to file 
any opposition to the bill declined to say if he would make any 
objection i would want to discuss that with my client but just 
on first glance it looks extravagant

rep richard gephardt said tuesday he 
regretted not doing better in the democratic presidential race but 
was determined to work in congress toward the same goals of his 
campaign for the white house 
reflecting on his failed white house bid after filing for 
reelection to his st louis congressional seat gephardt said he 
knew his campaign was in trouble march 8 when he lost 19 super 
tuesday states and won only missouri 
super tuesday was the hard night because that was when you 
really knew you were on the ropes gephardt said but he added 
there was a positive side to being out of the race 
theres always a bittersweet in everything in life were 
disappointed and yes we wanted t the 47yearold congressman said he 
was somewhat relieved he and 
his wife ando do this 
their three young children would not be thrust into 
the public life of a presidents family 
we couldnt go to a movie or a drugstore without an 
entourage gephardt said their lives would never be the same 
because of my choices my success so now we can go to the 
drugstore and the movies and be fairly normal 
gephardt repeated words he had said monday in washington when he 
formally withdrew from the race and called himself the luckiest 
guy in thefueltax exemption for farmers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the senate finance committee agreed tuesday to 
grant a fueltax exemption for farmers and other offtheroad 
diesel users on april 1 and to make corporations foot the bill 
however the future of the proposed relief remained in doubt 
because the house ways and means committee which must originate 
tax bills has scheduled no action on the diesel proposal backers 
of the legislation are holding out hope that the house panel will 
approve a bill this week before adjourning for easter week 
farmers fishermen and others who use diesel for offtheroad 
business purposes traditionally have been exempt from the tax 
which finances highway construction but under a 1987 law aimed at 
preventing cheating they must begin paying the tax on april 1 and 
then apply for a refund when they file their incometax returns 
next year 
the finance committee voted last week to grant these users 
relief from paying the tax at all but because of budget 
restrictions it acted to provide the exemption on oct 1 at the 
direction of the committee sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the 
chairman introduced an amendment tuesday that steps up the relief 
to april 1 
the committee is getting around the budget problem by tightening 
collections of corporate taxes this would cost corporations an 
extra 508 million from 1988 through 1993 with the bulk of the 
additional money coming from expedited collections this year and 
next 
under the change a corporation that shifts its method of 
calculating estimated taxes from one quarter to the next would have 
to make up in the subsequent quarter 96 percent of the reduction 
achieved in the previous period this change would be phased in 
over two years 
providing the dieseltax relief for offroad users will cost 
about 615 million during the same sixyear period another part of 
the package is a taxpayer bill of rights aimed at reducing 
internal revenue service powers in some disputes with taxpayers 
these changes would cost about 517 million through 1993 
other provisions would double the gasguzzler tax on inefficient 
cars mainly expensive imports and limit the abilities of 
distilleries to dodge part of the whisky tax through what is known 
as a wine credit 
the net revenue effect of the package would be to raise taxes by 
104 million over six years

tom king britains minister 
for northern ireland met tuesday with leaders of the main roman 
catholic political party in an effort to resolve a political 
stalemate in the troubled province 
king and leaders of the social democratic and labor party sdlp 
conferred for about two hours on the political situation and new 
surge of sectarian violence in northern ireland 
sdlp leader john hume said after the meeting we are ready to 
sit down and talk with anyone including the ulster unionists who 
represent the protestant majority 
hume said the negotiations would have to be about how we solve 
the problem in our society rather than who wins power we 
believe we should be talking face to face with the unionists the 
sooner we get there the better he added 
hume recently met with gerry adams leader of sinn fein the 
legal political wing of the outlawed irish republican army the 
unionists denounced that meeting saying the sdlp was giving 
credibility to terrorists 
the predominantly catholic ira has been waging a violent 
campaign since 1969 to unite northern ireland where protestants 
outnumer catholic 32 with the overwhelmingly catholic republic of 
ireland 
five people have died this month in murderous rampages at two 
ira funerals the killings climaxed two weeks of rising tension 
after british commandos shot dead three unarmed ira guerrillas in 
gibraltar 
hume said his delegation told king of their partys desire to 
see all factions work together to create stability in the british 
province where more than 2600 people have been killed in 
sectarian violence since 1969 
a british government statement said the meeting had been 
arranged to consider the possiblity of moving to a wider dialogue 
involving the constitutional parties about the future government 
of northern ireland 
the british broadcasting corporation reported king and the party 
leaders discussed setting up of some form of powersharing 
administration involving protestants and catholics 
hume said his talks with adams were not mentioned at the meeting 
with king 
the humeadams talks had drawn speculation of a possible 
temporary ceasefire but irish nationalists insisted the ira had 
no intention of halting its campaign and hume told independent 
television news he was only interested in discussing a permanent 
truce

sen albert gore jr said tuesday that jesse 
jackson has a complete and total lack of experience to be 
president and criticized what he said was jacksons notion that 
theres a moral equivalence between israel and the plo 
he also said of jackson an ordained minister known for his 
ringing speeches were not choosing a preacher were choosing a 
president 
jackson campaigning in east harlem when told of gores remarks 
said the senator should not discriminate against someone because 
they are a preacher a priest or a rabbi 
i assume that he is stimulated by his own status in the 
campaign to attack me i am stimulated to keep hope alive 
jackson said 
addressing jewish audiences in new york gore also criticized 
another democratic presidential rival michael dukakis for naive 
legalism in his approach to foreign policy and an exaggerated 
faith in the united nations 
gore said he was dismayed by jacksons embrace of palestine 
liberation organization leader yasser arafat and cuban leader fidel 
castro 
venturing where other democratic candidates have feared to 
tread gore sharply criticized jacksons foreign policy views and 
contrasted his own experience and beliefs with those of the civil 
rights activist 
other democratic candidates have shied away from attacks on 
jackson apparently assuming he wont win the nomination and 
wanting to pick up his supporters but there had been speculation 
that that would change after jacksons victory in last weeks 
michigan caucuses solidified his position in the forefront of the 
democratic race 
gore credited jackson with having energized millions of 
voters and having offered ideas on drugs and the economy 
but i part company with him over his opposition to such 
mainstays of our national defense as the f15 and the cruise 
missile gore said i categorically reject his notion that 
theres a moral equivalence between israel and the plo and i am 
dismayed by his embrace of arafat and castro 
as for dukakis gore pointed to his disagreement with the 
massachusetts governor over a recent letter signed by 30 senate 
members gore said he was asked and declined to sign the letter 
which disagreed with israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
opposition to exchanging occupied land for recognition by arab 
states dukakis he noted said he would have signed the letter 
gore in appearances before a civic group and a coalition of 
jewish organizations said the democratic race was far from over 
and that jacksons sudden ascendancy could be as fleeting as gary 
harts had been 
when gary hart got back into the race and he rocketed to the 
top of the polls a lot of people expressed a sense of panic 
gore told reporters at a breakfast of the association for a better 
new york this race changes from day to day 
later answering questions after a speech to the conference of 
presidents of major american jewish organizations gore said he 
hasnt been afraid to criticize jackson 
i have sharp disagreements with jesse jackson the tennessee 
senator said i have talked about his complete and total lack 
of experience in the national government he hasnt served a single 
day in the national government or had a single days experience in 
foreign policy 
he has said im a tree shaker not a jelly maker well 
some jelly has to be made in the white house so to speak if you 
need brain surgery youre going to want to know if the surgeon has 
gone to medical school or has had experience practicing that 
particular line of work 
we need a president who is prepared to tackle some of the 
toughest problems we have ever had in our foreign policy and our 
domestic policy and we need a president who has the experience to 
do that job well 
gore was applauded for his criticism of jackson 
in his speech to the jewish group gore contrasted his support 
of israel with jacksons recognition of the palestine liberation 
organization he also said he was deeply troubled by a report 
of chinese weapons sales to saudi arabia and urged steps by the 
united states to discourage such trade 
the tennessean said the new york primary on april 19 would be a 
critical test of his candidacy but he did not say he had to win it 
only do extremely well 
new york will send 255 delegates to the democratic national 
convention

reporters were allowed into the chinese 
legislatures small group meetings for the first time tuesday but 
saw a limited amount of the free and lively discussion that has 
been ballyhooed by the official news media 
in the tibetan room of the great hall of the people seat of 
chinas government 19 delegates from tibet gathered for what was 
supposed to be an example of democracy at work 
foreign and chinese reporters crowded the room in anticipation 
of observing delegates engaged in a free exchange of ideas 
but many soon left as one delegate after another to the national 
peoples congress read lengthy prepared speeches praising 
economic reform and chinas opendoor policy and calling for unity 
and perseverence in the great work of socialist construction 
western reporters who attended other provincial discussion 
groups said the action was a little livelier as delegates 
interrupted each other to add remarks or to disagree 
the reporters said they were surprised that their presence 
seemed not to deter delegates from criticizing the implementation 
of policies in their areas 
but most speakers prefaced critical remarks by saying they 
agreed with chinas policies of reform and with the report 
presented by acting premier li peng at fridays opening session of 
the congress 
china has given lavish publicity to what it says is the 
increasingly democratic nature of its government for the first 
time this year there were more candidates than seats in elections 
for local peoples congresses 
the media portrayed the small group discussions as being the 
heart of the democratic exercise the national tv evening news for 
two days has devoted nearly half its domestic news to showing 
delegates in animated exchanges 
but in the tibetan room 20 minutes passed before the first 
delegate spoke out of turn and then it was to support his 
colleagues statements 
at the 2hour meeting delegates were seldom interrupted and no 
one expressed disagreement or a differing viewpoint 
most delegates seemed disinterested smoking absently and 
staring into space through much of the session the panchen lama 
tibetan buddhisms secondhighest leader and a vice chairman of the 
national peoples congress carried on a private conversation with 
his neighbor ngapoi ngawang jigme chairman of the tibetan peoples 
congress 
western reporters said delegates in other groups took a more 
active role in discussions there was a certain amount of give 
and take one reporter said 
in the liaoning province group a rural school teacher found 
fault with government education policy and delegates frequently

israels army isolated the 
occupied territories tuesday but palestinians threw gasoline bombs 
at patrolling soldiers and the israelis opened fire and wounded 
eight of the demonstrators 
the unprecedented crackdown on the 15 million arabs in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip was aimed at halting four months 
of unrest and at preventing mass demonstrations by palestinians on 
wednesdays 12th anniversary of land day when israeli soldiers 
killed six arabs protesting land confiscation 
foreign relief workers were barred from entering the occupied 
lands thousands of police were mobilized tuesday evening to 
enforce curfews in arab towns in israel 
arabs reported that demonstrators took to the streets in some 
areas throwing rocks and gasoline bombs and that israeli troops 
fired at the curfew violators the eight arabs were wounded in the 
village of zaita 40 miles northwest of jerusalem the army and the 
palestine press service reported 
among the protesters reported wounded was 13yearold girl 
in ramallah small children tossed rocks at each other in the 
streets they called the game jews and arabs 
hundreds of protesters have been wounded since riots began dec 
8 in the west bank and gaza which israel captured from jordan and 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war the death toll stands at 119 
palestinians and one israeli soldier according to un figures 
defense minister yitzhak rabin and lt gen dan shomron 
israels military chief of staff threatened for the first time 
tuesday to close the territories for an extended period 
for now the decision to close the areas is for three days 
rabin said on israel radio but ive always said we have to 
adjust our measures to confront every eventuality 
in an israel television interview rabin said more than 4000 
palestinians arrested in the months of violence are being held at 
army detention centers he said that number included prisoners 
served with administrative detention orders 
closing the occupied lands is intended to quell the violence by 
imposing collective punishment on palestinians and to keep out 
journalists whose reports the israelis claim feed the rebellion 
although general access for journalists has been withdrawn us 
television pools were allowed into the west bank and gaza on 
tuesday and some individual journalists managed to get past 
roadblocks 
particularly harsh restrictions have been put on the gaza strip 
the rebellion began there and the 6milelong mediterranean coastal 
area is easier to isolate 
no human beings are on the streets said rashad al shawaa 
who was deposed by israel as mayor of gaza city in 1983 its 
like a cemetery the army announced over loudspeakers anyone who 
leaves their home will be shot 
he told the associated press by telephone he saw soldiers fire 
on a few palestinians who went out in his neighborhood 
shawaa said the telephone call was the first he had received in 
26 hours telephone service to gaza was cut monday and it mostly 
remained out tuesday night 
bernard mills the un relief and works agency director in 
gaza told un officials by radio you have 650000 people under 
house arrest 
unrwa cares for palestinian refugees in the territories about 
650000 palestinians live in the gaza strip and 850000 in the west 
bank 
foreign journalists asked the supreme court to overturn the 
order banning them from the territories the first in more than 20 
years of israeli occupation 
robert slater president of the foreign press association said 
it refused army offers of news pools but us television network 
pools went into gaza and the west bank with an army escort 
israel radio said the army made mass roundups of palestinians as 
soon as the territories were closed arresting 600 
according to the arabrun palestine press service 120 were 
jailed under special powers permitting six months of detention 
without trial the army confirmed making mass arrests but did not 
give numbers 
at west bank roadblocks troops turned away a un official and 
save the children director chris george despite an army 
announcement that the closure would not affect international relief 
workers the army refused comment 
both organizations said they would protest its a fulltime 
job now to raise our complaints with the israeli authorities 
said un spokesman bill lee 
george said half the 10 people on his agencys jerusalem staff 
were denied entry to the city 
an ap reporter saw soldiers force merchants in ramallah to close 
their shops and confiscate the identity cards of some the aim was 
to break the authority of the palestine liberation organization 
which ordered arabs to open their stores for three hours daily 
we wont allow another body to run things military 
government coordinator shmuel goren said on israel television 
israeli troops forcibly closed major west bank markets in 
jericho nablus jenin and ramallah as well as in gaza city said 
mona rishmawi of law in the service of man a human rights group 
founded by palestinian lawyers

army kept food trucks out of the city and when stores tried to 
open troops threw food on the ground and destroyed it i saw it

workers stayed home again tuesday in a region of 
the caucasus whose armenian majority is trying to force the soviet 
bureaucracy to reverse a decision it made about local rule 65 years 
ago 
my report today will be short izvestia correspondent p 
gutiontov wrote from stepanakert the largest city of the disputed 
nagornokarabakh region city enterprises are at standstill 
people are home 
about 75 percent of nagornokarabakhs 157000 people are ethnic 
armenians but the kremlin assigned it to neighboring azerbaijan in 
1923 most armenians are christians azeris the indigenous people 
of azerbaijan are predominantly moslem 
izvestia the government newspaper also gave the first 
breakdown of armenian and azeri casualties in feb 28 rioting in 
the city of sumgait in azerbaijan and denied reports that children 
were killed 
a curfew was imposed on sumgait after the riots but pravda the 
communist party daily said it was lifted tuesday because life in 
the city has returned to normal 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told a news 
briefing some workers in stepanakert stayed home and certain 
enterprises are not functioning or are partially not functioning 
telephone calls to stepanakert from moscow did not go through or 
were cut off 
izvestia also reported monday that residents of stepanakert 
stayed home dissident sources say the strike began last week but 
their reports could not be confirmed 
soviet officials who have announced a costly program to improve 
social and economic conditions in nagornokarabakh will not bend 
to pressure from activists to allow armenia to annex the region 
gerasimov said 
we believe that problems have to be solved on the basis of 
realism and without undue emotion gerasimov said one cannot 
solve these complex problems with demonstrations only 
we cannot solve the problem by mechanically transferring this 
region as some armenian officials want he said the more you 
study this problem the more you will see the whole thing is not as 
simple as that as merely saying nagornokarabakh must be part of 
armenia 
gerasimov said the situation had improved but not enough for the 
government to allow foreign journalists to travel there 
sporadic strikes and protests have been reported in 
nagornokarabakh since feb 13 the latest labor trouble is said to 
have begun last wednesday 
izvestia quoted investigators as confirming the previously 
announced death toll of 32 in the sumgait riot it said 26 of them 
were armenians and six were from azerbaijan previously officials 
had said the 32 dead were of various nationalities and that the 
rioting was not necessarily an ethnic dispute 
armenian activists had claimed the death toll was much higher 
and that most of the dead were armenians 
it has been firmly established with evidence that during the 
disorder in sumgait not one child suffered izvestia quoted 
investigators as saying there were not 400 or 500 deaths but 
exactly 32 people as said in a published statement by the soviet 
prosecutor included in these 32 were 26 armenians and six 
azerbaijanis 
armenian activists have claimed that small children were thrown 
from the windows of maternity hospitals during the riot 
izvestia said the strike would not help stepanakert residents 
and accused activists of lack of concern for the regions welfare 
its article tuesday and a report it published monday were part 
of a new more detailed look at the nagornokarabakh dispute 
soviet media are being encouraged under communist party chief 
mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost to be more open about 
social problems but initial reports on the nagornokarabakh 
dispute were slow in coming and lacked detail 
sovietskaya kultura said tuesday the governments plan for 
nagornokarabakh would cost about 640 million 
these millions which are so necessary now for restructuring 
the country is giving to karabakh it said in a frontpage 
article tracing the unrest to poor social and economic conditions 
moscow dissident tamara grigoryants said police broke up a 
demonstration monday evening in yerevan capital of soviet armenia 
by more than 50 people demanding freedom for jailed armenian 
activist paryur arikyan 
she said they carried saying we dont believe in 
perestroika a reference to gorbachevs effort to restructure 
soviet society

the house armed services committee voted deep 
cuts tuesday in president reagans request for star wars 
antimissile spending and his plan to put multiplewarhead mx 
missiles on western railroads 
the decision came shortly before the democraticcontrolled panel 
voted 484 approval of a bill authorizing the pentagon to spend 
299 billion in the fiscal year starting oct 1 
the overall pentagon budget had been set in december during 
negotiations between the white house and congress over a budget 
deficit reduction package 
the panel slashed to 37 billion reagans request for 45 
billion in star wars funds 
the panel also voted to approve 500 million for research into 
putting the mx aboard trains 300 million less than reagan had 
sought at the same time the panel increased reagans request for 
spending on the singlewarhead midgetman missile from 200 million 
to 500 million 
as it worked on the bill the committee also 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
voted 438 to spend 14 billion for a new trident submarine 
instead of using the money for two more aegisclass destroyers 
that vote reversed a decision last week by the seapower 
subcommittee 
voted 466 to permit the united states to sell aegisclass 
destroyers to japan as long as reagan certifies that the system is 
protected against espionage aegis is the navys secret hightech 
defense system for ships and the administration is considering 
selling four of the 12 billion ships to japan 
the star wars decision confirmed the budget choice made last 
week by the armed services research and development subcommittee 
and will result in a deep reduction from original plans the 37 
billion figure would mean that star wars spending next year would 
remain at about the current level 
last year pentagon budget plans called for seeking 62 billion 
in star wars money for fiscal 1989 but that was reduced to the 
45 billion level by defense secretary frank c carlucci as part 
of a package of reductions he ordered in response to a white 
housecongressional agreement in december that set next years 
defense budget at 299 billion 
that agreement has calmed the congressional debate about defense 
spending but opened new fights about how to best allocate the 
overall total 
the 37 billion figure for the strategic defense initiative as 
star wars is known formally was approved tuesday after the 
committee was unable to agree on four other proposed sdi amounts 
ranging from 31 billion up to the full 45 billion figure 
the committee later voted to overturn a decision by the research 
and development subcommittee which had halved the pentagons sdi 
budget request for research into an interceptor rocket that would 
be used to slam into soviet nuclear missiles at high speed to 
destroy them 
known as the spacebased interceptor the program is consuming 
an increasingly large share of the pentagons sdi budget plans 
next year call for spending 330 million on that program but the 
subcommittee had cut that in half because of fears that the 
technology is not as promising as other weapons that could be part 
of a defensive shield 
the dispute over the midgetman and the mx involves a pair of 
nuclear weapons that have been central to a sevenyearold fight 
over reagans plans for building up americas nuclear arsenal 
congress has approved building 50 of the mx weapons for 
deployment in landbased silos but the pentagon is now seeking 50 
more of the weapons and plans call for putting the second 50 aboard 
trains meantime the pentagon has been lukewarm toward the 
midgetman a weapon that has been a favorite of congressional 
critics of the mx 
carlucci told congress last month that he thought the midgetman 
should be eliminated but said he had included 200 million at the 
request of congress so the program could be kept alive until 
reagans successor makes a decision next year 
meantime carlucci said 800 million should be spent for 
research into the railbased version of the 10warhead mx 
the research and development subcommittee said last week that 
each weapon should be given 500 million and that subcommittee 
decision was ratified tuesday after several unsuccessful attempts 
to change it

three bombs exploded within 
minutes of each other tuesday in three movie houses spreading 
panic in the downtown cinema district and injuring two federal 
policemen and two other people officials said 
the officers were trying to deactivate one bomb when it exploded 
in the second row of the normandie theater on lavalle street bombs 
also hit the nearby atlas lavalle and sarmiento theaters police 
said 
a bomb was found at a fourth theater but experts defused it 
three other movie houses received telephoned bomb threats but 
searches turned up nothing police said 
the explosions caused panic along the street which is reserved 
for pedestrians only federal police chief juan angel pirker said 
theaters and businesses emptied tickettakers ran into the street 
shouting for ambulances 
leaflets scattered at one bombing site read oasmrp 
initials of a group that claimed responsibility for most of the 18 
bombings and bomb attempts in argentina this year it is not known 
what the initials stand for 
hurt the worst in tuesdays bombings was a police inspector who 
had one hand blown off officials at churruca hospital said the 
other policeman also was badly hurt they said 
the officials spoke on condition of anonymity 
two moviegoers a man and a woman were injured while watching 
the last emperor at the atlas lavalle police said the bomb 
exploded near the front of the theater where about 250 people were 
seated 
they the bombers placed the explosive devices in sites where 
they knew there were going to be civilians injured said pirker 
similar oasmrp leaflets were scattered earlier this month 
at the site of bombings in a downtown apartment building and a 
roman catholic church some reports suggest the bombings stem from 
a rightist terrorist group linked to rebel leader aldo rico a 
former lieutenant colonel 
last year rico led a brief easter week uprising at three army 
camps the mutineers demanded an end to prosecution of officers 
accused of human rights abuses during the 197683 military regime 
rico and other leaders of that rebellion and a similar one in 
january are held at magdalena military prison 60 miles south of 
buenos aires 
the supreme court meanwhile ordered freed four admirals accused 
of human rights abuses under the military regime at the naval 
mechanics school a notorious detention center in northern buenos 
aires 
the court ruled the four were among about 270 officers with the 
rank of brigadier general or below who could benefit from last 
years due obedience law passed by congress the law says only 
topranked officers who ordered human rights crimes now face 
prosecution not those of lower rank who obeyed orders

a convicted killer scheduled five times 
to die for murdering a sheriffs deputy won another lastminute 
reprieve tuesday by a 63 vote of the us supreme court which has 
heard but not decided a similar case 
attorneys for john henry selvage filed an appeal with the high 
court a day after an appeals court monday vacated a stay granted by 
a federal judge 
selvage was sentenced to die for the shooting death of harris 
county sheriffs deputy albert garza who was killed july 30 1979 
his 48th birthday garza was trying to prevent a houston jewelry 
store robbery but had not drawn his gun 
the appeal covered several issues but selvages strongest case 
for a reprieve stemmed from his use of the same argument the 
supreme court heard march 1 in texas inmate donald gene franklins 
case said attorney david cunningham 
franklins attorney argued that texas capital punishment law 
keeps jurors from giving full consideration to mitigating 
circumstances suggesting life in prison as more appropriate than 
the death penalty 
the supreme court granted a stay of execution to the 37yearold 
selvage after he was moved from death row at the ellis i unit 
outside huntsville to a cell near the death chamber at the walls 
unit in huntsville texas department of corrections spokesman 
charles brown said 
by a 63 vote the justices granted the stay pending action by 
the court on a formal appeal by selvage the dissenters were chief 
justice william h renquist and justices byron r white and sandra 
day oconner 
in february another texas inmate calvin williams won a stay 
from the supreme court about 90 minutes before he was to be 
executed he used the same argument as in the franklin case which 
the supreme court has not yet decided 
the scheduling of selvages execution on wednesday shortly 
after midnight marked the fifth time selvage faced lethal 
injection each time he won stays 
on monday the 5th us circuit court of appeals in new orleans 
vacated the stay granted to selvage on friday by us district 
judge norman black of houston 
the texas attorney generals office argued that black should not 
have granted a reprieve because the appellate court is 
reconsidering the appeal of another death row inmate from harris 
county leon rutherford king who like selvage questioned the 
selection of jurors during his trial

teachers unions are standing in the 
hallways and blocking up the doors of reform in places like 
chicago with troubled public schools secretary of education 
william j bennett said tuesday 
bennett who has said chicago schools are in an education 
meltdown toured two public schools there last wednesday at the 
invitation of jacqueline vaughn president of the chicago teachers 
union 
bennett said afterwards that two schools do not a system make 
facts remain facts and the evidence suggests very serious 
problems 
mrs vaughn responded that what stalls education reform are 
not teachers or teachers unions but the cutbacks in funds from 
his administration 
mr bennett appears to have a personal vendetta against our 
union because every time we challenge him to produce the socalled 
facts he throws around he insults us she continued 
in an interview with the associated press on tuesday bennett 
said teachers unions have been an impediment to school reform in 
some places 
he said the american federation of teachers has been more open 
to accountability and choice than its larger rival the national 
education association but he said aft affiliates like the one in 
chicago can be as intransigent and mindless as the nea 
we sat there together in a press conference and i said why 
dont you admit what everybody knows which is there are a lot of 
teachers who have no business in being in classrooms 
bennett said 
he said vaughn replied we dont think theres such a thing as 
an incompetent teacher theres only a teacher in need of 
assistance or help a sabbatical or something 
bennett called that just utter nonsense or drivel but thats 
the party line 
i was struck and kind of put off by the party line he said 
every time i met with the chicago teachers union every time they 
appeared they appeared as a committee and there were five or six 
of them and they would say these things which are obviously the 
approved way of speaking it was kind of scary 
theyre standing in the hallways and blocking up the doors of 
reform as is the bureaucracy there its an urban school situation 
and the children are suffering he said 
bennett added that the intransigence of special interests 
such as teacher unions remains the biggest obstacle toward improved 
schools 
mrs vaughn said bennetts comments show he is uninterested in 
fair and objective appraisals every system has good and bad in it 
but he seems to like to single out ours 
she also said the chicago union had a history of proposing 
innovative reforms

solicitor general charles fried said tuesday 
the resignations of two toplevel colleagues at the justice 
department are leading him to reconsider his future in the reagan 
administration 
this development implicates every sort of question fried 
said in the second of two interviews with the associated press 
the possibilities include my departure or that this is just a 
tempest in a teapot or many other things as well 
fried who represents the government in the supreme court said 
he learned about the resignations on monday the day before 
attorney general edwin meese was told 
i got a headsup a courtesy call to let me know in advance 
fried said of the departures 
deputy attorney general arnold burns and assistant attorney 
general william weld who heads the departments criminal division 
announced their resignations tuesday two personal assistants to 
each man also quit 
told that acquaintances had said he might join the pair in 
leaving fried replied they seem to know my mind better than i 
do 
he said he was home with the flu on tuesday and had a supreme 
court argument scheduled wednesday morning 
i want to get through tomorrow and then ive got to think it 
through fried said i dont know the significance of these 
departures 
once i get through tomorrow i plan to think it through he 
said in the first interview 
fried after the initial interview called back to stress that 
his departure was by no means the only possible outcome of his 
deliberations 
the 53yearold former harvard law school professor became 
solicitor general in late 1985 succeeding rex lee 
fried has been closely aligned with conservative legal theorists 
who have risen to power under meese 
but one source familiar with events leading to the resignations 
said fried had been working with burns on naming james m spears to 
head the civil division earlier this month when they were surprised 
to learn in a newspaper that meeses ultraconservative counselor 
william bradford reynolds engineered the selection of another 
department offcial john bolton for the post 
the resignations came amid a yearold criminal investigation of 
meese but there was nothing to link them directly to any new 
developments in that probe department sources said 
one source said the precipitating factor at this time was an 
internal fight over the successor to stephen trott as associate 
attorney general the departments no 3 post 
burns unsuccessfully supported weld for this post according to 
this source weld was unwilling to stay when he was passed over for 
the promotion in part because his two predecessors as criminal 
division chiefs lowell jensen and trott both had won the same 
promotion 
this source said weld believed he was being punished for 
disagreeing on legal issues with meese and his top aides 
burns was angered to learn that reynolds has gotten meeses 
private approval to name as associate attorney general frank 
keating the assistant treasury secretary who supervises the 
customs service and the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
another department source said however these fights might not 
have had so much significance were meese not under the cloud of a 
continuing criminal investigation

the senate foreign relations committee voted 
126 tuesday to approve a measure intended to bar future presidents 
from changing the current us view of the meaning of the 
mediumrange missile treaty with the soviet union 
rep daniel evans rwash called the action a gratuitous 
slap at president reagan and said it might cause him and other 
gop treaty supporters to vote against the pact 
in a separate development sen claiborne pell dri chairman 
of the foreign relations panel said another treaty problem has 
been solved with administration assurances that the pact does ban 
mediumrange weapons based on such futuristic or exotic technology 
as laser rays and particle beam generators 
the senate armed services committee had identified the issue of 
futristic weapons as one which had to be fully settled before the 
full senate acted on the pact 
earlier tuesday the senate met in unusual secret session to 
review conflicting intelligence estimates on the size of the soviet 
mediumrange ss20 missile force 
but conservatives who called for the meeting to air claims that 
the soviets are hiding a large force of ss20s said few if any 
minds had been changed about the merits of the new treaty 
eliminating such nuclear weapons 
the partisan dispute in the foreign relations committee over the 
meaning of treaty language stems from the controversy that 
developed after the reagan administration asserted in 1986 that a 
new reading of the negotiating record of the 1972 antiballistic 
missile or abm treaty permitted the deployment of a star wars 
strategic defense system despite the widely held view that the pact 
banned exotic missiledefense systems 
the democratic sponsors of the language added by the committee 
to the treaty said it would block future presidents from changing 
the meaning of the pact on grounds that the senate had not been 
fully informed about the contents of the negotiating record or had 
otherwise been misled 
sen jesse helms rnc an outspoken opponent of the inf pact 
unexpectedly voted for the measure after sen alan cranston 
dcalif agreed to add language stating that a commonly accepted 
treaty interpretation cannot be changed except by the senates 
ratification of a subsequent treaty or by enactment of a law by 
both houses of congress 
sen richard lugar rind told reporters later he believed 
helms acted out of a devious strategy intended to prolong the 
dispute and perhaps to torpedo the treaty itself 
helms denied that saying that in its previous form the measure 
had been unconstitutional 
lugar also accused the democratic sponsors of the proposal of 
a deliberate bid to embarrass the president adding it is 
certain to cause a fierce fight on the senate floor 
evans told reporters i think this has made it a partisan 
situation its a gratuitous slap at the president 
no one has worked harder for this treaty than me evans 
said but now im going to seriously take a look as to whether i 
will vote for it on the floor 
the secret session the first held by the senate since october 
1986 was convened to discuss allegations the soviets may try to 
hide a covert force of more than 300 ss20 mediumrange missiles 
after the treaty banning such weapons goes into effect 
i think they heard some things they hadnt heard before 
said sen jesse helms rnc who has long pursued the theory that 
the soviet ss20 force is far larger than the 650 missiles the 
soviets declare they have 
but sen steven symms ridaho told reporters i would be 
surprised if any minds were changed 
i dont know if it changed any minds said sen malcolm 
wallop rwyo when asked to describe the threehour secret 
session held for security reasons in the old senate chamber last 
used on a regular basis in 1859 
the treaty has a political life which is in large part 
independent of its own terms wallop said adding that many 
senators fear explosive political results inside the north atlantic 
treaty organization were the treaty to be denied senate 
ratification 
the inadequacies of this treaty are probably tolerable for a 
majority who feel that the political consequences in europe far 
outweigh concern about the failures and weaknesses in the treaty 
wallop said 
symms said he doubts if more than a dozen or so senators will 
vote against the inf pact 
but symms wallop and other conservatives said the debate over 
the mediumrange missile treaty has set the stage for a far more 
divisive and uncertain battle over a treaty making deep reduction 
in intercontionental nuclear arms 
inf is the appetizer for the main course the start treaty 
symms said 
start an acronym for strategic arms limitation talks would be 
far more significant militarily and provide far more incentive for 
the soviets to cheat symms contended 
the senate foreign relations committee is scheduled to vote 
wednesday on whether to send the mediumrange missile pact to the 
full senate 
the senate armed services committee voted 182 on monday to 
recommend the treaty be approved 
but in doing so it ignited a new controversy declaring it was 
not clear from the text of the treaty or the negotiating record 
whether the accord covers futuristic hightechnology weapons such 
as those using laser rays or particle beam generators

a judge on tuesday sentenced an exconrail 
engineer to five years in prison for driving three locomotives into 
the path of a passenger train killing 16 people in amtraks worst 
accident 
although rick l gates 33 of essex md admitted smoking 
marijuana on the train before the jan 4 1987 wreck baltimore 
county circuit judge joseph p murphy said he did not believe the 
engineer was under the influence of the drug 
but what he did in terms of failure to follow procedures was 
to show us that he didnt give a damn he just didnt care the 
judge said 
gates pleaded guilty feb 16 to a single misdemeanor 
manslaughter count and admitted in a statement of facts to failing 
to make several safety checks that might have prevented the 
accident 
i would like you to know i accept full responsibility gates 
told the judge i will never be able to forget 
gates and family members in the courtroom wept as excerpts from 
five statements from victims relatives were read 
in a plea bargain 16 original misdemeanor charges of 
manslaughter by locomotive were consolidated into a single charge 
reducing gates possible prison time from 80 years to five 
murphy also fined gates the maximum 1000 gates was taken into 
custody immediately after sentencing he could be eligible for 
parole after serving about 18 months states attorney sandra 
oconnor said 
mrs oconnor asked murphy to sentence gates to the maximum 
allowable term while his public defender donna shearer asked for 
a twoyear prison term plus mandatory rehabilitation 
the judge said no matter what i do we are at the mercy of 
people who will simply not behave properly behind the wheel of an 
automobile or at the stick of an airplane theres nothing i can do 
that will deter those people 
prosecutors accepted the plea bargain after examining vehicular 
manslaughter cases from several maryland counties and finding that 
none of the sentences were longer than five years mrs oconnor 
said 
dr roger horn whose daughter ceres was killed in the crash 
said he did not know what sentence would have been appropriate he 
said he was angry that no railroad safety legislation has been 
approved by congress since the crash that crime is right up 
there with mr gates he said 
mrs oconnor said her office would join the victims families 
in lobbying the general assembly next year to increase the severity 
of the crime 
ms shearer said she was disappointed in the sentence but 
doubted an appeal would be filed 
more than 175 people were injured when gates missed a track 
signal and drove three linked conrail locomotives in front of the 
660passenger amtrak train traveling about 120 mph the impact 
trapped riders in the wreckage for hours in bitter cold 
gates was unhurt and his brakeman edward cromwell suffered a 
broken leg 
the plea bargain was announced just before a trial at which 
cromwell was expected to testify that he and gates fabricated a 
story to cover up their drug use on the train 
tests performed on blood samples taken from both men after the 
accident showed traces of marijuana and possibly alcohol in their 
systems the national transportation safety board said 
a january ruling by the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
against postcrash drug testing is under appeal to the us supreme 
court

although vice president george bush is running 
virtually alone for the republican presidential nomination it will 
be at least a couple of weeks before he can gain enough delegates 
for a majority at the gop convention 
going into tuesdays primary in connecticut bush had 788 of the 
1139 delegates needed to win the republican nomination another 
250 delegates most of whom are the remnants of the presidential 
campaigns of sen bob dole and rep jack kemp now are counted as 
uncommitted 
if bush were to pick up all of those delegates he still would 
be 101 short of the number needed to win the nomination 
the connecticut primary could give bush 35 delegates and he 
could gain 47 more next week in wisconsin minnesota holds the next 
republican event yielding national convention delegates when the 
party there holds its state convention on april 15 
that convention where 24 delegates are at stake would be the 
earliest opporunity for bush to go over the top 
however if bush gains none of the currently uncommitted 
delegates his road to the nomination will be a bit longer 
assuming he wins every delegate that can be won from now on bush 
would cross the threshold on may 3 when ohio indiana and the 
district of columbia hold their primaries 
bushs only challenger is former television evangelist pat 
robertson who has 17 delegates and has all but quit campaigning

president oscar arias met tuesday 
with three guatemalan guerrilla leaders and said he would try to 
help arrange new negotiations between guatemalas government and 
leftist rebels 
he told reporters after the meeting that he would intercede with 
president vinicio cerezo of guatemala to see if negotiations could 
be resumed 
it has been proven that peace and democracy can be reached 
through dialogue arias said 
cerezos government and the rebels held their only peace talks 
in 27 years of fighting last october in madrid spain 
those negotiations were in line with the peace plan signed in 
guatemala in august by the presidents of the five central american 
countries costa rica guatemala el salvador nicaragua and 
honduras arias was the author of the plan and was awarded the 1987 
nobel peace prize 
arias met for more than an hour with rebel leaders rodrigo 
asturias luis becker and hector nuila asturias is the son of 
miguel angel asturias who won the nobel prize for literature in 
1971 
asturias told reporters the rebels proposed another negotiating 
session to be held in costa rica next month with archbishop 
prospero penados del barrio the roman catholic prelate of 
guatemala as mediator 
penados del barrio agreed earlier this year to the guerrillas 
proposal that he serve as mediator but cerezos government has 
rebuffed calls for a resumption of the talks 
we place no conditions on these talks instead we offer an 
open agenda to discuss the problems of guatemala and from there 
look for a political solution for our country with the 
participation of all social sectors asturias told a news 
conference 
he is a commander of the guatemalan national revolutionary 
union a coalition of three guerrilla groups that claim a total of 
3500 combatants

while the arizona senate heard testimony 
about an allegedly improper loan to gov evan mechams car 
dealership the governors son announced tuesday that the family 
has been forced to sell the business to avert financial ruin 
the confusion and questions this avalanche of negative 
publicity has caused has forced my family to come to this 
decision to sell mecham pontiac while the condition of the company 
remains solvent and salable dennis mecham told a news conference 
at the dealership in suburban glendale 
dennis mecham said sales have decreased dramatically for over a 
year as the result of mechams political battle and its effect on 
consumers the dealership was sold for about 4 million to a 
neighboring auto dealer he said 
dennis mecham testified last week that the mecham car dealership 
was on sure footing last july when his father arranged an 80000 
loan to the business from a protocol fund the prosecution has 
sought to show that mecham pontiac was in desperate straits and 
needed the money the governor denies this 
prosecutors said the sale would have no effect on mechams 
impeachment tral at this time 
mecham attorney jerris leonard said he was sure mecham would 
reap a substantial amount of money from the sale although not 
as much if he had sold before the political crisis 
leonard rested his case late tuesday on the 80000 loan count 
and the prosecution said it would call at least one rebuttal 
witness before closing its evidence on the charge wednesday 
senators then would decide whether to vote on mechams guilt or 
innocence of the two charges already considered or move on to 
evidence on the third and last count 
meanwhile a defense witness who testified that the 80000 loan 
was legal but stupid was threatened with contempt of court 
the warning to political consultant and lawyer robert lecuyer 
from presiding officer frank x gordon came at mechams impeachment 
trial as lecuyer tried to blunt a piercing crossexamination by 
reading sections of another witness earlier testimony about which 
he had not been questioned 
lecuyer continued his discourse even after gordon the chief 
justice of the arizona supreme court ruled him out of order 
mr lecuyer you see this thing in my hand gordon asked 
pointing his gavel at the witness 
i have been a judge for 26 years sir i have never had to rap 
this gavel and find a lawyer in contempt but you are tempting me 
i am properly admonished said lecuyer 
earlier lecuyer was admonished for trying to read a lengthy 
statement to defuse a prosecution disclosure that he had been 
reprimanded by the arizona bar for unethical conduct in 1979 and 
voluntarily stopped practicing law for three years 
he admitted that he improperly borrowed 5500 from a clients 
trust fund which he said was in lieu of his fee 
and your defense was that you were borrowing at a higher rate 
of interest than it could otherwise get prosecutor paul eckstein 
asked to laughter from the gallery 
part of mechams defense on the charge that he misused the 
protocol fund by loaning 80000 to his mecham pontiac dealership 
was that he borrowed the money at a higher rate of interest than it 
was receiving at the bank 
asked by mecham lawyer jerris leonard whether he knew of any law 
that made the governors loan illegal lecuyer replied i know 
of no such law 
lecuyer testified i told the governor when i found out that 
it was stupid i thought it was legal but stupid 
mecham contends the protocol fund was not public money because 
it was raised by his inaugural committee to pay off campaign debts 
when state law barred that use the money was placed in a fund 
for such uses as the governors trips and entertainment to promote 
arizonas image 
lecuyer who was hired by mecham to analyze laws relating to 
the public funds issue said he concluded that the money raised by 
the inaugural committee remained private and in mechams control 
the status of the funds is they are purely private funds of a 
private unincorporated organization in that associations bank 
account he said 
eckstein noted that the chairman of mechams inaugural 
committee william long has said his committee ceased to exist 
after its funds were transferred into the protocol fund 
lecuyer said he felt long was not qualified to make that 
decision which he said he considered a legal opinion 
mecham who testified earlier this week on the loan charge also 
is accused of thwarting investigation of an alleged death threat on 
a grand jury witness and concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
the campaign loan for which mecham faces felony charges and a 
criminal trial april 21 is scheduled to become the focus of the 
impeachment trial later this week 
on tuesday maricopa county superior court judge michael ryan 
rejected two defense motions to dismiss charges against mecham in 
the criminal case 
the defense had claimed mecham was being selectively prosecuted 
and prosecuted under the wrong law the judge also refused to 
separate mechams case from that of a codefendant his brother 
willard who was his 1986 campaign treasurer 
mecham the first us governor impeached in six decades also 
faces a recall election may 17

the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co stirred up the waters around texaco inc on tuesday saying it 
will seek federal approval to acquire up to 15 percent of the oil 
giants stock 
kohlberg kravis which has carried out some of the largest 
leveraged buyouts in us history said an affiliate already has 
acquired 1195 million texaco shares or about 49 percent of the 
roughly 242 million shares outstanding 
a statement said the shares had been purchased some months ago 
in the open market 
at its the white plains ny headquarters texacos response 
was upbeat 
kohlberg kravis roberts has in past situations demonstrated an 
ability to be a constructive shareholder which recognizes the 
importance of building value for the long term the company said 
in a statement we have no indication that their intentions with 
texaco are any different 
kohlberg kravis directed queries to kekst and co a public 
relations firm where ruth pachman declined further comment 
investors responded enthusiastically to kohlberg kraviss 
anouncement in nationwide trading of new york stock 
exchangelisted issues texaco jumped 325 a share from the 
previous days close to 48 
kohlberg kravis became the fourth party to express interest in 
texaco which is to emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy court 
reorganization early next month 
financier carl c icahn is the white plains nybased 
companys largest shareholder holding 148 percent of its shares 
oilman t boone pickens also has sought federal regulatory 
permission to buy up to 15 percent of texacos shares 
in addition getty petroleum co an independent marketer of 
petroleum products that was born of texacos 1984 getty oil co 
acquisition has made a similar filing 
the texacogetty oil deal started the nations third largest oil 
company on the road to bankruptcy court 
in november 1985 a houston jury ruled texaco had improperly 
interfered with a move by houstonbased pennzoil co to acquire 
part of getty then bought getty itself the jury awarded pennzoil 
1053 billion in damages 
while the figure was reduced by 2 billion on appeal it still 
stood at 103 billion including interest when texaco filed for 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last april 
the company said it was forced to do so to avoid having to post 
an 11 billion bond while appealing the houston jurys decision 
last week a us bankruptcy court judge approved a 
reorganization plan that will bring texaco out of chapter 11 
protection as part of that plan pennzoil agreed to accept a 3 
billion payment to settle its damage claim

house negotiators reached agreement in 
principle late tuesday on a 50 million package of humanitarian 
aid for nicaraguas contra rebels and for children injured in that 
countrys civil war 
as part of the deal speaker jim wright would agree to give 
fair consideration to any future request president reagan might 
make for new military aid for the rebels if the peace process 
should break down said rep david bonior dmich 
the package was worked out in a negotiating session between 
wright and house minority leader robert michel rill and final 
details were to be approved by both sides at a meeting wednesday 
morning 
the rules committee late tuesday approved ground rules for 
bringing the package to the floor on wednesday and approval by a 
bipartisan majority was expected if no further snags developed 
i think we have an agreement in principle said rep dick 
cheney rwyo 
the tentative agreement would send about 27 million monthly in 
food clothing medicine and shelter to the rebels over the next 
six months communications gear and other expenses would push the 
total sixmonth rebel aid package to 20 million said bonior 
leader of a democratic task force on the contra issue 
an identical ammount would go into a new program to care for 
children injured in the sevenyear civil war he said 
it also would provide 10 million to finance a verification 
commission to ensure adherence to a ceasefire worked out last week 
between the contras and the leftist managua government not 
included in the 50 million total is additional money to transport 
the aid 
the money would be administered by the state departments agency 
for international development bonior said 
in addition wright dtexas would write a letter to reagan and 
michel assuring the president of a chance to submit a proposal for 
new military aid if the peace process becomes derailed 
the speaker would promise fair treatment of such a package 
but would retain control over the precise timing of any final vote 
and the rules under which the package would be considered bonior 
said the verification commission would also have a substantial 
say in whether new military aid is justified he said 
republicans have said they do not trust the sandinistas to 
fulfill promises made as part of the 60day ceasefire agreement 
reached in talks with the rebels last week at sapoa nicaragua 
they had wanted a guaranteed speedy vote in congress on future 
military aid to put pressure on managua to live up to those 
agreements which include amnesty and restoration of civil 
liberties 
earlier white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the amounts 
mentioned were agreeable to the administration 
the issue is not money but how fast we can get it to help 
assure the survival of the contra rebels as a fighting force he 
said we want it as fast as we can get it 
the money would keep supplies flowing to the rebels as they wait 
out the continuing negotiations over a longterm truce while based 
in ceasefire zones inside nicaragua the aid would flow at a rate 
comparable to that provided before feb 29 when the last us 
support ran out 
any new aid for the contras would have to conform to the 
requirements of the cease fire reached last week that agreement 
said the contras would receive only humanitarian aid and that the 
aid would be routed through neutral organizations the cia has 
delivered past us aid supplies to the rebels

the proapartheid conservative 
party extended its series of recent political victories by winning 
a special election tuesday to fill a vacant seat in parliaments 
white house of assembly 
conservative candidate corne mulder received 8437 votes to 
4726 for boy geldenhuys of the governing national party in the 
balloting in rural randfontein district 
the seat became vacant jan 13 when mulders father connie 
mulder died of heart and kidney failure the elder mulder had 
captured the seat for the conservatives in the national whitesonly 
election last may 
tuesdays lopsided vote was a further indication of the 
conservative partys growing support especially among rural whites 
president pw bothas national party holds 133 seats in the 
whites 178seat house of assembly conservatives 23 and the 
antiapartheid progressive federal party 17 with five seats held by 
minor parties or independents 
there are three separate chambers in the whitedominated 
parliament with the mixedrace chamber having 78 seats and the 
asian chamber 45 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
the conservatives won two special parliamentary elections on 
march 2 in rural white districts similar to randfontein which is 
50 miles west of johannesburg 
in the national elections in may the conservatives won 26 
percent of the votes and they are expected to gain ground on the 
national party in nationwide municipal elections in october the 
national party has governed south africa since 1948 
the conservatives oppose all concessions to the black majority 
and say botha is capitulating to blacks and international pressure 
bothas party has said it seeks gradual race reform that 
eventually would give blacks a say in national politics but with 
the whites maintaining ultimate control 
the progressive federal party has been losing support in recent 
years and did not enter a candidate in tuesdays election

jesse jackson drew one in five white votes 
tuesday in connecticuts democratic primary far more than in 1984 
but too few to deny gov michael dukakis a big win exit polls said 
jacksons white support up from about 5 percent four years ago 
was bolstered by a nearly unanimous black vote wnbctv and abc 
news polls said wnbc said jackson drew 18 percent of the white 
vote abc said 22 percent 
but wnbc reported only onefifth of the connecticut democrats 
said the nation was ready to elect a black president and abc found 
that a third of democrats said they would abandon the party and 
vote for george bush if jackson were nominated 
abc poll analyst john brennan noted that jacksons share of the 
white vote was about the same in massachusetts and rhode island and 
greater in vermont early this month before jacksons victory 
saturday in the michigan caucuses 
theres been a misconception that jackson has made some kind 
of substantial breakthrough with the white vote brennan said 
i dont think thats happened 
both the abc and wnbc polls said jacksons white backers were 
mostly liberal and welleducated rather than bluecollar workers 
dukakis the governor of neighboring massachusetts won all 
demographic groups except blacks and 60 percent of the democrats 
including a third of those who voted for jackson said they believe 
he will be the nominee 
but the nbc poll of 1700 voters also found some weakness in 
dukakis support 45 percent of those who voted for him said they 
wished there were other candidates running said poll director 
laurily epstein 
theres good news for him hes swept all groups except 
blacks she said in a telephone interview but theres 
disquieting news in that its not enthusiastic support 
the abc poll however found that 79 percent of the democrats 
said they would vote for dukakis if he were the nominee against 
bush only 52 percent of democrats said they would vote for jackson 
if he were nominated and 33 percent said the nomination of jackson 
would cause them to back the republican 
nbc said there was a hint of trouble for bush forty percent of 
republican voters did not think he has told the full story of the 
irancontra affair and they tended to support him less strongly 
epstein said 
among those for whom its an issue its hurting him an 
indication of a potential trouble spot in the general election she 
said 
still bush was viewed favorably by 75 percent of the republican 
voters and unfavorably by 18 percent the wnbc poll said dukakis 
had the best such rating among democrats 70 percent favorable to 
10 percent unfavorable 
jackson was viewed favorably by about half the democratic voters 
and unfavorably by a third while gore was viewed favorably by 40 
percent and unfavorably by a quarter only one in seven gore 
supporters think he will be the partys nominee wnbc said 
jackson improved his showing among black democrats as well as 
whites winning 90 percent of the black vote compared to 69 percent 
in 1984 nbc said though just 20 percent of democrats said the 
nation is ready to elect a black president that was up from 10 
percent in 1984 
abc polled 1277 voters in connecticut brennan said the margin 
of sampling error was about 5 percentage points wnbcs was about 3 
points

jesse jackson who finished behind regional 
favorite michael dukakis in tuesdays connecticut primary will 
meet wednesday with the front rank of washingtons democratic 
establishment in a summit session 
the meeting comes one day after democratic rival sen albert 
gore jr criticized him sharply for a complete and total lack 
of the experience needed to be president 
gore took the negative tack tuesday in a departure from the 
general practice of jackson opponents avoiding public criticism of 
him 
dukakis who regained his delegate lead over jackson with his 
nearly 21 connecticut win refused on tuesday to say anything 
negative about the civil rights leader 
and the most prominent noncandidate new york gov mario cuomo 
said it was wrong to talk of a stop jackson movement 
jackson arrived in washington late tuesday to begin a series of 
private meetings with leading figures in the partys establishment 
which has been in turmoil since his smashing victory over dukakis 
in the michigan caucuses over the weekend 
facing the possibility that jackson could win the presidential 
nomination and be the first black ever to head the ticket 
democrats have been keeping telephone lines busy with private 
conversations about what the partys course should be 
exit polls indicated jackson drew one in five white votes 
tuesday in connecticuts democratic primary far more than in 1984 
but too few to stop dukakis from rolling up a big win he won a 
nearly unanimous black vote according to polls by abc and wnbctv 
in new york 
but wnbc said only onefifth of all democrats said the nation 
was ready to elect a black president and abc found that a third of 
democrats said they would abandon the party and vote for george 
bush if jackson were nominated 
the washington meeting wednesday was set up by john white a 
former party chairman even before the michigan caucuses 
jackson showed an interest in meeting with the party regulars 
and talking about the parts of the political world he might not be 
familiar with white said 
invited for the breakfast are such big washington names as clark 
clifford sol linowitz harry mcpherson richard moe and clifford 
alexander 
this did not start out as a summit said ann lewis an 
adviser to jackson the original idea was to get jesse together 
with the washington establishment to listen to them talk about 
issues and policies and then to answer any questions they might 
have about him 
also on hand will be state democratic officials charles 
whitehead chairman of the florida democratic party confirmed he 
will attend 
white strongly condemned any notion this meeting was designed to 
slow down jacksons campaign with appeals concerning the greater 
good of the party 
it would be a serious serious mistake for this party for 
anybody to participate in a stop jackson movement white said 
as the meetings were slated the attacks on jackson began 
in new york gore went sharply negative on the other southerner 
in the race 
i have sharp disagreements with jesse jackson the tennessee 
senator said i have talked about his complete and total lack 
of experience in the national government he hasnt served a single 
day in the national government or had a single days experience in 
foreign policy 
answering questions after a speech to the conference of 
presidents of major american jewish organizations gore denied that 
he has been afraid to criticize jackson and took him on on the 
middle east 
i also cannot disagree more with jesse jacksons views on many 
foreign policy issues gore said i categorically reject his 
notion that theres a moral equivalance between israel and the plo 
and i am dismayed by his embrace of arafat and castro 
in contrast dukakis would not criticize jackson in any way 
refusing to answer a question on whether he considers jackson 
qualified to be president 
im not going to comment on that thats something the people 
of this country are going to have to decide dukakis said while 
campaigning in connecticut in the last analysis theyre going 
to have to decide which one of us of all the candidates has the 
strength the values and the experience to lead this country 
he also refused to outline any differences on issues with 
jackson something he has done repeatedly with the other candidates 
that is a question which i have consistently refused to 
answer because what im going to do is to take my message to the 
american people positively confidently with hope with 
optimism dukakis said i assume he will do the same and the 
other candidates will do the same the more positive the tone of 
the campaign as far as im concerned the better for all of us 
and for the ultimate goal which is the election of a progressive 
democrat 
cuomo said the democratic party is not in a quandary if jackson 
becomes the first black man ever to head the national ticket 
i reject the suggestion that it somehow presents us with a 
dilemma if jesse jackson wins said the new york democrat as 
ive said before the person who gets the most votes should be the 
candidate and all talk of introducing somebody to stop gore to 
stop dukakis or to stop jackson thats all equally wrong 
cuomo had a oneword answer to the question of whether jackson 
could win the general election yes 
jacksons victory in michigan put a new focus on the meetings on 
wednesday 
the meeting has ballooned in size and importance lewis 
said after jacksons michigan victory 
democratic national committee chairman paul kirk who recently 
praised jackson for his positive campaign style and message was 
not part of the group of mostly former party officials who were 
invited 
there was speculation in washington that some of the party 
leaders objective in meeting with jackson was to tell him they do 
not believe he could win the general election if he were nominated 
lewis ridiculed that notion saying that jackson had asked for 
the meeting she said that such speculation comes from those not 
invited to the meeting and who do not understand the current 
political situation

a group that sponsors meetings for 
recovering alcoholics voted against buying an abandoned schoolhouse 
tuesday after wary park township officials imposed nearly two dozen 
restrictions 
the rules would have prohibited members from gathering outside 
on the 4acre property which includes soccer and softball fields 
and a playground and would have limited the number of cars on the 
premises to 35 
those two stipulations were the ones most bothersome to the 
holland alano association said spokesman donald hann 
we cannot and we will not turn away people seeking help 
because they happen to arrive in the 36th car said hann whose 
association provides meeting space for 250 to 300 people in six 
groups including alcoholics anonymous and alanon 
directors of the nonprofit organization had planned to buy the 
former ventura school a vacant fourroom building in a rural area 
six miles north of holland because its lease on a decaying 
warehouse expires may 1 
the holland alano association finds it impossible to purchase 
the ventura school because of the onerous and unfair restrictions 
placed on the use of the premises by the parkship township planning 
commission the group said in a statement after meeting tuesday 
night 
the rules which included a ban on alcoholic beverages and 
mood altering substances were imposed monday night by the 
ottawa county townships planning commission on a specialuse 
permit sought by the association 
several homeowners had contended the presence of the 
organization would destroy the peaceful character of their 
neighborhood 
i still dont feel it belongs in a quiet residential area 
said carol vaniwaarden its too bad they need a place to go and 
they are a necessary organization but they should be in an area 
where theres more activity 
hann said the alano association must begin searching for a new 
building immediately 
we thought an abandoned schoolhouse in the country would be 
ideal for us but i guess we were wrong he said

more opposition is that good for him its good to have a 
primary said thompson speaking to reporters on air force two

democratic convention that is about to come bush told the

the roman catholic church on tuesday 
called for gen manuel antonio noriega to resign and offered to act 
as a mediator between the strongman and opponents demanding his 
ouster 
a church spokesman said archbishop marcos a mcgrath had talked 
with both sides and received a positive impression that a 
solution could be found to the agonizing crisis that has gripped 
panama for more than a month 
in other developments tuesday 
a general strike continued for the ninth day with shopowners 
keeping their stores closed despite a violent crackdown against 
government opponents on monday 
the us helicopter carrier okinawa passed through the panama 
canal on its way to its home port in san diego the us defense 
department described the passage as routine but noriega called 
the passage a threat and an agression 
noriega said in a speech tuesday night that he would not be 
vanquished by what he said was an imperialist plot against him 
in washington panamanian ambassador juan b sosa speaking on 
behalf of ousted president eric arturo delvalle asked the united 
states to send a military force to remove noriega head of the 
defense forces were asking the international community to 
help sosa said were paying the price but weve got no 
weapons give us weapons 
the call for noriegas resignation marked the first time the 
church had made its stance public last week church officials 
privately urged noriega under indictment in the united states on 
drug trafficking charges to step down 
on monday troops firing shotguns tear gas and water cannon 
smashed a demonstration by thousands of antigovernment marchers in 
panama city 
afterward troops raided the marriott hotel which serves as the 
headquarters of panamas opposition and the foreign press 
about 20 opposition leaders and ten foreign journalists were 
arrested the journalists and most of the opposition leaders were 
released tuesday although carlos gonzalez de la lastra a founder 
and director of the national civic crusade was still missing 
the crusade is a coalition of about 200 business professional 
labor and political groups that has been seeking noriegas removal 
since last june 
president reagans chief spokesman expressed outrage at mondays 
action by noriegas troops 
we are all angry at this latest demonstration at people being 
beaten and threatened spokesman marlin fitzwater said adding 
that the noriega regime is showing its true colors 
the united states has imposed sanctions on panamas government 
and supported efforts by delvalle to freeze panamanian funds in 
us banks 
eight of the foreign journalists arrested monday night were 
taken to a military intelligence center in panama city and held for 
three hours two other journalists ignacio medrano of cbs and nbc 
cameraman domingo rex of mexico city were arrested separately 
witnesses said 
noriega told a solidarity with panama conference tuesday 
night that the united states had spent more than 100 million in 
the effort to topple him 
but with all the gold in the world they have not been able to 
bring this people or this commander or these defense forces to 
their knees he said shaking his fist to wild applause 
delegates from about 25 latin american and caribbean countries 
attended the conference but few represented governments 
a spokeswoman at the marine traffic office of the panama canal 
said the helicopter carrier okinawa passed through the canal 
tuesday afternoon and was anchored at rodman naval base a us 
facility she said she did not know whether it was loading or 
unloading anything 
the church agreed to intercede in panamas crisis at the request 
of president oscar arias of costa rica prime minister felipe 
gonzalez of spain and former presidents carlos andres perez of 
venezuela and daniel oduber of costa rica 
monsignor oscar brown the auxiliary bishop of panama city said 
mcgrath received their request monday and immediately began 
contacting all the parties involved including noriega and 
opposition leaders 
but brown noted that the opposition demonstration was broken up 
in the precise moments when we were pursuing the first steps of 
this initiative 
he said representatives of the civic crusade who have been 
contacted have responded favorably 
in a statement to reporters during browns news conference the 
church said a committee of bishops met with noriega on thursday and 
asked him to resign 
last month noriega engineered delvalles dismissal and 
installed a new chief executive manuel solis palma the civic 
crusade and the united states continue to recognize delvalle as 
panamas legitimate president 
earlier tuesday ricardo arias calderon the president of the 
opposition christian democratic party said the government had 
reacted to the request for church mediation as if it just doesnt 
give a damn 
referring to mondays violence arias calderon said they are 
responding to this initiative by simply going ahead in their 
repressive manner and doing it dramatically so nobody misses the 
point

latin america urged the united states 
on tuesday to end its economic blockade of panama while 
encouraging panama at the same time to make its democracy more 
effective 
the 26 member nations of the latin american economic system 
ended a twoday emergency conference convened at panamas request 
by condemning the us economic measures as contrary to 
international law and the charters of the united nations and the 
organization of american states 
the nations said they were opposed to foreign intervention in 
panama and asked washington to honor a treaty which turns full 
control of the panama canal over to panama in 1999 
we urge the us government to revoke immediately the coercive 
measures it has adopted against panama organization members said 
in a final threepage communique released late tuesday 
we reaffirm the sovereign right of all nations to decide their 
own economic social and political destiny in peace and liberty 
free from foreign pressure aggression and threats 
the organization based in caracas was founded in 1976 as an 
economic forum for latin american countries 
us economic action against panama is aimed at forcing the 
removal of gen manuel antonio noriega as chief of his nations 
defense forces and as de facto ruler of panama noriega is under 
indictment in the united states as a drug trafficker and 
moneylaunderer charges he denies 
the reagan administration has imposed economic sanctions and has 
backed moves by former panamanian president eric arturo delvalle to 
freeze panamanian accounts in us banks the united states still 
recognizes delvalle as president although he was ousted by noriega 
the latin american economic system took note of a promise by 
panama to deepen its democratic system 
the group said a request for economic aid by panamas 
cashstarved government will be considered with a spirit of 
solidarity by economic system members 
individual delegates clearly separated their support for the 
principle of selfdetermination from their position regarding 
noriega 
we have not come to defend a regime or even less a person who 
has been insubordinate to civil and constitutional authority 
perus foreign minister allan wagner told delegates tuesday 
our solidarity is with the people of panama 
he called for an end to panamas political crisis through free 
elections and the removal of any obstacles that prevent this clear 
expression of the will of the people of panama

nation was fully committed to deepening panamas democratic 
system 
mexico and venezuela were among the individual nations monday 
that indicated their opposition to outside interference in panamas 
affairs without specifically mentioning the united states by name

more than two dozen kurds burned on their faces 
backs and hands from reported iraqi poison gas attacks that killed 
5000 were flown to four european countries and the united states 
on tuesday for treatment 
some coughed violently others lay motionless on stretchers as 
they were taken from an iran air ambulance plane that touched down 
in austria switzerland west germany and britain 
one 6yearold child said by iranian and kurdish officials to 
have lost her entire family in an attack sobbed constantly and 
called for her parents at least four other children were among the 
wounded 
the plane dropping off six patients each in vienna geneva 
frankfurt and london arrived in new york later tuesday with five 
wounded the man woman and three girls were taken to st johns 
episcopal hospital in queens where they were admitted in stable 
condition hospital spokesman jim wellen said 
he said they suffered from skin and eye wounds burns and 
inhalation injuries 
swiss red cross president felix christ said the iranian 
goverment was paying for the medical treatment 
iran said the iraqi air force dropped cyanide and mustard gas 
bombs on three kurdish towns in iraq killing 5000 kurds and 
injuring 5000 other people the attacks first targeted the town of 
halabja which had been captured by iran on march 16 some 
chemical bombs reportedly hit the nearby villages of khormal and 
dojaila during the next few days most victims were in halabja 
dr gerhard freilinger department head of viennas university 
clinic for plastic surgery said the patients he talked to appeared 
to have been injured by mustard gas that may have been mixed with a 
nerve gas 
it was possible the mustard gas was in combination with a 
light nerve gas because they all have bad headaches are dizzy and 
some may have been unconscious he told reporters in vienna 
mustard gas causes changes in the lungs that can lead to 
suffocation burns the skin and also destroys bone marrow 
freilinger said 
the gas is heavier than air which he said would explain how it 
seeped into cellars where the patients said they had been hiding 
during the attacks 
freilinger said poison gas penetrates everything including 
clothes 
they cant run away from it because if they do they breath it 
in even deeper he said 
in the past iran has sent soldiers allegedly poisoned by 
mustard gas to vienna and other european cities for treatment in 
july iranian civilians were sent for treatment for the first time 
since 1984 freilinger has treated about 30 victims of alleged 
chemical weapons attacks in the 7yearold persian gulf war he 
said about half of them had survived but the latest victims were 
injured nearly two weeks ago meaning the damage done by the gas 
could not be reversed 
freilinger said he visited areas allegedly bombed with chemical 
weapons in 1984 and had taken a sample of the gas for verification 
and testing 
he said two of the patients a child and a severely wounded 
iranian soldier were to be placed in the intensive care unit at 
his university clinic 
three women and a man were brought to private clinics in the 
austrian capital 
in geneva three children aged between six and 11 were driven by 
ambulance to the lausanne university hospital and two men and a 
woman were flown on to zurich and taken to the citys university 
hospital 
a swiss foreign ministry spokesman said the six were granted 
visas for switzerland for humanitarian reasons in 1985 five 
iranian soldiers allegedly wounded by iraqi chemical weapons were 
treated in zurich and lausanne the following year six more were 
treated in lausanne and in liestal near basel and two died 
five men and a 6yearold girl were taken to recklinghausen 125 
miles north of frankfurt scores of iranians injured in the war 
have been flown in recent years to the west german town which has 
several clinics that specialize in respiratory ailments 
about 70 iranian protesters waving placards and photographs of 
civilians allegedly burned by chemical gas gathered at londons 
heathrow airport three male and three female patients were due to 
be taken from the converted jumbo jet to cromwell hospital

president daniel ortega urged the 
united states on tuesday to negotiate a return to normal relations 
with his leftist sandinista government 
ortega said president reagan had promised to begin discussions 
with nicaragua if the sandinistas met with ussupported contra 
rebels a truce agreement with the contras was reached last week 
we hope president reagan keeps his word ortega declared 
he has repeatedly said that the day the sandinistas sit down for 
direct negotiations with the contras then the united states 
government would sit down and negotiate with the sandinistas 
contra and sandinista representatives reached general agreement 
tuesday on the size and location of zones where the rebels will 
gather during a temporary 60day ceasefire to begin friday 
a communique at the end of two days of talks in the southern 
nicaragua border town of sapoa said two zones would be in the 
northern part of the country two on the caribbean coast and one in 
the south 
aristides sanchez head of the rebel delegation said exact 
locations would not be disclosed yet 
still to be decided was how the truce will work said maj gen 
joaquin cuadra chief government delegate 
he said it would be a main topic when talks resume in sapoa next 
tuesday 
the agreement signed last week does not say if the rebels must 
lay down their arms during the truce 
what is important in these meetings is that they have 
advanced cuadra said 
he called the talks an important step toward the permanent 
ceasefire cuadra said the ceasefire will take effect friday as 
scheduled even though the conditions were not agreed upon 
sanchez said the talks are quite delicate we are trying to 
guarantee the physical and moral security of our combatants 
ortega spoke at a ceremony honoring antiwar activist s brian 
willson of san francisco as a hero of peace willson lost both 
legs when a train ran over him during a protest at a us navy 
weapons depot in concord calif last fall 
reagan told the organization of american states in november that 
secretary of state george p shultz was prepared to meet with the 
sandinistas as part of discussions with other central american 
countries once serious negotiations on a nicaraguan ceasefire 
were under way 
direct talks between the united states and nicaragua have not 
been held since 1984 
on march 23 the sandinistas and contras ended three days of 
meetings with a signed agreement to work out a permanent ceasefire 
in the civil war which began in 1981 and restore democracy to 
nicaragua 
ortegas government refused for years to meet with the contras 
insisting instead on negotiations with the united states 
the nicaraguan president said tuesday we hope he reagan is 
a man of his word and immediately fulfills his word to accept 
bilateral conversations to deal with security issues that concern 
the united states with respect to nicaragua and with nicaragua in 
respect to the united states 
those talks should concentrate on normalizing relations not the 
internal policies of nicaragua ortega said and added we will 
not directly discuss the democratic regime in nicaragua or the 
democratic regime in the united states 
washington contends the sandinistas broke promises made to the 
oas in 1979 in exchange for its support the reagan administration 
says they promised democracy and delivered marxism 
the sandinistas came to power in a revolution that ousted the 
proamerican rightist regime of the late president anastasio 
somoza in july 1979 the united states supported the sandinistas 
initially but in 1981 began financing the contras 
in his remarks tuesday ortega urged the us congress not to 
approve any contra aid that would conflict with last weeks 
agreement in which the contras agreed to accept only humanitarian 
assistance from neutral organizations 
us aid to the rebels expired feb 29 and sandinistas sources 
have cited lack of aid as the reason the contras signed the truce 
agreement 
rebel spokesmen say continuing the war is unnecessary if the 
sandinistas keep their promises of restoring democratic freedoms 
for the sandinistas the agreement could ease internal pressures 
created by dissatisfaction with the war an unpopular military 
draft food shortages and a shattered economy

bernhard h goetz on tuesday appealed his 
conviction on weapons charges in the 1984 subway shooting of four 
teenagers saying the instructions to the jurors did not give them 
the option of being merciful toward him 
the appeal which contained a legal attack on his sentence as 
well as his conviction was filed at the state supreme courts 
appellate division by his lawyer barry slotnick 
goetz 40 is free on 5000 bail pending appeal after a widely 
publicized trial the man dubbed the subway vigilante was 
convicted last june on one count of thirddegree weapons possession 
but acquitted of more serious charges in the december 1984 
shootings 
goetz said he shot the four young men all 19 because they were 
trying to rob him when they approached and asked for 5 the men 
said they were merely panhandling 
in the appeal slotnick argued that the trial judge stephen 
crane illegally violated goetzs right to have a jury decide his 
guilt or innocence on the weapons charge by telling the jurors they 
must rather than they may convict if they found goetz 
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
the lawyer argued the judge voided the jurys power to find that 
a defendant committed a criminal act but also deserved mercy 
jury mercy is indeed a wellrecognized phenomenon indigenous 
to out justice system slotnick wrote 
slotnick also argued against the sentence that crane imposed 
last october six months in jail and 4 years probation plus 
community service a fine and counseling 
paradoxically slotnick argued for a longer oneyear jail 
sentence because a definite oneyear sentence would make goetz 
eligible for parole in two months his sentence as it now stands 
means he must serve the six months with the possibility of being 
jailed again if he violates probation 
the oneyear sentence is required because there is a state law 
requiring a mandatory year in jail for a weapons possession 
conviction and the law does not mention splitting the sentence 
into part jail time part probation the lawyer said 
the appeals brief also argued that a jail sentence would be 
unduly harsh in goetzs case because of his state of mind 
slotnick said goetz continues to suffer psychic pain because of 
the intense publicity the case received 
goetz had no comment on the appeal

conference we must step up our attacks on the police the army 
and other personnel associated with the institution of apartheid 
we will strike against its economic infrastructure and do much

the fortunate pilgrim based on novelist 
mario puzos sweeping saga of an italian immigrant family in search 
of the american dream is unfortunately a tedious wooden 
melodrama in its adaptation for tv 
nbc will air the twopart fivehour miniseries on sunday and 
monday april 34 
sophia loren whose husband carlo ponti produced the 
fortunate pilgrim stars as plucky matriarch lucia corbo whose 
first husband is killed in a factory explosion and whose second 
husband played by edward james olmos of miami vice succumbs 
to insanity her children meanwhile get tuberculosis arrested 
and the neighbors wife pregnant 
hal holbrook arrives in part 2 as a scotchfrench doctor who 
romances lucia john turturro who made his mark playing malevolent 
types in such films as to live and die in la and five 
corners is eldest son larry 
the movie a period piece set in the 1920s and 30s was shot 
against an almost sepiatoned backdrop by director stuart cooper 
who did the miniseries the long hot summer this one was filmed 
on location in yugoslavia but the sets look more like a studio 
backlot also inexplicably the dialogue sounds dubbed much of the 
time 
coopers rudimentary direction is matched only by the pedestrian 
script drama needs conflict the fluffy ill take manhattan 
even with broadly drawn characters and plotlines worked because it 
at least had structure 
the fortunate pilgrim is a muddle the central conflict 
seems to be lucias dream for a home in the country and success for 
her children running up against her offsprings constant moral 
lapses illnesses and scrapes with neighbors and the law an early 
symbol of evil is a laughably snidely whiplashlike landlord 
the result is a meandering plotline composed of a series of 
unconnected events most of which have no buildup or ramifications 
in john mcgreeveys script as well character development 
consists of simplistic dialogue although it doesnt help us 
connect with them to switch actors every hour or two as the 
children age 
a sample scene early in part 2 son vinnie goes to comfort 
sisterinlaw luisa who is weeping after being insulted by her 
husband larry we have seen these two only in passing so this is 
supposed to establish their characters 
too bad you didnt get to finish high school i probably wont 
either vinnie says at one point 
you should vinnie youre so smart says luisa 
mom depends on me thats the way it is he replies 
youre too kind she says youre always doing things for 
other people 
the miniseries does have the dubious honor of stifling a fine 
cast 
loren is becoming something of a tv movie regular she was in 
courage last season and before that aurora and sophia 
loren her own story and she is still a charismatic screen 
presence 
olmos who plays enigmatic martin castillo on vice does a 
good job with smoldering frank corbo convincing us by strength of 
performance that lucia could indeed fall in love with this troubled 
man 
annabella sciorra makes an impressive television debut as 
octavia lucias headstrong eldest daughter also notable is 
yugoslavian actress mirjana karanovic who plays clara a married 
woman who becomes pregnant by larry 
all these immigrants are yearning to breathe free

lawrence trupiano saved most of the organ from 
st pauls hoboken everything but the bellows which was too big 
to fit through any door 
the builders had the mentality that they would last forever 
theyll put things where you couldnt get to them trupiano said 
organs dont last without help though not in the smog of a big 
city or in a church where the furnace dries and cracks a wooden 
instrument nor do they stand up under careless tuning or the 
assaults of mice tempted by the taste of horsehide glue in the 
bellows 
the organ at st pauls didnt play at all when trupiano moved 
it from the new jersey shore of the hudson river to his shop in 
brooklyn it will sing again though in a church in manhattan 
which is giving up high tech for the timetested sound of pipes 
dozens of organs become orphans each year no longer wanted 
because struggling churches close and prosperous churches buy new 
instruments many like the organ from st pauls turn up in new 
homes 
alan laufman who runs the organ clearing house in norrisville 
nh has about 120 organs available at any time 
sometimes we get a call on a thursday afternoon saying that a 
church will be torn down on monday and can we find a home for the 
organ sometimes we can laufman said in a telephone interview 
since the clearing house was started in 1959 laufman estimates 
that more than 1200 organs have found new homes in one case as 
far away as yokohama japan 
perhaps the proudest match was between the metropolitan museum 
of art in new york and an organ built by thomas appleton of boston 
in 1830 it was found unused in a pennsylvania church trupianos 
shop returned it to playing condition complete with handpumped 
bellows 
it was a timecapsule of information it was just like 
appleton built it said trupiano who restored the organ to 
playing condition it answered a lot of unknowns from organs 
built at that time 
other organs require educated guesses he is now restoring 
another organ for the metropolitan a home organ which he thinks 
was built in 1821 
you are always trying to understand what the builder was 
trying to do he said and the surest guide is the instrument 
itself the pipe will tell you what it wants to do 
the organ from st pauls built in 1890 was remodeled in 1920 
trupiano is reworking it again adding to the 1600 pipes which 
came from hoboken 
first it received a thorough cleaning 
if its from new york city the problem is exhaust fumes the 
grease and dirt is almost a paste trupiano said 
calgon and hot water works well on metal pipes while steel 
wool moist cheesecloth and elbow grease are recommended for the 
less numerous wooden pipes 
trupiano says he rarely has to rebuild a pipe but many are 
fitted with felt or leather which must be replaced some pipes are 
beyond help bent and buckled by a hamhanded tuner 
keyboards have to be rebuilt with bone instead of ivory because 
ivory imports are banned the thousands of parts of the action the 
mechanism which links the keys to the pipes must be cleaned and 
reassembled 
usually we tell a church its going to take two years said 
trupiano who has four people working in his shop 
half the battle with electronic instruments is that churches 
want instant gratification he added you pay your money and 
by next week you have your noise 
and in 15 years youll need a new instrument said laufman who 
found that most of the churches looking to adopt a pipe organ are 
replacing an electric instrument less than 20 years old 
i know how long a pipe organ will last he said i play 
one every sunday that was built in 1853 
adopting an organ costs 10000 and up laufman said though the 
investment is anywhere from 30 percent to 70 percent less than the 
price of a comparable new organ 
organized efforts to preserve historic organs began only in 1956 
with the founding of the organ historical society based in 
richmond va the society has tracked down 4498 american organs 
built in the 19th century said william van pelt the executive 
director 
most are still working every sunday and most were built with 
considerable integrity van pelt said many of these are less 
ambitious adequate sunday by sunday church organs not magnificent 
concert instruments 
many 19thcentury instruments were lost van pelt said because 
churches could afford to replace them other organs fell victim to 
renewed interest in baroque music and a demand for organs built in 
the german style of bachs time 
the organ historical society concentrates on organs built before 
1850 or instruments built in the second half of the 19th century 
which are essentially unaltered 
van pelts computer has a list of 450 shops across the country 
that could do restoration 
trupiano was bitten by the organ bug 25 years ago when he was 
13 and spent hours watching a new organ being installed in his 
church it didnt occur to him then to worry about the fate of the 
old organ 
laufman a former teacher was lured into the field by a 
12yearold student who had saved an organ that was being removed 
from a new hampshire church with sledgehammers and chainsaws 
that church is now on its third electronic instrument 
laufman noted with satisfaction the old organ built in 1858 
was lovingly reworked by this kid and parts of it are still 
playing in a suburb of boston

at any one time ardyth lohuis is trying to 
match 20 to 25 churches who want to hire an organist with two or 
three musicians who are looking for jobs 
some churches call me month after month saying dont you 
have someone said lohuis a professor of organ and church music 
at virginia commonwealth university in richmond and director of a 
referral service for state chapters of the american guild of 
organists 
what the churches want typically is someone to play one or two 
services a week plus a choir rehearsal and often one full week of 
revival services 
theyre hoping to get someone to do this for 4500 which is 
not even minimum wage she said 
its getting harder to find takers 
according to the national association of schools of music the 
number of undergraduate organ majors fell from 673 in the 198283 
school year to 469 in 198485 and the number of schools offering 
majors declined from 194 to 160 
at oberlin college in ohio there are now fewer than 20 
undergraduate organ students compared to perhaps 50 a 
quartercentury ago said david bow dean of the colleges 
conservatory of music 
i would say that the quality of the students we have now is as 
high as i can remember they are extraordinarily committed he 
said 
however bow noted we see a high school pool out there that 
is a quarter or a fifth the size it was 15 years ago 
in contrast the number of applications for other instrumental 
programs at oberlin is up 218 percent this year 
charles krusenstjerna director of admissions at the eastman 
school of music at rochester university in new york says the drop 
is partly a demographic phenomenon the number of entering freshmen 
in the united states has fallen from a peak of 26 million in 1981 
to 23 million in 1985 according to the us department of 
education 
krusenstjerna said the school expects to have about 40 
applications from organ students this year down from an alltime 
high of 60 several years ago 
daniel nelson colburn ii executive director of the 
25000member american guild of organists and john walker 
chairman of the agos task force on the new organist suggested in 
a recent interview that several factors are at work 
mainline churches which attach more importance to elaborate 
liturgy set to classical music are not growing rapidly if at all 
people simply dont go to church as much colburn said it 
is no longer automatically to be assumed that a sort of 
middleamerican person has been exposed to this music at all 
more women are going to work leaving fewer of the talented 
housewives who have filled many an organ job for token compensation 
fewer students are willing to enter a profession in which 
25000 is a princely salary and only a handful of positions pay 
50000 
one of the basic problems is the residual sense of a lot 
of church members throughout the country that whatever you do for 
the church needs to be done voluntarily said walker organist at 
new yorks riverside church and chairman of the organ department at 
the manhattan school of music 
one of his doctoral students recently found a job outside the 
city paying 20000 a year this means years and years of study 
to get there and hes thrilled to death walker said 
the people who do this profession in my generalized view 
still love what they do colburn said to the extent they are 
aware of these problems they are frustrated but i dont see a 
lot of people leaving 
he just sees fewer people entering 
the ago with a touch of exaggeration has been asking will 
we worship with music in the year 2000 in fact colburn said 
there is almost a glut of highly trained organists with advanced 
degrees competing for the best jobs the shortage affects the 
smaller churches 
the guilds strategy is to seek publicity through promotions 
such as organ week which it will launch next year and to seek 
out and encourage promising high school musicians 
in sioux falls sd the ago chapter last fall awarded five 
100 scholarships enough to pay for 10 lessons to aspiring 
organists including one in eighth grade 
substitutes are very hard to find said richard collman 
secretarytreasurer of the 50member state chapter i know of 
only one or two people in the high school age category studying the 
pipe organ now 
collman looks at youngsters with at least five years of piano 
lessons which is a good start toward mastering the two three or 
more keyboards of a pipe organ 
still they have to learn a different touch they have to 
learn to play yet another keyboard with their feet and to adjust 
tonal colors by drawing on combinations of pipes the best jobs 
often require the organist to direct a choir as well 
my guess is that as organists continue to be scarce the 
churches that want live music will realize they will have to pay 
more bow said 
however the volunteer ethic isnt dead 
walker received a letter from an organist in vermont who is 
paid 2796 a year 
this represents a major increase just this year the 
organist wrote and i have no wish to complain

a staggering amount of organ music is 
heard in the united states most of it live on sunday mornings 
though perhaps little of it worth hearing again 
its that smaller segment that michael barone pursues for 
pipedreams a 90minute weekly showcase for organs and 
organists on american public radio 
the inspiration came in 1980 when barone found himself running 
the only tape recorder at an american guild of organists convention 
in the twin cities 
gosh this was incredible music some good commissioned works 
some young artists who were just outstanding said barone who 
had a local organ program at the time 
he put together 14 programs to offer nationally in 1982 
i did it only because there seemed like a lot of good stuff 
available not only here that year but around the country and 
there didnt seem to be anyone else doing anything with it he 
said 
thats still true 
im getting the sense that though 128 stations do carry 
pipedreams they may carry no other pipe organ music during the 
week barone said 
there is one other nationally distributed organ program 
halfhour performances by john obetz from the headquarters of the 
reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints in 
independence mo which is carried by about 100 stations 
pipedreams ranges far more widely 
recently for example programs have featured the flamboyant 
french organist jean guillou the dedication of new organ at iowa 
state university an anthology of american music and a variety of 
bach organ works played at several universities 
one of barones favorite shows included what was apparently a 
premiere performance 139 years after the composers death of a 
work by felix mendelssohn 
in addition to the ago conventions barones digital tape 
equipment has captured gatherings of the organ historical society 
recital competitions of young organists and even the occasional 
theater organ or choir he also uses records compact discs and 
tapes submitted on spec 
there is so much he said that he is just now scheduling some 
of the material from the agos 1986 convention 
im really here to beat the drum for the pipe organ which 
barone feels is almost an invisible creature in the world of 
music

us sen john heinz promised to push for a 
law that would make a hostile takeover of koppers co unpalatable 
for british investor brian beazer and sen arlen specter asked the 
attorney general to enter the case personally 
heinz a pittsburgh republican charged at a news conference 
monday that if a 17 billion tender offer from bns inc succeeds 
beazer will gain a monopoly in various markets for aggregates road 
building materials that include sand and pebbles added to concrete 
to make cement 
a strangle hold on the existing aggregates business is 
financially attractive because environmental laws are such at the 
state and local level that you cannot easily open a new source 
of aggregate he said 
specter a philadelphia republican said he is concerned whether 
an initial jusice department review satisfied the hartscottrodino 
act which sets guidelines for corporate takeovers he asked 
attorney general edwin meese to personally review the koppers case 
and to respond to the request by thursday 
heinz withheld details of his proposed legislation 
to reveal our strategy might very well be to jeopardize its 
success he said 
the proposal will be offered this week or after the easter break 
as an amendment to pending legislation heinz said 
im not in the business of making hollow promises and i do 
not make idle threats heinz said i have drafted and am 
prepared to introduce and press legislation to make the takeover of 
koppers extremely unpalatable 
the corporate raiders will be and should be as surprised by 
this legislation as koppers was by this raid he said 
we are not corporate raiders beazer declared in a fullpage 
advertisement monday in pittsburghs newspapers our goal is not 
to make a quick buck rather we are in the process of creating a 
vital dynamic worldwide organization 
beazer said that after he acquired the atlanta homebuilder cohn 
communities and the dallas construction materials company 
giffordhill in 1985 and 1986 respectively each of those 
companies has grown and prospered under our ownership 
bns inc a takeover company formed by beazer and shearon lehman 
hutton inc bid 60 cash per share for koppers stock under a 
tender offer open until april 7 a federal court in california 
temporarily has blocked the acquisition over antitrust concerns 
koppers management says it may sell all or part of the company 
or pay cash to shareholders to keep the company out of beazers 
hands 
heinz said taxpayers will spend more for public roads if the 
takeover succeeds 
the two of them combined in what are essentially local market 
areas would if the sale went through amount to a de facto local 
monopoly on very costly roadbuilding materials he said 
the senator allegheny county commission chairman thomas 
foerster and others at the news conference said the takeover 
jeopardizes the approximately 1100 pittsburgharea jobs in 
koppers chemicals businesses beazer has said he would sell 
chemicals and related businesses although it is not clear that all 
those jobs would be eliminated 
opponents also worry about the 232 million that koppers 
contributes to the area economy 
heinz joined city county and state officials who have lambasted 
shearson for going a step beyond traditional takeover financing and 
becoming an equity partner in the takeover company bns 
i am appalled by the involvement of shearson he said 
shearson stands to gain tens of millions of dollars in fees 
simply for shuffling some paper around 
shearson officials have said their ownership in bns is merely a 
temporary method of helping finance the takeover

companies faced with increased competition and 
more demanding consumers are learning to stress customer 
satisfaction over bottomline profit strategy the president of a 
bostonbased corporate research and training firm says 
right now there are a lot of people playing around in each 
others back yard said richard c whiteley president of the 
forum corporation with more options the consumer is in a better 
position to be selective 
a forum corporation survey of nearly 5700 employees and 
consumers released monday said toplevel management should rely on 
frontline employees and the public to gauge service quality 
and corporate image 
companies are learning that they need the consumer and that 
service has got to improve or they can lose their business 
overnight if theyre not careful said whiteley who estimates 
consumer complaints have doubled since 1980 
the survey which included more than 3200 employees at 14 large 
companies in the united states and canada revealed a trend toward 
stressing consumer satisfaction 
theres a certain arrogance in companies on a downward 
spiral whiteley said they think they know what their 
customers need more than their customers do 
the survey indicated that empathy and responsiveness among 
socalled frontline workers who deal directly with the public 
leads to customer loyalty and new business 
but the report noted that managers constantly must seek comments 
and advice from frontline employees and customers who have the 
best sense of how the company is perceived in the marketplace 
the report also notes that the attitudes of frontline workers 
is heavily influenced by upper management 
consumer focus has come to be regarded as a complex notion 
that involves the entire organization and not just something that 
is the responsibility of people who are sometimes the lowestpaid 
leasttrained and leastmotivated employees in the company the 
report said 
whiteley cited tollfree information numbers consumer 
questionnaires and maintaining executives connection with the 
public as methods successfully used by companies seeking to enhance 
image and customer satisfaction 
you now hear thank you for calling atampt when you call he 
said that wasnt the case years ago 
whiteley predicted more us companies will foster better 
consumer policies as foreign and domestic competition grows 
forty percent of the 2374 consumers interviewed late last year 
in the twomonth survey said poor service prompted them to pull 
away their business an additional 30 percent cited other 
reasons for switching including some servicerelated problems 
according to the report 
but between 60 percent and 73 percent of consumer respondents 
rated service quality with the companies excellent according 
to the report 
we found their standards are just lower said thomas 
atkinson who supervised the survey theres the impression that 
service just is not very good in america anymore 
the number of employees who said that satisfying customers 
was among their companies top three priorities ranged from 87 
percent to 63 percent 
in addition attracting new customers was considered a 
priority almost twice as often as keeping customers among the 
corporate sponsors of the survey which included manufacterers 
hightechonology firms and serviceoriented companies 
the names of the companies were not released 
in general priorities having to do with customers or better 
financial performance were seen as key by the employees while 
objectives such as emphasizing quality finding new products and 
finding new markets ranked lower the report said 
a final version of the findings is scheduled to be released in 
september atkinson said

bank while stock prices posted substantial gains for the second

foreign visitors are boosting attendance at south 
florida tourist attractions from the everglades to ocean world 
while the number of vacationing collegians has plummeted to an 
alltime low this decade 
you have a truly unique place said klaus mueller who was 
bird watching on the anhinga trail in the everglades the greatest 
expanse of sawgrass in the world everybody in the world knows 
about the everglades 
attendance at everglades national park is up 43 percent over 
last season with 306202 visitors in january and february compared 
to 213384 during the same time last year spokesman pat tolle said 
monday 
its like a language school outside my office said park 
superintendent michael finley im hearing french german 
japanese everywhere 
jerome scherr president of miamis parrot jungle where 
attendance was up 16 percent said the attraction is something 
different than theyve got back home in europe and japan were 
subtropical palm trees and glamour 
the weak dollar against foreign currencies and the slick image 
created by the television series miami vice are attracting many 
of the foreign visitors to south florida 
nigel and rosy collins visited miamis seaquarium during their 
weeklong trip to south florida and orlando from london the couple 
expected their vacation to cost half of what they would have paid 
two years ago because of the weak dollar 
everything is so warm so clean so new so cheap collins 
said as his wife chimed in and youve got don johnson 
but the traditional spring break market in fort lauderdale is 
going bust instead of boom this year according to broward county 
tourism officials 
a turnout of 200000 college students had been expected 
matching last years dismal turnout however the numbers now being 
forecast range from 110000 to 180000 and the hotels and bars 
that report solid business say its due to the influx of european 
tourists 
although south florida tourist officials are uncertain of the 
number of foreign tourists international traffic at miami 
international airport was up 9 percent to 786951 passengers in 
january compared to the same month last year 
finley expects europeans to generate 80 percent of the business 
at flamingo lodge at the southern tip of the everglades in the 
mosquitoswarming months of july and august 
at lion country safari the palm beach county biggame preserve 
and amusement park a 25 percent boost in attendance over last year 
was reported said lion country marketing director brian osborne 
ocean world where fort lauderdale visitors can pet dolphins and 
watch sharks feed reports 18 percent more visitors so far this 
season the attraction does not release specific admission figures 
said general manager george boucher 
businesses that thrive on tourism expect the boom to continue as 
long as the dollar is low 
the english should be here big in april parrot jungles 
scherr said south americans will then travel north to avoid 
winter and europeans will keep coming

eastman kodak co will seek to complete 
its merger with fellow photofinishing giant colorcraft corp now 
that an appeals court has ruled the two were not trying to force 
other companies out of the industry a kodak spokesman said 
were absolutely gratified spokesman henry kaska said 
monday evening after hearing of the federal court ruling it does 
mean that we will be proceeding with that merger 
however kaska said it was still too early to tell when the 
merger would actually take place 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals on monday reversed a 
preliminary injunction granted to phototron corp that blocked the 
kodakcolorcraft merger the court ruled the merger was aimed at 
making the firms more competitive and was not an attempt to put 
others out of business 
a lower court ruled feb 22 that phototron had standing to 
challenge the merger and that the combination of kodak and 
colorcraft could substantially reduce competition in the wholesale 
photofinishing market 
kaska said the merger would not result in a monopoly of the 
wholesale photofinishing business and retail operations known as 
mini labs but he could not immediately provide figures on how much 
of the market the companies would control 
kodak operates 50 photofinishing labs throughout the united 
states while colorcraft operates 41 labs phototron operates nine 
labs in the southern and western united states 
kodak and colorcraft decided to merge to make their 
photofinishing operations more competitive phototron sued asking 
a district court in texas to block the merger 
the lower court issued a preliminary injunction saying it was 
appropriate given the threat of loss and damages phototron could 
suffer 
however the threejudge panel of the 5th circuit said the 
district court had erred in handing down a preliminary injunction 
without first finding phototron had demonstrated a substantial 
likelihood of having suffered an antitrust injury 
the appeals court went on to say that under a previous ruling by 
the us supreme court a competitor can obtain a permanent 
injunction against a merger only if it can prove the transaction 
would violate antitrust laws 
under cargill a competitor has standing to challenge the 
merger if an allegation and proof of predatory pricing is made 
the appeals court said 
the panel said phototron has not offered substantial proof that 
the merger would fall under the predatory pricing guidelines and 
therefore has not demonstrated the substantial likelihood it 
would prevail in a trial 
phototron argued to the district court that kodak and colorcraft 
had undercut the price phototron offers retailers and therefore 
claimed that its two competitors could be operating unprofitably 
and violating the predatory pricing prohibition 
the appeals court said phototron must prove kodak and colorcraft 
are offering services below their own cost in order to satisfy the 
substantial likelihood requirement for a preliminary injunction 
kaska said the legal obstacles have only delayed the merger 
several weeks obviously any delay would mean a loss of revenue 
but the delay was not that long he said

the common markets executive body has 
approved french government aid to giant automaker renault but has 
set certain conditions on the assistance 
the european economic community commission said tuesday it has 
approved french aid to renault of 20 billion french francs or 
about 354 billion at current exchange rates 
the decision made a month before the french presidential 
elections marked the end of a twoyear investigation into 
government assistance to regie nationale des usines renault which 
is a state agency 
the decision means that the french government is authorized to 
proceed with a 12 billion franc writeoff of renaults debt 
renault had 464 billion francs of debt at the end of 1987 
the commission said in a statement it also approved a 
previouslymade capital injection into renault of 8 billion francs 
because it had not been used to undercut prices in the 12nation 
common market 
the commission has the power to investigate government aid to 
industry because of the potential anticompetitive effects of such 
assistance 
however the commission said it approved the aid under certain 
conditions including the conversion this year of renault into a 
stateowned company from a state agency which escapes company law 
other conditions included the completion of an 834 billion 
franc restructuring program and a pledge from the french government 
not to grant further aid 
the french industry ministry said in a statement in paris that 
the commissions decision was good for the company it said 
renault would now be in a position to compete on an equal footing 
with its main competitors 
the commission said renault had been particularly hard hit 
by the crisis in the common markets auto sector in the early 1980s 
when many companies had to reorganize their activities in the face 
of reduced demand and rising imports from japan 
renaults restructuring plan which runs through 1990 involves 
modernizing factories cutting the workforce by at least 38000 and 
reducing production capacity by more than 25 percent 
the commission said the program would make a significant 
contribution to resolving some of the problems of the european 
car industry

griffin and trump are making rival bids to take over the 
hotelcasino concern which has operations in new jersey and the

court in manhattan adds to our claims concerning mr trumps 
scheme to depress the value of resorts shares and lock up his 
control in order to acquire resorts on the cheap 
trump has denied the charges 
the suit added no new allegations rather it sought to buttress 
its existing claims with new evidence 
the suit which seeks 500 million in damages contends trump

following in your fathers footsteps is never 
easy its even tougher when your father built a nearly 3 billion 
computer company from scratch 
but to hear fred wang talk its not that big a deal 
i dont think im under any more stress or pressure than 
anybody else seems to be at work said the 37yearold president 
and chief operating officer of wang laboratories inc 
having always worked for him never having had a different 
father never having worked for anybody else i dont know what 
its like i cant compare to be in a different environment 
but that doesnt mean wang isnt under the gun he must prove he 
can turn around a company thats had more than its share of hard 
times and a reputation for lessthanstellar customer service 
wang based in lowell mass was once a wall street darling 
for over a decade its earnings increased more than 30 percent a 
year as its word processors became standard equipment in the 
secretarial suites of major corporations 
but the good times collapsed in its fiscal year 1985 when 
beset by the computer industry slump and its own high operating 
costs wangs profit slid to 155 million from 2102 million the 
year before 
to shore up the company the management under wangs father an 
wang went through several rounds of layoffs pay freezes and other 
costcutting measures but things got worse instead of better the 
company reported a loss of 30 million in the quarter ended sept 
30 1986 its stock price and its image both sagged 
fred wang was named president in november 1986 and almost 
immediately took action he eliminated 1000 jobs on top of the 
1600 cut in 1986 and a like number the year before and reduced 
salaries by 6 percent for all us employees 
but things didnt improve quickly in fact they appeared to get 
worse a little more than a month after he took office the company 
announced a loss of 786 million in the quarter ended that dec 30 
morale among the 30000 wang employees probably hit its nadir 
when that loss was announced he recalled in an interview here 
we said ok weve really got to get the place turned around 
get people focused in on basically expenses getting more new 
orders in he said 
the tonic finally took its effect in the quarter ended march 31 
1987 when the company reported a profit of 59 million but it 
still ended its fiscal 1987 a quarter later drenched in red ink 
707 million worth of it 
wang also changed the structure of the company letting out some 
slack in the tight reins his father held by giving divisional 
chiefs more authority and he launched an innovative advertising 
campaign in which actors posing as wang employees boast in 
computerese about their products 
since the profitable quarter ended march 31 1987 wang has 
recorded earnings in three more quarters including 341 million 
in the period ended dec 31 
the mood has turned around and i think weve done some things 
not only on the expense side but also on the advertising side and 
really on the management side to get things moving in the positive 
direction he said 
an wang a chinese immigrant who founded the company in 1951 as 
a maker of custom electronics components has denied speculation 
that he made his son the president because of the companys 
problems instead he said the younger wang was ready for more 
responsibility an wang remains chairman and chief executive 
officer 
and fred wang denies that hes made any real departure from the 
way the company was run by his father universally called 
doctor in deference to his harvard doctorate in physics 
instead wang says hes managed to communicate better with the 
employees to battle corporate inertia 
what sometimes gets lost in this fred vs dr wang issue is 
that a lot of the changes he has been a proponent of for some years 
anyway but a lot of the people said we did this five years ago 
thats the way we are going to do it 
where he always had a grand strategy for the organization he 
kept most of it in his head 
wang says he never set out to work at the company let alone run 
it but when he graduated from brown university with a math degree 
after changing majors several times he had little career 
direction 
so here i was 21 years old june of 1972 unemployed he 
said 
but since he learned to write computer programs at brown he 
said he decided to work at wang 
after going through the ranks in the programming department 
wang moved into marketing later he headed the research and 
development operations and served as corporate treasurer he also 
is on the board of directors 
now at the helm wang faces several challenges in addition to 
maintaining profitability he must manage the companys transition 
from a maker of word processsors to a broadbased seller of 
minicomputers data networks and information storage and management 
tools finding a niche for it alongside the giants of the computer 
industry international business machines corp and digital 
equipment corp 
wang says hes not talking about sheer size instead he wants 
wang labs to be viewed as an industry leader in other areas such 
as technology 
the ads are part of the companys imageraising plan he said 
theyre designed to change the nagging image of our being a 
wordprocessingonly company to one of being a computer company 
that specializes in the office 
they also serve another purpose our sales people had gone 
through one hell of a year with the industry slowdown and our own 
internal problems we wanted them to be seen as the hero of the ad 
program he said

prime minister margaret thatcher told parliament 
that there isnt any policy split between herself and chancellor of 
the exchequer nigel lawson the treasurys top official 
both mr lawson and i put downward pressure on inflation as 
topmost priority both of us think interest rate stability can be 
very useful to industry mrs thatcher said tuesday in response 
to a question in the house of commons 
it was the first time that the conservative prime minister had 
publicly denied a split with lawson according to observers 
after the governments recent decision to allow the british 
pound to rise above 300 west german marks there were press 
reports that lawson had been against allowing the pound to rise but 
had been overruled by mrs thatcher the prime minister was more 
concerned about the inflationary impact of any effort to stem the 
pounds rise on world currency markets the reports said 
a stronger pound could hurt british exports and company profits 
earlier tuesday lawson told a gathering of the association of 
american correspondents in london that the whole government 
policy is to ensure to continue to have downward pressure on 
inflation 
there is no sign whatsoever of resurgence of inflation 
lawson said britains annual inflation rate is currently 33 
percent 
he said britains intervention in the foreignexchange markets 
wasnt inflationary 
lawson also said he is perfectly satisfied with the current 
trading level of the pound against the mark 
the british currency was quoted at around 31050 marks on 
tuesday afternoon in london 
but lawson added that you shouldnt draw the conclusion from 
that that there is a target for the pound against the mark 
lawsons lack of concern about the current inflation rate might 
mean there is room for british interest rates to fall further the 
banks base lending rate currently stands at 85 percent 
the reported policy split between mrs thatcher and lawson 
fueled speculation in recent weeks that he would resign his post 
which he has held since 1983 
i havent formed myself a view of how long i will remain 
chancellor lawson said i am not worn out and you can see my 
hair hasnt turned gray but he also said that no one holds a job 
forever and added i have been chancellor longer than most 
lawson also said he wasnt particularly concerned about 
britains widening trade deficit provided there is no resurgence 
of inflation 
the treasury is forecasting a doubling this year of the 
currentaccount deficit to 4 billion pounds or about 7 billion 
but the government on friday reported a worsethanexpected 
february deficit of 156 billion pounds or around 29 billion 
which made the financial markets nervous

eight of the suits were filed in us district court in san 
francisco texas filed in state district court in austin

american stores co says it is prepared to 
increase its offer for lucky stores inc to more than 19 billion 
if a friendly merger of the two grocery store chains can be worked 
out 
american also filed a lawsuit in delaware state court to enjoin 
lucky officers from defending against americans unsolicited tender 
offer indicating american may be bracing for a takeover battle 
in a letter to the board of the dublin califbased lucky late 
monday american chairman ls skaggs said his company was ready to 
offer 50 per share if a mutually acceptable agreement could be 
worked out with lucky 
earlier in the day american launched a cash tender offer for 
lucky at 45 per share or a total of 174 billion that offer 
expires at midnight april 22 
we made clear our willingness to negotiate concerning all 
aspects of our offer including the price said skaggs in his 
letter to lucky 
so far luckys representatives have declined to negotiate 
american stores vice president michael holt today said the 
company would have no comment on either the lawsuit or increased 
stock cash offer lucky officials were not available to discuss the 
matter this morning 
the combination of american the nations thirdlargest grocery 
retailer with 1700 stores and annual sales of 15 billion and 
lucky the sixthlargest with 480 stores and sales of 7 billion 
could produce the biggest grocery retailer in the country analysts 
say 
lucky officials were not immediately available for comment on 
the latest developments which were announced in a press release 
after the close of stock trading 
lucky shares advanced 87 cents to close at 4862 while 
american shares lost 175 to finish at 5487 on the new york 
stock exchange 
before american revealed the contents of its letter lucky 
spokeswoman lissa perlman said company officials had been reviewing 
the offer with financial and legal advisers since last week 
ms perlman said lucky was advising stockholders not to take any 
action on the american offer until luckys board of directors has a 
chance to study the bid and make its recommendation 
americans lawsuit filed friday in wilmington del alleges 
lucky and its executives have breached their fiduciary duties by 
following a course of conduct directed towards entrenching 
themselves in control of lucky stores 
in the lawsuit american said its representatives met with 
luckys march 21 to announce the tender offer american claimed the 
45 offered for each lucky common share is about 40 percent over 
the market price of the companys stock immediately before the 
offer 
american said its representatives advised lucky chairman john m 
lillie that their company preferred to negotiate a friendly 
acquisition and requested a prompt meeting to do so 
but within hours of this meeting lucky set out on a 
course of conduct which would deny the lucky stockholders a premium 
price for their shares and would preserve the position of the 
companys management and the board the suit alleged 
the lawsuit further claimed that lucky initially threatened to 
take injunctive action against american and urged the utah company 
to delay its tender share filings with the securities and exchange 
commission not to publicize the offer and to consider certain 
arrangements between the two companies leading to abandonment of 
the offer 
based on those attempts the lawsuit said american believes 
luckys management will continue to refuse to negotiate seriously 
and will employ an array of defensive measures to prevent the 
acquisition of the company in violation of the defendants 
fiduciary obligation and duties to its stockholders 
in a march 26 letter telling lillie of the takeover plans 
skaggs praised luckys management and marketing strategies and 
invited lucky executives to stay on if the deal is completed 
luckys headquarters would remain in dublin skaggs said 
the bid for lucky came 16 months after takeover specialist asher 
edelman dropped his hostile effort to acquire the company in 
return lucky agreed to pay his 28 million in legal bills 
lucky kept edelman at bay partially by selling off its 
nongrocery divisions and adopting antitakeover measures 
after the text of the letter was released last week lucky 
officials had no comment on the americans tender offer except to 
say company bylaws contain a poison pill antitakeover 
provision limiting the voting power of any shareholder who acquires 
more than 10 percent of luckys stock 
in 1984 american spent 11 billion to take over jewel 
companies inc a chicagobased grocery drug and convenience store 
chain 
that acquisition expanded americans operations from just over 
1000 retail outlets to its present 1700 the company has three 
divisions skaggs which operates supermarkets in the western 
united states american superstores which runs outlets in the 
midwest and east and osco drug stores which has stores nationwide 
the company operates stores under the names acme jewel star 
buttrey skaggs skaggs alpha beta and osco drug

corporate raider carl c icahn will 
not take over texaco inc which is coming out of bankruptcy 
company president james kinnear predicted today 
icahn who owns 148 percent of texaco and is the oil giants 
largest single shareholder has threatened to run a panel of five 
candidates for the texacos 14member board at the next annual 
meeting unless texaco offers to put itself up for sale 
but kinnear whose seat on the board of directors also is 
threatened for takeover said texaco management will do its best to 
keep icahn out texaco officials have repeatedly said the company 
is not for sale 
he recently said in public that he has no intention of being 
on texacos board or wanting to take control of the company but 
the next day he said he might run a proxy slate kinnear told a 
news conference i just dont know what his intentions are my 
prediction is that he will not take over this company 
kinnear did not elaborate on the strategy for keeping icahn from 
making a run at the company 
icahn is not the only takeover artist known to be interested in 
texaco oilman t boone pickens has said he is seeking federal 
regulatory permission to acquire 15 percent or more of texacos 
stock as has getty petroleum co a large independent distributor 
that was born of texacos takeover of getty oil 
kinnear talked to reporters after a speech to the national 
petroleum refiners association 
he said the company would become leaner and stronger by selling 
some assets to clear up its huge debt 
last week a us bankruptcy court judge approved a 
reorganization plan that will enable texaco to emerge from chapter 
11 protection early next month 
texaco filed for that protection last april to avoid having to 
post an 11 billion security bond while appealing a 103 billion 
judgment against the company held by houstonbased pennzoil co 
the judgment stemmed from a november 1985 ruling by a houston 
jury that texaco had improperly interfered with a pennzoil bid to 
acquire part of getty oil co then bought getty itself 
texacos reorganization plan calls for payment of 56 billion 
with 3 billion going to pennzoil to drop the judgment and the rest 
going to creditors 
texaco expects to sell 3 billion in assets to finance the 
program kinnear said 
in his speech kinnear said that the petrochemical industry 
could profit if it remains lean 
us chemical manufacturers must adjust their thinking to a 
slowergrowth economy and to competition from new players he 
said revamping facilities stretching existing units or making 
strategic acquisitions will generally yield far greater returns 
than investing in new grassroots plants with the expectation of 
growing to full capacity in two or three years

sundstrand corp a major aerospace 
contractor has agreed in principle to plead guilty to filing false 
statements with the government and pay 125 million for 
overcharging on military work a newspaper reported 
the proposed plea agreement covers allegations that the 
companys seattlebased sundstrand data control unit improperly 
included patentlitigation expenses in overhead costs on government 
military contracts the wall street journal reported tuesday 
quoting unidentified sources 
sundstrand said in a filing with the securities and exchange 
commission that it expected to face unspecified criminal charges in 
both washington state and illinois in connection with federal grand 
jury investigations of its accounting methods for handling 
government contracts and tax matters 
the government has advised that it intends to charge the 
company with criminal violations in both districts sundstrands 
filing stated 
the document also reported that the company rockfords largest 
employer was working on a settlement in one and possibly both of 
the actions 
federal charges could lead to the suspension of new government 
contracts for sundstrand which had 579 million in military sales 
in 1987 
but if the company settled the dispute by paying materially 
adverse fines and penalties it might be suspended only 
temporarily from new government business according to sundstrands

the 12nation european economic 
community loses at least 250 billion a year in extra costs and 
lost economic opportunities by staying divided along national 
borders a twoyear study concludes 
the study which was released tuesday is designed to give 
economic undepinning to the trade blocs plan to abolish national 
frontiers and create a single european market by the end of 1992 
the report concluded that fusing the economies of the individual 
member states into one would add 5 percent to the blocs gross 
domestic product and create up to 5 million new jobs 
the report was prepared by a team of economists supervised by 
paolo cecchini a former senior eec official 
jacques delors president of the eec executive commission said 
at a press conference that he hoped the report would launch a 
european debate about economic integration we are simply 
providing food for thought we want to get a debate going he 
said 
he said the purpose of the study was not to provide an economic 
forecast but rather to outline the economic potential of a europe 
united in a single market 
lord arthur cockfield the eec commissioner responsible for the 
integration process gave a more prosaic appraisal of the study 
we wanted to show there is a lot more juice to be squeezed from 
this particular lemon 
pointing to the more than 6000 pages that the report and its 
underlying studies contain cockfield said nothing like it has 
ever been done before 
he said the results show clearly the extent to which the 
division of europe results in noncompetitive behavior missed 
opportunities high unemployment and higher prices 
according to the study the eec stands to gain from market 
integration the equivalent of at least 250 billion a year largely 
by foregoing the cost of border controls and by improving 
productivity and competitiveness 
abolishing controls and removing nontariff barriers to trade 
the report concluded could save up to 992 billion and shave as 
much as 35 percent of the cost of products 
an additional 756 billion could be gained from exploiting 
economies of scale more fully the report estimated 
restoring competition in statecontrolled industries and 
reducing business ineffectiveness would add 57 billion in 
economic benefits the report said 
the study predicted that in addition to boosting output 
employment and the standard of living the creation of a single 
market would simultaneously cool the economy deflating consumer 
prices by an average of 6 percent 
deregulation of public transport the energy industry banking 
indurance and defence procurement would lead to price cuts of up to 
20 percent the report said 
the report estimated that market integration alone would add 45 
percent to the gross domestic product and add 2 million new jobs 
but if combined with tax reduction and increased spending the 
report said a single market would boost gross domestic product by 
7 percent and create 5 million new jobs 
the report did not estimate which eec countries would benefit 
most from the single market but said all 12 were likely to make 
substantial economic gains

grain and soybean futures closed mixed tuesday on 
the chicago board of trade soybeans posted losses most wheat 
contracts made slight gains and corn finished nearly unchanged 
the decline in soybean prices was mostly due to profittaking 
after mondays sharp advances analysts said 
wheat prices also did an aboutface as traders bought contracts 
after a fairly steep drop on monday said victor lespinasse a 
trader for dean witter reynolds inc 
contracts for may and july delivery of corn advanced marginally 
in reaction to news that the government had granted oneyear 
extensions on certain corn loans taken out in 1984 1985 and 1986 
the extensions mean farmers can delay decisions about marketing 
hundreds of millions of bushels of corn that might otherwise have 
gone onto the market this year lespinasse said 
trading volume is expected to drop on wednesday and thursday 
ahead of two eagerly awaited agriculture department reports the 
annual spring planting intentions report and the quarterly grain 
stocks report due out after thursdays close 
at the close wheat was 1 cents lower to 1 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in may at 301 a bushel corn was 1 cent 
lower to cent higher with may at 211 a bushel oats were 1 
cents lower to 3 cents higher with may at 163 a bushel soybeans 
were 3 cents to 6 cents lower with may at 651 a bushel

a law that barred publisher rupert murdoch 
from continuing to own television stations and newspapers in the 
same city was struck down today as unconstitutional by a federal 
appeals court 
the divided panel of the us circuit court of appeals here 
voided a provision passed by congress late last year that would 
force murdoch to sell the boston herald or wfxttv in that city by 
june 30 to comply with rules that forbid single ownership of a 
newspaper and a television station in one city 
the 21 court decision does not affect murdochs 37 million 
sale of the new york post to real estate developer peter kalikow a 
deal that was spurred by the laws enactment as part of a massive 
spending bill 
in his contract to sell the post murdoch retained the right to 
make the first offer for the paper if kalikow should decide to 
sell howard j rubenstein spokesman for both men said the 
contract obliges kalikow to allow murdoch to make a first offer 
for the paper but does not oblige kalikow to accept it 
but lawrence kessler general counsel for news america said 
murdoch was not contemplating repurchasing the post which kalikow 
says he is committed to turning into a profitable newspaper 
kessler also said he was heartened and encouraged that the court 
of appeals shared our concern for the protection of publishers 
constitutional rights 
the courts ruling could enable murdoch to retain temporarily 
ownership of both his boston media outlets if the federal 
communications commission extends his waiver from the enforcement 
of the commonownership rule 
the court ordered the fcc to consider murdochs application to 
extend the temporary waiver that he has held since 1986 
murdoch charged that the law forbidding the fcc to extend his 
temporary waivers for both the new york post and the boston herald 
was politically motivated and amounted to an unconstitutional 
attempt to silence criticism of sen edward m kennedy dmass by 
the herald 
the court ruled that the provision of a massive spending bill 
was unconstitutional because it singled out murdochs news america 
inc 
while the court declined to inquire into congresss motives it 
concluded that the provison strikes at murdoch with the precision 
of a laser beam and therefore violates the equal protection 
clause of the constitution 
the amendment to the spending bill prohibited the fcc from 
extending temporary waivers to the commonownership rules it was 
sponsored by sen ernest hollings dsc and supported by kennedy 
the court did not rule on the merits of any claim that murdochs 
news america publishing inc should retain ownership of both the 
herald and wfxttv but the judges cleared the way for murdoch to 
seek an extension of the june 30 deadline for complying with the 
commonownership rules 
murdoch has indicated he wanted to retain the herald and sell 
the television station if forced to do so 
the court ruled that because murdochs company was the sole 
holder of temporary waivers specified in the hollins amendment the 
law was aimed solely at him 
because the law appears to serve no legitimate purpose except to 
prohibit murdoch from obtaining extensions of his waivers it 
unconstitutionally singled him out the court said 
congresss exclusive focus on a single party clearly 
implicates values similar to those behind the constitutional 
proscription of bills of attainder judge stephen williams wrote 
in an opinion joined by judge laurence silberman such bills are 
aimed at specific individuals 
the safeguards of a pluralistic political system are often 
absent when the legislature zeroes in on a small class of 
citizens he wrote 
nowhere are the protections of the equal protection clause 
more critical than when legislation singles out one or a few for 
uniquely disfavored treatment williams said 
sen edward m kennedy dmass who had the legislation 
attached to the spending bill said in a statement that the courts 
decision does not mean murdoch should retain ownership of his 
boston newspaper and television station 
nothing in the constitution or even the courts decision says 
that rupert murdoch is entitled to be the only newspaper owner in 
american who can buy a broadcasting station and keep his newspaper 
in the same community kennedy said 
he said he continues to believe that congress was on sound 
constitutional grounds when it adopted the provision and that the 
right of congress to take this action will be vindicated by the 
supreme court if the parties appeal todays decision

roper corps board of directors changed 
sides tuesday in the takeover fight for the appliance manufacturer 
saying stockholders should sell to general electric co instead of 
whirlpool corp 
ropers board determined that ges 508 million tender offer was 
clearly superior to whirlpools 470 million one the company said 
in withdrawing a recommendation of whirlpool made march 18 
discussions with whirlpool have not to date led whirlpool 
to propose an increase in the price offered for roper shares 
ropers statement said 
the battle began in february when roper announced it had agreed 
to be acquired by whirlpool for 3750 for each of ropers 94 
million shares outstanding or about 3525 million general 
electric then entered the fray with a bid of 45 per share or 423 
million 
both companies have since increased their bids with ges 
currently at 54 per share and whirlpools at 50 
whirlpool and ge have filed federal court suits challenging each 
others actions with ge claiming the roper board failed to tell 
stockholders of an earlier interest in the company and whirlpool 
complaining ge was trying to sabotage an already announced deal 
hearings are scheduled this week in whirlpools suit 
the board said roper stockholders should withdraw their shares 
already offered to whirlpool and tender them to ge instead 
whirlpool in a statement issued from its benton harbor mich 
headquarters said the company will continue to pursue roper 
our definitive merger agreement with roper still stands 
david r whitwam whirlpools president chairman and chief 
executive said in the statement the roper boards action is 
disappointing in light of its corporate charter to consider the 
best interests of all constituents however it is 
understandable in view of the current price differential and the 
pressures being applied by ge 
roper employs about 4750 people 3000 of them in four georgia 
plants in addition to electric and gas appliances the company 
manufactures tillers lawn mowers and lawn and garden tractors its 
customers include sears roebuck amp co the nations largest 
retailer 
it also manufactures some ge ranges and the fairfield 
connbased company has said its interest in roper stems from that 
association 
roper had net income of 24 million on 703 million in sales for 
the fiscal year ended july 31 
ge which also has financial and broadcasting interests had 
1987 revenues of 405 billion and net income of 29 billion its 
major appliance business was responsible for 472 billion in 
revenue and a pretax operating profit of 490 million 
whirlpool had 42 billion in sales last year

odyssey partners sweetened its tender offer for 
jp stevens amp co to 114 billion tuesday but analysts predicted 
further bidding in the battle for the textile giant 
west pointpepperell inc which has made a 11 billion bid for 
stevens is expected to compete fiercely for the crown jewels 
three stateoftheart factories and licenses for hot designer 
labels that lure consumers around the world to stevens quality 
sheets and towels 
odyssey a new york investment firm said it would pay 64 for 
each of stevens 178 million outstanding shares up from the 
6150ashare tender offer stevens management accepted earlier 
this month 
in consideration for the sweetened offer stevens board 
agreed to pay odyssey up to 8 million if it is acquired by a third 
party for more than 64 a share 
pepperell made its 6250ashare bid after stevens forged its 
agreement with odyssey pepperell had said it might be willing to 
increase its offer to 64 a share if stevens agreed to a friendly 
deal 
a spokesman at pepperells headquarters in west point ga had 
no comment after odyssey announced its increased offer 
but asked in an interview last week whether pepperell would 
consider raising its offer above the conditional 64 a share 
chairman joseph l lanier said i wouldnt preclude it 
in afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange stevens 
rose 37 cents to 6487a share 
odyssey partner brian d young noted in a statement that while 
odysseys bid matched what pepperell said it was prepared to pay 
under friendly terms odysseys tender offer expires on april 11 
10 days ahead of pepperells offer 
investors are likely to find the earlier expiration attractive 
unless pepperell raises its bid 
west pointpepperell wants stevens very badly said george 
zimmerman director of research at gruntal amp co 
the acquisition would quickly further pepperell in its goal of 
becoming a major international marketer of branded products 
not only does stevens have some of the best brand names in the 
business but they have bigger international operations 
particularly in canada and japan said josephine esquivel a 
textile analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc 
pepperells brands include arrow martex lady pepperell and 
burberrys among stevens arsenal of top designer names are ralph 
lauren laura ashley pierre cardin vanderbilt perry ellis and 
givenchy 
in addition to the attraction of the licenses to use those 
names pepperell is keen on acquiring stevens sheet plant in 
clemson sc and two top towel plants in wagram nc analysts 
agreed 
how much higher pepperell can go is another matter esquivel 
noted that the companys debttoequity ratio currently at 28 
percent would jump to 63 percent based on a 64ashare tender 
offer 
odysseys young has charged that a pepperell merger with stevens 
would violate antitrust laws 
pepperell has sought to soothe potential antitrust concerns with 
a plan that includes the sale of half of stevens bath lines and 20 
percent of its sheet lines for about 170 million pepperell signed 
a definitive agreement for the sale with ntc group parent of bibb 
co a textile manufacturer 
but young said the proposed sale to bibb does not cure the 
antitrust problems he said odyssey will strongly present our 
views to the appropriate governmental authorities and will continue 
to oppose any amended proposal if we believe that the antitrust 
problems have not been solved 
bidding for stevens began after it received a leveraged buyout 
offer several weeks ago from a group led by its own senior 
management including chairman whitney stevens a fifthgeneration 
member of the family that founded the company in 1813 
the management group initially offered 43 a share and later 
sweetened its bid to 55 a share in cash and securities in a 
leveraged buyout a company is acquired largely with borrowed money 
repaid with a target companys profits or the sale of assets

new home sales which had fallen for three 
months following the october collapse of the stock market soared 
203 percent in february the fastest increase in almost two years 
the government said tuesday 
the commerce department said that new singlefamily homes were 
sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 628000 units it was 
the first monthly increase since a 14 percent rise in october but 
it still left sales 149 percent below where they were a year ago 
sales had fallen 103 percent in january 68 percent in 
december and 42 percent in november declines which analysts had 
blamed on high mortgage rates and consumer jitters following the 
record plunge in stock prices that occurred on oct 19 
because housing is often the first sector to weaken at the start 
of a new recession the string of declines had raised concerns 
about whether another downturn was imminent 
but analysts said the strong february rebound erased those 
worries and indicated housing should strengthen further in coming 
months 
the february numbers spell relief and optimism said david 
seiders chief economist for the national association of home 
builders we feel we are back on track where we should be 
james christian chief economist of the us league of savings 
institutions said the february housing performance is another 
piece of evidence that we are shrugging off the aftershocks from 
the stock market crash 
christian predicted that new home sales would rise further 
during the spring sales season and help boost sales for the entire 
year to around 650000 while that would be down from the 671000 
new homes sold in 1987 it would still be considered a strong sales 
year for the industry 
analysts said it is unlikely that mortgage rates will fall much 
further fixedrate mortgages currently stand at 999 percent down 
from a high last year of 1158 percent just before the stock market 
decline 
economists predicted rates would begin rising later this spring 
and would probably top 11 percent by the end of the year 
the economy is too strong and the dollar is too weak to 
believe that interest rates will go down from here said martin 
regalia chief economist of the national council of savings 
institutions 
the big february sales rebound was the largest monthly increase 
since a 21 percent gain in march 1986 it was accompanied by a 
sharp decline in prices reflecting in part the reentry into the 
market of firsttime buyers who normally buy less expensive homes 
the median or midpoint price of new homes was 110800 in 
february down 61 percent from the record january price of 
118000 
the average price of a new home fell 46 percent to 139000 
last month down from 145700 in january 
the big jump in sales was propelled by a 429 percent surge in 
sales in the south this region of the country which accounts for 
40 percent of all new homes sold is still 96 percent below the 
yearearlier sales pace 
sales were up 293 percent in the northeast and 182 percent in 
the midwest the west was the only region of the country to suffer 
a sales decline in february a drop of 71 percent

sundstrand corp has agreed in principle 
to plead guilty to filing false statements with the government and 
to pay 125 million in connection with alleged overcharges on 
defense contracts according to published reports tuesday 
sundstrand corp an aerospace contractor previously revealed 
in a financial filing with the government that it would face 
criminal charges resulting from two federal grand jury 
investigations into alleged overcharges 
the wall street journal reported tuesday that sundstrand had 
agreed to the guilty plea and payment in one of those 
investigations and that justice department officials hoped to gain 
an agreement in the second larger investigation 
sundstrand reported a year ago that the government was seeking 
repayment of 135 million plus interest and 1029 million plus 
interest in two separate disputes over contract pricing 
the journal said the two cases taken together could result in 
the largest total payment ever for alleged military contracting 
fraud 
claude bernam a spokesman for sundstrand referred inquiries 
about the investigations to the companys lawyers who were not 
available for comment 
in a report filed recently with the federal securities and 
exchange commission sundstrand acknowledged the government has 
advised that it intends to charge the company with criminal 
violations in both rockford and seattle 
sundstrand is based in rockford and operates a subsidiary in 
redmond wash near seattle that is part of its advanced 
technology group 
sundstrand which makes flight data equipment engine startup 
systems and other electronic equipment for commercial and military 
aircraft said in its sec filing that it was in the process of 
entering a settlement in one or possibly both actions 
such settlements the company also noted in the filing could 
result in the imposition of materially adverse fines and 
penalties 
in the seattle case the newspaper said sundstrand failed to 
disclose improper accounting procedures during negotiations with 
the defense department in the rockford case sundstrand allegedly 
charged private commercial costs to air force and navy contracts 
and subcontracts 
sundstrands military sales last year amounted to 574 million 
and accounted for more than half of all sales in the aerospace 
segment 
in 1986 sundstrand put aside 615 million to cover settlement 
and legal expenses relating to the government disputes as a 
result 1986 profits were down 39 percent 
one analyst said sundstrand has the market presence to weather a 
temporary halt in government business 
the question is is this jeopardizing on a longterm basis 
said steven colbert at prudentialbache securities the answer 
right now is i dont think so right now they have very strong 
market share

the senate on tuesday effectively rejected 
legislation to warn up to 300000 workers a year they risk cancer 
and other diseases from occupational exposure to toxic chemicals 
on a 5242 vote senate sponsors of the housepassed measured 
failed by 18 of the 60 votes necessary on a fourth attempt to break 
off a conservative republican filibuster over the past eight days 
against the unionsought bill 
the bills author sen howard metzenbaum dohio conceded 
defeat but said the issue will not go away 
in this one ive lost he said but as long as workers are 
kept in the dark about occupational hazards we will continue to 
try to bring them light 
the defeat was the first for the aflcio on the senate floor 
since helping return the 100member body to democratic control but 
15 of the senates 54 democrats most of them from the south ended 
up siding with the leader of the filibuster sen orrin hatch 
rutah 
weve had 50 years of these type of giveaway programs that 
dont work said hatch who claimed the measure could cost 
businesses up to 7 billion if exposed workers began filing and 
winning liability suits against their current and former employers 
the bill was aimed at addressing what the national institute of 
occupational safety and health estimates is one in every four 
americans who has been exposed to carcinogens at work most of them 
unaware of it 
metzenbaum the measures chief sponsor repeatedly cited 
american cancer society estimates that warnings to atrisk workers 
could have saved 250000 lives over the next 10 years 
tens of thousands of american workers are dying each year from 
occupational diseases and could prevent many of these deaths by 
telling them the truth that they are at risk he said 
metzenbaum accused the national association of manufacturers and 
the us chamber of commerce of waging an orchestrated campaign 
of misrepresentation innuendo and hype in citing the potential 
costs to employers 
alexander trowbridge the nams president called metzenbaums 
charge irresponsible saying worker health is a prime concern 
of every responsible manager in the country 
we care a great deal about preventing disease from happening 
rather than discovering it after the fact which is what his 
proposal would bring about trowbridge said 
the bill would have established a panel of seven scientific 
experts to identify the most hazardous substances in workplaces and 
the groups of employees most susceptible to disabling diseases 
because of exposure to them 
niosh would have been required to individually notify between 
100000 and 300000 of those atrisk workers every year at an 
annual cost of 25 million employers then would be required to 
finance medical monitoring program for them at a cost of up to 250 
each annually 
if a physician recommended transferring a monitored employee to 
less hazardous work he or she would have had to be paid the same 
level of wages and benefits to them in the new job if no other job 
is available the employee would have been entitled to full wages 
for up to a year after leaving work 
in addition to unions the bill was supported by public health 
and environmental groups the chemical and electronic industries 
and several giant companies most of which have instituted such 
notification programs on their own

congress unconstitutionally singled out 
publisher rupert murdoch by prohibiting his continued ownership of 
newspapers and television stations in the same city an appeals 
court ruled tuesday 
a recently enacted provision barring the federal communications 
commission from extending temporary waivers from its 
crossownership rule is unconstitutional because it strikes at 
murdoch with the precision of a laser beam without a legitimate 
purpose the us circuit court of appeals in washington ruled in a 
21 opinion 
the law violates the the constitutions equal protection clause 
as well as the first amendments guarantee of freedom of the press 
the court said 
the decision means murdoch may petition the fcc to extend past 
june 30 the waiver that allows his news american publishing inc to 
own both the boston herald and that citys wfxttv 
murdoch also had sought an extension of a waiver that allowed 
him to own both the new york post and wnywtv until march 6 but 
the newspaper was sold earlier this month for 37 million to real 
estate developer peter kalikow the decision therefore wont 
affect the posts sale 
lawrence kessler general counsel for news america said murdoch 
has no plans to repurchase the newspaper in light of the courts 
ruling 
the provision that banned the crossownership waiver extension 
had been tucked quietly into a massive spending bill last december 
by sens ernest hollings dsc and edward m kennedy dmass 
in its ruling tuesday the court said the ban was so narrowly 
drawn that it applied only to murdoch who held the only two 
waivers from the crossownership rule 
the court is saying congress should not enact legislation that 
is aimed in a punitive way at a single individual said howard 
squadron a new york attorney who argued the case for news america 
i would think its a benefit to all people who enjoy the first 
amendment freedom squadron said 
howard rubinstein a spokesman for both news america and 
kalikow said news america was gratified with the courts 
ruling and that kalikow has instructed his attorneys to seek to 
purchase a radio station or television station in new york city he 
would not name stations 
rubinstein said kalikow will challenge the crossownership rule 
itself because he believes the reasons for the rule no longer exist 
since there are an ample number of radio and televison stations 
the fcc which defended the laws constitutionality but not the 
policy it enacted appeared as pleased with the decision as 
murdochs lawyers 
the court by this decision has demonstrated that the congress 
does not have a free hand in the regulation of the broadcast 
press fcc chairman dennis r patrick said in a statement i am 
pleased the court will hold the congress to a higher standard when 
first amendment freedoms are implicated 
the court did not specify how the commission should rule on 
murdochs request for an extension except to say political pressure 
from congress should play no role in agency adjudications 
involving important constitutional rights 
the court found that the law had no other purpose than to 
prohibit extensions of the waivers and therefore unconstitutionally 
targeted a specific individual for no legitimate purpose the court 
said 
congresss exclusive focus on a single party clearly 
implicates values similar to those behind the constitutional 
prosription of bills of attainders judge stephen williams wrote 
in an opinion joined by judge laurence silberman bills of 
attainder are aimed at specific people 
murdoch and some politicians had criticized the ban as an 
attempt to muzzle the conservative editorial policies of the 
newspapers particularly the herald which repeatedly has been 
critical of kennedy 
kennedy and hollings however said they merely were trying to 
force murdoch to comply with rules that other publishers must 
observe 
in a statement tuesday kennedy said the courts decision does 
not mean murdoch should retain ownership of his boston newspaper 
and television station 
nothing in the constitution or even the courts decision says 
that rupert murdoch is entitled to be the only newspaper owner in 
american who can buy a broadcasting station and keep his newspaper 
in the same community kennedy said 
he said he believed congress will be vindicated by the supreme 
court if the parties appeal todays decision 
hollings meanwhile said the court has arrested the policeman 
on the beat while the culprit has gone free he called the 
decision a legal contortion that set up murdoch for special 
treatment 
while the court did not speculate on the senators motives it 
noted the provision did not bar new temporary waivers that are 
normally extended to give a company time to divest itself of a tv 
station or newspaper acquired during a merger or acquisition 
nor did congress mention waivers from the crossownership rules 
the court said 
in dissent circuit judge spotswood robinson said congress 
pursued a wholly legitimate purpose when it acted to protect the 
crossownership rule from circumvention or erosion 
even though a statute so narrowly drawn naturally arouses 
suspicions about its legal propriety robinson concluded that 
congress selected a method that was more than adequately related 
to the purpose it sought to achieve 
the issue arose last fall when the fcc was asked in a petition 
to consider abolishing the crossownership rule the fcc said it 
would solicit comments on the idea but the laws enactment barred 
the agency from taking further action during the current fiscal 
year 
murdoch meanwhile has indicated he would keep the herald and 
sell his boston tv outlet if the fcc forces him to divest one of 
the properties

stock prices started out on a strong note with the help of the 
dollars advance in foreign exchange which in turn eased 
inflation fears and pushed interest rates lower a sharp decline in 
the us currency had been largely responsible for the markets 
recent losses 
the fact that the dollar has stabilized and is no longer going 
into a freefall thats a psychological prop said larry 
wachtel market strategist and first vice president at

the dollar was aided in part by reports of central bank 
intervention 
hugh johnson chief investment officer at first albany corp 
said a report showing the index of leading indicators the 
governments chief economic forecasting gauge gained 09 percent 
in february also lent support to stock prices the index had fallen 
in three of the past four months 
maybe those fears that the economy is going to run out of 
steam either this year or next year are unfounded johnson said 
analysts said they were uncertain whether tuesdays rally 
represented a bullish trend or just a muchneeded respite following 
three disappointing sessions 
in light of what weve seen in the equity market today 
much of this action is almost like an oversold bounce said

modest efforts by central banks to support it 
gold prices edged higher republic national bank of new york 
said gold was bid at 45525 a troy ounce as of 4 pm est up from 
45510 late monday 
there were conflicting reports on the extent of intervention by 
central banks although traders agreed the bank of japan bought 
some dollars with yen in the tokyo market 
the federal reserve bank of new york also bought dollars 
tuesday said david h arbesman president of kemper currency inc 
the rally generated by reports of the central banks action 
squeezed out investors who had bet on further declines in the 
dollar forcing them to buy dollars to cover borrowed positions 
arbesman said 
traders who bought dollars were pushing aside the concerns that 
have sent the dollar lower the past several weeks the dollar 
closed monday at its lowest levels since the first week in january 
against major currencies 
the bearish factors include disenchantment with anything being 
really done about the budget the fear of renewed inflation and 
the fear of another stock market collapse arbesman said 
those are all really still in the backs of peoples minds but 
theyre taking a back seat he said 
the dollar showed little reaction to reports tuesday that the 
governments chief economic forecasting gauge rose 09 percent in 
february and sales of new homes shot up 203 percent said david 
godwin chief foreign exchange dealer for the union bank of 
switzerland in new york 
the british pound was bolstered by rumors later firmly denied 
that british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson had resigned 
and by a statement by prime minister margaret thatcher that keeping 
inflation down was the governments top priority 
lawson whose job is equivalent to the us secretary of the 
treasury reportedly has been arguing against allowing the pound to 
continue its recent rise against other currencies

platinum futures prices surged 7 a troy ounce tuesday on the 
new york mercantile exchange as the economic outlook continued to 
brighten and racial unrest in south africa prompted fears of supply 
disruptions analysts said 
on other exchanges gold futures retreated while silver 
advanced energy futures were mixed grains and soybeans were 
mixed livestock and meat were mostly lower and stockindex 
futures advanced 
platinum prices have been gradually reestablishing their 
traditional dominance over gold after falling to an even par with 
the yellow metal late last year when recession fears were 
widespread 
although it is considered a precious metal platinum is also an 
industrial base metal and is more widely used by industry than gold 
in a healthy economy platinum is likely to do better than 
gold said craig sloane an analyst in new york with smith 
barney harris upham amp co the economic activity weve seen in 
the last couple of months is very positive for platinum 
tuesdays government report showing a 09 percent increase in 
february in the index of leading economic indicators further 
dispelled fears that the october stock market collapse was a 
harbinger of recession sloane said 
most platinum comes from south africa and a recent upswing in 
violence there sparked fears of supply problems that helped support 
platinum prices said peter cardillo commodity futures trading 
adviser for josephthal amp co in new york 
platinum settled 7 to 830 higher with the contract for 
delivery in april at 51870 a troy ounce 
tuesdays economic data had little impact on gold and silver 
futures prices which registered only slight moves on new yorks 
commodity exchange 
gold settled 30 cents to 60 cents lower with april at 45560 a 
troy ounce silver was 3 cents to 4 cents higher with march at 
6705 a troy ounce 
indications of continued overproduction by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries sent crude oil futures prices sliding 
lower in light trading on the new york mercantile exchange said 
michael rothman senior energy strategist for merrill lynch capital 
markets 
in addition the market was skeptical that an opec meeting next 
month will produce support for a production cut rothman said 
heating oil futures prices also declined while unleaded gasoline 
gained a bit 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents lower across 
the board with may at at 1698 a barrel heating oil was 02 cent 
to 40 cent lower with april at 4815 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 10 cent lower to 24 cent higher with april at 4826 
cents a gallon 
soybean futures settled lower on the chicago board of trade but 
the grains finished nearly unchanged 
the decline in soybean prices was mostly due to profittaking 
after mondays sharp advances said victor lespinasse a trader for 
dean witter reynolds inc 
contracts for may and july delivery of corn advanced slightly in 
reaction to news that the government had granted oneyear 
extensions on certain corn loans taken out in 1984 1985 and 1986 
the extensions mean farmers can delay decisions about marketing 
hundreds of millions of bushels of corn that might otherwise have 
gone onto the market this year 
wheat settled cent lower to 1 cents higher with may at 301 
a bushel corn was 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with may at 211 
a bushel oats were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with may at 163 a

a bushel

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge shook off the october stock market slump to post a 09 
percent increase in february in a performance which analysts said 
should lay to rest fears of a 1988 recession 
in a second upbeat economic report tuesday the government said 
that sales of new homes which had fallen for three consecutive 
months shot up 203 percent in february the biggest monthly gain 
in almost two years 
the positive economic news helped pull the stock market out of 
its slump in a broadbased rally the dow jones average of 30 
industrials rose 1857 points to 199834 following steep declines 
last thursday and friday and a fractional gain in mondays session 
share prices also were bolstered by a more stable dollar and 
lower interest rates the us currency surged upward from its 
lowest point since early january responding favorably to reports 
of modest efforts by central banks to support it the dollar jumped 
to 12526 japanese yen in late new york trading from 12384 yen 
late monday 
interest rates declined meanwhile as bond prices rose the 
treasurys closely watched 30year bond jumped about point or 
875 for every 1000 in face value its yield which moves 
inversely to its price tumbled to 875 percent from 883 percent 
late monday 
weakness in home sales and in the index of leading economic 
indicators in the months following the oct 19 stock market crash 
had raised fears that the fiveyearold economic recovery was in 
imminent danger of collapsing 
housing is often the first sector to weaken in a new downturn 
and the index of leading indicators is designed to forecast turning 
points in the economy for that reason the february rebounds in 
both were greeted as good news by economists 
i think we can pretty well bury the recession fears said 
robert dederick executive vice president of northern trust co of 
chicago we have dodged the bullet from the stock market decline 
the economy seems to be getting its second wind 
similarly white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the index 
shows that the economy is very promising the size and 
broadbased nature of last months index of leading indicators are 
encouraging 
the 09 percent rise in the leading index was the biggest 
advance since a 1 percent rise last june the index had fallen in 
three of the past four months including declines of 01 percent in 
october 12 percent in november and 11 percent in january 
only a 04 percent increase in december kept the index from 
posting a string of three or more consecutive declines which is 
often viewed as a harbinger of a recession 
analysts said the declines were correctly signalling slower 
growth this year than in 1987 but they said the economy should 
strengthen as it moves into the spring 
the first quarter economic slowdown will be brief and mild and 
the fundamental strengths of the economy will emerge as the months 
go on said lyle gramley chief economist for the mortgage 
bankers association 
gramley predicted that the economy as measured by the gross 
national product would rise 27 percent this year an even more 
optimistic outlook than the administrations prediction of 24 
percent growth 
more than half of the strength in the leading index in february 
came from a big jump in building permit applications 
analysts said the increase in building permits after three 
months of declines reflected optimism on the part of builders that 
home sales would strengthen because of declining mortgage rates 
in the report on home sales the commerce department said new 
singlefamily homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 628000 units last month the first advance since october and 
the biggest gain since march 1986 
the housing rebound suggests that the october crash worries 
have been shaken off said allen sinai chief economist of the 
boston co we have good fundamentals on consumer spending and 
consumer confidence because of strong employment growth and strong 
growth in disposable incomes 
in all five of the available nine indicators were positive 
forces on the leading index in february after building permits 
the sources of strength came from a drop in unemployment claims a 
rise in stock prices faster growth of the money supply and a rise 
in consumer goods orders 
four indicators held the index back the biggest negative factor 
was a decline in the length of the manufacturing workweek followed 
by a decline in orders for plant and equipment a change in raw 
materials prices and a speedup in business delivery times 
considered a negative because it is often a sign of dropping demand 
the various changes left the index at 1906 percent of its 1967 
base of 100 
right now the economy is looking a lot better than we thought 
it was going to look three months ago said david wyss an 
economist with data resources inc of lexington mass 
at the end of last year some analysts had feared the economy 
could suffer a decline in the gnp in the first three months of this 
year something that has not occurred since the end of the 198182 
recession they feared that a big runup in unsold goods would 
cause production cutbacks and rising unemployment at manufacturing 
plants 
while there have been some production declines notably in the 
auto industry employment has risen sharply in the first two months 
of the year pushing the jobless rate down to an 8year low of 57 
percent in february

substitute flights 
about 6000 passengers were expected to be stranded at other 
airports in spain finland denmark and italy caro had said 
earlier 
there arent enough airplanes in all of europe to resolve 
this caro said 
he said the situation was expected to get worse this weekend at 
the height of the easter vacation boom 
by sunday ill be hiding under the bed he said 
echegarray said tour operators made arrangements for palma 
passengers originally scheduled to fly on seven incoming and seven 
outgoing spantax flights all canceled tuesday spantax had 30 
routes 
he said charter airlines air europa canafrica and tae arranged 
to carry spantax passengers some passengers booked on a flight

first city bancorporation of texas inc debt 
holders balked for a third time at tendering securities for a loss 
tuesday and officials responded by granting another extension and 
cutting its compliance goal for a federally assisted bailout 
chicago investor a robert abboud who would become chairman 
under the bailout plan and the federal deposit insurance corp 
decided to modifiy the tender offer to 70 percent for the 
outstanding unsecured publicly held securities of first city 
under the modification the 90 percent minimum tender 
requirement has been eliminated said first city spokesman jim 
day but we still hope to get 90 percent actually wed like to 
get 100 percent 
what were saying is that we can get to 70 percent and still 
close and the projections of the company will be the same 
another condition under the modification is that the new first 
city entity at the time of closing not differ materially from what 
was originally planned because of the lower participation level 
day said 
in addition the terms of the offer have been amended to include 
payment of accrued interest on tendered debt securities through the 
date of acceptance and payment by first city acquisition of such 
tendered securities 
houstonbased first city also extended the deadline for the 
tender offer until april 12 the deadline now has been extended 
four times 
as of tuesday first citys third deadline 62 percent or 140 
million of banks 2258 million in bonds had been tendered only 
51 percent or 115 million were tendered by an earlier march 15 
deadline 
the deadline for debt holders was extended to march 15 when only 
414 percent or 936 million was redeemed for cash by the 
first deadline of march 8 
under the arrangement first city senior debt holders have been 
offered 45 cents on the dollar for their debt while subordinated 
debt holders have been offered 35 cents 
since the current reorganization is the only openbank 
proposal being considered by the fdic it is unlikely under any 
alternative that holders of first city subordinated debt would 
receive anything for their interests holders of first city senior 
public debt would in all likelihood receive at best only a 
fraction of the amounts represented by their securities abboud 
said tuesday 
wall street sources have said that almost 55 million of the 
outstanding bonds can be traced to arbitragers holding out for a 
sweetened offer 
first city with 59 banks in texas and one in south dakota grew 
quickly during the texas oil boom but was hammered by energy and 
real estate losses when oil prices plummeted for 1987 the company 
posted a 11 billion loss 
the bailout plan for texas fourthlargest bank holding company 
calls for 970 million in assistance from the fdic 500 million 
infusion of capital raised privately by an investor group headed by 
abboud and a spinoff of 179 billion in book value of poorly 
performing assets 
on march 4 more than 71 percent of the houstonbased companys 
37 million shareholders approved the controversial bailout 
other options available to the fdic analysts say include 
canceling the abboud deal and reopening bidding for the bank or 
having the fdic itself take over first city
