the victim of a 1983 traffic accident would 
not want to be kept alive in the helpless state in which she has 
been maintained the womans older sister testified at a 
righttodie trial thursday 
last year the parents of 30yearold nancy cruzan who is in 
what doctors call a persistent vegetative state sued the state 
to force doctors to allow her to die by removing a feeding tube 
from her stomach 
it is the first case in missouri to address the question of 
whether food and water can be denied patients like ms cruzan 
assistant attorney general robert presson contends missouri law 
prohibits such a step staff members at the state rehabilitation 
center at mount vernon said removing the feeding tube would violate 
their medical mission 
doctors say ms cruzans brain stem was nearly the only part of 
her brain left intact after she was deprived of oxygen for several 
minutes after the accident 
on thursday the second day of trial in jasper county probate 
court her older sister christy white testified that ms cruzan 
was a vital sometimes headstrong woman who had said on at least 
two occasions that she would not want to live if she could not do 
so independently 
her father joe cruzan of carterville said he could see no 
purpose in forcing her to go through the indignities shes going 
through now 
when she has a bowel movement they have to change her 
diaper he said i know the hospital does the best it can but 
nancy drools sometimes her hair will be wet the pillow her 
gown i just feel like its beneath her dignity to continue like 
this 
lisa perrin a nurse at the rehabilitation center who said she 
has seen ms cruzan daily for the past three years testified i 
was trained to preserve life and i dont want to enhance death 
dr james c davis ms cruzans physician said that a legal 
ruling would help him make a decision but that he still would 
hesitate to counsel the cruzans to pursue their plan 
mentally theyre going to have problems somewhere down the 
line that they brought about the death of their daughter he 
said and if they dont do it they will have the same problem 
with her continued suffering either way theyre going to have 
problems

the people of afghanistan continued to suffer 
human rights abuses at the hands of both government and rebel 
forces last year according to a report by two groups that monitor 
human rights 
the march report of the us helsinki watch committee and the 
asia watch committee is based on a septemberoctober factfinding 
mission to pakistan afghanistans neighbor to the south and a base 
for opposition forces fighting the sovietbacked government 
the reports authors said all requests to visit kabul or other 
cities under the governments control went unanswered 
afghanistan has been the scene of some of the most serious 
human rights violations on record the report said about 
onehalf of the countrys prewar population is either in 
emigration or internally displaced or dead 
the report the committees fourth on human rights violations in 
afghanistan since 1984 noted that most abuses reported previously 
had continued the government is guilty of most of the abuses it 
said 
indiscriminate warfare in the countryside combined with 
totalitarian controls in the cities have brought incalculable 
suffering to the afghan people it said 
resistance groups also were accused of violations as in 
previous reports 
we continue to deplore the execution of prisoners of war by 
the resistance often after a trial that is lacking in most aspects 
of what we consider due process the report said 
it specifically mentioned abuses by the hezbiislami resistance 
group led by gulbaddin hekmatyar 
abuses by this group seem to have become even more extreme in 
the past year and reportedly include politically motivated 
assassinations the taking of hostages the committees said 
if a settlement is reached in afghanistans civil war the 
committees said the hezbiislami and other groups guilty of 
gross human rights violations should not be given much influence 
in a new government 
the report noted seemingly positive developments in 1987 
including the governments call for refugees to return to 
afghanistan and amnesty declarations for thousands of prisoners 
the new yorkbased us helsinki watch committee was founded in 
1979 to promote domestic and international compliance with human 
rights provisions of the 1975 helsinki accords 
the washingtonbased asia watch committee was founded in 1985 to 
promote internationally recognized human rights in asia both are 
private nonprofit groups

about 35 percent of smokers die prematurely 
because of tobacco the american cancer society estimates 
if smokers could just think of those odds as twice as bad as 
those for russian roulette they might understand how dangerous the 
cigarette habit really is harmon eyre national society 
president said in a statement 
the estimate refers to all tobaccorelated causes of death such 
as lung cancer and heart disease a cancer society spokesman said 
it appears in the societys new publication cancer facts amp 
figures 1988 
some 40 percent of male smokers and 28 percent of female smokers 
die prematurely the society said 
the estimate is derived from population data and the higher 
percentage for men reflects the fact that men have historically 
smoked longer and in greater amounts than women rather than any 
significant sexbased difference in risk for individual smokers 
the society spokesman said 
the society estimates that smoking is related to 320000 deaths 
a year including 30 percent of all cancer deaths it blames 
cigarettes for 85 percent of lung cancer cases among men and 75 
percent among women 
among males smokers run more than twice the rate of nonsmokers 
for cancer death while among women the difference is 67 percent 
the society says 
the society also said lung cancer remains the nations leading 
cancer killer within each sex some 152000 new cases are expected 
this year with 139000 deaths

prime minister yitzhak shamir on friday 
attacked us peace proposals for the first time in public saying 
they were fraught with danger and incapable of bringing peace 
to the region 
us secretary of state george p shultz shuttled through the 
region last week to urge arab and israeli acceptance of the plan 
the only word i agree with in the us plan is the name 
shultz shamir was quoted as saying by the israeli daily 
newspaper haaretz 
shamir previously has criticized elements of the us proposal 
in private meetings with party officials but statements published 
friday in a series of interviews constituted his first rejection of 
the plan as a whole 
shamirs comments on the plan were criticized by a highranking 
official in israels leftofcenter labor party which shares power 
in a shaky coalition with shamirs rightist likud bloc 
it would be extremely artificial if the american people hear 
only one unauthorized version former foreign minister abba eban 
told israel radio 
foreign minister shimon peres shamirs rival and a leader of 
the labor party supports the plan 
yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation 
organization has rejected the us plan the new york times 
reported in its saturday editions it said that in an interview 
thursday in tunis tunisia where the plo has its headquarters 
arafat said the plo would no longer settle for indirect 
representation through a joint jordanianpalestinian delegation as 
suggested by shultz 
earlier this week arafats fatah branch of the plo had 
criticized the us plan 
israel and the united states consider the plo a terrorist 
organization israel has declared it will never negotiate with the 
plo but would consider talks with a combined delegation of 
jordanians and nonplo palestinians 
in cairo president hosni mubarak of egypt and jordans king 
hussein said friday that shamir would pit himself against world 
opinion if he rejects the us peace plan 
i dont think that this shamirs comments will lead to a 
comprehensive settlement or a comprehensive peace which is very 
important for the whole area and the whole world mubarak told 
reporters after a 3hour meeting with the jordanian leader 
i agree hussein said 
shultz has requested an israeli decision on the plan by the time 
shamir arrives in washington on monday and has publicly complained 
that both the arabs and the israelis are unwilling to compromise 
the plan calls for israel to give up land in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip in exchange for peace in the region 
shamir said he was particularly disturbed by the part of the 
us proposal that calls for kicking off direct negotiations with 
an international conference 
that he told the englishlanguage jerusalem post obligates 
me to resist with all my power and my power to resist is very 
great 
he said the united states had changed its position on the 
convening of such a conference without reason and he warned the 
proposal was fraught with danger 
shamir told haaretz that while the united states is undeniably a 
friend to israel every bit of it the us plan was an attempt 
to satisfy the arabs 
the rightwing leader has twice blocked cabinet votes on whether 
israel should approve the plan 
the issue is expected to come up a final time before the shamir 
trip during a cabinet meeting sunday 
eban a member of peres labor party announced friday he would 
travel to the united states hours before shamir to explain labors 
position on the peace plan to the americans 
the fact is that mr shamir did not get any authorization to 
refuse the peace plan no parliament and no cabinet agreed to this 
refusal eban said on israel radio 
speaking on israel radio shamir said he would explain to shultz 
that his plan as it is seen today cant solve the problem of 
peace in our area and cant guarantee the safety and security of 
the state of israel 
despite shamirs tough stand us officials are still hopeful 
that shultz and reagan may be able to persuade the prime minister 
to change his mind diplomatic sources said 
shamir however stressed that he will bring the americans his 
own suggestions on how to make the plan more acceptable 
this paper the plan given to us is not moses commandments 
from mt sinai shamir said on the radio 
shamir aide yossi ahimeir told the associated press the prime 
minister would suggest implementing palestinian selfrule in the 
territories on a stepbystep basis testing the idea in a single 
city for example 
in addition the prime minister will suggest that instead of an 
international conference peace talks be held under sovietamerican 
auspices ahimeir said 
finally ahimeir said the prime minister wants a more flexible 
timetable than that sought by washington which has called for 
starting talks on an interim solution in the territories by may and 
opening negotiations on the final status of the west bank and gaza 
by december 
shamir wants to delay talks on the final status until selfrule 
is implemented throughout the territories his aide said

japans latest comic book heros are emperor 
hirohito and former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone 
comic books widely read in japan by both children and adults 
often are used as teaching aids for such topics as history 
economics or etiquette and even to explain frictions with the 
united states over trade 
the hirohito comic book which is in hard cover and is titled 
tenno heika emperor follows the 86yearold monarch from 
childhood through world war ii including his historic surrender 
broadcast in 1945 and into his quiet retirement in tokyos 
imperial palace 
the book on nakasone is called yatchans which was the 
former prime ministers childhood nickname it is published 
quarterly by nakasones office and sent to supporters and 
constituents 
japanese prime ministers once they step down traditionally 
fade into the political background and take the role of party 
elder occasionally seen but seldom heard 
but nakasone whose term in office ended this past november has 
stayed in the news through trips abroad and the establishment of a 
thinktank group yatchans helps keep attention focused on him 
the idea for a cartoon newsletter has been gestating for a 
long time and it just happens that it was produced after 
nakasonesan left office said masaki donji a private secretary 
to nakasone there was no deliberate timing to keep him in the 
news 
while purporting to depict faithfully the characters lives and 
careers the comic books seem overly flattering 
hirohito is shown as barrelchested and cheerful rather than the 
aged and stooped man he is now 
nakasone now 67 is shown as burly with round eyes and a 
uncharacteristic full head of hair 
but the comic book presents littleknown facets of nakasones 
life 
an essay by nakasones wife tsutako says that in his younger 
days when he was known as yatchan nakasone pranced about in his 
underwear after baths humming music from swan lake and on state 
visits abroad as prime minister he grudgingly allowed his wife off 
elevators first but upon returning to japanese soil would 
instantly declare ladies first is over 
yatchans opens with nakasones return from the 1987 summit 
in venice italy with photos of the six inflight meals he was 
served on his special jet it then flashes back to the beginning a 
fieryeyed nakasone resigning from tokyos metropolitan police 
department in 1946 to work toward japans postwar reconstruction 
he reveals himself as an idealist who patterns himself after 
sakura sogo a 17thcentury village headman who was executed for 
seeking reduced taxes for poor peasants 
he eats potatoes for lunch an expression of humility and 
chooses a white bicycle for his first political campaign because 
hirohito rode a white horse 
subscriptions to yatchans are 2000 yen 1550 a year 
the booklet also includes reproductions of nakasones paintings 
and samples of his haiku poetry 
the hirohito book divulges some imperial trivia the emperor has 
no surname reached adulthood at age 18 20 for ordinary japanese 
and cannot adopt children or vote 
it also explains that his duties include opening sessions of the 
diet parliament closing sessions of the house of 
representatives receiving foreign ambassadors and formally 
approving laws government decrees amendments to the constitution 
and treaties 
hirohito once regarded as a living god remains a sensitive 
subject in modern japan and ribbing of royalty by the press is 
neither tolerated nor attempted 
but the comic book touches on some sensitive points in the 
emperors life including an assassination attempt the great kanto 
earthquake of 1923 for which hirohito was later criticized for not 
doing enough for his people and a 1936 military rebellion that led 
to the death of one of his favored ministers 
it also touches briefly on his role in world war ii although it 
reveals little about his activities or motivations during the 
conflict and portrays hirohitos famed speech imploring the nation 
in august 1945 to bear the unbearable surrender 
the emperors trips to europe and the united states are shown 
including protesters waving signs saying go home and fascist 
hirohito it ends with him enjoying his favorite pastimes 
walking along the beach and studying marine biology 
an official of the imperial household agency which tends to the 
imperial familys duties and needs said the agency had nothing to 
do with the comic book and extended neither approval or assistance 
in its production

graffiti the ubiquitous writing that is 
spraypainted on mosques schools and shops is a guide to 
political happenings in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
from the mount of olives in jerusalem to the farmlands of gaza 
the walls are a bulletin board for political groups to proclaim 
their ideologies and issue public appeals 
let the gaza strip be in flames for shultz said a wall in 
gaza city shortly before the recent middle east shuttle of 
secretary of state george p shultz 
a slogan in black paint on the wall of the beit al may refugee 
camp in the west bank declared disgrace will face collaborators 
glory to our heroic martyrs 
it was signed by the united national leadership of the uprising 
a name used by supporters of yasser arafats palestine liberation 
organization 
a more religious tone was struck nearby paradise for our 
martyrs and god is great victory to islam 
this was signed by hamas arabic for zeal the signature of the 
moslem brotherhood a fundamentalist sunni moslem group that 
opposes plo support for a negotiated settlement 
islam is the solution and the alternative said a slogan 
signed by the islamic resistance also believed to be the work 
of moslem brothers 
other wall decorations in the occupied territories were signed 
by shaabiya george habashs popular front for the liberation 
of palestine and democratia nayef hawatmehs democratic front 
for the liberation of palestine 
one was the work of supporters of abul abbas the mastermind of 
the hijacking of the italian cruise ship achille lauro in 1985 
on the mount of olives a wall declared palestinianarab 
solidarity lives on 
this slogan possibly written by supporters of jordan is a 
rarity because sentiment in the west bank and gaza has been 
strongly against arab states 
the feeling is that arab states have failed to support the 
rebellion against israeli occupation and some notably jordan fear 
that the revolutionary fervor will cross its borders 
as a result slogans supporting syria damascusbased 
palestinian groups and jordans king hussein are noticeably absent 
in gaza city residents of the welltodo ramali neighborhood 
were chastized by a piece of graffito scrawled on the mosque in 
palestine square courage to the people of the ramali quarter 
it said mocking the inaction of the middle class 
some wallwriting has called for specific action such as ones 
in gaza that demanded the resignation of arab tax collectors and 
arab police officers 
arab employes of the income tax and value added department 
must resign otherwise we will said the chilling warning in 
downtown gaza city 
forty taxmen quit their jobs as directed and new graffiti 
written in blue spray paint replaced the old yes yes for the 
step taken by our honorable brothers in resigning from the tax 
department and yes to the resignation of the police 
moderates have also come in for a pounding on the walls which 
tend to reflect more hardline views down with hanna siniora and 
fayez abu rahme declared a slogan attacking the two palestinians 
who met with shultz in washington last month 
israels army has periodically tried to censor the wall writing 
in nablus a reporter saw arab prisoners watched by armed 
israeli soldiers using black paint to blot out slogans such as 
death to israel written in red on the metal shutters of shops 
the political graffiti has also spread to israel where the 
division between left and right is played out on the walls of the 
beachfront tayellet or promenade in tel aviv 
arabs go to the arab world said one declaration 
reflecting the extreme rightwing view that arabs should leave 
israeliheld territory 
enough of the occupation countered another reflecting the 
leftwing viewpoint that israel should withdraw from the west bank 
and gaza strip

the discovery in spain of a car bomb destined for 
gibraltar was a relief to the british government helping ease 
political embarrassment by proving a tragedy had been averted by 
the killing of three unarmed ira members 
thwarting the irish republican army operation in the british 
colony through pooled british irish and spanish intelligence was a 
triumph for international cooperation against terrorism but the 
circumstances raised questions 
was it necessary to shoot the guerrillas dead when they were 
unarmed why did britain wait 24 hours to declare the falsity of 
official reports that a car bomb already had been parked at the 
gibraltar governors residence 
the guerrillas were shot sunday on tuesday spanish police 
found a car laden with explosives in a parking lot at marbella a 
resort about 45 miles up the coast of southern spain from the 
fortress colony 
prime minister margaret thatchers supporters said the discovery 
vindicated the army in the shootings 
i am delighted said lawmaker ivor stanbrook who heads a 
parliament committee on nothern ireland this confirms all the 
evidence which showed that the actions of the british security 
services were absolutely justified 
two men and a woman were shot down at midday sunday as they 
walked from a car they had parked at the governors residence 
called the convent a public changing of the guard ceremony was 
scheduled for tuesday morning involving a british army unit just 
transferred from northern ireland 
men dressed in jeans did the shooting and were said to be 
members of the elite special air services undercover unit the sas 
has been involved in several operations against the outlawed ira a 
mainly roman catholic group fighting to drive the british from 
protestantdominated northern ireland 
protests came from the irish republic and from inside britain 
the masscirculation press backed mrs thatcher but the daily 
telegraph usually progovernment in irish matters said britain 
should give illwishers no further grounds to suggest that the 
authorities operate a shoottokill policy against terrorists 
in dublin the respected irish times commented there is 
emerging a profound difference between british and irish attitudes 
on the proper response which is demanded by terrorism 
immediately after the shootings spanish police and british 
officials in gibraltar spoke of a gun battle and a car bomb 
then the ira said early monday the slain trio were in gibraltar 
on active service reinforcing britains contention that the 
bomb was in place 
britains armed forces minister ian stanley described the car 
parked near the governors residence as a car bomb and british 
press reports spoke of hundreds of pounds of explosives 
not until monday afternoon did sir geoffrey howe the foreign 
secretary tell a surprised house of commons there were no 
explosives in the car and police were searching for another vehicle 
official british sources say confusion arose because of 
assumptions based on spanish intelligence and underlined by the ira 
reference to active service 
why the immediate resort to gunfire the response was that 
security forces could not be sure the guerrillas were not armed 
reporters in london were told mairead farrell an ira veteran 
fumbled in her handbag and could have been going for a gun 
for some explosive device anything 
on tuesday the irish government said it was gravely 
perturbed that unarmed irish people should have been shot dead 
when it appears they could have been arrested 
this enraged british officials and one said privately a lot 
of british people are beginning to wonder if they the irish are 
serious about combating terrorism 
british officials said the 145 pounds of explosives packed into 
the car found at marbella timed to explode during the military 
ceremony tuesday could have killed more than 100 people the 
guerrillas apparently parked the first vehicle to secure a space 
for the car bomb when arrived later 
the shooting came at an awkward moment in angloirish relations 
tensions arose in january when britain announced it would not 
prosecute northern ireland police officers involved in killing six 
roman catholics five of them guerrillas but unarmed in three 
incidents at the end of 1982 
those shootings had remarkable similarities to that in 
gibraltar the irish times said 
soon after the government announcement a british soldier in a 
watchtower shot an unarmed catholic civilian dead at a checkpoint 
on the irish border the soldier who is in custody said it was an 
accident but the irish government ordered its own inquiry

eastern airlines says it will appeal a 
contemptofcourt citation imposed by a judge who ruled that plans 
to transfer the airlines shuttle operations to a new corporate 
entity violate a 1987 injunction 
us district judge john h pratt ruled thursday that the 
miamibased airline was in contempt of his july 2 1987 order that 
it maintain the status quo in working conditions for 12000 
employees represented by the international association of 
machinists and aerospace workers 
although the preliminary injunction issued last summer dealt 
with a separate labor dispute pratt said his order also applied to 
any plans to change the working conditions of union workers that 
would create a major dispute as defined by the railway labor act 
the judge scheduled a march 18 hearing to determine what 
sanctions to impose against eastern the judge could impose a daily 
fine to force eastern to halt its plans to transfer the shuttle to 
a new corporate entity under its parent texas air corp 
in a complicated financial deal announced last month texas air 
will purchase the shuttle operation for 225 million the federal 
aviation administration must approve the transaction and give an 
operating certificate to the new operator to take over the shuttle 
which operates between washington new york and boston 
airline spokesman robin matell said easterns view is that the 
courts ruling is incorrect and we intend to file an expedited 
appeal in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia 
we are confident the court will rule in our favor 
the union meanwhile said in a statement that the courts 
order today sends a message to texas air that it is not above the 
law and it too must comply with the railway labor act 
pratt found that the proposed transfer to texas air 
significantly changes the working conditions of iam members 
we find that the proposed spin off of easterns air shuttle 
operations to the new air shuttle is not fundamentally different 
from the proposed spin off of easterns fleet services employees 
to air ground services the judges opinion said 
that spinoff which was barred last summer involved plans to 
transfer ground crews and baggage handlers to a new subsidiary 
called air ground services inc 
easterns serious financial problems do not change the fact 
that it proposed a spin off of the air shuttle is in clear 
violation of our july 2 1987 order which whatever doubts eastern 
had as to its meaning and application it made no attempt to have 
clarified or modified the judge said 
the judge noted that eastern announced the deal a day after it 
dropped its appeal of the preliminary injunction in the air ground 
case 
pratt accepted the unions contention that spinning off the air 
shuttle could undermine the machinists bargaining position with 
the company if fewer than 50 percent of the air shuttles 
employees opt to join the iam machinists who transferred to the 
new subsidiary from eastern would be without union representation 
the judge noted 
the decision is the latest in a series of complicated and often 
bitter legal fights eastern is having with its union 
in a separate action the air line pilots association is trying 
to bar eastern from contracting with an air freight hauler to train 
pilots to operate the companys planes in the event of a strike 
this spring 
the pilots union has asked another federal judge here to issue 
a temporary restraining order to prevent the use of eastern 
aircraft by orion air inc 
so far one plane has been leased to orion to train pilots who 
would fly eastern aircraft in the event the pilots honor a strike 
by the machinists union according to court testimony the union 
contends this arrangement circumvents the labor contract that 
specifies that only its members can operate eastern planes 
eastern contends that the labor agreement does not prevent it 
from leasing its aircraft to other companies

president reagan has released a symbolic wish 
list of projects he wants congress to strike from its spending 
plan but there appears little chance capitol hill will pay much 
attention 
james c miller iii director of the office of management and 
budget said that if the list were adopted the savings for fiscal 
1988 alone would amount to 115 billion 
miller who released the list thursday said the money saved 
could be used either to reduce the deficit or pay for more 
meaningful projects 
the items were included in the 600 billion catchall spending 
bill approved at the end of last years congressional session 
im hopeful congress will respond to it miller said when 
asked whether the cuts had any chance of gaining congressional 
attention 
the list which has no legal power has no effect unless 
congress moves to adopt it the presidents request was not in the 
form of legislation and even when he has made such requests 
formally they have received little support in congress 
reagans effort appears to fall short of the pledge he made in 
his state of the union address in january 
in his speech reagan repeated his longstanding request for the 
lineitem veto which would allow him to delete specific items from 
congress spending bills 
in lieu of such power reagan said he intended to send back to 
congress in 30 days those items as rescissions which if i 
had the authority to line them out i would do so 
instead of sending the formal rescissions to congress reagan 
sent the informal list 
miller explained that the president decided not to send the 
formal rescission list because many members of congress had argued 
such an action would upset the bipartisan agreement on the budget 
reached last year by the white house and congress 
this is not an ordinary year miller said referring to the 
lengthy negotiations that produced the budget agreement 
gop sources on capitol hill who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the strategy was adopted to avoid electionyear 
clashes with republican lawmakers who won spending projects for 
their home districts last year 
in proposing a formal rescission reagan freezes spending on 
those items for 45 days and gives procedural advantages to those in 
congress supporting the effort after the 45day period the 
spending would be restored unless the rescissions were approved 
in his 46page informal list reagan cited a myriad of projects 
from around the country including the construction of a ski lift 
in idaho 15 building projects at universities or medical schools 
and even a program to establish a fund to preserve lighthouses 
sen james mcclure ridaho won approval for 64 million for a 
kellogg idaho gondola in the 600 billion spending bill approved 
late last year the money was in appropriations for a forest 
service program that is supposed to pay for development and 
management of forests 
the 15 construction projects included 4 million for a cancer 
research center at the medical university of south carolina and 
75 million for a pediatric research center at the childrens 
hospital of pittsburgh 
the list also included historic preservation grants with the 
national park service that would establish a bicentennial 
lighthouse fund to distribute matching grants for the preservation 
of lighthouses the list did not give an exact amount for the item 
saying only that it amounted to less than 50000

army bases across the country are running out 
of tuition assistance funds for soldiers because of a 30 million 
cut in the armys education budget according to college groups 
the army has put new restrictions on its tuition assistance 
which helped 188000 soldiers and officers pay for college and 
graduate school last year 
allan w ostar president of the american association of state 
colleges and universities said the cutbacks will have a direct 
impact on thousands of individuals who want to take college 
classes 
it will only hurt us all if individuals enlisted in the army 
do not have the opportunity to get the education they need he 
said 
frank mensel vice president of federal relations for the 
american association of community and junior colleges said the 
army has shifted education funds into recruiting 
lt col greg rixon an army spokesman said the cutbacks were 
triggered by pentagon budget reductions that congress and the 
reagan administration recently ordered to hold down the federal 
deficit 
the education budget was cut to 966 million originally 35 
million of the armys 126 million education budget for fiscal 1988 
was targeted for tuition assistance 
rixon said armys personnel chief did have the option to move 
money around among his education civilian training and 
recruiting accounts but there was a relatively uniform reduction 
across the board 
the college groups are lobbying to get at least 11 million 
restored for tuition assistance even at that level ostar said 
a number of programs would still come to a grinding halt but at 
least it is a more realistic and equitable approach to budget 
reduction 
the army has requested a total education budget of 104 million 
for fiscal 1989 which starts oct 1 
many soldiers pursue their college or graduate studies at state 
campuses and community colleges near military bases 
the army once covered 90 percent of a gis cost of taking 
classes rixon said it now pays 75 percent of tuition costs up to 
80 a semester hour for undergraduate study and 165 for graduate 
study 
he said area commanders are being allowed to tailor the program 
to meet their local needs 
but the army has ruled out providing tuition assistance for 
soldiers who are entitled to vietnamera gi bill benefits for 
college and it will not pay for a degree that is lower or lateral 
to one a soldier already has 
in general subject to the area commanders discretion the army 
is not paying any tuition for lieutenant colonels or above or 
paying for graduate school for enlisted soldiers or warrant 
officers rixon said

the chicago tribune illinois largest newspaper 
endorsed republican bob dole in the states presidential primary 
even as the kansas senators campaign appeared to falter 
in an editorial titled why illinois should pick dole the 
newspaper said in its friday editions that dole needs a big primary 
win to stay alive in his race against vice president george bush 
for the gop presidential nomination 
the vice presidents impressive qualifications and his 
commanding lead notwithstanding the tribune hopes that sen dole 
gets that big win and endorses him in the illinois republican 
primary on tuesday the editorial said 
doles campaign has been reeling from its dismal showing in the 
super tuesday primaries he pulled television commercials off the 
air in illinois and laid off more than half his staff thursday 
campaign spokeswoman dale tate said thursday that dole intended 
to remain a candidate but a campaign aide speaking on condition 
of anonymity said campaign officials were discussing whether the 
senate minority leader should withdraw from the illinois contest 
the very lead that bush amassed on super tuesday was cited by 
the tribune as one of its reasons for endorsing dole 
the combination of mr bushs incumbency and the personal 
popularity of president reagan has brought the vice president to 
the brink of nomination without the kind of campaign test both he 
and the republican party need to have a chance in november the 
editorial said 
so far the fight for the 1988 republican nomination has been 
a replay of the 1984 democratic one in which former vice president 
walter mondale muscled out all the challengers early and sailed on 
to a mighty debacle in the general election 
while saying that bushs identification with the administration 
and policies of president reagan gives him strength among 
republican primary voters the tribune suggested that 
identification with reagan might backfire in the general election 
nowhere have the republican candidates asked or answered the 
kind of harsh questions the democrats surely will raise in november 
about the reagan administration whose colors mr bush has been 
able to wave more furiously than anyone else the editorial 
continued 
yet voter concern over these issues shows up in opinion polls 
that often reflect sen dole as a stronger party standardbearer 
than mr bush in matchups with democrats it said

the two homestate favorites in the democratic 
presidential fields got the most applause thursday as five of the 
partys presidential contenders appeared at an illinois democratic 
party dinner a few days before the states critical primary 
right after the dinner they participated in a lowkey forum 
sponsored by the roosevelt center for american policy studies 
unlike in the candidates debates held throughout the campaign 
there was no byplay between the contenders and not a cross word 
about each others positions 
during both events the candidates stuck closely to their 
standard stump speeches 
at the dinner illinois sen paul simon known for his trademark 
bow ties and hornrimmed glasses drew laughter and applause when 
he said i want your vote in a beauty contest believe it or 
not 
simon went on to say i offer you not a 30second commercial 
but 30 years service to the people of this state and this nation 
you will not meet me through a commercial said jackson the 
other illinois resident in the presidential race 
both simon and jackson and running barebones campaigns with 
little or no money left for advertising dukakis is the only 
democrat with the funds to run a fullscale advertising campaign 
directed at illinois voters 
simon who bypassed the super tuesday contests earlier this 
week is hoping to get back into contention with a strong vote from 
his home state 
jackson did well on super tuesday and is regarded as a storng 
contender in illinois 
gov michael dukakis of massachusetts rep richard gephardt of 
missouri and sen albert gore jr of tennessee also are bidding for 
support in the primary 
at the forum gore called for an allout war on drugs and 
repeated his new campaign theme that he wants to bring the 
democratic party back to the neighborhoods 
dukakis described himself at the forum as a fullemployment 
democrat 
on foreign policy he said weve got to get a lot tougher on 
south africa saying that ought to include tougher sanctions to 
press that country to do away with its racial segregation policies

frederic remington the painter and sculptor 
best known for his depiction of the wild west deserves recognition 
as an american master say the curators of a traveling exhibit of 
his work that opens here today 
remington has been seen superficially says michael edward 
shapiro chief curator at the st louis art museum hes been 
stereotyped as a cowboy artist when he was a very sophisticated new 
yorker who drew from a lot of sources and created his own style 
which has astonishingly imprinted itself on the conscience of our 
country 
shapiro and peter h hassrick director of the buffalo bill 
historical center in cody wyo organized frederic remington 
the masterworks the first major traveling exhibit of remingtons 
work 
the exhibition consists of 46 paintings and drawings and 20 
bronze sculptures remington created from 1889 when he was 28 
until he died in 1909 at age 48 of complications from appendicitis 
among the works are a dash for the timber an 1889 painting 
acknowledged as remingtons first masterpiece and the bronco 
buster possibly the bestknown american bronze sculpture of the 
19th century 
remington began his art career as an illustrator with his wild 
west scenes turning up in several popular magazines including 
harpers weekly his work illustrated what shapiro describes as the 
forces of nature and man and the risk of death and danger in the 
west in the action and energy of remingtons horses and horsemen 
he was especially successful at capturing the image of the horse 
bucking rearing lunging running at breakneck speed there 
was never a more vivid depiction of the american horse shapiro 
adds 
indeed remington once told a drinking companion that if he 
could have one thing written on his tombstone it would be he 
knew the horse 
his subject was always the horse and its rider the 
indianfighting soldier or the cowboy but the west of the 
homesteader the farmer and the frontierending railroads held no 
interest for him 
while the rest of the country spoke of the advance of the 
frontier the taming of the west as a positive force in the 
building of american civilization to remington the frontier was 
receding and in the end a tragic loss historian david 
mccullough writes in the shows catalog 
remington was born oct 4 1861 in canton ny the son of a 
newspaper proprietor he grew up in canton and ogdensburg ny 
then enrolled in the school of fine arts and joined the football 
team at yale university 
he dropped out of yale after a year and a half when his father 
died and at the age of 21 he headed west to make his fortune 
plunking down part of his inheritance on a sheep ranch near 
peabody kan 
the sheep ranch failed and remington bought into a kansas city 
saloon which also failed his new wife had left him to go back to 
new york remington headed west again to sketch his way through new 
mexico and arizona 
but by 1885 remington was back in new york reunited with his 
wife and establishing himself as a magazine illustrator in 1887 
harpers weekly carried 39 of his sketches and drawings and the 
next year more than 70 
remingtons drawings also began to appear in st nicholas and 
outing magazines he was commissioned by century illustrated 
magazine to illustrate a series of articles by a young theodore 
roosevelt the series later was made into a book titled ranch 
life and the hunting trail 
despite his popular success remington was never a critical 
success says shapiro 
his work was just seen as cowboys and indians he says 
and there was a belief that cowboys and indians wasnt serious 
subject matter 
the exhibit goes next to the buffalo bill historical center in 
cody wyo the museum of fine arts in houston and closes at the 
metropolitan museum of art in new york

said thursday 
in a statement from its tulsa okla headquarters sun said 
that 176000 gallons of toluene were missing after the break in the 
pipeline which leads from a sun refinery in toledo to one in 
marcus hook pa 
earlier officials estimated that between 80000 and 100000 
gallons had leaked into a marshy area and made its way into the 
sandusky river 
the spill forced the city of fremont to evacuate 5000 people 
and impose a water emergency for several days until a method was 
devised to filter the chemical out of the drinking water the city 
draws from the river 
sun said a significant share of the additional amount that

talks aimed at ending a fourday strike by 
film and tv scriptwriters broke off thursday 
in new york meanwhile two unions representing 100000 actors 
set a march 21 deadline for a strike against makers of tv and radio 
commercials 
talks between the alliance of motion picture and television 
producers and the striking writers guild of america had gone on 
here under the auspices of a federal mediator 
marty waldman a guild spokesman said the producers broke off 
the talks 
a spokesman for the producers herb steinberg said the 
scriptwriters demands are so unrealistic that further talks 
would be fruitless theyre not even in the same neighborhood 
in an assessment of the economics involved 
no new negotiations were set the 9000 scriptwriters walked out 
sunday over creative control and royalties from reruns 
in view of the seriousness of the strike and its impact on the 
industry we had hoped that continued talks might bring us better 
results said mona mangan executive director of the writers 
guild of americaeast 
we deeply regret that the companies do not view these talks as 
moving us closer together she said 
the strike in its fourth day thursday has not yet had a 
widespread effect on the movie and tv industry but has delayed the 
debut of at least two series and has forced the david letterman and 
johnny carson shows into reruns 
it could shorten the tv season if producers failed to stock 
enough scripts or discovered the need for extensive rewriting 
in new york leaders of the screen actors guild and the american 
federation of television and radio artists announced a march 21 
deadline for a strike against the american association of 
advertising agencies and the association of national advertisers 
union members voted 93 percent to 7 percent march 2 to authorize 
a walkout according to a statement from the unions the last 
strike of its kind lasted seven weeks in 197879 
the current contract expired feb 6 but was extended while 
negotiations continued over such key issues as the industrys 
insistence on removing costofliving increases and the unions 
demand for higher compensation for commercials shown on cable 
television the union said 
there was no answer thursday night at the new york offices of 
the american association of advertising agencies the unions 
negotiate in the field of tv commercials radio commercials are 
under aftras jurisdiction 
in a strike sag and aftra members would be asked not to perform 
or audition for commerciials and to terminate the producers right 
to use any commercial beyond its maximum period of use the unions 
said 
some of the most popular shows were near the end of their work 
schedules when the scriptwriters went on strike the episode 
closing out the popular eightyear run of magnum pi has been 
written 
i have a lot of projects that are jeopardized now said 
executive producer jennifer alward there are options on books 
that will run out if the scripts arent delivered on time if the 
strike goes three months what do i do 
wes kenney executive producer of the abc soap opera general 
hospital said i have enough scripts to last me through any 
strike 
writers working on the academy awards ceremonies slated for 
worldwide broadcast april 11 said they left its script half written

the military regime of gen manuel 
antonio noriega made its army payroll but panamas deposed 
president and economists predicted it will not be able to pay civil 
servants next week 
that could further erode support for the general chief of the 
15000strong panama defense forces and considered the real power 
behind panamas civilian government 
the government had to withdraw substantial funds from the 
central national bank of panama and divert receipts from 
stateowned utilities in order to back the army payroll thursday 
diplomatic sources said speaking on condition of anonymity 
in other developments thursday panamas banks defied a 
government order to reopen on a limited scale saying there simply 
wasnt enough cash available to do business 
in washington the house voted overwhelmingly to demand 
noriegas ouster and the reagan administration considered imposing 
sanctions on panama including withholding payments for panama 
canal operations due by march 15 
also the panamanian government ordered five private television 
stations to close indefinitely but did not say why 
eric arturo delvalle whose noriegaorchestrated removal from 
the presidency feb 26 led to us economic pressure predicted the 
government would not be able to meet its midmarch payrolls for 
public employees 
the government will not be able to pay all civil servants and 
that will create another problem delvalle said 
delvalle who has been in hiding since his ouster made the 
statement in a taperecorded response to written questions from the 
chicago tribune 
he was dismissed hours after he tried to fire noriega who is 
under federal indictment in the united states on charges of 
trafficking in colombian cocaine and money laundering 
attorneys representing delvalle who still is recognized by the 
united states as panamas legitimate president have blocked the 
transfer of an estimated 50 million in panamanian government funds 
held in us banks 
popular resentment toward noriegas regime could rise if it 
cannot meet its obligations to workers after paying the military 
public school teachers and other government workers are 
scheduled to receive their semimonthly paychecks monday and 
tuesday the total payroll including the militarys is estimated 
at more than 38 million about six times the amount of money the 
government reportedly has on hand 
private economists estimated the governments reserves at about 
5 million making it unlikely it will be able to meet next weeks 
payroll 
the national banking association which represents 97 of the 118 
financial institutions that make panama a major international 
banking center said thursday that its members are in no 
condition to resume operations 
the association on wednesday had ordered its members to reopen 
but only to accept deposits and make transfers of funds between 
banks calling the move a first step toward resumption of full 
banking services 
but in a statement the following day it said the government 
still had not been able to guarantee its members enough money a 
run on deposits that began with opposition demonstrations last 
summer and accelerated after delvalles ouster prompted the banks 
to close on march 1 
the government ordered the banks to close last week saying it 
could not provide them with enough money because of the legal 
action in the united states 
panamas currency is the us dollar 
in an interview shown thursday on the caracol television chain 
in colombia noriega again denied drug trafficking charges and said 
his accusers were paid 15 million to make their claims he did 
not elaborate 
noriega rejected for reasons of sovereignty and dignity the

energy secretary john herrington says foreign 
money may pay for up to half the 44 billion superconducting super 
collider project and house committee members want the 
international commitments before approving us funds 
japan taiwan south korea france italy and canada are 
interested in investing in the project herrington said thursday in 
testimony before the house appropriations committees energy and 
water development subcommittee 
i fully expect you to see 40 percent to 50 percent of this 
project will be international financing herrington said i 
think the money is there and the interest is there it is an 
international project 
herringtons estimate of foreign participation was about double 
the 25 percent level previously stated by department officials 
the subcommittees chairman rep tom bevill dala said 
foreign money would help win congressional funding for the physics 
research complex which would include a 53mileround atom smasher 
but he and herrington differed on who should commit money first 
congress or foreign investors 
it seems to me this is the only way under our present budget 
situation that we would even start this project with the 
participation of the countries bevill said 
herrington replied it is not in the interests of the united 
states government to say to the world we are the leaders in 
highenergy physics and we are ready to take the next step but 
we are not willing to do that until we get foreign commitments 
thats not leadership 
bevill said he was considering how to pay for the project while 
herrington was thinking of the united states being first in physics 
unless we can get allocated another billion dollars pretty 
soon and start it we could not possibly initiate the funding 
bevill said but if we had assurance 50 percent or 75 percent 
would be contributed by other countries it would be a whole new 
game 
the reagan administration has proposed spending 363 million for 
supercollider construction in 1989 but critics in congress say 
that would divert money from other important research projects 
seven states have sites competing for the project which will 
produce 3000 jobs and have an annual operating budget of 279 
million 
the states are arizona colorado illinois michigan north 
carolina tennessee and texas

late thursday breaking windows in houses in southern cities near 
the border with panama a fire department official said 
there were no immediate reports of injuries 
firefighters in the panamanian city of david said the tremor was 
felt strongly in panamas western provinces of chiriqui and boca 
del toro both bordering costa rica but there were no reports of 
damage or injuries there either 
the temblor was not felt in panama city 
the quake registered 56 on the richter scale said an official 
in the communications office of san joses fire department he 
refused to be further identified 
no one answered telephones at the seismology institute 
the red cross said no damage was reported in san jose the 
capital 
the fire department official said the quake occured at 945 pm 
1045 pm est and was centered near buenos aires 70 miles 
southeast of san jose and 26 miles from the border with panama 
we have reports that the glass windows of many homes broke in 
the towns of buenos aires ciudad neily and san isidro and we 
are expecting possible reports of damage in puerto jimenez near 
buenos aires the official said 
san isidro is 48 miles southeast of san jose and ciudad neily is 
seven miles from the panamanian border 
he said the quake also was felt strongly in the city of golfito 
also near the border but communications were poor and there was no 
word of damage he said 
the people ran into the streets terrified in the cities of 
buenos aires and ciudad neily since the temblor was really 
strong johnny zamora of the red cross in san jose said 
in san jose tall buildings swayed 
definitely the quake was felt practically in all the 
country the fire department official said 
the richter scale is a measure of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number indicates an increase of 
10 times in ground motion 
an earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage one 
measuring 6 can cause severe damage while a reading of 8 indicates 
a quake capable of tremendous damage

president reagan says he will try to persuade 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir to drop objections to an 
american peace plan for the middle east 
reagan said thursday that a great element of israels 
coalition government supports the plan he said the plan offers a 
pretty good solution that would remove some of the problems 
besetting the people in the occupied territories 
i believe that peace is inevitable reagan said we may 
have some differences there as to how to achieve it but i dont 
think anyone believes that we can go on just with a constant state 
of warfare and unrest in the middle east 
the president conducted four separate interviews in the white 
house map room with television journalists from france britain 
italy and west germany transcripts of the remarks were released by 
the white house 
he criticized israels ban on press coverage of unrest and the 
militarys response in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
more than 80 arabs have been killed by israeli troops or 
settlers since the demonstrations began late last year israeli 
officials concerned about the negative publicity have now 
restricted press access to the areas involved 
im a great believer in a free press and the right of the 
people to know so i would have to be opposed to it thinking 
that they want to conduct operations in which they would rather not 
have public knowledge of them 
next week shamir will meet at the white house with reagan to 
discuss the administrations proposals the prime minister has 
blocked efforts to force a vote within israels government on how 
to respond to the american plan 
shamir rejects the us plan because it sets a timetable for 
negotiations between israel and the arabs on the future of the west 
bank and gaza strip thirty us senators have criticized shamir 
for rejecting an exchange of territory for peace 
reagan asked what kind of pressure he would put on shamir 
said well i dont think its so much pressure as it is just an 
attempt at persuasion 
but also id like to point out that his cabinet is pretty 
evenly split on the solution reagan said so it isnt a case 
of outside pressure there he has a great element in his own 
government that sees merit in the proposals that weve made 
part of the us plan calls for an international peace 
conference whose members would include the soviet union 
reagan said moscow has not recognized israel as a nation and 
added thats very difficult to have someone participating in a 
conference of that kind who doesnt even believe in the right of 
statehood of the other country 
he said the conference would not be empowered to impose a 
settlement but would try to be helpful and see if we could not 
join in helping arrive at a solution that would once and for all 
end the hostilities 
on other subjects reagan 
said the united states has made gains in talks with the soviet 
union there has been a softening in their position on human 
rights and they have freed political prisoners and so forth 
reagan said we think they have a long way to go to meet our 
standard of human rights 
denied that his wife nancy is his main adviser no and 
shes very embarrassed about the press stories that for some reason 
continue to say that no she has been a good and faithful wife 
and i share secrets with her and my problems and all of that

elisabeth ann zinser resigned her position 
early friday as president of gallaudet university only five days 
after her selection to lead the school for the deaf touched off a 
storm of protest from students who demanded a hearingimpaired 
president 
the universitys board of trustees said it had regretfully 
accepted zinsers resignation and would resume its search for a new 
president 
gallaudet board chairman jane bassett spilman called the 
resignation a tragic loss to the university 
we selected dr zinser as president in recognition of her 
superior academic administrative and research skills her 
strengths and accomplishments were precisely in those areas most 
critical for the growth of the university spilman said 
on thursday students capped the fourth day of protests by 
declaring zinser is not deaf and does not know sign language 
unelcome on campus and vowing to keep her out 
jerry covell a leader of the protests hailed the resignation 
but said early friday that students were still angry with spilman 
who had resisted the push to oust zinser who is vice chancellor 
for academic affairs at the university of north carolinagreensboro 
we are glad that she resigned but we are still waiting for 
spilman covell said 
in submitting her resignation shortly after midnight zinser 
emphasized her concern that the very governance of gallaudet had 
been called into question by the weeks events 
the campus was virtually shut down for four days while a large 
majority of the 124yearold institutions 2200 students 
protested the students had attracted members of congress and 
presidential candidates to their cause 
zinser had been named to head the university the nations only 
liberal arts college for the deaf on sunday 
i accepted the presidency when the board and i agreed that my 
values talents and experiences were well suited to the growth of 
gallaudet university in the higher education community as well as 
the deaf community this remains the challenge for the future of 
gallaudet zinser said in a statement released through a public 
relations firm 
she said her decision to resign was reached with great 
difficulty as i came to understand how deeply some see the social 
stature of deaf persons reflected in the presidency of this 
university 
students on thursday threatened to seize the presidents campus 
house and office if zinser made her way past students blocking 
entrances to the school the doors to the administration building 
were chained shut and no administrators were seen on campus 
in other action on thursday one of the two deaf finalists for 
the school presidency withdrew his support for zinser and said he 
would back the student protesters 
a day earlier i king jordan dean of the schools college of 
arts and sciences had said he was supporting zinser for the good 
of the school but jordan told a student rally on thursday that 
he could no longer support the new leader 
rep david bonior dmich who is a member of gallaudets board 
of trustees said in a statement thursday he suggested to zinser 
that in the next few days she consult with the faculty students 
staff and alumni to experience the passion with which they view 
the appointment of hearing president 
the time is long overdue for gallaudet university to have a 
deaf president bonior said the university has for generations 
been an international mecca for excellence and opportunity in deaf 
education 
the question before us is how long will it be able to 
sustain this important role without a deaf president 
earlier in an interview with the washington post bonior said 
he told zinser that federal aid for the school may be jeopardized 
if she refuses to leave the post she was named to sunday night 
about 75 percent of the schools 76 million operating budget 
comes from federal funds the rest comes from tuition and grants 
meanwhile the house education and labor subcommittee on select 
education which oversees gallaudets budget scheduled hearings 
for tuesday on the controversy over the president and the makeup of 
the board of trustees 
zinser had said wednesday she was assuming her post immediately 
instead of waiting until the original july starting date 
she also lamented that campus protests have disrupted classes 
and said she would take unspecified steps to restore order if the 
protests which have been peaceful so far took a violent turn 
besides calling for zinsers ouster the students want spilmans 
resignation and a deaf majority on the 20member trustees board 
which now has four deaf members 
as zinser attempted to start her job support for the protesters 
grew 
late wednesday democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson 
issued a statement supporting the students and called on 
gallaudets board of trustees to resolve this dispute equitably 
the problem is not that the students do not hear the problem 
is that the hearing world does not listen jackson said 
sen paul simon dill another democratic presidential 
hopeful on thursday called for zinsers resignation 
simon a longtime member of the senate labor and human resources 
subcommittee on the handicapped which has jurisdiction over 
funding for gallaudet said zinsers appointment was a slap in 
the face to the entire purpose of the university 
vince dollard a spokesman for the national technical institute 
for the deaf in rochester ny said two buses and several cars 
carrying at least 100 students from the school were to leave at 
midnight for washington to join the gallaudet protest 
a rally was held on the rochester campus in support of gallaudet 
thursday afternoon 
in addition some east coast leaders of the national association 
of the deaf a 20000member deaf rights group based in silver 
spring md were planning to gather in washington on friday 
spokesman fred weiner said 
and activist abbie hoffman who lectures to universities on 
student protests said whats happening at gallaudet is 
obviously right there in the front he said and theyre going 
to win their battle 
he said he has urged members of three electronic bulletinboard 
networks with a total of 16000 members to support the students 
efforts by tying up gallaudets switchboards with calls of support 
for the students

frederic remington the painter and sculptor 
best known for his depiction of the wild west deserves recognition 
as an american master say the curators of a traveling exhibit of 
his work that opens here today 
remington has been seen superficially says michael edward 
shapiro chief curator at the st louis art museum hes been 
stereotyped as a cowboy artist when he was a very sophisticated new 
yorker who drew from a lot of sources and created his own style 
which has astonishingly imprinted itself on the conscience of our 
country 
shapiro and peter h hassrick director of the buffalo bill 
historical center in cody wyo organized frederic remington 
the masterworks the first major traveling exhibit of remingtons 
work 
the exhibition consists of 46 paintings and drawings and 20 
bronze sculptures remington created from 1889 when he was 28 
until he died in 1909 at age 48 of complications from appendicitis 
among the works are a dash for the timber an 1889 painting 
acknowledged as remingtons first masterpiece and the bronco 
buster possibly the bestknown american bronze sculpture of the 
19th century 
remington began his art career as an illustrator with his wild 
west scenes turning up in several popular magazines including 
harpers weekly his work illustrated what shapiro describes as the 
forces of nature and man and the risk of death and danger in the 
west in the action and energy of remingtons horses and horsemen 
he was especially successful at capturing the image of the horse 
bucking rearing lunging running at breakneck speed there 
was never a more vivid depiction of the american horse shapiro 
adds 
indeed remington once told a drinking companion that if he 
could have one thing written on his tombstone it would be he 
knew the horse 
his subject was always the horse and its rider the 
indianfighting soldier or the cowboy but the west of the 
homesteader the farmer and the frontierending railroads held no 
interest for him 
while the rest of the country spoke of the advance of the 
frontier the taming of the west as a positive force in the 
building of american civilization to remington the frontier was 
receding and in the end a tragic loss historian david 
mccullough writes in the shows catalog 
remington was born oct 4 1861 in canton ny the son of a 
newspaper proprietor he grew up in canton and ogdensburg ny 
then enrolled in the school of fine arts and joined the football 
team at yale university 
he dropped out of yale after a year and a half when his father 
died and at the age of 21 he headed west to make his fortune 
plunking down part of his inheritance on a sheep ranch near 
peabody kan 
the sheep ranch failed and remington bought into a kansas city 
saloon which also failed his new wife had left him to go back to 
new york remington headed west again to sketch his way through new 
mexico and arizona 
but by 1885 remington was back in new york reunited with his 
wife and establishing himself as a magazine illustrator in 1887 
harpers weekly carried 39 of his sketches and drawings and the 
next year more than 70 
remingtons drawings also began to appear in st nicholas and 
outing magazines he was commissioned by century illustrated 
magazine to illustrate a series of articles by a young theodore 
roosevelt the series later was made into a book titled ranch 
life and the hunting trail 
despite his popular success remington was never a critical 
success says shapiro 
his work was just seen as cowboys and indians he says 
and there was a belief that cowboys and indians wasnt serious 
subject matter 
the exhibit goes next to the buffalo bill historical center in 
cody wyo the museum of fine arts in houston and closes at the 
metropolitan museum of art in new york

environmental cleanup at the nations nuclear 
weapons production plants could cost as much as 100 billion 
department of energy officials told a congressional panel 
cleaning up does nuclear facilities may be the federal 
governments biggest challenge j dexter peach an assistant 
comptroller general of the general accounting office said in 
testimony thursday before the house energy and commerce hazardous 
materials subcommittee 
joseph salgado undersecretary at the energy department told 
the panel that 100 billion in cleanup costs for all of the federal 
facilities is probably in the ballpark 
the subcommittee is considering a number of bills designed to 
strengthen enforcement of environmental laws at the nations 
weapons production plants which are operated for the department by 
private contractors 
in a related development the new york times quoted energy 
department officials in todays editions as saying the department 
would sharply scale back the amount of radioactive material it 
plans to bury in the nations first permanent nuclear waste 
repository 
department engineers said in interviews with the newspaper that 
the department would entomb less than a quarter of the 125000 
barrels of plutoniumcontaminated wastes the government earlier 
intended to place in the planned 700 million repository in new 
mexico over the next five years 
the decision came four months after scientists told a 
congressional committee that enough water was seeping into the 
repository to threaten its ability to safely store wastes that 
would remain radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years 
last week a panel of experts from the national academy of 
sciences confirmed that water was entering the chamber and 
recommended that the energy department entomb only enough waste for 
experiments to determine the significance of the seepage 
the water leaks are to be studied further to determine whether 
current plans for the repository to receive even more waste can be 
put into effect the repository is being dug from salt beds 26 
miles east of carlsbad nm and is to open next october 
winston porter assistant administrator for the us 
environmental protection agency acknowledged thursday in the 
hearing that the epa has lost one of its levers in forcing 
facilities to comply with environmental laws the reason he said 
is that the justice department has prevented the agency from using 
its authority to go to court or issue unilateral orders 
he said the administration has brought no court suits issued no 
unilateral orders and entered into a handful of consent orders 
two enforceable compliance agreements and three unenforceable 
agreements as part of its cleanup efforts 
but salgado told the subcommittee that the energy department has 
recently made significant progress toward addressing environmental 
contamination and has increased funding for cleanup by 62 percent 
in fiscal 1989 
salgado said he has been told it will likely cost 1 billion to 
begin cleanup at the feed materials production center in fernald 
ohio the aging foundry processes uranium for use in nuclear 
weapons 
joseph legrone the energy departments operations manager at 
oak ridge tenn said 105 million was budgeted for environmental 
work at fernald in fiscal 1988 more than the 102 million for 
production and he said 145 million has been earmarked for fiscal 
1989 
legrone told rep thomas luken dohio he hopes to be able to 
assure that there is no leakage from fernalds waste pits into 
groundwater within a year and a half

richard nixon in a new book criticizes the 
american military establishment for preparing for the big war 
that will probably never be fought and ignoring the possibility 
of smaller wars 
moscow is most likely to seek to outflank europe and japan 
with aggression in the third world where our nuclear power is 
useless he writes in 1999 victory without war if we fail 
to develop the capability to parry soviet thrusts in the third 
world we will find ourselves unable to compete with moscow 
nixons book the sixth he has written since he resigned the 
presidency in 1974 is to be published this spring by simon and 
schuster like the last four it deals with foreign policy his 
first postwhite house book was his memoirs 
he writes that moscow is outspending washington 4to1 in 
providing military aid to other countries and that america must 
continue providing tons of weapons to its allies to head off 
the soviet challenge 
it is not philanthropy but expansionism that drives the soviet 
union to pump weapons into the third world nixon says its 
goal in exporting arms is exporting communism we must do at 
least as much for our allies as the soviets do for theirs 
he adds americans instinctively cringe at the thought of 
shipping off tons of weapons and military equipment to countries 
around the world they do not want to think of themselves as arms 
merchants but military aid is often the best way to protect our 
interests and those of our friends and allies 
the united states nixon says must not fall into the trap of 
thinking that a reduction in ussoviet tensions means the end of 
the conflict if mikhail s gorbachev stresses the need to solve 
his internal problems we should not be conned into thinking that 
the system has changed or that the threat has ended 
gorbachev the current soviet leader nixon says more than his 
predecessors is a powerful reminder that we underestimate the 
soviets at our peril 
washington lost its collective senses when gorbachev applied 
his public relations talents last december at the superpower 
summit the former president writes saying that gorbachev is so 
confident of his strengths that he is not afraid to talk about his 
weaknesses 
nixon also makes these points 
in 1999 when we look back over the 20th century we will 
have to face the fact that mankinds advances in military power and 
material progress have dwarfed his progress in developing the 
political skills and institutions to preserve peace and capitalize 
on our technological advances it will be our task in the 21st 
century to end the mismatch between our technological skill and our 
woefully lagging political skill 
the united states has a greater competitive edge in foreign 
economic assistance than in military aid this country has spent 
more than 134 billion in economic aid since world war ii compared 
with less than 50 billion by the soviet union yet has failed to 
capitalize on the advantage 
if we are to compete it must be on their side of the iron 
courtain as well as ours if we compete only on moscows terms 
soviet leaders will take what we give them and come back for more 
although the united states holds good cards in ideological 
competition with the soviets they have done a good job of selling 
a poor case and we have done a poor job of selling a good case 
he writes of the pap that passes for programming on the voice of 
america and of professional diplomats who reflexively treat 
disputes as if they were simply great misunderstandings rather than 
imsurmountable differences 
the war powers act which limits a presidents power to take 
military action overseas without congressional approval and was 
passed over nixons veto in 1973 is not only unconstitutional but 
unsound given the realities of the world the united states will 
sometimes need to use force in actions short of allout war and 
will have to be able to act quickly and decisively while 535 would 
be commanders in chief the number of representatives and senators 
dissect the merits and demerits of the intervention the president 
will have to keep glancing over his shoulder to check the clock 
while fighting to defend american interests

discovery of a gene that produces a brain 
protein from the chromosome segment responsible for downs syndrome 
puts researchers on the trail of the genetic basis for the most 
common form of mental retardation 
in a study published today in the journal science researchers 
from canada and california report that they have identified a brain 
protein gene in a part of chromosome 21 that relates to downs 
syndrome a discovery that other experts said may be an important 
first step toward a genetic understanding of the birth defect 
it puts bloodhounds on the trail but its still a distant 
scent said dr david r cox of the university of california san 
francisco one of seven scientists who conducted the research he 
cautioned that more study is required because we dont know what 
its relative importance will be in the cause of downs 
dr sigfried pueschel head of a downs syndrome research 
program at brown university and a nationally recognized authority 
said the finding is a significant advance 
it is a first step and an important step pueschel said 
downs syndrome is a congenital defect that includes mental 
retardation and bowel and heart abnormalities downs babies have 
broad features and slanted eyes characteristics that led the 
syndrome to once be identified by the nowobsolete term of 
mongoloidism 
downs syndrome is the most common form of mental retardation 
about 4000 downs babies are born annually in the united states 
the syndrome affects one in every 800 to 1000 live births 
the birth defect is caused by the presence of three copies of 
chromosome 21 instead of the normal pair it is believed that this 
socalled trisomy leads to the genetic expression of proteins 
which in turn lead to the development of downs 
in the science magazine report cox said that his 
coinvestigators found a gene in chromosome 21 that expresses a 
protein called s100 that is primarily found in the brain 
this is the first time that a brain protein has been mapped 
into the downs syndrome region of chromosome 21 he said 
previously there had been some genes that were expressed 
primarily in the brain but those were mapped to other portions 
of the chromosome said cox 
our results say that this is a potential candidate gene that 
may play a major or minor role in mental retardation he said 
it can now be studied to test this hypothesis 
cox emphasized that the discovery offers no immediate promise 
for treatment and that it will take additional study to determine 
the precise effect of the gene 
but it provides the first clue that allows one to start 
looking into that he said 
i think to uncover any gene on chromosome 21 with a specific 
function is a significant advance pueschel said it might in 
the future provide us with information on how to treat these 
individuals 
cox said the researchers isolated portions of chromosome 21 and 
then conducted tests to determine which part produced s100 the 
gene that expressed the protein was found in a band called 21q22 
it is one of perhaps 1000 genes in that portion of chromosome 21 
but cox said it is the first found there that expresses a brain 
protein 
in addition to cox members of the research team were robert 
allore karen neilson hf willard rj dunn david ohanlon and 
alexander marks all of the university of toronto in canada and 
er price of the university of california san francisco

sen donald riegle has returned campaign 
contributions made by employees and officers of an arizona company 
on whose behalf he met with federal bank regulators conducting an 
investigation 
riegle said thursday he wanted to avoid the appearance of a 
conflict of interest and so was giving back 76100 in 
contributions from people associated with american continental co 
of phoenix ariz and its subsidiaries 
three other senators present at the meeting last year said 
through aides they saw no reason to return the money an aide to a 
fourth senator was unable to say whether the contributions would be 
returned 
while there was no conflict of interest involved before or 
after these contributions even the appearance of such a personal 
conflict should be enough to warrant the return of these 
contributions and that is what i have done said riegle a 
michigan democrat up for reelection this year who sits on the 
senate banking committee 
riegle and sens dennis deconcini dariz alan cranston 
dcalif john glenn dohio and john mccain rariz met last 
april 9 with federal home loan bank board examiners and discussed 
the investigation of an american continental subsidiary lincoln 
savings and loan association of irvine calif 
there was no connection between the meeting and the agencys 
decision to end its probe of highrisk investments made by the 
subsidiary riegle said last month 
the meeting was called by deconcini said riegles press 
secretary mike russell deconcini had received 43000 in campaign 
contributions from american continental officers and employees 
cranston received 41900 in contributions glenn 34000 and 
mccain 112000 
it is foolishness to assume that just because employees of a 
company make a contribution to a deconcini campaign that that

out of the country and she was unable to determine whether he had 
or intended to return his american continental campaign

drug and alcohol testing of the nations 
railroad workers is resuming following a court order that has 
temporarily boosted reagan administration efforts to make the 
examinations more common 
the administrator of the federal railroad administration john 
riley told congress on thursday that he had ordered railroads to 
begin conducting the urine and blood tests once again less than a 
month after a federal court in san francisco declared them illegal 
his order was a response to a stay issued last friday that 
temporarily lifts the ban on testing 
if an accident were to occur tomorrow the crew would be 
tested riley told the house transportation appropriations 
subcommittee 
riley said that without last fridays court ruling our 
testing program would be terminated 
the reagan administration has been trying to perform more and 
more drug and alcohol tests on employees in the transportation 
industry 
on feb 11 the 9th us circuit court of appeals in san 
francisco struck down the fras 2yearold program that required 
railroads to check the members of train crews involved in serious 
accidents for drug or alcohol use the court stated that such tests 
were unconstitutional unless there was a suspicion that an 
individual worker was under the influence of drugs or alcohol 
but last friday us circuit judge thomas tang granted a 
request by the government to stay the order until april 2 tang was 
in the 21 majority that originally voted to invalidate the testing 
riley said that under federal judicial procedures if the 
government files its appeal by april 2 which officials say they 
will the stay would automatically remain in effect until the 
supreme court issues a decision in the case that would probably 
take months 
but a spokesman for the countrys railroad unions said the stay 
would not be automatically extended beyond april 2 edward wytkind 
spokesman for the railway labor executives association said that 
after april 2 the supreme court could decide to allow the tests to 
resume at any time 
we dont view the stay as any sort of attack on employees 
wytkind said its just on an interim basis 
as a result of the decision the government had also halted drug 
and alcohol testing of railroad workers performed for what it 
called reasonable cause in which a supervisor noticed unusual 
behavior by a worker 
such tests also will be resumed riley said

the fourmonth tab for storing midwest grain 
on river barges to help make room in country elevators for the new 
1986 harvest came to 62 million or nearly a dollar a bushel the 
general accounting office says 
overall the cost to taxpayers was sharply higher than the 
storage fees normally paid by the government for grain inventories 
in elevators and farm bins the program was announced in august 
1986 as one of a number of emergency measures to help relieve 
pressure on elevators getting ready for another bumper corn harvest 
the gao an investigative agency of congress said in a recent 
report to rep bill alexander dark that the agriculture 
department awarded storage contracts to a dozen grain companies a 
total of about 649 million bushels of grain 98 percent corn and 
2 percent soybeans was loaded on 1253 barges along the illinois 
mississippi missouri and ohio rivers 
all of the barge grain originated from the corn belt states of 
illinois indiana iowa michigan minnesota missouri nebraska 
ohio and wisconsin the gao said most had been in country and 
terminal elevators in those states but some had been stored by 
producers on their farms 
eventually the departments kansas city commodity office which 
handled the program disposed of most of the barge grain by trading 
it to the contractors for grain they had stored in inland 
elevators the remainder was sold redeemed by farmers or returned 
to storage elsewhere 
we estimate that the additional cost of the special barge 
storage program over and above the normal costs for shipping 
storing and disposing of the grain was about 448 million or an 
additional cost of 69 cents per bushel to store the grain for an 
average of four months the gao said 
the estimate by gao was made because the departments 
agricultural stabilization and conservation service did not 
separately accumulate total cost data for the program however 
gao said its estimates were based on reviews of contracts and other 
information provided by the agency 
the estimated cost of storing the 649 million bushels of 
grain was about 622 million or 96 cents per bushel the gao 
said this includes the additional cost of the program about 
448 million and the cost that would have been incurred in the 
normal course of storage more than 173 million 
corn market prices nationally averaged 173 per bushel when the 
program was announced and dropped to 140 in october 1986 the 
peak of the new harvest 
investigators said they estimated the departments kansas city 
commodity office paid the 12 contractors about 455 million and 
that an additional 167 million went to others for charges related 
to the bargestored grain 
the gao said the kansas city office agreed with our 
methodology and results in estimating the payments

the agriculture departments new crackdown on 
illegally high traces of a suspected cancercausing drug found in 
hog carcasses has eased concern in japan that pork imports from the 
united states may be tainted officials said 
japan had initiated a program to hold and test all us pork 
imports which american livestock interests feared might jeopardize 
foreign sales the drug involved is sulfamethazine commonly used 
by swine producers to prevent certain kinds of disease and as a 
feed additive to promote faster growth 
lester m crawford administrator of the departments food 
safety and inspection service said thursday that usda and japanese 
officials have agreed on testing requirements for pork shipped to 
japan 
crawford said japanese officials have been favorably impressed 
with us efforts initiated on march 7 to increase testing of 
pork products for sulfamethazine residues in the 100 largest us 
pork plants 
us pork produced after march 7 must carry a statement on the 
export certificate that the product originated from one of the 100 
plants undergoing increased residue testing he said japan 
will not further test these products for sulfamethazine residues 
pork exported before the new controls went into effect will be 
tested further for the drug either in japan or the united states 
he said

the agriculture department reports the soviet 
union has bought an additional 100000 metric tons of us corn for 
delivery this year under a longterm supply agreement between the 
two countries 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 100000 tons of 
corn would be about 394 million bushels 
corn prices recently have been averaging about 184 per bushel 
at the farm level meaning that the sale could have a farm value of 
around 725 million 
officials said thursday the latest sale involved 50000 tons 
that had been reported by exporters as headed for japan and 50000 
tons for unknown destinations 
the corn is part of the grain the soviet union is committed to 
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement which calls 
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of us grain 
the pact expires sept 30 
according to the agreement the annual purchases are supposed to 
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn the 
soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as 
wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting as two 
tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
with the latest purchases the soviets now have bought 327 
million tons of corn and more than 69 million tons of wheat plus 
13 million tons of soybean meal and 813300 tons of soybeans

congress will begin another long fight with 
the white house if it passes a bill requiring president reagan to 
tell capitol hill about all covert operations within 48 hours after 
they start says defense secretary frank c carlucci 
reagan would veto the bill because he believes it is 
unconstitutional the defense secretary said thursday in testimony 
before a house intelligence subcommittee he added that enactment 
of the measure over reagans objection would touch off another 
fight similar to the ongoing dispute over the war powers act 
the war powers act a 1973 law restricting a presidents 
authority to send us troops into dangerous situations is the 
subject of a federal court fight over its constitutionality the 
white house claims it is unconstitutional 
the intelligence notification bills arise from the irancontra 
affair when us weapons were secretly sold to iran and some of 
the profits were diverted to the nicaraguan contra guerrillas 
reagan withheld notification from congress for 10 months in 1986 
current laws require that congress be told about covert actions 
except in extraordinary circumstances when only timely notice 
is required but the phrase is not defined and the proposed 
legislation would mandate notice within 48 hours 
carlucci who was reagans national security adviser after the 
irancontra affair became public said the administration has put 
procedures into place to avoid another irancontra situation 
at some point we have to rely on trust he told the 
legislation subcommittee if a future president sets out to 
deceive a congress no amount of statutes will stop him 
rep henry hyde rill said the bill is one more battle 
between the imperial congress and the imperial presidency 
carlucci agreed saying i can think of no step by the 
congress which would do more harm to the process of rebuilding an 
atmosphere of trust and candor between the branches than 
unilaterally to lay claim to prerogatives which the president 
firmly believes are vested in the executive by the constitution 
but rep matt mchugh dny chairman of the subcommittee said 
the legislation is needed 
in the case of the arms sales to iran the president construed 
current law as permitting him to withhold notice for more than 10 
months after the covert sales had been authorized mchugh said 
if he had done as the law generally requires he would 
surely have heard some strong objections and might have spared the 
country a serious foreign policy setback and himself a major 
political embarrassment 
carluccis argument was that the failures of the iran affair 
were human and managerial no statute can prevent these mistakes 
we will not put the mistrust which caused the irancontra 
affair behind us until we trust each other again 
the bill was also opposed by brent scowcroft national security 
adviser to president ford 
scowcroft said the excessively restrictive language proposed 
seems a case of throwing out the baby with the bath it is not 
possible to eliminate every opportunity for abuse by the executive 
without at the same time paralyzing the ability to act 
he said the bills arise from the view that notification to 
congress about the arms sales would have been met with opposition 
that would have derailed the plan 
scowcroft disputed that there is no evidence to support this 
assumption indeed as it was the president was confronted by his 
principal advisers with views strongly in opposition to the 
iranian arms sales

pat robertson the biggestspending candidate of 
the presidential race so far says hell use his federal matching 
funds after all even though he has said he is philosophically 
opposed to the idea 
robertson said thursday that short of what would amount to an 
absolute miracle in the state of illinois it looks as if ill 
have to use them 
he also said at a news conference that he is within about 2 
million of the 27 million spending cap that election rules set for 
those who get matching funds that could pose serious strategy 
problems for him because it means he will be unable to continue 
the kind of highspending campaign he has conducted so far and will 
be forced to skimp along for the remainder of the primary season 
its going to mean that its going to be me the candidate and 
not a lot of travel and everything else the volunteers he said 
robertson said he had made deep cuts in his national staff but 
he declined to give specific numbers he said the reductions had 
cut deeply into his press and office staff 
everybody is bucking up around the federal spending limit 
so we want to stay lean and mean he said 
robertson has received 72 million in federal matching funds 
more than any other candidate including vice president george 
bush who has received 66 million 
robertsons campaign has put the money into an escrow account 
and was keeping open the option of not using the money and later 
giving it back to the government in that case campaign attorney 
marion harrison had contended robertson would not be bound by the 
spending limits imposed on those who accept matching funds 
whether the federal election commission would have accepted that 
point of view is now moot since robertson has indicated he will not 
try that approach 
fec officials had pointed out that the law requires a candidate 
to sign an agreement to abide by the limits at the time of 
application for matching funds there is no language in the 
regulations that addresses whether a candidate actually spends the 
money 
robertson had used the money as collateral for a 55 million 
loan in january and a 15 million loan in december 
we put the matching funds in escrow and borrowed against 
them were still trying to keep our options open but the options 
i might say narrowed considerably after super tuesday robertson 
said in an interview following a brief chicago news conference 
kicking off his effort in illinois 
robertson said that the matching funds are in a sense 
already spent 
that money would just go to pay off loans the truth is in my 
estimation that all the major campaigns are bumped up against the 
limit there is not much money left for anybody said robertson 
were trying to husband our resources as hard as we can and 
hold on through june he continued 
robertson said cash problems would not deter him from continuing 
the gop fight 
i am more and more being urged by conservatives to stay in the 
race as a rallying point for conservatives and conservative 
principles he said 
as of the most recent campaign financial reports through jan 
31 robertson had spent more against the limit than any other 
candidate more than 22 million that was before the most 
intensive spending period began for the super tuesday primaries and 
caucuses in 20 states on march 8 
by contrast bush had spent 153 million and sen bob dole 
rkan 181 million 
the matching funds are provided from a fund supported by the 1 
voluntary checkoff on individual income tax returns each donation 
of 250 or less that a candidate raises is matched by the public 
fund to qualify initially a candidate must raise at least 
100000 across 20 states in contributions of 250 or less 
robertson had said he was not in favor of the publicly supported 
campaign finance system

talks with movie and television producers 
aimed at ending a fiveday scriptwriters strike broke down with no 
new meeting scheduled officials of both sides said 
the writers and producers were meeting thursday with a federal 
mediator when the producers decided the talks werent going 
anywhere said mona mangan executive director of the writers guild 
of americas east coast unit 
in view of the seriousness of the strike and its impact on the 
industry we had hoped that continued talks might bring us better 
results we deeply regret that the companies do not view these 
talks as moving us closer together ms mangan said 
a spokesman for the alliance of motion picture and television 
producers herb steinberg said the scriptwriters demands were so 
unrealistic that further talks would be fruitless theyre 
not even in the same neighborhood in an assessment of the economics 
involved 
meanwhile in new york two unions representing 100000 actors 
set a march 21 deadline for a strike against makers of tv and radio 
commercials 
federal mediator leonard farrell recessed the scriptwriters 
talks subject to his calling another meeting but no date was 
agreed to ms mangan said 
daily variety an industry newspaper reported thursday that the 
guild is preparing interim contracts for independent producers a 
tactic used last summer by the directors guild before its contract 
with producers ended 
the strike has yet to have a widespread effect on the motion 
picture and television industry but has delayed the debut of at 
least two series and has forced the david letterman and johnny 
carson shows into reruns 
a long strike by the 9000 writers could affect some movies and 
the fall television season and could shorten the current 
television season if producers failed to stock enough scripts or 
discover extensive rewriting is needed 
the union struck sunday demanding an increase in residuals from 
movies and television shows distributed in foreign countries and 
rejecting a producers offer to reformulate residuals from the 
syndication of onehour tv shows 
in new york the screen actors guild and the american federation 
of television and radio artists announced a march 21 strike 
deadline for the american association of advertising agencies and 
the association of national advertisers 
union members working under a contract extension voted march 2 
to authorize a walkout the last strike of its kind lasted seven 
weeks in 197879 
there was no answer thursday night at the new york offices of 
the american association of advertising agencies

the complicated relationship between the 
ethereal blanche du bois and the earthy stanley kowalski in 
tennessee williams a streetcar named desire is one of the most 
fascinating in the american theater 
blanche the epitome of neurotic southern gentility flutters to 
her doom at the hands of stanley her crude but practical 
brotherinlaw its a destructive flight one that she resists 
until the very end of the play but then accepts almost willingly 
that strange bond between the two is ignored in the new 
straightforward revival of williams classic drama that opened 
thursday at broadways circle in the square theater 
this streetcar is riding on one rail blythe danners 
dangerous ontheedge performance as the desperate blanche just 
when you think she may veer out of control miss danner takes 
charge 
the actress recites williams poetry and thats what much of 
his dialogue is with an intensity that is very moving she also 
can handle the more lurid permutations of the plot bringing a 
conviction to melodramatic moments such as as the story of the 
death of her young husband its a commanding portrait 
that conviction is lacking in aidan quinn who plays stanley 
quinn is an intelligent actor but hes miscast both physically and 
vocally 
his stanley is brash rather than brutish more wise guy than 
tough guy that approach works when hes playing poker with his 
pals but when he comes up against an aggressive blanche quinn 
falters 
blanche keeps referring to stanley as apelike but quinns 
characterization is anything but animalistic hes too boyish and 
bears more than a passing resemblance to the young newsboy blanche 
attempts to seduce late in the first act 
blanche and stanley become little more than a bickering couple 
their lack of electricity doesnt ruin the production but it does 
make this revival a lopsided unsurprising evening of theater 
danner works better with frank converse who projects an innate 
decency as mitch stanleys good friend and blanches one last 
chance theres a genuine regret about their inability to make 
something of their relationship equally appealing is frances 
mcdormand a ripe voluptuous stella who gamely puts up with 
stanleys crudeness because she loves him 
nikos psacharopoulos the countrys foremost interpreter of 
williams plays directs at a leisurely pace between scenes there 
are a lot of saxophone moans in the night designer john conklin 
spills a french quarter setting much of it wrought iron across 
the elongated stage to create an evocative new orleans apartment 
the set is tantalizing and so is miss danner she just doesnt 
have anyone to go up against 
in other reviews 
frank rich of the new york times called the production a 
staging that may not deface williamss masterpiece but often 
sanitizes it 
what is most absent from the evening and not just in blanche 
and stanleys showdown is sex miss danner and mr quinn both 
fine actors both erotic figures in other circumstances shed no 
sparks here 
in the daily news howard kissel writes that the production 
lacks a sense of an old world decaying of desire hanging 
palpably urgently in the air without this tangled undergrowth 
of anxiety and nervous longing the play loses its force

pooltable rape trial says he hopes a state supreme court ruling 
affirming the convictions will end the furor touched off by the 
case 
it was a worldwide case literally the whole world was 
watching bristol county district attorney ronald pina said

turned aside defense objections on pinas handling of evidence 
judge william g youngs decision to avert television cameras from 
the victim and other issues 
the victims dramatic account of the barroom rape and the 
lengthy televised trial in superior court drew national attention 
to the workingclass neighborhoods of new bedford where the attack 
occurred and sparked an intense debate over rape 
the case also brought agony to new bedfords large 
portugueseamerican community the six young men charged in the 
case were of portuguese descent as was the victim 
the high court upheld the punishments handed out to daniel 
silvia john cordeiro and victor raposo who were sentenced to nine 
to 12 years in the state maximumsecurity prison at walpole and 
joseph vieira who drew six to eight years the two other 
defendants were acquitted 
the victim died in a car crash outside miami in december 1986 at 
age 25 
according to court records she entered big dans tavern on 
march 6 1983 to buy cigarettes she ordered a drink spoke with 
another woman and watched a game of pool when she declined an 
offer of a ride from cordeiro and raposo the court said she was 
knocked down dragged to the pool table and raped

newspapers clamored today for prince charles and 
other royals to abandon dangerous pursuits after the 39yearold 
heir to the british throne narrowly escaped an avalanche that 
killed a close friend 
charles is the next king that means he must be 
safeguarded if need be from himself the daily mirror admonished 
in an editorial 
it said charles as well as prince andrew and his wife the 
duchess of york took unnecessary risks 
the royals have a duty to play it safe the newspaper added 
charles 28yearold brother andrew was catapaulted off the 
deck of the us carrier nimitz in a jet fighter when he and the 
28yearold duchess visited the united states last week 
the duchess the former sarah ferguson is expecting the 
couples first child in august she was on a skiing holiday with 
charles and his wife princess diana 26 and friends at klosters 
in the swiss alps when the avalanche occurred thursday all are 
good skiers 
sarah who fell skiing earlier thursday and was advised to rest 
was with diana in a chalet when the avalanche struck 
andrew a royal navy helicopter copilot in the 1982 falklands 
war and now a helicopter instructor missed the holiday because of 
duties at portland naval based in southwest england 
the avalanche killed maj hugh lindsay 34 and injured another 
friend of the royals patricia palmertomkinson 
charles the lead skier and the rest of his party managed to 
evade the avalanche he helped rescue the unconscious mrs 
palmertomkinson both of whose legs were broken and then helped 
free lindsays body from under the snow 
another tabloid the sun demanded why was he there 
daredevil charles has a passion for pushing himself to the 
limit on the snow each time he dons his skis he likes to shake off 
his tag of pampered prince and prove he is a real man charles 
has consistently risked his life by going on increasingly deadly 
slopes the sun said 
swiss authorities had warned that the area where the royal party 
was skiing was prone to avalanches 
the sun quoted alex broggi a klosters ski club owner as 
calling charles incredibly brave broggi added many locals 
are amazed by the runs he attempts they wouldnt go anywhere near 
them 
the star said in an editorial we dont want our royals to be 
wimps but advisers who should know better must never again lead 
the heir to the throne into such deadly danger 
the royals and many of their friends have a pronounced taste for 
danger and charles once asserted if you occasionally live 
dangerously it helps you appreciate life 
the daily mail said the question asked by wellwishers of the 
royal family is why do so many of them go in for such perilous 
sports it urged queen elizabeth ii to ask your offspring for 
the nations sake to show just a little more care 
charles other sports include polo and fox hunting he has 
injured himself several times in falls from his horse at polo 
his father prince philip 66 played polo until recently while 
the 61yearold queen is an accomplished horsewoman 
princess anne 37 the queens only daughter goes fox hunting 
and occasionally rides in horse races where accidents are numerous

democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson 
is calling for a 71 percent increase in spending on drug 
interdiction and treatment over the 1989 reagan administration 
proposal 
jackson released a detailed position paper thursday saying the 
government should spend 67 billion to fight drugs a topic which 
has emerged at the top of his list of campaign issues 
its overrunning our borders its undermining our 
productivity its killing our children its corrupting our 
government he said at a campaign stop at wheaton college we 
must stop the flow of drugs into our country 
his spending program includes increases in the interdiction 
budgets of the justice department customs operations coast guard 
pentagon and state department and prevention and treatment 
programs 
for treatment according to jacksons position paper he would 
spend 17 billion compared to 425 million proposed by president 
reagan 
jackson contends the drug issue is a hidden benefit for him in 
his presidential campaign because it strikes a responsive chord 
wherever he speaks about it he said in an interview last week that 
the media and political analysts have failed to take note of how 
important the drug issue is to the american people 
jackson tells his audiences that the drug problem is the 
nations no 1 threat to national security killing young people 
corrupting police departments and making banks into partners with 
drug kingpins 
he often asks members of the audience to stand if they know 
someone who has died because of drugs who is in jail because of 
drugs or who has tried drugs 
jackson has previously said he had no specific numbers on how to 
implement his suggestions to fight drugs but his new position 
paper breaks down totals for each government agency 
it is time to put up the necessary resources to meet this 
national security threat head on he said in his statement 
we have 325000 troops in europe but only 269 drug enforcement 
agents overseas to fight the war on drugs 
he would tie us foreign and trade policy to the drug problem 
persuading drugproducing allies to install new antidrug programs 
or face trade and diplomatic penalties these countries should be 
rewarded with crop diversification plans and increased us 
training equipment and material assistance he said 
jackson proposed a western hemisphere summit on drugs and said 
international troops may be needed in countries like colombia to 
deal with the crisis 
jackson also would name a cabinetlevel drug czar and he 
would beef up the border patrol and other agencies to stop drugs at 
the border he said 
jackson also proposed a schoolbased education and prevention 
program led by the secretary of education and a public awareness 
campaign similar to the one that warns people about the danger of 
smoking cigarettes

the reagan administration has asked an appeals 
court to overturn a judges order barring federal regulations that 
would cut off funding to family planning clinics that offer 
abortions or abortion counseling 
the administration said it was seeking a reversal from the 1st 
us circuit court of appeals in us district judge walter ray 
skinners march 3 ruling which declared the regulations 
unconstitutional 
skinners ruling was announced the day the new guidelines were 
to have taken effect and forced the us department of health and 
human services to order regional offices to suspend enforcing them 
that order will remain in effect while the appeal is considered 
said hhs spokeswoman lucy eddinger 
in a memo accompanying his ruling skinner said the regulations 
violated a womans right to choose to have an abortion and her 
first amendment rights to free speech 
federal judges in colorado and new york had issued temporary 
injunctions against the regulations but skinner was the first to 
rule on their constitutionality and said his order applied 
nationwide 
he granted an injunction requested by the state of 
massachusetts the national family planning and reproductive health 
association and 13 other local and national family planning groups 
about 5 million low and moderateincome women receive services 
at 4000 clinics nationwide which would have been affected by the 
regulations announced last month by hhs secretary otis r bowen 
the new rules would have prevented federally funded family 
planning programs from providing abortion counseling abortion 
referrals and engaging in lobbying or legal action to increase the 
availability of abortions 
if a clinic performed abortions it would have been forced to 
maintain separate facilities for each type of patient if it wanted 
to continue to receive funding under title x of the public health 
service act of 1970

japanese banks will wait for the time being for 
overdue interest and principal payments by panama of 406 million

panama missed thursdays deadline for the payments owed to an 
unspecified number of japanese commercial banks 3906 million in 
principal and 156 million in interest said a bank of tokyo 
official who insisted on anonymity

lead agents for the 10year bonds which panama issued in march

recently confirmed it is delaying the payments because of a 
freeze on panamanian assets held by us banks the official said 
according to japanese banking sources panama earlier told its 
japanese creditors a freeze in us aid money to the country in the 
wake of a confrontation between washington and the military regime 
of gen manuel antonio noriega would make it difficult to honor the 
transaction

doctors continue to perform archaic 
circumcisions on newborn males forsaking anesthetics because of 
misguided notions that their tiny patients do not feel pain a new 
study concludes 
dr howard stang a minneapolis pediatrician said the findings 
were not new but the most important thing is this if its 
going to be done it ought to be done humanely 
about 3 million children roughly half of them males are born 
in the united states each year 
stang and four colleagues whose study was reported in todays 
journal of the american medical association estimate that between 
60 percent and 80 percent of the male infants are circumcised 
within days of their births and that virtually all of those 
children are circumcised without anesthesia 
years and years ago there was a feeling in the medical 
community that infants dont suffer stang said we now know 
that just isnt true as pediatricians were trying to get this 
across to the obstetricians and family practitioners who handle the 
bulk of these surgeries 
i guess its custom and customs die hard he added in a 
telephone interview the sad thing is that the law requires 
animals for example to have anesthesia before surgery but we 
dont extend that same humanity to our own kids 
in the study 60 newborns who were to be circumcised were 
randomly divided into three groups of 20 each 
the first group received lidocaine as a local anesthetic in a 
10yearold procedure known as a dorsal penile block the second 
group also received an injection but the solution was a placebo 
the third group received no injections 
researchers found newborns in the lidocaine group cried 23 
percent of the time while babies in the saline and control groups 
cried 68 percent and 71 percent of the time respectively during 
circumcision 
additionally the study measured how the surgery affected blood 
levels of cortisol a chemical secreted by the adrenal gland that 
shows how much stress the individual is under 
the infants given lidocaine showed significantly lower levels 
throughout the surgery said stang 
stang noted that during the circumcisions of jewish children 
infants are given wine as a general anesthetic 
thats a start he said but a local anesthetic is better 
because its more easily controlled and there are no complications 
using the block has been proven to be safe he said but 
what will make it commonplace is for parents to demand that their 
doctors do it 
stang said doctors also may be resisting the procedure because 
they fear a lack of complications may lead to an increasing number 
of circumcisions 
he said the current rate has held steady since 1970 when both 
the american academy of pediatrics and the american college of 
obstetrics and gynecology issued statements that circumcision has 
no medical value 
since then some insurance companies have classified the surgery 
as cosmetic and will not reimburse clients 
but some new studies may be shifting the tide back stang 
said he said there are indications that uncircumcised males may be 
more prone to urinary tract infections

10 times in ground motion 
an earthquake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage one 
measuring 6 can cause severe damage while a reading of 8 indicates 
a quake capable of tremendous damage

presidential ticket unlike recent circus atmosphere 
conventions that weakened the nominee 
carter who spent thursday at the us coast guard academy as a 
hedrick fellow said he emerged from both conventions that 
nominated him for president weaker than i went in because too 
many delegates used the occasions as platforms for their own issues 
democratic conventions were a circus he said at a news 
conference after conducting an informal class for cadets majoring 
in international relations and government 
we had nominees wounded and bleeding he said praising the 
current party leadership for making sure delegates are committed 
to winning not just highlighting their own individual causes 
carter said he cant tell who will prevail at the convention 
but it will be difficult for any candidate to get 50 percent of the 
delegates on the first ballot 
ive got an open mind about it he said what happens 
during the campaign will be an indication of who will do well in

three days after super tuesday republican 
officials say human error skewed the reported results of washington

robertson won 39 percent of the republican delegates picked 
tuesday night to attend county or legislative district conventions 
where another slate of delegates will be picked for the state 
convention sen bob dole won 26 percent and vice president george 
bush 24 percent 
john meyers executive director of the state gop said reporting 
errors occurred when precinct caucus results were phoned in to the 
news election service and that these errors first were noted by 
the dole campaign 
meyers said most involved precinct chairmen reporting straw vote 
totals rather than the number of pledged delegates they would send 
to their next convention others reported delegates and alternates 
together he said 
the mistakes werent enough to change the overall results 
meyers said when youve got almost 4000 precincts some mistakes 
are going to be made 
the result was that nes reported more delegates committed than 
possible for the 71 percent sample of tuesday night some precincts 
didnt report 
vance noted that it would be the july 15 state convention when 
delegates would be allocated and until then no one won here on

fifty union activists demanding 
higher pay and reinstatement of fired workers occupied the interior 
ministry for nine tense hours then left the policeringed building 
under church protection 
the roman catholic church was able to mediate the evacuation 
thursday after a judge inspected the building and confirmed the 
workers were neither armed nor holding hostages said monsignor 
gregorio rosa chavez the metropolitan auxiliary bishop 
the workers solidary coordinate protesters were unable to win 
any concessions and took a bus under military escort to a local 
church office for the night 
officials with the national salvadoran workers unity the 
largest opposition union said soldiers captured and beat their 
leader humberto centeno when he arrived to seek an end to the 
occupation 
both unions are leading opponents of the government of president 
jose napoleon duarte who claimed the ministry takeover was part of 
a recentlydiscovered guerrilla plan to stir up mass protests in 
the country 
the 50 unionists took over the building to demand a 60 monthly 
wage hike reinstatement of dismissed workers and other conditions 
they spoke with labor minister lazaro tadeo bernal but he gave 
them no satisfaction said gerardo diaz henriquez the coordinates 
director 
centeno had arrived on a bus with several other union activists 
who soldiers forced back onto the vehicle before shooting out its 
window said guillermo rojas a workers unity official 
one worker was injured by flying glass he said 
duarte at a news conference with bernal said the government 
did not talk with the protesters who he said would be jailed if 
captured 
the president said the incident confirmed the existence of a 
rebel plan to widen the scopeof its leftist insurgency by having 
urbanbased mass organizations engage in disruptive activity 
the government has said the plan calls for constructing 
barricades occupying public buildings provoking riot police and 
burning buses and other government vehicles

a soviet envoy rejected a us demand that moscow 
cut off military aid to afghanistan if washington stops aiding 
afghan rebels after a soviet troop pullout 
moscows ties to afghanistan are seven decades old and the us 
demand is tantamount to the soviets calling for an end to us aid 
to pakistan said nikolay kozyrev ambassadoratlarge and senior 
soviet specialist in asian affairs 
kozyrev who spoke to reporters at a news conference thursday 
heads a visiting team of soviet specialists to follow the latest 
round of the peace talks in geneva between pakistan and afghanistan 
un undersecretarygeneral diego cordovez is mediating the 
6yearold peace talks the latest round of which began march 2 
pakistan is representing afghan guerrillas who have been 
fighting for nine years against the government in kabul the afghan 
capital soviet troops were sent into afghanistan in 1979 to prop 
up the marxist government 
robert peck assistant deputy secretary of state is also in 
geneva to follow the talks and has been in touch with kozyrev a 
us mission spokesman said peck had no immediate comment on the 
soviets comments 
the united states has given the afghan rebels millions of 
dollars in aid including groundtoair stinger missiles claimed to 
have downed more than 200 soviet and afghan aircraft 
kozyrev said the talks bogged down of pakistans insistence 
that an interim government replace the one headed by sovietbacked 
president najib 
he said islamabad will bear the responsibility if there is no 
final agreement despite completion of all main elements of the 
peace package 
the interim government pakistan argues could guarantee 
implementation of the settlement and ensure the safe return of more 
than 5 million afghan refugees from pakistan and iran 
kozyrev said the draft agreements from the peace talks do not 
commit his country to halt aid to the kabul government except to 
stipulate that no new troops must be sent to afghanistan after the 
withdrawal of the estimated 115000strong limited soviet 
contingent 
kozryev avoided a direct answer when asked whether negotiations 
would continue after next tuesday the target date set by mikhail 
gorbachev last month the soviet leader said that moscow will begin 
the troop withdrawal may 15 if the settlement is signed by march 15 
sources close to the talks said the date was not considered a 
deadline after which the kabul representatives would walk out 
the us demand for symmetrical cessation of military aid 
was spelled out at a state department briefing on march 4 it was 
the latest of seemingly uncoordinated signals from washington 
concerning the issue 
it followed a nonbinding resolution unanimously adopted by the 
us senate last week urging the white house to continue such aid 
until all soviet troops have left 
peck said before his departure from washington that a decision 
on the timing of the cutoff should be left to president reagan

in a dramatic speech in parliament an 
independent deputy demanded the truth be told about the world war 
ii massacre of 4000 polish officers in a forest in the soviet 
union 
the official version is that nazi troops committed the katyn 
forest massacre but many poles blame the soviet union 
deputy ryszard bender raising the taboo issue for the first 
time in parliament said thursday that full disclosure is needed if 
poland and the soviet union are to have genuinely friendly 
relations 
the word katyn must be spoken out in this high chamber 
said bender addressing foreign minister marian orzechowski this 
is required by the honor of the polish people by its martyrdom 
throughout the war 
bender spoke after orzechowski praised a sovietpolish agreement 
on ideological cooperation signed last year that stresses the need 
for a more truthful history of polishsoviet relations 
bender said soviet interests were not served by making poland 
a dependent nation but by having a sovereign selfgoverning 
economically strong poland as its neighbor 
he said the friendly relations between poland and the soviet 
union must be genuine not just facadelike propaganda 
on tuesday 59 polish opposition activists and intellectuals 
including solidarity leader lech walesa issued an open letter 
appealing to soviet intellectuals to speak out about katyn 
bender called on communist authorities to open up to historians 
archives of classified documents so blank spots in 
polishsoviet relations can be filled he said these included the 
1939 nonaggression pact through which the soviet union and germany 
divided poland 
that september the nazis invaded from the west and the soviets 
from the east tens of thousands of poles were deported to siberia 
there are persons in this chamber with painful experiences of 
those deportations said bender 
the phrase blank spots has become shorthand in poland for 
topics so controversial that go unmentioned or are distorted in 
official histories 
last week a joint sovietpolish commission of communist party 
historians met in warsaw to review research on the blank spots 
the panel discussed such sensitive topics as the fate of poles 
deported to the soviet union in 193941 but reported no progress 
in elucidating all the circumstances behind the katyn massacre 
polish and soviet official versions of the massacre say the 
4000 officers whose bodies were found in the forest near smolensk 
were murdered by the nazis in 1941 after they invaded the soviet 
union 
most poles and western historians maintain the officers were 
slain in 1940 on orders of soviet dictator josef stalin 
the 4000 were among 15000 polish officers detained after the 
soviets invaded poland and held in three separate camps in western 
russia the fate of the remaining 11000 officers has never been 
revealed and the issue remains a sensitive point in polishsoviet 
relations 
in his speech orzechowski said the ideological cooperation 
agreement will be conducive to overcoming the negative phenomena 
which have accumulated in history between two countries 
he said poland fully supported the revolutionary changes 
being introduced by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev adding that 
polishsoviet relations are closer than ever before

for a time last spring bracy also faced a military 
courtmartial because navy and federal agents were convinced he had 
conspired with lonetree and allowed russian kgb agents inside the 
embassy late at night to roam at will

were dropped when military lawyers concluded they did not have any

the rev jerry falwell says scandals 
involving tv preachers jim bakker and jimmy swaggart have 
strengthened broadcast evangelism and made christianity stronger 
more mature and more committed 
christian television ministries that put their financial and 
doctrinal houses in order will survive and prosoper falwell told 
the national association of evangelicals on thursday 
in five years most of the evangelical ministers that are 
playing on top of the table will be stronger than they are today 
the fundamentalist preacher said in his first appearance before the 
group which represents 50000 churches in 72 denominations 
falwell is not a member of the nae 
you need not be embarrassed by what has happened just more 
sensitive he told hundreds of applauding delegates this is a 
time to regroup judge ourselves and march on with a greater 
intensity than before 
the cause of christ is now better off because of bakker and 
swaggarts problems falwell said comparing the scandals with 
watergate and politics 
in the days ahead it is going to be tougher for national 
leaders of tv ministries to misbehave just as the watergate 
crisis resulted in governmental and political reforms he said 
bakker who admitted a tryst with a church secretary and who has 
been accused of financial improprieties was expelled from the 
assemblies of god church after bakker resigned as head of ptl 
falwell headed the ministry for several months before stepping 
aside 
swaggart who has been accused of paying a prostitute to perform 
lewd acts was suspended by the denomination and expects to return 
to the pulpit 
the scandals have led to a new code of moral and financial 
ethics for religious broadcasters 
i think the days of the rolls royces and rolexes the days 
in which social status is gauged by financial trappings are over 
said falwell whose old time gospel hour is broadcast worldwide 
on 350 television stations 
he said the swaggart controversy had little effect on his own 
ministry and he didnt believe that it had the more serious impact 
of the bakker revelations on the religious broadcast industry 
however he said that if the events surrounding swaggart and 
bakker had involved him billy graham or other more conservative 
ministers we would be out looking for other employment 
id rather be dead than be immoral said falwell a founder 
of the moral majority and pastor of the 21000member thomas road 
baptist church in lynchburg va 
falwell praised former television evangelist pat robertson but 
said he endorsed vice president george bush for the presidency even 
though falwell advised president reagan not choose bush as his vice 
president 
the preacher said he would like to see us rep jack kemp run 
for vice president the republican new york congressman pulled out 
of the presidential race thursday after a poor showing in primary 
and caucus races 
falwell is a registered democrat but said i cant think of a 
single democrat running this year who i could hold my nose and vote 
for

glenn cunningham who overcame a crippling 
childhood injury to become americas premier middle distance runner 
in the 1930s is dead at age 78 
cunningham died thursday at his exotic animal preserve near 
menifee which he maintained as a retreat for troubled youngsters 
as long as you believe you can do things theyre not 
impossible cunningham said in an interview 10 years ago you 
place limits on yourself mentally not physically 
people say somethings never been done so it cant be done 
but thats not so its never been done because no one has set 
about the task of doing it 
cunninghams greatest task was to walk after the severe injuries 
he received in a 1917 schoolhouse fire that killed his older 
brother floyd doctors feared the extensive damage to the 
7yearold cunninghams legs might require amputation and surely 
would prevent him from walking 
cunningham proved them wrong not only did he walk he ran as 
fast as any miler of his generation persevering through almost 
constant pain 
i was 179 pounds too heavy for a runner he recalled a few 
years ago i also had brokendown arches bad legs and such badly 
abscessed teeth eight of them that doctors didnt see how i 
could walk i never knew when my teeth would cause me great pain 
but i just knew i could do it run and win 
he set a world outdoor record of 4 minutes 67 seconds in the 
mile at princeton nj in 1938 his indoor best of 4044 wasnt 
recognized as a record because it was considered a paced race a 
practice which became acceptable only after cunningham had retired 
cunningham a native of elkhart kan who later attended kansas 
university ran the 1500 in two olympics finishing fourth in the 
1932 games at los angeles and winning the silver medal in the 1936 
games at berlin 
cunningham six times won the prestigious wanamaker mile in the 
indoor millrose games at new york he won it the first time in 
1933 the year he was voted the sullivan award as the best amateur 
athlete in the united states 
he won 21 of his 31 races at madison square garden set six 
world records at 1500 meters or one mile and another at 1000 
yards 
in 1979 cunningham was voted best track athlete in the 100year 
history of madison square garden and on feb 28 returned to the 
millrose games to run a lap during a commemorative ceremony 
after a tour with the navy in world war ii cunningham and his 
wife ruth bought an 840acre ranch near wichita kan cunningham 
tended exotic animals and he and his wife cared for any wayward or 
troubled child sent his way 
we have worked 18 hours a day seven days a week to 
rehabilitate 9000 wayward or orphaned youths who passed through 
our care said cunningham who had 12 children of his own 
funeral arrangments were incomplete

retired air force maj gen richard secord a key 
figure in the irancontra scandal denied any knowledge of an 
alleged reagan administration plot to infiltrate the organizations 
of political extremist lyndon larouche 
secord said thursday he was relaying a message from an associate 
when in a memo to former national security council aide oliver 
north he mentioned an apparent effort to collect information 
against larouche 
secord a principal in norths private contra supply network 
said in a telephone interview that he was not aware of any 
government plot to infiltrate larouche organizations 
defense lawyers for larouche and his supporters on trial here 
on fraud and conspiracy charges contend larouche was a target of 
the fbi and cia they cite the northsecord memo and other 
documents as support for the claim 
the defense lawyers contend that north the marine lieutenant 
colonel fired for his role in the irancontra scandal supported 
the cia and fbi infiltration as part of a reagan administration 
plot to ruin larouche because he opposed aid to the contra rebels 
in nicaragua 
in addition to the secordnorth memo larouche defense lawyers 
have been given an fbi document declassified wednesday that 
quotes three intelligence operatives as saying they were directed 
by top fbi and cia officials to infiltrate larouche groups 
us district judge robert e keeton halted trial testimony this 
week because of the newly discovered documents 
he ordered assistant us attorney john markham to review 
classified fbi files from which the declassified material was taken 
and determine if additional information should be given to defense 
lawyers 
in a may 1986 memo to north that was declassified this week 
secord said he was told by our man here that retired army sgt 
maj fred lewis has collected info against larouche 
defense lawyers have said the prosecutor in the case told them 
our man referred to fbi executive assistant director oliver 
revell but secord said he was referring to john cupp who worked 
for a company that provided clandestine air transport for 
government operations including the contra resupply effort 
cupp on thursday agreed with secords characterization that 
our man referred to him but defense lawyers maintained their 
position that the reference was to revell 
cupp said he had relayed to secord details of a conversation he 
had with lewis whom cupp described as a longtime friend 
fred came to me and said he had been approached by mr 
larouche to conduct some very questionable activities and he kind 
of went along with it to get information because he thought he was 
a froot loop cupp said in a telephone interview 
he knew i was working in washington and looked me up because 
he thought i would be able to get the information to an authority 
who would be able to take some kind of action cupp said 
cupp said lewis told him that larouche wanted to rescue 
dissidents from the soviet union including andrei sakharov and his 
wife yelena bonner 
lewis hung around for a while to check him out and see what he 
was doing but he wasnt doing anything official cupp said 
cupp said he agreed to discuss the matter as a favor to secord 
the three operatives quoted in the declassified fbi material are 
lewis gary howard and ron tucker 
larouche six aides and five larouche political organizations 
are charged with conspiring to obstruct a grand jury investigation 
of alleged credit card and loan fraud by larouche followers during 
his 1984 presidential campaign four of the organizations also are 
charged with fraud 
defense attorneys claim evidence of the fraud was fabricated by 
fbi and cia plants in the organizations

organizers of this mississippi river 
citys annual barbecue contest say its time the cookoff was 
officially titled the worlds largest and theyre going whole hog 
for the billing 
the may 1214 competition is called the world championship 
barbecue contest but that title has no independent verfication 
the national pork producers council is mounting a cooking 
contest june 12 in des moines iowa and is seeking a nod from the 
guinness book of world records for the most pork barbecue cooked in 
a day said ida eleazer a program director for the memphis in may 
festival 
the pork producers hope to attract 300 cooking teams and crank 
out 20000 pounds of pork barbecue she said 
i guess weve been challenged said becky landers an 
organizer of memphis cookoff 
in an informal survey two years ago the memphis barbecuers 
cooked 75000 pounds of pork in two days ms landers said 
this year participants will be required to keep records of how 
much pork they cook 
we never really felt like it was an issue before we knew we 
were the largest barbecue contest in the world ms landers said

defense attorneys expressed disbelief after 
a judge convicted two 13yearold girls of being accessories in the 
death of a 12yearold boy forced to drink lighter fluid and 
suffocated with a plastic bag 
montgomery county juvenile court judge arthur o fisher on 
thursday found the girls guilty of involuntary manslaughter and 
grand theft because they helped two 15yearold boys get into the 
apartment of victim antonio r cooley 
i had never envisioned her as anything but a material 
witness defense attorney daniel obrien said of his client 
whose name like that of the other youngsters in the case was not 
released because of their age 
attorney risa mccray who represented the second girl said 
fisher ignored the girls claims they tried to warn the victim and 
testimony by a 13yearold boy backing them up 
he even ignored the states own evidence ms mccray said 
the defense attorneys contended the 13yearold boy kept the 
girls in a back room while two older boys killed cooley feb 8 
obrien said the two older boys had threatened the girls with 
harm even while in the county detention center 
cooley was sprayed with insecticide and forced to drink charcoal 
lighter fluid before being suffocated with a plastic bag according 
to a deputy coroner 
fisher said the girls did nothing to alert authorities although 
they knew the boys were angry because cooley had denied them use of 
his videocassette recorder and knew they intended to beat cooley 
and steal several items including the vcr and a stereo 
obrien said he would consider an appeal based on the sentence 
fisher is to impose on the girls at an unspecified date 
fisher could order them held for a year and state officials 
then could decide to continue to hold them until age 21 assistant 
prosecutor debra armanini said 
the 13yearold boy has pleaded guilty to deliquency involuntary 
manslaughter and theft and will be sentenced later 
the 15yearold boys face delinquency charges of aggravated 
murder aggravated robbery child endangerment and intimidation 
and may be tried as adults 
i think the verdict sends a message across this city that the 
courts are not going to permit anyone no matter what their age to 
take part in a scheme or plan to snuff out another life 
assistant prosecutor mathias heck jr said 
the girls mothers sobbed and one called the verdict unfair 
i know she didnt do it the woman said he fisher was 
against them in the very beginning regardless

a 15yearold boy convicted of killing a 
classmate with a baseball bat to know what it was like has been 
sentenced to life in prison becoming the states youngest prison 
inmate 
rod matthews could be paroled in 15 years under the mandatory 
sentence he received thursday after being found guilty of 
seconddegree murder in the nov 20 1986 slaying of 14yearold 
shaun ouillette 
two former friends of matthews testified he told them of 
planning the killing and took them to see ouillettes body which 
police did not find until nearly four weeks later in woods in 
canton a suburb 15 miles south of boston 
matthews showed no emotion when the verdict reached after 
almost 10 hours of deliberations over two days by the norfolk 
county superior court jury was announced throughout the trial he 
had been expressionless eyes downcast 
the decision satisfied neither the victims mother jeanne 
quinn nor the defendants parents 
mrs quinn carrying a portrait of her son and choking back 
tears told reporters she had hoped matthews would be convicted of 
firstdegree murder which carries a mandatory life sentence 
without parole 
he planned this she said fifteen years no im sorry 
thats wrong shaun is not coming home in 15 years is he hes not 
ever coming home 
its terrible matthews mother janice said on the 
courthouse steps hours after the verdict a child shouldnt be 
persecuted and forced to go through something like this 
god only knows how much worse its prison going to make his 
condition she said 
matthews takes ritalin for hyperactivity and defense attorney 
john philip white argued for acquittal by reason of insanity 
ritalin taken by an estimated 800000 children has been a 
standard treatment for hyperactivity and attention problems for the 
past 30 years but the stimulant drug has its critics including 
those who say it can cause serious side effects including facial 
tics extreme lethargy and stunted growth 
white portrayed matthews as a mentally unstable child whose 
pleas for help were ignored by teachers and friends and whose 
irrational behavior was possibly exacerbated by ritalin 
he was overlooked said mrs matthews he was overlooked 
in the third grade junior high school we overlooked him because 
we didnt think there was a problem 
white expressing concern for matthews safety and the 
possiblity the youth might attempt suicide said he will try to 
have the boy moved from prison to a mental health center while 
considering whether to appeal 
an appeal must be made within 30 days said superior court judge 
roger donahue 
matthews is the youngest of more than 6500 massachusetts prison 
inmates said correction department spokeswoman mary mcgeown 
it just doesnt make any sense because theres no treatment 
facility there said matthews father kenneth 
prosecutor peter casey a norfolk county assistant district 
attorney called the decision an appropriate wellcounseled 
verdict 
the case has been compared to that of anthony broussard 18 
sentenced to 25 years to life in 1982 in san jose calif for 
killing his girlfriend in 1981 broussard who was also tried as an 
adult took at least 13 schoolmates to see the body the movie 
the rivers edge was based on that case 
matthews trial which began march 2 was broadcast on a canton 
cable television station it was highlighted by graphic 
descriptions of the slaying and testimony by matthews former 
friends rob peterson and jonathan cash who said he told them of 
his desire to kill in the fall of 1986 
he said he wanted to know what it was like to kill somebody 
peterson said 
after rejecting two possible victims matthews chose ouillete 
an overweight high school freshman relatively new to canton 
because he felt he would not be missed the youngsters testified 
ouillette was lured to the woods after school by the promise of 
fireworks before being hit at least three times in the head with 
the baseball bat 
matthews took peterson to see the body several hours after the 
slaying and they hid a knife matthews planned to use to cut off 
ouillettes arms and legs peterson said 
several days later peterson and cash went with matthews to see 
the body then went to a pizzeria 
police found the body dec 15 1986 after receiving an 
anonymous letter from cash 
matthews told a psychiatric counselor after the slaying that he 
first decided to kill someone after viewing the videotape faces 
of death which shows animal and human deaths

the use of us military personnel to 
help in antidrug operations has bolstered bolivias ability to 
foil trafficking but also has shown the difficulties of curtailing 
a billion dollar industry 
there are 30 us military trainers and advisers sent from the 
us southern command in panama now working with bolivian 
antinarcotics police units and air force pilots according to the 
interior ministry 
there have been recent calls in the united states for the 
military to be deployed in the war on drugs and bolivia is a 
country in which the use of us soldiers is being tried 
the mission is a followup to the presence of 175 us soldiers 
and six black hawk helicopters in july 1986 for a threemonth 
operation known as blast furnace says david greenly chief of 
mission at the us embassy in la paz 
blast furnace demostrated that a concerted usbolivian 
effort could make a difference in bolivia that bolivian operations 
could have a similar impact and we are beginning to see such an 
impact is possible greenly told the associated press 
during the 1986 operation 22 major cocaine processing labs were 
destroyed and cocaine shipment and processing were seriously 
disrupted farmers could not sell their coca leaves because 
processing was snarled and prices dropped from 120 a pound of 
coca leaf to 40 cents the estimated cost of production 
cocaine is processed from the leaves of the coca plant which 
peasants in bolivia grow for its profitability 
after the troops pulled out in november coca leaf prices shot 
up and trafficking operations returned to normal bolivian and us 
drug officials say 
since then the us trainers have prepared 720 elite antidrug 
police and taught pilots to fly five huey helicopters on loan from 
the united states the helicopters carrying bolivian police now 
fly regular missions in the tropical lowlands where cocaine labs 
are located 
bolivian police are disrupting operations in the chapare 
cocagrowing region where most of the cocaine is processed into 
paste 
this is reflected in a drop in coca leaf prices the us drug 
enforcement agency says it says prices are down to 30 cents a 
pound of coca leaf even lower than blast furnace days 
the volume of cocaine reaching us and european markets has not 
decreased and the price of cocaine has dropped evidence of a glut 
bolivian cocaine production which accounts for one third of 
what reaches us and european markets has increased 10 percent a 
year to an estimated 80 metric tons in 1987 according to a report 
from the us state department 
the cocaine produced in bolivia has a us street value in the 
billons of dollars the dea says 
despite the concerted effort by bolivian and us forces 
traffickers have moved their operations to remote and hidden jungle 
areas that are difficult to reach by road or even helicopter 
the us government with all its military might could only 
make a dent on cocaine operations in bolivia during blast 
furnace said information minister herman antelo 
but he said that dent was important because it showed bolivia 
was serious about combating cocaine despite political problems that 
blast furnace caused for the government 
during blast furnace marches were held to protest the us 
presence and opposition congressmen and political leaders attacked 
the government describing the us military presence as an 
interference in the internal affairs of bolivia 
when bolivian police dea agents and pilots took over the 
village of santa ananin in october 1986 looking for traffickers 
almost the entire town of 5000 joined in forcing them to leave 
under threat of death townspeople knew in advance about their 
arrival although officials say the planning was handled with 
utmost secrecy 
bolivian and us officials hope the presence of the 30 
trainers who are based near the city of trinidad in the chapare 
region will reduce corruption of officers by traffickers and 
increase the effectiveness of bolivian police and pilots

two scientists set a world record for 
concentrating the suns energy with a homemade silver device that 
could help make a practical solarpowered laser officials said 
we consider this a breakthrough because it just hasnt been 
achieved before said bimleshwar gupta of the us energy 
departments solar energy research institute in golden colo 
which paid for the 150000 project 
roland winston a university of chicago physics professor and 
philip gleckman a graduate physics student used a borrowed mirror 
and their solar concentrator to focus sunlight to 60000 times its 
normal intensity on earth the university announced thursday 
that concentration is about three times the previously achieved 
range of 16000 to 20000 times normal intensity said gupta the 
institutes program manager for solar thermal research 
this work opens whole new areas for applications of solar 
energy he said perhaps the solar concentrator could be used 
to power lasers 
most conventional lasers run on electricity he said there are 
no commercially available solarpowered lasers because the 
technology hasnt been developed to harness the suns rays 
efficiently 
in theory gupta said a solarpowered laser would be cheaper to 
operate because conventional lasers require large amounts of 
expensive electricity 
and those advantages would be greater in space he said where 
solar energy isnt weakened by clouds and is more accessible than 
electricity or other types of energy 
gleckman 26 who helped design the solar concentrator on a 
computer said scientists have used sunlight to power lasers 
before but not very efficiently 
we believe this solar concentrator weve built has the 
potential to make a more efficient solarpowered laser it 
would be less costly and more practical said gleckman 
the solar concentrator he helped design was made from an ounce

for the second time in a year harvard 
university president derek bok has gone against a majority of 
tenured law professors and will not recommend tenure for a 
professor who is an adherent of critical legal studies 
the critical studies philosophy that the legal system is 
biased in favor of the rich and powerful is an issue that has 
divided harvard law school 
bok who was dean of the law school before he became president 
of the university in 1971 announced his decision thursday in the 
case of clare dalton 37 who has taught for seven years 
my record was strong enough for tenure and there was 
political and gender discrimination involved in my being denied 
she told the boston globe thursday night 
bok would not answer questions about the decision and the 
prepared statement he issued did not give a specific reason for his 
action the newspaper said 
the american association of university professors will 
investigate according to a spokeswoman in washington the american 
association of law schools also has been asked to investigate 
last may bok went against the law school faculty in not 
recommending tenure for professor david trubek 
tenured members of the law school faculty voted 2920 last 
spring in favor of granting ms dalton tenure four votes short of 
the twothirds needed under a rule change earlier in the year 
some faculty members say the rule is used by conservative 
professors to block tenure for faculty with whom they disagree 
politically daniel tarullo who also was recommended by a majority 
but not a twothirds vote was denied tenure then 
last october ms dalton filed complaints against harvard with 
the massachusetts commission against discrimination and the federal 
equal employment opportunity commission 
she and a representative of the university asked the state 
commission not to investigate until bok completed a review of the 
case her lawyer nancy gertner said ms dalton has an extremely 
strong gender discrimination case and an extremely strong political 
discrimination case 
last december bok appointed an outside committee to review the 
case 
the globe said that according to a letter bok reportedly sent to 
law school faculty thursday the committee and harvard law school 
dean james vorenberg and two harvard law professors met for seven 
hours sunday reviewed ms daltons scholarship and decided that 
her record was not sufficient to merit tenure

the opposition reunification 
democratic party said today it was abandoning efforts to merge with 
the rival party for peace and democracy because kim daejung 
refused to step down as its leader 
acting reunification president kim myungyoon told a news 
conference his party would go its own way in preparing for national 
assembly elections expected in late april 
he said his party had decided not to discuss the proposed 
merger again because kim daejung had refused its demand that he 
resign as peace and democracy party president by today 
the reunification party made the merger bid after kim youngsam 
resigned as its head last month saying he wanted to pave the way 
for reunification of the two main opposition political parties 
kim youngsam warned that the opposition would lose to the 
governing democratic justice party in the elections if they did not 
reunite 
the parties split last fall when both kims decided to run in 
decembers presidential election that divided the opposition vote 
and roh taewoo won without receiving a majority 
kim daejung refused wednesday to resign and instead proposed 
that he and kim youngsam lead the opposition until the national 
assembly elections sponsoring joint candidates 
in a statement peace and democracy spokesman ahn dongseon 
charged that kim youngsams obstinacy and meddling was behind his 
partys insistence kim daejung step down

six of the nations nine goals for reducing 
fatalities from injuries by 1990 will probably be achieved federal 
health officials predict 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
the fatality rates from many types of injuries including car 
accidents house fires and drownings have dropped since 1979 when 
the us department of health and human services announced its 1990 
goals for the nation 
however some rates have not fallen as far as the government had 
hoped the cdc said although some of the 1990 injuryrelated goals 
reducing deaths from car crashes childhood household accidents 
house fires and gun accidents will be met others such as 
reducing deaths from falls and drownings wont 
achieving the 1990 objectives will require the coordinated 
efforts of federal state and local agencies academic 
institutions professional associations and private entities the 
atlantabased cdc said in its weekly report 
here from the cdc report is a look at the nations 1990 goals 
for reducing deaths from injuries and the progress being made 
reducing the nations annual motor vehicle fatality rate from 
236 such deaths per 100000 americans in 1978 to 18 per 100000 in 
1990 by 1984 the rate had fallen to 196 and the goal is 
projected to be met in part because of a reduction in 
alcoholrelated fatalities 
reducing the motor vehicle fatality rate for children under 15 
from nine per 100000 in 1978 to 55 by 1984 the rate had fallen 
to 66 and the goal is projected to be met 
reducing the death rate from falls from 62 per 100000 in 1978 
to two the rate had fallen only to 51 by 1984 and the goal is 
not expected to be reached people over 65 continue to have high 
death rates from falls for example in 1984 102 such deaths per 
100000 people age 6574 and 147 per 100000 people over 84 
reducing the death rate for children under 15 in home injuries 
from six per 100000 in 1978 to five the 1984 rate was 49 
already meeting the objective 
reducing the drowning rate from 32 per 100000 in 1978 to 15 
the rate had fallen only to 23 in 1984 and the goal is not 
expected to be met 
reducing the number of deaths in residential fires from 5401 
in 1978 to 4500 the objective was reached in 1984 when 4466 
americans died in such fires 
reducing the number of deaths in firearm accidents from 1806 
in 1978 to 1700 the goal was met in 1984 when 1668 such deaths 
were reported 
reducing the suicide rate among 15 to 24yearolds from 121 
per 100000 in 1978 to 11 the rate is going up not down it was 
122 per 100000 in 1984 up slightly from 1978 and up about 200 
percent from 1950 cdc noted that various suicide prevention 
approaches have been tried in us communities but their 
effectiveness is not known 
reducing the homicide rate among black males aged 1524 from 
707 per 100000 in 1978 to 60 this goal will probably be met 
according to cdc researcher dr richard sattin the rate had fallen 
in 1984 to 615 this goal was set recognizing the high homicide 
rate among young black men sattin said noting that the national 
homicide rate in 1984 was 84 per 100000 americans

a haitian colonel accused of conspiring to import 
100 kilograms of cocaine into the united states is unlikely to come 
to trial us officials have conceded 
at present there is no extradition treaty between the united 
states and haiti ana barnett an executive assistant to us 
attorney leon kellner said thursday after the indictment accusing 
col jeanclaude paul was unsealed 
this leaves a substantial question of how the extradition of 
colonel paul could be accomplished she said 
a statement haitis president leslie manigat issued thursday 
through a washington public relations firm called the indictment 
a matter of concern that will be handled in haiti by military 
courts 
paul head of a battalion in the haitian capital of 
portauprince is accused of conspiring to import 100 kilograms of 
cocaine into the united states his brother antonio paul and his 
former wife marie merielle delinois also were named as defendants 
in the indictment 
jeanclaude paul 40 had close ties to the militarydominated 
ruling junta that replaced president jeanclaude baby doc 
duvalier after he fled the impoverished island nation in february 
1986 the officer seldom appeared in public during the juntas 
twoyear rule which ended when manigat was inaugurated last feb 7 
when he did it often was to serve as bodyguard for lt gen 
henri namphy the junta president and now military chief and brig 
gen williams regala now defense minister 
the indictment charged that in december 1986 the accused 
traffickers used a landing strip on pauls farm 90 miles from 
haitis capital to load and fly the cocaine shipment to the 
bahamas where it was lost or stolen 
both men named in the indictment are charged with conspiracy to 
distribute distribution and attempted importation of cocaine they 
could face up to 45 years in prison and 375000 in fines 
ms delinois already a federal fugitive after jumping bond on a 
related march 1987 indictment in miami faces the same three 
counts plus charges of jumping bond and attempting to extort a 
fellow conspirator with violence she faces up to 75 years in 
prison and 410000 in fines 
the extortion count grows out of the unexplained loss of the 
cocaine shipment on spanish key in the bahamas where it allegedly 
was flown from haiti for shipment to the united states 
osvaldo quintana a conspirator and now a principal government 
witness went to spanish key in an attempt to locate the cocaine 
the indictment said 
when he failed to find it according to the indictment ms 
delinois told him his family would be killed if he did not pay at 
least 250000 of the money owed for the lost shipment 
quintana in a news conference here last month said there were 
two attempts on his life by armed haitians but no shots were fired 
quintana has testified for the government at previous drug 
trials in january outside of a federal courtroom he told 
reporters he had once seen 9000 kilograms of cocaine stuffed into 
duffel bags in the haitian presidential palace during the 
administration of duvalier

us military bases here are 
essential for both nations defenses but difficult negotiations 
are ahead on how much washington will pay the philippines to keep 
them a senior american diplomat said today 
also today the military said about 200 communist rebels dressed 
in fatigues raided a police station killing three policemen and a 
civilian before making off with weapons and a radio 
the rebels attacked thursday afternoon in the town of st 
nicholas in pangasinan province 100 miles northeast of the capital 
in manila kenneth quinn the us deputy chief of mission 
denied allegations by the philippines foreign secretary that the 
united states will step up political pressure on president corazon 
aquino to extend the current bases agreement 
quinn told a civic club that the us installations including 
clark air base and the subic bay naval base contributed to global 
security and played a major role not only in the defense of the 
philippines but in providing jobs to filipinos 
the bases are important because they provide for our bilateral 
protection and for the external defense of the philippines quinn 
said 
we think theyre important because they make an enormous 
contribution to the economy of the philippines in terms of the 
68000plus filipinos who are hired there and the 500 million a 
year which is spent in your economy he added 
quinn described as absolutely false a claim by foreign 
secretary raul manglapus that the united states was pressuring mrs 
aquino to say whether she wants the bases agreement extended 
on thursday manglapus who spent more than 10 years as a 
political refugee in the united states accused the americans of 
armtwisting mrs aquino because they have decided to stay 
the current agreement provides that after sept 16 1991 the 
philippines can order the bases closed within one year mrs aquino 
has said she will honor the current agreement but refuses to say 
whether she will agree to an extension 
under the new constitution any extension must be approved by 
twothirds of the 23member senate and may be subject to a national 
referendum 
the us and philippine governments are to begin reviewing the 
current agreement within the next two months filipino officials 
are expected to demand a substantial increase in the 180 million a 
year which the manila government receives in aid for use of the 
bases 
quinn said he expected a full and frank discussion on the 
issue of compensation using diplomatic language which refers to 
tough bargaining 
some filipino congressmen have suggested that the united states 
agree to pay off the countrys nearly 29 billion foreign debt as 
the price for keeping the bases 
about 70 members of the radical league of filipino students 
rallied in front of the senate building today demanding the bases 
be closed 
they carried placards reading save the earth from nuclear 
destruction dismantle all us bases 
on thursday rep lorna yap a member of the house foreign 
affairs committee said the panel reached a consensus to enforce a 
provision of the constitution against nuclear weapons 
the constitution states that the philippines consistent with 
the national interest adopts and pursues a policy of freedom from 
nuclear weapons in its territory 
some government officials argue the phrase consistent with the 
national interest would give mrs aquino flexibility to allow 
such weapons at the american bases others see it as a ban on such 
weapons 
the united states refuses to say whether it maintains nuclear 
weapons at the installations here

a candidate seldom seen or heard from 
collected enough votes in a democratic congressional primary to 
make it into the runoff but his two challengers in the contest 
have cried foul 
johnny welch who has called for a manned space flight to saturn 
and a requirement that every american perform civil service 
captured 34 percent of the vote in the 6th congressional district 
primary tuesday 
he faces an april 12 runoff against np pat kendrick and 
the winner of that race will take on republican incumbent us rep 
joe barton 
but kendrick and ousted candidate w alton parish think theyve 
been the victims of some sort of republican conspiracy registered 
republicans can vote in either partys primary as long as they 
dont cast ballots in both 
they did it intentionally charged parish a fort worth 
economics professor 
theres something very suspicious here he said mr 
kendrick and i worked very hard on this campaign we never took him 
welch seriously kendrick thought i was his opponent and i 
thought he was mine 
gary koops bartons press secretary denied that republicans 
were behind the voting for welch and he noted that barton had 
worked with local officials throughout the district to produce a 
recordbreaking gop turnout tuesday 
there was some speculation that perhaps voters confused welch 
with louie welch the former longtime mayor of houston who twice 
waged a highprofile campaign against incumbent kathy whitmire 
johnny welchs address and home phone number are listed with the 
secretary of states office and a check with both the telephone 
book and directory assistance confirmed the number is correct 
but calls to the home address have gone unanswered there is no 
campaign office listed and party activists in two districts say 
they have never heard of welch 
welchs threepoint platform called for launching a manned space 
flight to saturn mandating that every american participate in 
civil service unless they pay a fee to the government and feeding 
and sheltering the hungry and homeless

said 
at least 87 palestinians have been killed by israeli gunfire or 
beatings during the unrest and hundreds have been wounded

their shoulders patrolled a jewish neighborhood near al ibrahimi

initiative 
peres head of the leftcentrist labor party said upon 
receiving an honorary doctorate from hebrew union college in 
jerusalem that israel would be making a fateful decision in the 
next few weeks 
in 40 days time there is a chance that direct negotiations may 
start between a jordanianpalestinian delegation and an israeli 
delegation he said in 40 days we may lose the opportunity as 
well and the grayness of hesitation of suspicion of postponement 
may cover our skies again for time to come 
shamir flies to washington next week to discuss the initiative

austria today marked the 50th anniversary 
of its annexation by nazi germany capping a bitter twoyear debate 
about its world war ii past that has polarized politics at home and 
tarnished its image abroad 
about 60 protesters gathered outside the chancellery to demand 
the resignation of president kurt waldheim members of the liberal 
greens party boycotted a special parliamentary session marking the 
annexation known as the anschluss 
during world war ii waldheim served as a lieutenant in a german 
army unit in the balkans that has been linked to nazi atrocities 
he has denied any wrongdoing 
fewer than 100 people turned out in a light rain as waldheim and 
other political leaders laid wreaths in separate ceremonies at 
monuments honoring austrias unknown soldiers and victims of 
fascism 
during the ceremonies a dozen protesters gathered outside the 
chancellory building 500 yards away carrying a banner that asked 
who will make waldheim resign 
until two years ago waldheim had not admitted that he served in 
the balkans unit since then he has resisted mounting pressure to 
resign 
greens delegates handed out pamphlets saying they were 
protesting waldheims presence at the hourlong session the 
pamphlets said waldheim is not representative of the austria that 
we want to commemorate 
the greens said they would instead travel to mauthausen site of 
a former nazi concentration camp near the city of linz to honor 
the victims of nazi germany 
chancellor franz vranitzky told a special cabinet session that 
the events of 1938 when this alpine nation was forcibly annexed to 
adolf hitlers third reich were a central theme of austrian 
politics today 
the events of 50 years ago pose relevant fundamental 
questions about the essence of politics vranitzky said if one 
attempts to avoid them they sooner or later return with greater 
emphasis 
vranitzky said austrians must recognize that crimes were 
committed by their countrymen during world war ii 
we must recognize the fact of historical guilt because as 
politicians we must draw lessons from the past failures of 
society he said 
vranitzky did not mention the waldheim controversy 
waldheim originally to speak at a hofburg palace ceremony was 
to remain out of the spotlight throughout the day 
instead waldheim commemorated the annexation with a nationally 
televised speech thursday in which for the first time he apologized 
for crimes committed by austrian nazis during the war but he 
ignored the debate surrounding him 
we must not forget that many of the worst nazi hangmen were 
austrians waldheim said in the 12minute speech there were 
austrians who were victims and others who were perpetrators 
the president added that as head of state of the republic of 
austria i wish to apologize for nazi crimes committed by 
austrians 
austrias nazi past largely suppressed here over the past four 
decades has dogged this country since the disclosure in march 
1986 of waldheims wartime service in the balkans 
as a result the us justice department last year placed 
waldheim on a list that effectively bars him from entering the 
country 
in april 1938 the nazis said 99 percent of austrians approved 
of the anschluss in a nationwide vote widely believed to have been 
rigged 
more than half a million austrians joined the nazi party and 
250000 turned out to cheer hitler when he came to vienna shortly 
after the anschluss 
last month an international panel of historians found that 
waldheim had been in close proximity to war crimes during world 
war ii knew they were going on and made no attempt to prevent them 
the panels report did not support allegations waldheim 
committed atrocities but left open the question of whether he was 
guilty of any crime waldheim claimed the report vindicated him

iraq said it fired 11 missiles today into 
tehran and qom seat of irans religious hierarchy undermining 
efforts to halt the 12dayold bloody war of the cities 
the official iraqi news agency also said iraqi warplanes bombed 
a tanker off the iranian coast 
the news agency monitored in nicosia reported that the 11th 
missile was fired at the iranian capital at 344 pm 16 minutes 
before baghdad had said it would stop its deadly barrages on 
iranian cities 
iraq had offered to end the bombardments if iran halted its 
barrages on baghdad and other iraqi cities baghdad also demanded 
that it be allowed to fire the last shot 
in all the iraqi agency said eight missiles were fired into 
tehran today and three into qom 60 miles south of the iranian 
capital 
irans islamic republic news agency confirmed five of the 
attacks and said there were numerous casualties 
the agency said that in one attack homes of two jewish families 
surnamed odishiv and roshan were demolished killing and wounding 
women and children 
there were no reports of iranian attacks on baghdad but the 
iraqi news agency said iranian f4 phantom jets struck hard at 
residential targets in the northern iraqi city of sulaymaniya 
killing and wounding several civilians 
it also said basra in southern iraq and a cluster of towns 
along the border were shelled by iranian longrange artillery but 
gave no precise casualty figures 
iraq said that during the night its warplanes bombed a large 
maritime target a reference to an oil tanker off the iranian 
coast and seven iranian cities today baneh and ardabil in the 
north kermanshah and hamadan in the west arak and broujerd in 
central iran and dezful in the southwest 
the agency did not identify the stricken ship but said the 
planes scored accurate and effective blows on all their targets 
irans agency confirmed the raids on the cities saying they 
were aimed at civilian targets 
this is a further proof to the tehran rulers who are filled 
with evil intentions and hatred that they should not have started 
the war of the cities the iraqi news agency said 
it said the attacks were designed to avenge the innocent blood 
shed in baghdad and other iraqi cities in the unprecedented 
missile duel 
before today iran and iraq had claimed firing 78 missiles at 
each others capitals since feb 29 fiftyone were fired by iraq 
at tehran and 27 by iran at baghdad 
according to the iranian agency the previous attacks on tehran 
have killed at least 157 civilians and wounded more than 420 iraq 
has not provided exact casualty figures 
several missiles have struck other iranian cities including qom 
and central isfahan while iranian gunners kept up a steady barrage 
of artillery fire on iraqi border communities 
turkish prime minister turgut ozal said in ankara that iran and 
iraq had agreed to halt the duels at his request 
iraq announced thursday that it would stop attacking iranian 
cities at 4 pm baghdad time today which is 430 pm tehran time 
iran gave two times thursday when it said it would stop its 
attacks but both deadlines passed with continued attacks today 
however iran has not reported firing any missiles 
irans un envoy mohammad jaafar mahallati offered to honor 
an unconditional truce if the un chief called for one 
mahallati told a news conference in new york that iran would not 
fire back if iraq got in the last shot before any deadline set by 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar

declines in the costs of food and energy pushed wholesale prices 
downward last month while retail sales were boosted by strength in 
autos the government said today 
wholesale prices fell 02 percent in february the labor 
department said as it released its monthly producer price index 
food prices fell 11 percent and energy prices declined 08 
percent the department said 
for the first two months of 1988 prices rose at an annual rate 
of 11 percent half the modest 22 percent rate for all of last 
year prices rose 04 percent in january after a 04 percent 
decline in december 
meanwhile the commerce department said retail sales rose 06 
percent in february the increase was generally in line with 
expectations 
the government also revised its january retail sales report to 
show a small decline of 02 percent instead of an originally 
reported increase of 05 percent 
even with the january decline analysts said the sales report 
generally reflected that the october stock market crash has had 
little effect on consumer buying plans 
since consumer spending accounts for twothirds of overall 
economic activity any significant faltering in this area could 
topple the country into a recession 
on thursday nervousness over wall streets strength yanked down 
stock prices but pessimism disappeared in the energy markets 
where oil futures rose sharply over expectations that opec will 
take steps to avert another 1986style price collapse 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 4824 points 
to 202603 its largest loss since falling 5720 on jan 20 
broader market indicators also declined 
declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 3 to 1 on the 
new york stock exchange and the wilshire 5000 equity index 
measuring the value of 5000 us stocks fell nearly 40 billion 
analysts said the selloff reflected continued anxiety about the 
aftermath of the oct 19 market crash which persistently has 
undermined investor confidence 
the mood contrasted sharply with a buying spree on the new york 
mercantile exchange where contracts for april delivery of west 
texas intermediate the main us crude rose 51 cents to close at 
1600 a barrel refined products traded on the exchange also rose 
sharply 
petroleum analysts linked the oil rally to reports that the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries aware it cant 
sustain relentless price discounting and excessive output will 
shave 5 percent off the production of all members except iraq 
which has resisted cartel discipline 
the reports reflected hopes that after three months of price 
erosion reminiscent of the cataclysmic market plunge two years ago 
opec and nonopec producers were taking steps to avoid another 
uncontrollable drop 
since january prices for persian gulf oil have fallen as low as 
13 per 42gallon barrel compared with opecs official price of 
18 west texas intermediate has dropped from about 18 to as low 
as 15 
in other financial markets gold prices rose sharply in reaction 
to the sudden strength in the oil market which could portend 
higher inflation gold is considered a good hedge against rising 
prices 
in the bond market a barometer of interest rate trends prices 
fell in reaction to higher oil and metal prices the treasurys 
30year issue fell 5 per 1000 in face amount and its yield rose 
from 851 percent to 855 percent

navy helicopter crashed off the portuguese coast after taking off 
from a warship that prince andrew was aboard portuguese and 
british officials said today 
commandante antonio monteiro coelho a portuguese navy 
spokesman said the lynx helicopter crashed thursday night less 
than threefourths of a mile from the training ship engadine where 
andrew was on duty as a helicopter warship instructor

for andrew today was canceled because of the accident the 
presidents office said 
on thursday prince charles andrews brother and heir to the 
british throne narrowly escaped an avalanche that killed a close 
friend skiing with him in switzerland the accident prompted calls 
in the british press for the royal family to abandon dangerous 
pursuits 
the defense ministry spokesman who was not indentified in 
keeping with british custom refused to say whether andrew was 
involved in the planning of the helicopters test flight 
it is normal practice not to reveal who is involved in the 
planning of operations he said the whole thing will go before 
the board of inquiry 
monteiro coelho said the helicopter crashed into the sea around 
9 pm 50 miles west of the cabo da roca a cape west of lisbon

bodies

that because of the crash andrews ship would not put into lisbon 
for the weekend as scheduled he said he did not know whether the 
vessel would return to britain or remain at sea

engadine went it crashed for those aboard the ship to have 
witnessed the accident

falklands war was on regular sea duty as a helicopter instructor 
aboard the engadine british officials said

telephone transcripts casting doubt on former 
minister walker raileys actions the night his wife was almost 
choked to death were released by a prosecutor who said he wanted to 
fill in the blanks 
the transcripts of two calls railey made to his home answering 
machine the night of the attack and a note he wrote before 
attempting suicide 11 days later were made public thursday by 
dallas county assistant district attorney norman kinne 
in the transcripts railey describes his whereabouts in detail 
gives times and warns his wife margaret peggy railey to lock 
the garage door 
railey 40 told police he found his wife unconscious in the 
garage with a cord wrapped around her neck when he came home early 
april 21 mrs railey remains in a coma 
railey senior pastor at first united methodist church and a 
rising star in the united methodist church took an overdose of 
pills in an unsuccessful suicide attempt may 2 the day police said 
they planned to interview him 
after reportedly refusing 43 times to testify before a grand 
jury he resigned and moved to san francisco leaving his wife and 
children ages 2 and 5 in texas 
kinne said he didnt have the evidence to bring railey to trial 
i feel like this may very well be the last anyone is hearing 
of this and i want to fill in the blanks as much as i can the 
prosecutor said 
the answering machine transcripts point out a number of 
discrepancies 
in one call railey said he was phoning around 1030 pm and 
had a couple more hours of research to do at a southern methodist 
university library 
however telephone company records indicate railey made the call 
from his mobile phone at 1204 am and library employees couldnt 
recall seeing railey when he claimed he was there kinne said 
railey explained he had to leave the library when it closed and 
was on his way to another and later called to say he was on his 
way home 
im not calling on the private line because i know youre 
already asleep he said in that message but in case you get up 
with the kids i just wanted you to know that im on my way home 
its 1230 ill be home by about 1245 love you dear bye bye 
railey called police about 15 minutes later to report he had 
found his wife unconscious 
in the fourpage suicide note he described himself as the 
weakest of the weak the baddest of the bad and the lowest 
of the low 
he said he was taking his life because a demon inside my soul 
has finally gotten the upper hand and lured me into doing 
things i do not want to do 
other parts of the note were published earlier railey has said 
the letter reflected his despondency 
kinne also said he discovered that railey spent more than an 
hour that night at the home of psychologist lucy papillon who 
reportedly told grand jurors she and railey were having an affair 
theres a big gap between saying the man is not telling the 
truth about some things and saying therefore he strangled his 
wife the prosecutor said im not saying that 
kinne initially refused to release the transcripts prompting 
abc news to file suit the suit failed but kinne decided to release 
the material after an appeals court ruled it was up to local 
officials to decide the issue 
the telephone at raileys san francisco apartment is unlisted 
and railey could not be reached for comment thursday railey leased 
the apartment with ms papillon 
mrs raileys mother and legal guardian billy jo nicolai has 
filed a civil suit against railey accusing him of the attack on her 
daughter

an american woman who championed the 
cause of soviet citizens seeking to emigrate to the united states 
to join their spouses has been divorced from her russian husband 
district judge kenneth bronson agreed with sandra gubins 
contention that her husband aleksei lodisev married her solely to 
enter the united states 
the defendants entire testimony is shot through with 
evasiveness and contradictions said bronson who heard the case 
as a visiting judge in washtenaw county circuit court 
the only reason lodisev married gubin bronson said was to 
leave the soviet union thats the only conclusion i can reach 
he said he planned his moves he thought it out the plan was of 
long duration 
gubin and lodisev were married in the soviet union in 1981 
while gubin was studying in kiev she returned to the united states 
and spent several years trying to get an exit visa for lodisev 
she became nationally known as a spokeswoman for the divided 
spouse coalition americans whose spouses have been denied exit 
visas 
in january 1986 lodisev arrived in new york eleven months 
later gubin filed for divorce saying that he married her only to 
come to the united states 
gubin was awarded 113087 for lost wages expenses for writing 
to political figures and medical expenses there is scant 
likelihood of collection on the judgment because of debts 
pending against lodisev bronson said in his ruling tuesday 
lodisev he said had run up about 22000 in bills before 
leaving last summer for a visit to the soviet union which showed 
a pattern not just of stiffing the plaintiff but of stiffing 
everyone else in this country bronson said 
lodisevs lawyer craig mckinnon said he was unsure whether his 
client wanted to appeal lodisev who works for a computer company 
had no comment after the ruling 
gubin 40 a doctoral student in political science at the 
university of michigan said she felt vindicated but sorry for 
lodisev 
i care for him she said i know he doesnt believe it 
but i do

twelve percent of usmade condoms and 21 
percent of foreignmade ones failed in recent testing say federal 
researchers the prophylactics have been advocated as a means of 
slowing the spread of aids 
as of february the centers for disease control reported 
thursday the food and drug administration had tested samples from 
430 batches of condoms 165 batches manufactured in america and 
265 manufactured abroad 
the fda reported previously that as many as one in five batches 
of latex condoms it tested fail to meet federal standards 
the fda rejects a batch of condoms if more than four per 1000 
fail in waterleakage tests if two or more batches from a foreign 
manufacturer fail future shipments from that manufacturer are 
stopped at their port of entry into the united states 
the cdc in its report on condoms and sexually transmitted 
diseases stressed that condoms can help prevent such diseases but 
that they dont always work 
individuals likely to become infected or known to be infected 
with aids should be aware that condom use cannot completely 
eliminate the risk of transmission the atlantabased agency said 
lab tests have shown that latex condoms are effective barriers 
to the spread of aids hepatitis b gonorrhea chlamydia and other 
sexually transmitted diseases however breakage or other mishaps 
during use can negate their diseasefighting effectiveness 
the cdc said condoms should be made more widely available 
through std clinics family planning clinics and drug treatment 
centers 
those clinics and centers should become more assertive in 
warning clients about stds and emphasize that the risk of 
infection is most effectively reduced through abstinence or sexual 
intercourse with a mutually faithful uninfected partner 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a 
virus that damages the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

were also seen on the roof of a police station in the central 
market square

telephone interview she said one announcement called for people 
to surrender people who were involved in the disturbances 
before the 20th otherwise they would be punished

republican sen bob dole today denied 
he was dropping out of the presidential race and he criticized the 
news media for concentrating on such matters as his campaign staff 
cuts saying i never thought that a campaign was a jobs 
program 
i am running for president dole told a group of illinois 
farm bureau leaders trying to stop rumors that he was about to 
pull out after suffering crushing defeats to vice president george 
bush on super tuesday 
however he told reporters after the speech we will reassess 
after illinois i am going to be very realistic about this 
dole said the question of pulling out of the illinois primary 
was not discussed by him and his aides but he conceded they did 
discuss canceling some campaign activities to heighten whatever 
were going to do later 
he said his campaign had more than 1 million on hand to finance 
its illinois efforts his problem he said is not money weve 
got the staff we need what we need is to slow down this super 
tuesday momentum 
its hard to focus on the issues sometimes because the press 
wont let us do that he said they would rather write about 
how many staff you reduced your numbers by 
news reports also have noted that he has taken his television 
ads off the air in illinois 
dole made his remarks at the start of a daylong trip across 
central and western illinois to shore up his support in farm 
country which is considered his strongest territory 
in a statement issued thursday night in illinois and washington 
dole had categorically denied rumors that he was about to drop 
out in the face of bushs big delegate lead and polls that show 
bush ahead in illinois which has its primary next tuesday dole 
has taken all his tv ads off the air in illinois 
im not a dropout im a candidate dole told a suburban 
chicago veterans group thursday night 
were going to be in this race all the way to new orleans and 
now were looking for an upset next tuesday in illinois 
although dole sought to shoot down reports that his presidential 
quest was ending several campaign sources said that option had 
been discussed 
the sources speaking on condition that they not be identified 
said dole met with campaign manager bill brock and other aides in 
the past few days in illinois and talked about the possibility of 
abandoning the race because of bushs commanding lead in delegates 
for the gop nomination 
dole however decided to press on in illinois 
im the underdog the odds are great but ive tackled great 
odds before and im still here dole said 
bushs sweep of 16 super tuesday primaries has clearly wounded 
doles campaign 
one dole aide speaking on condition of anonymity said doles 
private polls indicated bush held a lead of between 15 and 20 
percentage points in illinois that was described as a significant 
increase for the vice president in the 48 hours following his 
victories on super tuesday 
a washington postabc news poll published today said bush led 
dole in illinois by a wide margin 58 percent to 31 percent 
although dole had not said whether he would remain in the race 
if he lost illinois next tuesday one aide said i think its 
clear to dole that its do or die 
im a fighter im also a realist ive looked at the delegate 
count and ive got to do well in illinois dole said at one 
chicago stop thursday 
and im not in this race to see how long we can extend it im 
in this race to win 
mari maseng doles press secretary said 130 staff members in 
super tuesday states were being cut because the campaign no longer 
needed them in addition she said more than half of the staff in 
the campaign national headquarters was laid off to provide money 
for media and essential travel for the illinois effort 
there were no staff cuts in states with primaries after next 
tuesday 
maseng confirmed dole had ordered his television ads stopped in 
illinois because weve changed our media strategy dole had 
planned to spend about 500000 on tv spots in the state 
maseng said campaign advisers were trying to draft a new 
advertising battle plan to draw the contrast between bob dole and 
george bush as dramatically as we can 
the campaign according to one source is considering a 
30minute paid broadcast near the end of the illinois campaign

a band of men wielding guns swords 
and daggers ambushed a bus carrying tamils today and killed at 
least 16 people officials said 
police believe the attack was in retaliation for the killings of 
sinhalese by tamil guerrillas last week 
todays killings occurred in the northeastern district of 
trincomalee and the victims all were believed to be tamils said a 
military official he could not be identified under military 
regulations 
the official said the attackers stopped the bus near the village 
of horawapatana 28 miles west of the port city of trincomalee and 
attacked the passengers 
our reports are that eight passengers were shot and butchered 
seven more were forced to remain inside the bus when it was 
torched another died on the way to a nearby hospital 
we have unconfirmed reports that the total dead could be more 
than 22 the official said all of them are reported to be 
tamils 
police investigating the bus attack believe it was carried out 
by sinhalese in retaliation for the killings last week of 45 
sinhalese and moslem villagers 
twentyseven people most of them sinhalese died when a truck 
was blown up saturday near sitaru and 18 more sinhalese were 
killed when tamil rebels raided the morawewa village wednesday 
both villages are in trincomalee 
militant tamils have been fighting since the summer of 1983 for 
a separate state in northern and eastern sri lanka where most 
tamils live 
india has an estimated 45000 soldiers in sri lanka to try to 
enforce an indiansponsored peace accord signed last july to try to 
end the war 
tamils most of whom are hindus make up 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million population they claim they are discriminated 
against by the majority sinhalese buddhists who control the 
government and the military 
india has become involved because it has 60 million ethnic

a courtappointed guardian for a 
48yearold comatose woman is supporting her familys request to 
remove a feeding tube that is keeping the woman alive 
boston college law professor paul r tremblay concluded that 
although tube feeding was once considered an ordinary measure 
that a patient could not refuse a considerable body of legal and 
medical expertise suggests that is no longer true 
doctors for the family of marcia v gray and the state which is 
fighting the familys request say the woman will die within a 
period of days to a few weeks if the feeding tube is removed 
in a similar case a family in carthage mo is suing the state 
to force doctors to disconnect nancy cruzan 30 from a feeding 
tube because she would not want to live in a hopeless state her 
parents rested their case today after they and another daughter 
testified 
the woman was left in what doctors call a persistent 
vegetative state after a 1983 automobile accident she is being 
cared for at the state rehabilitation center at mount vernon 
mrs gray has been in a coma since suffering a cerebral 
hemorrhage in january 1986 last january the roman catholic bishop 
of providence louis e gelineau said it would be morally 
permissible to withdraw nutrition from mrs gray who is a catholic 
it is in marcia grays best interest that the feeding tube be 
removed once the benefits of continued feeding are weighed against 
the burdens of that treatment tremblay said in a report 
submitted thursday to us district judge francis j boyle 
tremblay concluded that if state officials at general hospital 
continue to oppose allowing mrs gray to die they should quickly 
transfer her to a hospital that would grant the familys request 
if no hospital were found tremblay said the court should order 
state officials to comply 
the state asserts that honoring the familys request would be 
tantamount to sanctioning euthanasia 
family members tremblay said have provided adequate data 
to satisfy the standards that courts have used to permit the 
discontinuance of lifesupport systems for terminally ill patients 
she was very persistent in her wishes and insisted that i 
promise not to keep her alive in a coma where there was no hope of 
recovery her husband university of rhode island professor h 
glenn gray said in an affidavit

a minor earthquake shook an area about 10 miles 
southeast of tacoma today but apparently did no damage officials 
said 
the temblor was recorded at 201 am pst according to the us 
geological surveys national earthquake information center in 
golden colo it measured 35 on the richter scale said the 
centers bruce presgrave 
there were no reports of damage or injury 
for a quake this size i really would not expect any 
presgrave said 
residents of fife federal way tacoma and auburn called local 
radio stations to report the quake 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage

federal investigators say an air force bomb 
expert who had been absent without leave for several weeks 
apparently set off a blast in his pickup truck that killed him and 
damaged a motel where he was staying 
but officials said it was unknown if staff sgt donald lawrence 
lunger detonated the bomb intentionally or accidentally march 4 
forensic psychologists will study lungers medical records and 
talk with family and friends to determine why he placed a 10pound 
to 15pound package of explosives behind the seat of his pickup 
truck and attached it to a blasting cap said willi ellison agent 
in charge of the jacksonville office of the bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms 
the explosives wires and other materials found at the blast 
scene indicated they were the type used at eglin air force base 
where lunger was stationed an investigation at the base was under 
way to determine if any explosive materials were missing ellison 
said thursday 
it has been determined that the explosion that resulted in the 
death of lunger was a deliberate act initiated by actions 
intentionally or unintentionally taken by him officials said 
the charge could have been electrically detonated by the 
cigarette lighter in the truck or flashlight components ellison 
said 
he said there was no indication that lunger was involved in any 
criminal activity narcotics or espionage he said he could not 
speculate on whether lunger was under mental distress at the time 
of the blast

several days before the explosion motel employees said he was 
reported awol from eglin on feb 22 
lunger originally of endicott ny had been in the air force

the state naacp president and 13 other 
black lawmakers argued today that they were protected by 
legislative immunity when they tried to remove the confederate 
battle flag from atop the alabama capitol 
the trespassing arrests of the legislators raised serious 
constitutional questions and serious questions of state law said 
fred gray who represents thomas reed head of the state national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
gray also said at the court hearing that gov guy hunt lacked 
the right to instruct officers to arrest anyone who attempted to 
enter the capitol grounds through a locked chainlink fence since 
the building is under the control of the alabama historical 
commission the building is closed for renovation 
prosecutors from the district attorneys office did not comment 
on the defense motions 
district judge craig miller granted defense attorneys request 
to file briefs and gave the district attorneys office 10 days to 
respond he said he would set a trial date later 
reed speaking with reporters before the brief hearing began 
repeated his contention that the state should not fly the flag over 
the capitol reed and the other legislators maintain that the 
confederate banner represents racial oppression and slavery 
people can fly it on their pickup trucks i have no problem 
with that said reed a state representative from tuskegee 
reed and his codefendants were arrested feb 2 minutes after 
the legislatures opening gavel 
capitol police and state troopers pulled down reed and the 
others as they made at least symbolic efforts to scale the 8foot 
fence the lawmakers never got near the building and the dixie flag 
still flies atop the capitol dome some merely put their hand on 
the chainlink fence when they were arrested 
each lawmaker was charged with seconddegree criminal 
trespassing and released from the county jail on 300 bond 
conviction on the misdemeanor count carries a maximum penalty of 
three months in jail and a 500 fine 
reed had vowed for weeks to remove the flag hundreds of people 
ranging from ku klux klansmen carrying rebel flags to black 
students singing we shall overcome gathered outside the 
capitol for reeds attempt 
hunt who contends the flag is historic and not a symbol of 
racism has refused to remove the standard saying the legislature 
should decide the issue hours after reed and the other democrats 
were arrested the state house defeated a resolution to remove the 
flag 
the naacp also is trying to remove the banner above south 
carolinas statehouse and change the state flags of georgia and 
mississippi which bear versions of the confederate battle flag in 
their designs

kidnappers of us marine lt col 
william r higgins have pledged to free him but set no specific 
date for the release the beirut magazine ashshiraa said today 
the weekly quoted unidentified knowledgeable sources in south 
lebanon as saying the kidnappers made the pledge in secret 
contacts undertaken by more than local and regional parties 
there was no way to verify the report independently 
ashshiraa gained international fame for disclosing the secret 
us arms sales to iran in november 1986 but many of its reports 
about foreign hostages held in lebanon have proved inaccurate 
higgins 44 of danville kentucky who served with a un 
observers group in south lebanon was kidnapped near the ancient 
southern port of tyre on feb 17 
a proiranian shiite group the organization of the oppressed on 
earth claimed responsibility for his abduction charging he was a 
spy for the us central intelligence agency us and un 
officials have denied the charge 
the sources did not reveal an approximate date for higgins 
release saying this has been left for the kidnappers to set the 
magazine said 
the sources have said that the important thing in this regard 
is that a decision has been taken by the kidnappers to free 
higgins such as what happened with former west german hostage 
ralph schray who was freed last week ashshiraa added 
schray an industrial engineer who was abducted in moslem west 
beirut jan 27 was released by his proiranian shiite moslem 
captors march 3 in west beirut 
syrian troops in charge of security in west beiruts whisked him 
the same day to the syrian capital of damascus where he was handed 
over to the west german embassy he returned to resume his life in 
west beirut two days later 
twentytwo foreigners including nine americans are missing and 
believed kidnapped in lebanon the longest held is american terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press

the telephone company is cracking 
down on us air force personnel who have been using nickels 
instead of british 20pence coins to make cheap calls home an air 
force spokesman said friday 
it seems airmen stationed in britain have for some time known 
that a nickel works like a 20pence coin in pay phones a 20pence 
coin is worth 37 cents so every nickel used for a call to the 
united states saves 32 cents 
using the nickel swindle a transatlantic call that should have 
cost about 24 would only cost 3 
british telecom the telephone company estimates the scam has 
cost it about 52000 in the past several months 
two airmen at the us air force base in bentwaters in eastern 
england have been charged with cheating on longdistance calls and 
the air force is helping the telephone company end the swindle 
we have warned everyone here that british telecom is looking 
out for people making fraudulent use of the phones said capt 
john boyle a spokesman at brentwaters 
the united states takes very seriously anything of this nature 
and we fully support british telecom in its efforts to track down 
offenders he said

that jet lag is far more difficult when you come back 
it will be a little difficult for the president when he comes 
here gorbachev said referring to the next summit meeting

reagan probably will spend some time in neighboring finland before 
coming to moscow to adapt to the time change

leaders of student protests at gallaudet 
university say todays resignation of elisabeth ann zinser as 
president of the deaf liberal arts college leaves other key demands 
yet to be addressed 
separately the chairman of the schools board of trustees said 
it will meet next week to weigh those demands which include 
drastic changes in the board itself 
zinsers appointment sunday had sparked heated protests over the 
boards failure to appoint a deaf president something the school 
never has had in its 124year history 
zinser who has normal hearing and does not know sign language 
resigned just after midnight she told a later news conference that 
the siege was not the reason she resigned 
what is happening across the country is a civil rights time of 
the deaf community she said we have responded to that she 
called the protest a very special moment in time for the deaf 
community that we could not anticipate 
zinser who began studying sign language only during the final 
week of the selection process held up her fingers in the i love 
you sign as she told members of the deaf community i send them 
the message that we celebrate with them and wish them their day in 
the sun 
in an earlier nationally televised interview student protest 
leader jerry covell said that while the students are very 
excited about zinsers resignation they plan to insist on other 
changes to make the school more sensitive to its hearingimpaired 
students 
their first priority covell said is for zinser to be replaced 
with a deaf president in addition the students are seeking 
the resignation of jane bassett spilman as chairman of the 
board of trustees 
a minimum of 51 percent deaf people on the board of trustees 
a guarantee of no reprisals against students faculty and staff 
who were involved in the protests 
spilman appearing at the news conference with zinser said 
there would be no reprisals but she refused to address the other 
two demands until the board meets early next week 
it is for me and the board of trustees to assess she added 
when asked whether she will remain or whether the composition of 
the board will change i have begun to make that assessment 
she said the board would also begin looking for a new president 
next week but she would not discuss whether the job will go to a 
deaf person 
the school institution from the outside looks beautiful 
said covell whose sign language was voiced by an interpreter on 
cbstvs this morning program there are people there who 
dont understand and are not sensitive to our needs and now it is 
time we feel that we are ready and we have ample support and 
numerous people who agree with us so why should we stop now 
zinser vice chancellor for academic affars at the university of 
north carolina at greensboro had stayed away from gallaudets 
campus this week in the hope that the furor would die down but had 
insisted she was in charge 
spilman called the resignation a tragic loss to the university 
we selected dr zinser as president in recognition of her 
superior academic administrative and research skills she said 
her strengths and accomplishments were precisely in those areas 
most critical for the growth of the university 
rep steve gunderson rwis and one of the universitys 
trustees said a hearingimpaired person should be at the helm at 
gallaudet zinser was the only one of the three finalists for the 
job who was not deaf 
ive said all along even before dr zinser resigned that 
ideally a hearingimpaired person would be the track that we ought 
to follow gunderson said 
a large majority of the institutions 2300 students joined in 
the protests which began sunday with a march on capitol hill 
students on thursday threatened to seize the presidents campus 
house and office if zinser made her way past students blocking 
entrances to the school and school officials chained shut the 
doors to the administration building 
students from the national technical institute for the deaf in 
rochester ny had planned to travel to washington by bus today 
to show their solidarity with the protesters 
presidential candidates jesse jackson and paul simon offered 
words of encouragement to the students saying their protest 
reflected the desire of handicapped americans everywhere to take 
control of their own destiny 
the national association of the deaf a 20000member deaf 
rights group based in silver spring md said it had been 
receiving calls letters and pledges of support for the gallaudet 
students from around the country and as far away as great britain 
a university official who was one of the other two finalists for 
the presidents job i king jordan on thursday had withdrawn his 
support for zinser 
the resignation followed a warning by rep david bonior 
dmich another university trustee that federal aid for the 
school could be jeopardized if she refused to leave the post 
the house education and labor subcommittee on select education 
which oversees gallaudets budget scheduled hearings for next week 
on the dispute 
about 75 percent of the schools 76 million operating budget 
comes from federal funds the rest comes from tuition and grants

a brush fire 35 miles long and six miles 
wide roared across west texas early today scorching an estimated 
135000 acres by midmorning officials said 
however no serious injuries were reported and most homes in the 
path of the fire were saved by hundreds of firefighters battling 
the blaze said lawrence winkler information officer of the 
shackelford county emergency management team some firefighters 
suffered minor burns 
its been a miracle so far winkler said of the 
firefighting effort 
however officials said a cold front was expected to change the 
direction of the wind today and turn the flames back toward albany 
a town of 2400 people about 150 miles west of dallas 
by 9 am winds that had gusted to 30 mph had died down but 
national weather service forecasters said the calm preceded a shift 
in winds along the cold front 
army national guard troops used bulldozers to build firebreaks 
to protect the town according to maj ed komandosky a spokesman 
at the guard state headquarters in austin 
earlier the fire threatened albany the shackelford county 
seat but winds died down and the fire moved north and away from 
the town officials at the sheriffs office in albany said 
texas national guardsmen ordered by gov bill clements to help 
local authorities joined an estimated 15 west texas fire 
departments and members of the texas forest service in fighting the 
blaze 
some fire equipment was lost to the flames mainly because 
firefighters were working in darkness winkler said at times 
during the night the blaze could be seen as far as 35 miles away 
he said 
at least one house some mobile homes and outbuildings were 
destroyed during the early hours of the blaze thursday night 
authorities said 
some children were evacuated from homes in the path of the fire 
but winkler said most people stayed there to fight the fire 
nervous albany residents watched during the night as the glow of 
the approaching fire got closer but there were no evacuations 
families that moved away from their isolated rural homes chose 
to stay with friends said red cross spokeswoman cheryl parks 
the national weather service said winds gusted to 30 mph in the 
area around the fire thursday night but winkler said the wind died 
down somewhat during the night 
albany which dates from about 1880 was an early supply point 
on the cattle trail to dodge city kan

authorities said they will begin excavating 
a site monday in search of evidence in the shooting deaths of four 
members of a family and the disappearance of a relative eight 
months ago 
authorities on friday would not identify the site or specify 
what they might find 
this site has possibilities but no certainties marathon 
county sheriffs lt elwood mason said friday 
authorities believe 500 to 700 cubic yards of material will be 
removed mason said he would not comment on whether that material 
might be dirt or concrete 
it is not on land that is owned or under control by any 
suspect in this case mason said adding that was one reason for 
choosing to dig at this site rather than any others under 
consideration 
four members of the kunz family were found shot to death and a 
fifth family member disappeared from their rural athens home last 
july 
circumstances and events surrounding july 4 and 5 give this 
site some probabilities but by no means create a certainty that 
there would be something there mason said 
district attorney rand krueger said thursday he did not plan to 
file charges in the case this week and no one was in custody he 
said the number of suspects which he had described earlier as more 
than one but fewer than 12 remained the same 
helen kunz 70 has been missing since her relatives bodies 
were discovered in the family home ms kunzs brother clarence 
kunz 76 their sisters irene 81 and marie 72 and helen kunzs 
son randy 30 were shot dead 
krueger would not comment on whether a murder weapon had been 
recovered

a german restaurant violated the civil rights 
of three patrons by refusing them service for wearing nazi swastika 
lapel pins a superior court judge ruled 
but judge kurt lewin said thursday it would be up to a jury to 
determine whether alpine village restaurant in torrance was wrong 
in refusing the three service in october 1985 after they caused a 
disturbance when told to leave 
lewin said state law prevented the restaurant from refusing 
service because of what the men wore 
the suit on behalf of joe fields 24 of san pedro stanley 
witek 54 of los angeles and harold follin 28 of anaheim had 
sought unspecified damages as well as an injunction preventing the 
restaurant from refusing service to customers based on their 
political views damages would only be awarded if the jury sides 
with the plaintiffs 
attorney julia tachikawa who represented the restaurant said 
she didnt know if alpine village would want to appeal 
she expressed disappointment that the judge ruled against the 
restaurants contention that it did not have to serve the men if 
they wore things patrons might find offensive 
ms tachikawa said lewin failed to take into account the 
restaurants constitutional right of freedom of association 
in this case i was trying to argue that it was a german 
restaurant and the association was so obvious the restaurant was 
compelled to speak up that we dont hold that view she said 
the swastika was the emblem of adolf hitlers national socialist 
party 
ms tachikawa said the restaurant contended the men were thrown 
out not because of the pins but because they caused trouble after 
being asked to either remove the pins or leave 
american civil liberties union attorney carol sobel who 
represented the men said it didnt matter whether they created a 
disturbance after they were refused service 
she argued that the only issue to be resolved was whether a 
restaurant could exclude someone because it disapproved of what the 
person was wearing

judging by what israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir had to say in his letter to skeptical senators this 
toughminded middle eastern leader may climb aboard secretary of 
state george p shultzs peace shuttle after all 
shamir reaffirmed his commitment to the 1978 camp david approach 
to negotiations over the west bank and gaza the way shultz has 
structured the talks that would suffice for the first stage 
but shamirs resistance to the concept of trading the 
territories or even part of them for arab recognition is a 
potential roadblock so is the refusal of king hussein of jordan to 
commit himself to recognizing israel until the territories are 
vacated 
shamir who will be here monday to see president reagan shultz 
and members of congress has a reputation for intransigence so did 
menachem begin the last leader of the likud coalition to serve as 
prime minister of israel 
but begin turned every inch of sinai over to egypt stripping 
israel in the meantime of all its oil resources dismantling a 
firstclass military airfield and uprooting jewish settlers begin 
gave it all away in exchange for a 1979 peace treaty with the most 
formidable arab country 
the treaty was based on the camp david agreements former 
president jimmy carter worked out with begin and the late egyptian 
president anwar sadat in the catoctin mountains of maryland 
israel offered selfrule or autonomy to the 15 million 
palestinian arabs who live on the west bank and in gaza as an 
interim arrangement all options including statehood would be 
open during a second stage of negotiations 
the first round ended in 1981 in failure jordan and the 
palestinians did not participate the arab world shunned sadat for 
his treaty with israel and only lately has begun to repair 
relations with cairo 
sens carl levin dmich rudy boschwitz rminn and 28 other 
senators criticized shamir for not being willing to give up 
portions of the territories in exchange for arab recognition of 
israel 
but the prime minister in his reply left the option open as 
the camp david agreements do he said the formula begin and sadat 
devised would grant the palestinian arabs selfrule following 
which the sides would negotiate the final status of the territories 
in question in a vastly improved setting of coexistence and 
cooperation between jordan israel and the palestinian arabs 
in other words shamir still wants a trial period of palestinian 
autonomy before taking up a final settlement he may harbor hopes 
the palestinians would elect to remain under israels security 
control while running their own daily affairs 
in a letter to shultz in january the israeli leader excluded 
only security and foreign relations as functions of autonomous 
palestinian arabs 
the scheme shultz presented to shamir and hussein in jerusalem 
and london envisions a threeyear interim arrangement that should 
be attractive to the prime minister 
also negotiations for an overall settlement would begin only if 
israel and a mixed jordanianpalestinian delegation succeeded in 
working out interim arrangements 
that means shamir could say yes next week to the president 
and the secretary of state without committing himself to yielding 
the territory israel won in the 1967 sixday war 
the prime ministers letter to levin and boschwitz suggests 
getting him to give up even parts of the west bank and gaza would 
be more difficult than persuading begin to yield the sinai 
shamir reminded the senators that jordans occupation of the 
west bank from 1950 to 1967 was never recognized internationally 
egypt held gaza during the same period but unlike sinai the strip 
along the mediterranean was occupied militarily and illegally 
shamir said 
we have sought peace relentlessly but our arab neighbors 
except egypt still have to prove in deeds that they are willing to 
negotiate peace with us the israeli leader said 
shultz tried to pierce husseins decadeslong resistance by 
proposing to hold the negotiations in an international setting 
this is designed to give the king the support he seeks 
but shultz obviously could not guarantee hussein that israel 
would withdraw from the west bank and gaza so theres a big 
question mark over husseins participation in the peace talks as 
well

a federal appeals court ruled today that 
prosecutors illegally obtained statements from a former fbi agent 
charged with lying about his role in handling teamster president 
jackie presser as an informant 
the us court of appeals upheld a lower courts decision that 
suppresses as evidence the statements that former fbi agent robert 
s friederick made to government prosecutors in early 1986 
the statements that friedrick made to federal prosecutors 
constituted the linchpin of the governments case against him the 
former cleveland fbi agent is charged with five counts of making 
false statements to federal agents 
the appeals court panel upheld a finding by us district judge 
george revercomb that federal prosecutors failed to inform 
friederick that unlike previous interviews in 1985 statements he 
made to them during the january 1986 session could be used as 
evidence against him 
friedericks lawyer william beyer said the decision eliminates 
the only evidence that prosecutors have against his client 
i dont know of any other evidence that they have to support 
their claim beyer said in a telephone inteview from cleveland 
friederick is charged with lying by telling fbi agents and 
prosecutors that he was aware that presser had been authorized by 
the cleveland fbi office to put ghost employees on the payroll of a 
local teamsters union 
the case stems from an fbi investigation of payroll padding in 
teamsters local 507 in cleveland that resulted in convictions of 
jack nardi and allen friedman in 1983 
presser has been indicted on charges that he authorized the 
payment of union funds to socalled phantom employees as a 
defense presser claims he was acting under the authority of 
cleveland fbi agents as an informant 
friederick who was head of the cleveland fbis organized crime 
squad was questioned in 1984 and again in 1985 about his handling 
of presser as an informant 
it was during a 1984 interview with friederick and other 
cleveland agents that the fbi learned that presser was an 
informant during a june 26 1985 interview at fbi headquarters in 
washington friederick signed an fbi form that said he was required 
to answer questions but that the government could not use his 
statements against him in a criminal prosecution 
friederick was questioned on two other occasions that summer in 
connection with the fbis internal investigation of the handling of 
presser as an informant 
the appellate court upheld revercombs finding that friederick 
was not warned during a jan 6 1986 interview that statements he 
made could be used against him 
the prosecutors made a conscious decision prior to the 
interview not to furnish friederick with or even mention the fbi 
form indeed they hoped that friederick would make incriminating 
statements that they could use against him in a subsequent 
prosecution the court said in an opinion by judge kenneth starr 
during the january interview friederick made statements 
contradicting his previous assertion that he was aware that presser 
had been authorized to put ghost employees on the locals payroll 
the next day he failed a lie detector test

wholesale prices dipped 02 percent in 
feburary as both energy and food costs declined including a 
dramatic 70 percent tumble in the price of lettuce the government 
reported friday 
the decline in the labor departments producer price index

it provided further evidence that inflation remains tame 
for the first two months of 1988 wholesale prices have been 
increasing at an annual rate of 11 percent just half of last 
years 22 percent rise

price index which was up 44 percent in 1987 
at the wholesale level food prices overall fell 11 percent

down but the 08 percent decline trailed januarys 45 percent 
drop 
gasoline prices fell 05 percent after an 84 percent plunge in 
january home heating oil costs were off 42 percent after a 62 
percent drop natural gas prices up 08 percent in january fell 
14 percent 
as for food vegetable prices which had increased 162 percent 
in january dropped 263 percent a decline largely driven by the 
drop in lettuce prices the price of lettuce had tripled between 
october and november because of shortages and crop infestation in 
california 
fruits down 30 percent in january fell an additional 35 
percent 
beef and veal prices were up 03 percent after a 34 percent 
rise in january pork costs up 132 percent in the previous month

alcoholic beverage costs were up 08 percent after rising 01 
percent in the preceding month 
subtracting the usually volatile energy and food categories 
wholesale prices for all other goods increased a relatively sedate 
03 percent 
the stability which we continue to see in the producer index 
is very good news said dirk van dorgen president of the 
national association of wholesalerdistributors we dont need to 
have to cope with a vexing inflation problem on top of all the 
other basic economic problems weve got to deal with 
the producer index had declined as recently as last december 
when it was down 04 percent the 02 percent february decline if 
continued for 12 consecutive months would yield an annual 
pricechange rate of minus 22 percent 
the teaming up of lower energy and food costs in february 
really was a break for the consumer said sandra shaber senior 
economist for the futures group a management consulting company 
but there have been some strong increases in some services 
medical care housing costs which are not in the ppi 
we cant anticipate a continuing decline in lettuce prices 
unfortunately she added 
fridays report again showed there was little justification for 
worries of a resurgence in inflation analysts agreed 
the news is clearly that we have very stable inflation 
rates said david wyss chief financial economist for data 
resources inc we think energy prices will come back a little bit 
in the next few months because they have dropped so far but the 
base inflation rate is going to remain very stable 
other wholesale price activity in february included 
prices for new automobiles fell 02 percent after a 02 percent 
gain in january 
capital equipment costs were up 02 percent for the third month 
in a row 
childrens clothing prices fell 22 percent mens clothing 
costs fell 01 percent mens apparel prices gained 05 percent 
tobacco prices gained 09 percent after a 12 percent drop in 
january 
februarys decline brought the overall wholesale price index to 
1059 this means that a selection of wholesale goods costing 100 
during a 1982 base period would have cost 10590 last month the 
index itself is not adjusted for seasonal variations as are other 
figures in the report 
the labor department recently switched from a 1967 base period 
for both its producer and consumer price index figures 
using the 1967 base the february index would have been 2973 
that compares to a 2923 index in february 1988 in other words 
goods costing 100 in 1967 would have cost 29230 in february 1987 
and 29730 in february 1988

the puritan ethic and epic magnetohydrodynamics and prohibition 
party has died at the age of 93 
riddick who died wednesday of cancer also was a world war i 
aviator and 1920s barnstormer before moving to montana to prospect 
for gold 
he ran for president in 1976 1980 and 1984 campaigning across 
the country on the greyhound buses where he also slept 
i live on the bus he said in 1981 i can get the bus 
passes for less than 12 a day its cheaper than living in a 
hotel 
he lost his presidential bids obviously but that was nothing 
new for riddick he had been running for office since 1960 and 
losing spectacularly just as long 
but politics was a relatively late interest for riddick also 
known as one of the nations earliest aviators 
he was a graduate of the army air corps first pilot class in 
san diego in 1917 and flew reconnaissance missions over europe in 
world war i he became one of the nations first airmail pilots and

field of six he tried again in 1968 with the same result 
he switched parties to run for the senate in 1972 he finished 
fourth among four republicans 
and with that long political background he launched his bids 
for the presidency 
his party was his own creation the puritan ethic and epic in 
the title stood for moral values magnetohydrodynamics is a 
hightech process for turning coal into electricity prohibition 
marked his personal belief 
perennial losing candidates are not unusual in american 
politics but riddicks quests earned him a place in the hearts of 
many in montana a state proud of its individualists 
a restaurant freqented by politicians in helena the state 
capital named a private dining room after riddick the airport in 
philipsburg his home was named for him and the 341st strategic

gary hart ended his onagain offagain bid for 
the 1988 democratic presidential nomination today saying the 
people have decided and now i should not go forward 
it was the second withdrawal for the man who once was the 
prohibitive frontrunner for his partys nomination coming 10 
months after he quit because of questions concerning his 
relationship with miami model donna rice 
flanked by members of his family hart told a news conference 
that when he rejoined the race last december he wanted to let 
the people decide 
i got a fair hearing and the people have decided and now i 
should not go forward he declared 
the former colorado senator departed with words of praise for 
the surviving democratic contenders but with thinly veiled 
criticism as well 
he said democrats have won only a single presidential election 
since 1964 and added those who cling to the past mask their 
lack of direction with caution and platitudes we can only be 
prepared to govern if we challenge the future with bold new ideas 
he said the contenders must offer detailed budget proposals and 
learn the details of military reform two points he made 
repeatedly in his rerun for the nomination 
hart second exit contained only a trace of the defiance that 
marked his departure in may but he struck one similar note 
to those of you in and out of politics who may face setbacks 
failures or defeats who are told to give up accommodate or 
compromise i hope you will simply say as i do hell no hart 
said 
hart also stepped back from the criticism of reporters that 
marked his second try for the nomination saying i want to thank 
members of the media who were fair and balanced 
harts announcement capped a story as bizarre as any in modern 
presidential politics 
he was the overwhelming favorite for the nomination when he 
announced his bid a year ago but his campaign selfdestructed in 
the springtime scandal 
he plunged back into the campaign last december and briefly 
soared in the polls but it quickly became clear the voters were 
deciding he wasnt their man relegating him to the back of the 
pack in the early primaries and caucuses 
hart failed to garner a single delegate to the 1988 democratic 
national convention and his vote percentage never reached double 
digits in any contest when the dust settled from this weeks 
20state super tuesday contests the federal election commission 
announced that hart was no longer eligible for federal campaign 
matching funds 
harts undoing in his initial bid came when the miami herald 
newspaper staked out his washington townhouse and reported that 
rice 29 a parttime model spent a night there 
there were questions about that because the paper admitted it 
did not have every entrance monitored all night but then photos of 
rice sitting on harts knee aboard a yacht called the monkey 
business on a trip to bimini surfaced 
hart however repeatedly refused to discuss specifics of his 
relationship with rice saying it was his personal business 
later he admitted i never should have been on a boat with a 
woman who was not my wife but thats not the issue its 
complicated its the system its all of us 
after seven months on the sidelines he announced in december in 
new hampshire in a dramatic stepsofthestatehouse news 
conference that he was back in the race and would let the 
people decide 
he could not he said withhold his views on public policy and 
issues during this presidential campaign he vowed to run a 
grassroots campaign with little money and an informal organization 
however he sustained another serious blow in january when there 
were reports that hollywood video producer stuart karl improperly 
bankrolled his campaigns 
when we needed fliers printed or a chartered plane stuart 
managed to get it done one source told the associated press 
dennis walto was a fulltime advance man for hart and he was on 
karls payroll stuart picked up a variety of other things 
hart said he was unaware of any wrongdoing but i will hold 
myself responsible for whatever happened and not shift any blame to 
anyone else obviously a candidate cannot know every detail 
he later acknowledged that several contributions from employees 
of karl were illegal and he was returning the money

the united states told secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar today it will move next week to close the 
plos observer mission at the united nations 
perez de cuellar replied with a strong protest to us 
ambassador herbert okun according to un spokesman francois 
giulaini 
okuns letter to the un chief says the justice department will 
initiate legal action to close the palestine liberation 
organization mission around march 21 
it also says the united states will not try to close the mission 
until the litigation is resolved 
giuliani said perez de cuellars legal staff is studying 
options but he refused to describe them or say if the united 
nations would join the litigation on behalf of the plo 
the united nations released copies of okuns letter to the 
secretarygeneral during a press briefing after the two diplomats 
met this morning 
giuliani said perez de cuellar strongly protested this 
violation of the headquarters agreement during the meeting 
the letter also says that the united states refuses binding 
arbitration of the dispute over the mission the worst 
confrontation ever between the united nations and its host country 
the 159nation general assembly in a special meeting last 
month asked the world court in the hague to rule on whether the 
united states must agree to arbitration oral arguments are 
scheduled for april 11 
un officials and diplomats regard the threat to the plo 
mission as a challenge to the independence of the united nations 
they and the state department have said the 1947 treaty under 
which new york became un headquarters obliges the united states 
to let all accredited missions operate 
even the united states closest allies have denounced the 
attempt to close the mission and several arab diplomats have 
suggested that the general assembly move to geneva if the mission 
here is closed 
it was not clear if the assembly would convene again to consider 
the dispute 
last year the state department closed down the only other plo 
office in the united states an information office in washington 
in what turned out to be a futile attempt to head off legislation 
ordering the un mission closed 
despite this and despite the headquarters treaty congress 
passed an antiterrorism law in december ordering the mission 
closed by march 21 
the united states and israel consider the plo a terrorist 
organization but the united nations recognizes it as the only 
legitimate spokesman for palestinians

two people who claim they have 
information that could clear a condemned murderer said today they 
were disappointed the governor refused to meet with them to discuss 
the case which has become a rallying point for death penalty 
opponents 
the rev sam sparks a baptist minister and christine bass a 
lakeland secretary appeared at a news conference with amnesty 
international officials to discuss about information they believe 
might clear willie jasper darden of murder 
darden is under his seventh death warrant and is scheduled for 
electrocution tuesday for the 1973 slaying of a furniture store 
owner 
no other florida inmate has survived as many death warrants and 
only one other prisoner has been on floridas death row longer 
i know willie darden is innocent it is not a belief it is a 
knowledge said ms bass who said her attempts to give vital 
information to dardens trial attorney 14 years ago were rebuffed 
gov bob martinez refused to meet with the two and an aide said 
the governor is satisfied that the evidence sparks and ms bass 
were talking about had been considered and rejected by the courts 
this is not about public sentiment its about the law and 
carrying out the law press secretary jon peck said in explaining 
why martinez decided against the meeting 
i think a lot of people in florida are wondering why he wont 
sit down for even 15 minutes with ms bass and me that seems 
reasonable sparks said at the news conference 
sparks and ms bass who have signed affidavits that raise 
questions about whether darden could have committed the crime have 
appeared on television news programs to repeat those statements 
supporters say darden who is black was the victim of racial 
prejudice in his trial 
he was convicted of killing lakeland store owner james turman 
during a robbery that netted 15 a store employee also was shot 
and permanently disabled while turmans wife had to fend off a 
sexual attack as her husband lay dying 
sparks said turmans wife had told him that all blacks looked 
alike to her and that her identification of darden was unimportant 
because the lawyers had told her that darden committed the crime 
helen baum formerly helen turman recently denied having made 
that statement to sparks and reaffirmed her identification of 
darden as the man who shot her husband 
ms bass a lakeland secretary said dardens car had broke down 
near her home and he waited for a tow truck from 4 pm to 535 
pm on sept 8 1973 her house was eight miles from the furniture 
store prosecutors say the crime occurred about 6 pm 
as ms bass and sparks made their claims a sixth warrant 
against darden was stayed and the us supreme court agreed to 
consider his appeal for the fourth time 
on monday the us supreme court ruled 63 that darden had 
received a fair trial and had been properly sentenced 
the governor siged a seventh death warrant tuesday which gave 
the inmates attorneys less than a week to prepare his case 
usually at least 30 days are allowed 
amnesty international officials said martinez was rushing to 
execute darden for political reasons 
i think what the governor is looking for some kind of 
ritualistic sacrifice that he can go through to prove hes tough on 
crime said magdaleno roseavila national director of amnesty 
internationals campaign to abolish the death penalty 
she said the governors popularity waned after the controversy 
last year over a state sales tax on services the governor 
originally backed the tax but later repudiated it 
peck the governors spokesman said politics had no bearing on 
the new death warrant 
peck said martinez had instituted a new policy recently to 
schedule executions on subsequent warrants within 20 days rather 
than 30 days which he said would have put the execution near the 
good friday and easter holidays 
it seemed like kind of an inappropriate time peck said 
darden attorney mark olive said he wasnt sure when he would 
file an execution appeal 
when martinez signed the sixth death warrant in dardens case 
earlier this year soviet dissident andrei sakharov american 
actress margot kidder and british rock star peter gabriel urged 
clemency for darden 
darden 54 has been on death row since jan 29 1974 a 
prolific writer he is nicknamed the poet of death row

italys big league stylists said friday that 
five days of presentations of deluxe readytowear clothes for next 
fall and winter went better than expected 
strong trends such as the new smaller silhouette and a revival 
of pants caught the interest of the fashion traders in milan 
revitalized classics coupled with the high quality italian fabrics 
and workmanship contributed to the success 
fear of the low buying power of the dollar had caused the 
italians to step carefully the result was a simplified silhouette 
with plenty of commercially valid wearable clothes 
rigid cost control and the use of less opulent materials by some 
fashion companies kept price tags within reasonable limits fashion 
houses reported price increases of never more than 10 percent above 
last years prices 
jitters regarding competition from avantgarde foreign designers 
the french in particular also showed signs of subsiding as 
orders rolled in 
the general good health of italian fashion houses is 
demonstrated by their continuous expansion into profitable market 
sectors outside their readytowear lines perfumes furs 
eyeglasses footwear pens and watches are just some of the 
sidelines that stylists sign to promote their name and make money 
perhaps the most successful part of the milan shows was the 
renewed interest in pants 
pants are what its all about said kal ruttenstein senior 
vice presidentfashion director at bloomingdales 
sal ruggiero fashion director at marshall field and company of 
chicago called them a great option until skirt lengths settle 
down 
armani mario valentino and krizia showed them in easyfitting 
versions ferre versace and genny preferred a tighter look 
pants frequently were cut high to emphasize the waist 
the new tiny jacket cropped at the waist and with tightfitting 
sleeves is a keynote of the wellbred trend equally important is 
the tailored city coat modeled on riding jacket lines flaring out 
from a fitted top 
armani showed a winner in glen plaid and then repeated it in 
velvet for a formal evening chalkstripe gray flannel was the 
fabric choice used by other designers for this shape 
on the same refined wavelength are the dickensianstyle frock 
coats shown by romeo gigli one of italys youngest designers in 
the top slot he continues to use his favorite knit fabrics for 
styles that fit as tight as a second skin a habit copied by many 
of his colleagues 
lots of boots clinging tight as stockings came in flat or 
highheeled versions and heralded a return of the footwear after 
several seasons 
fake furs enjoyed another revival fendi byblos and armani for 
emporio produced some of the most beautiful 
many of the biggest names in italian fashion will participate in

defeating the united states in the vietnam war has died of a heart 
attack he was 75 
the domestic vietnamese radio quoting official communiques 
said hung died early thursday afternoon while working in ho chi 
minh city formerly saigon and other southern provinces 
it said the council of ministers named a vice premier vo van 
kiet as acting premier until the national assembly chooses a 
permanent successor 
kiet in his late 70s is chairman of the state planning 
commission and is regarded by western analysts as the leading 
proponent of westernstyle reforms aimed at resolving the countrys 
economic crisis

revolutionaries who took up radical politics in their teens joined 
the communist party in the 1930s and over the next halfcentury 
guided it to victory over the french japanese and americans 
some western diplomats say that in recent years hung had been 
in bad health and did not have a central role in important policy 
decisions 
his death was the latest in a series of recent major upheavals 
in the vietnamese leadership 
party chief le duan died in mid1986 his successor truong 
chinh and two other top party officials resigned in december 1986 
when the sixth national party congress elevated more pragmatic

cuu long province in the mekong river delta of southern vietnam

women who enter a public restroom have a 
legal right to expect the same privacy they have in their homes or 
offices the state superior court ruled 
the court rejected claims by a man convicted on felony trespass 
charges after he entered the ladies room of the society hill club 
his attorney contended that anthony white should have been found 
guilty only of defiant trespass a misdemeanor because the 
club was open to public access and therefore so were all 
restrooms 
we deem the ladies room to be a separately secured or 
occupied portion of the structure housing the society hill club 
the said wednesday in upholding the felony trespass finding of a 
lower court 
the trial court stated that the criminal trespass statute 
gives legal protection to the expectation of privacy that the 
occupants of the smaller units within a structure or building 
would realistically assume the court concluded that the 
legislature intended to afford occupants of a restroom the same 
protection afforded occupants of an office 
in other words all women in the restroom may exclude all men 
even those legitimately in the club the court added 
an aerobics instructor was alone in the restroom when white 
entered it according to the court white rifled through the 
contents of the womans gym bag made indecent propositions to her 
and used obscene language and gestures the court said 
white was sentenced to 1 to three years in prison after being 
convicted of felony trespass and attempted robbery in philadelphia 
common pleas court in 1987

caused most likely by a virus not drug or alcohol abuse doctors 
said today

30 died naturally of a heart condition 
the statements came after bee gees singer robin gibb angrily 
denied reports that his brothers death was related to drug abuse 
constable michael harvey of the oxford coroners office said 
that since the cause of death was natural an inquest would not be 
conducted 
mr gibb died from inflammation of the heart of the sort 
commonly caused by a virus there is no evidence that his death was 
related to drink or drugs said a statement from the john 
radcliffe hospital in oxford where the singer died thursday 
gibb had followed his brothers who formed the bee gees rock 
group to stardom in the late 1970s 
there was no question of andy using drugs i dont know where 
that story came from but there is absolutely no truth in it he 
was not using cocaine again robin gibb told reporters at 
heathrow airport british tabloids had said drug abuse may have 
caused the death 
it was so unexpected he said andy had been ill with 
stomach pains for about four days 
robin gibb 39 was at the airport to meet his 72yearold 
father hughie who was arriving from los angeles 
press association the domestic british news agency said gibb

readmitted wednesday night after complaining of stomach pains 
a hospital spokesman said the twotime grammy award nominee died 
at 845 am thursday in the hospital 50 miles northwest of london

and dropped his career after the breakup of his highly publicized 
relationship with television star victoria principal 
three years later he entered the betty ford rehabilitation 
center in rancho mirage calif for treatment of a cocaine habit 
a spokesman for island records ltd who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said gibb signed a contract two months ago and would 
have started working on a new album this spring 
gibb who at times sang in a falsetto voice had a string of 
hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s his charttoppers included 
i just want to be your everything love is thicker than 
water shadow dancing everlasting love and our love 
dont throw it all away 
despite his successful solo career gibb never fully emerged 
from the shadow of his older superstar brothers maurice robin and 
barry who formed the bee gees last year gibb went into 
bankruptcy proceedings in miami where he had been living 
but his miami lawyer john kozyak said gibbs bankruptcy was 
discharged in january his debts were settled and he was back on 
his feet and in good spirits and trying to put together a record 
contract 
gibb was divorced from his wife kim in 1978 the couple had 
one child a daughter peta 12 
in addition to his singing career gibb had a stint as a cohost 
on tvs solid gold the syndicated musical variety show but he 
was fired in 1982 for missing too many tapings

president oscar arias winner of the 
1987 nobel peace prize for his central american peace plan said 
the united states and soviet union should give the region a chance 
to work out its problems on its own 
in an interview with the associated press arias said he also 
has urged president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
to include central america as a topic in their next summit 
stressing that the purpose of his peace plan was to build 
bridges arias said he had received indications from both united 
states and soviet union that the superpowers will discuss the issue 
i went to the us congress to ask congressmen to give us 
central americans an opportunity to work out our problems arias 
said in the interview conducted thursday but i cannot do the 
same thing in the soviet union because of the nature of its regime 
radically different from the pluralistic democracy system of the 
west 
arias said he was pleased that nicaraguas contra rebels had 
agreed to meet with nicaraguan government representatives inside 
that country and without a mediator for ceasefire talks previous 
peace talks have been held outside the country and were mediated by 
nicaraguas roman catholic bishop 
arias described a nicaraguan ceasefire as the key that 
would then open other possibilities for peace 
but he expressed regrets that the soviet union continued to 
provide aid to leftist guerrilla movements in central america 
i cannot use the soviet unions media and ask its government 
to give us the same chance i requested from the us congress i 
see where the soviet union continues to help guerrilla movements in 
central america and in the last few months as never before is 
helping the sandinista governemnt militarily he added 
the war in nicaragua is one of the central american conflicts 
that arias hopes will be resolved as a result of his peace plan 
which also seeks to end guerrilla wars in el salvador and honduras 
bring democracy to the entire region and end foreign aid to 
insurgents 
the presidents of nicaragua el salvador honduras and 
guatemala joined arias in signing the plan last august 
arias said that if the united states and soviet union include 
central americas armed conflicts in their summit agenda it 
would be very important for us to show between now and then that 
some progress has been made toward reaching a regional political 
solution 
we have an opportunity as never before to find peace in 
central america arias said if we do not those who come after 
us will feel less of a commitment to search for it 
arias said a problem with making the peace plan work has been a 
lack of consistency between what is being said and done 
there can be no peace without democracy in our region they 
must go hand in hand he said

a group formed by the church of scientology has 
filed five medical malpractice lawsuits in massachusetts against 
physicians who prescribed the drug ritalin to children to control 
supposed hyperactivity 
the citizens commission for human rights claims ritalin is 
dangerous and overprescribed 
the maker of the drug not named in any of the suits denied all 
the groups claims friday 
dennis clarke president of the commission that was formed in 
1969 read aloud from medical and psychiatric journals to back up 
the groups claims when the group announced the suits thursday with 
attorneys and two mothers who are plaintiffs the suits do not 
request specific damages 
too often clarke said teachers and school officials complain 
that a child is too active and suggest to parents that the child be 
taken to a pediatrician who recommends ritalin without careful 
examination 
clarke said ritalin use requires increased dosage over time 
withdrawal results in depression and can sometimes result in 
suicidal behavior he claimed he also cited medical journals in 
his claim that ritalin has been shown to cause psychotic episodes 
in children 
such claims were all denied friday by cibageigy corp 
spokeswoman gloria martini in summit nj who said she has never 
seen in medical journals any of the claims clarke cited 
ritalin has been out there for over 30 years and it has a long 
history of experience for physicians who use it mrs martini 
said there is no evidence that it is addictive when used as 
directed 
she said it has a potential for abuse however 
cibageigy introduced ritalin to the us market in 1955 in 
1987 it was used by an estimated 600000 to 700000 patients mrs 
martini said 
clarke said he spoke briefly to attorneys representing rod 
matthews the 15yearold canton boy convicted of seconddegree 
murder in the bludgeoning a classmate with a baseball bat 
matthews attorneys claimed the teenager had been taking ritalin 
and that it may have triggered the violent episode 
susan marshall of hingham mother of a child placed on ritalin 
and a plaintiff in one of the suits said ritalin was prescribed 
for her normal happy welladjusted son when he began to have 
slight handwriting problems in the first grade 
i was not given any diagnosis i was never told about any side 
effects said mrs marshall 
her son took the drug for six months and became angry hostile 
moody and stopped eating most meals she said a neurologist later 
discovered his problem stemmed from slight brain damage 
rita lassiter of new bedford said her son matthew was first 
described as too active by his kindergarten teachers and was 
given ritalin after a 10minute examination by a pediatrician 
bernard portnoy who prescribed the drug for matthew lassiter 
said he was unaware of the lawsuit against him 
of ritalin he said i think it can be of help when its used 
properly it can be helpful in many cases 
mrs lassiter said matthews condition worsened after taking the 
drug but said she did not make the connection until a few years 
later when matthew was taken off the drug he became so 
disoriented and troubled that he had to be hospitalized now 11 he 
is unable to attend school his vision is blurred and his growth is 
stunted mrs lassiter said

a former top aide to gov evan mecham 
testified today that he believed the governor was loyal to a state 
official accused of making a death threat because the man had been 
an effective campaign fundraiser 
former special assistant sam steiger who faces a criminal 
extortion charge unrelated to mechams case testified at the 
governors impeachment trial that mecham has a dangerous tendency 
of extreme loyalty to people who have helped him 
mecham felt such loyalty toward lee watkins who is accused of 
making a death threat against former mecham aide donna carlson 
steiger said ms carlson was about to testify before a grand jury 
investigating the governors campaign finances 
mecham is accused of trying to thwart an investigation of the 
alleged threat 
during thursdays testimony mechams defense lawyer angered 
senators by accusing the senate majority leader of showing 
overwhelming bias against the governor during his impeachment 
trial 
jerris leonard lashed out at majority leader bob usdane when the 
republican lawmaker questioned whether the impeached governors new 
lawyers erred when they said weeks ago they were ready to defend 
mecham 
usdane ought to show a little more impartiality said 
leonard his bias and prejudice are overwhelming and under 
normal trial circumstances he should be disqualified the attorney 
said 
for months usdane has been accused by some lawmakers of being 
too accommodating toward mechams gop administration 
leonards attack came during testimony on an accusation that 
mecham tried to block an investigation of an alleged death threat 
by a state official testimony on that charge was expected to 
continue today 
usdane called the lawyers blast illconceived 
i dont think im biased the majority leader added i 
swore an oath to go make a decision based on the evidence and 
thats what ill go on 
minority leader alan stephens also took issue with leonards 
statement 
maybe they figured theyve lost their case and are going to 
go one by one trying to create controversy stephens said if 
thats so were all in for a very unpleasant time 
the controversy arose when usdane challenged leonards 
contention that he should be allowed to question a witness on 
matters not specified earlier because there had not been enough 
time to prepare for trial 
the senator asked whether that countered an affidavit by 
mechams new lawyers certifiying they were ready shortly before the 
trial began feb 29 
leonard joined mechams defense team a week before the trial 
opened and the governors original defense lawyer resigned three 
days later 
mecham 63 is also accused of concealing a 350000 campaign 
loan and misusing 80000 from a state protocol fund by loaning it 
to his auto dealership he faces an april 21 criminal trial on 
charges of hiding the 350000 loan and a may 17 recall election 
the governor is accused of ordering department of public safety 
director ralph milstead not to cooperate with a probe of the 
alleged threat last november against ms carlson a former mecham 
aide about to testify before a grand jury about the 350000 loan 
peggy griffith head of the governors office of womens 
services testified last week that watkins then the state prison 
construction chief threatened ms carlsons life during the second 
of two conversations nov 12 
the defense sought thursday to discredit mrs griffith with 
testimony from her secretary terri fields who said her boss 
tends to exaggerate things a little and was not thorough in her 
work 
when asked for an example of an exaggeration by mrs griffith 
ms fields said she could not think of one ms fields testified 
she did not believe the second conversation between mrs griffith 
and watkins ever happened 
maybe she did have the conversation with lee watkins but i 
dont believe that a threat came out of it ms fields said 
ray russell the only one of mechams original special 
assistants still on his staff a year after the governor took 
office testified that administration officials felt that every 
time you turned around it looked like somebody was investigating us 
for breaking the law 
i know whats in his mechams heart russell said i 
find him to be an honest sincere man 
mecham is the first us governor to be impeached in six decades 
and the first ever in arizona a twothirds vote of the 30member 
senate is required for a conviction that could bar him from ever 
holding public office again

favorite son jesse jackson looking for a 
warm homecoming in south carolina in saturdays democratic 
caucuses said today its get out the vote time in the state 
that gave him one of his few 1984 wins 
jackson told about 250 supporters at the university of south 
carolina that the new challenge for the south is to find common 
ground where the people can come together 
most political experts and campaign officials in the state 
agreed that jackson was the clear frontrunner in the caucuses 
theres more suspense over how close tennessee sen albert gore 
jr can come to jackson and the division of delegates 44 of which 
are at stake saturday 
south carolinas democratic leaders decided against following 
the crowd on super tuesday when all of the other southern states 
held primaries 
the candidates are relying on grassroots organizing telephone 
banks and direct mail to lure democrats to the caucus gore is also 
buying television advertisements 
gore who was campaigning in greenville columbia and charleston 
today has the largest organization in the state and the most 
endorsements from elected officials who wield strong influence at 
the caucuses 
missouri rep richard gephardt who traveled across the state 
wednesday and thursday has a skeletal organization but his few 
endorsements from elected officials are the biggest former govs 
dick riley and robert mcnair and all of the south carolina 
democratic congressmen who have chosen sides 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis has an even smaller local 
organization and virtually no endorsements from elected officials 
but dukakis strong super tuesday showing will help earn him a 
chunk of votes saturday barry weiner dukakis national campaign 
cochairman said thursday in columbia 
all of the competing state campaigns except gores have conceded 
that jackson will win the lions share of the 44 delegates at stake 
i dont think there is any doubt that jesse jackson will 
win said bill prince gephardts state coordinator 
house speaker robert sheheen gores state chairman said 
theres really no way of knowing whether the tennessee senator 
can upset jackson were not conceding anything to anybody 
gore is promoting his strong ties to the south and a strong 
defense which plays well in the palmetto state 
gephardt is hoping to use his trade policy to gain votes in the 
state which has seen its largest industry textiles severely 
weakened by cheap foreign imports his first stop wednesday was a 
textile plant in aiken county that is scheduled to close next month 
and put 420 people out of work 
between a quarter and a half of south carolina democrats 
traditionally remain uncommitted at the caucus meetings to give 
themselves more maneuvering room through the nominating process 
they usually choose a candidate at the county or state convention 
that leaves relatively few delegates for the candidates to 
divide up saturday but in a tight national race in which no 
candidate has been able to take a decisive lead every one helps 
this certainly increases the importance of south carolina 
because the delegate count is so close said kevin gray state 
coordinator for jackson

thailands envoy urged the united states on 
friday not to cut quotas for indochinese refugees to make room for 
armenians fleeing the soviet union 
if more armenians are permitted into the united states the 
quotas for eastern europe should be raised and the quotas for 
indochina should be left alone ambassador arsa sarasin told a news 
conference 
the us budget currently permits the annual entry of 68500 
refugees from around the world including 23000 from indochina 
thailand where 400000 indochinese refugees reside mostly in 
camps is pressing continuously for higher quotas 
the united states must not cut the quota and give it to 
eastern europe sarasin said 
the reagan administration is in the process of deciding what to 
do about a massive increase in applications for entry from 
residents of soviet armenia 
according to state department records armenians are applying 
for asylum at a rate of 1500 a month compared with 200 applicants 
in all of 1985 and 200 to 300 a month as recently as 1987 up to 
12000 armenians are reportedly waiting to come to the united 
states 
a current wave of ethnic protests in armenia has highlighted 
some of the dissatisfaction there toward soviet government policies 
in the region 
sarasin said he felt better about the situation after jonathan 
moore director of the state departments division of refugee 
affairs told a congressional hearing feb 24 that no decision to 
alter quotas had been made 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
however that changes were possible under some of the options being 
considered by an interagency group 
the group may decide to reallocate quotas grant emergency 
quotas for the armenians or slow down processing of refugees to 
pay for the influx from armenia 
relations between the united states and thailand have been in a 
somewhat sour state lately mostly because of the refugee problem 
after years of providing asylum to people fleeing cambodia vietnam 
and laos resistance is growing in thailand to the continuing 
influx 
leaders there have accused the united states australia canada 
and other resettlement countries of failing to live up to 
commitments to find new homes for the refugees 
thailand cannot bear the burden indefinitely sarasin said 
there is a limit to our capacity 
moore and other us officials have been sympathetic to 
thailands concerns and have sought higher refugee quotas at the 
same time they have criticized inhumane treatment of refugees in 
thailand 
such treatment has included the closing of some camps the 
pushing of boats laden with refugees out to sea and the forced 
repatriation of lao tribesmen seeking a haven in thailand

the captain of a continental airlines 
flight that crashed last november killing 28 people and injuring 
54 generally performed well when he was tested on a dc9 a flight 
trainer testified today at a federal hearing 
however the copilot first officer lee bruecher 26 was at 
the controls of continental flight 1713 when it crashed at denvers 
stapleton international airport on nov 15 both the pilot and 
copilot were killed 
on thursday a different flight trainer testified that bruecher 
had trouble with takeoffs and landings during his simulator 
training on the dc9 
in testimony today before national transportation safety board 
officials investigating the accident continental capt james 
edward madsen said capt frank zvonek did a good job on a test ride 
from denver to albuquerque nm but he did not give himself as 
long a final approach as madsen would have liked and did not allow 
enough visual clearance behind a small aircraft 
i would have given myself another mile or two of spacing 
said madsen but added it was not a down or unsatisfactory 
flight at all 
continental pilot trainer je summervilles testimony thursday 
about bruechers performance highlighted the third day of the 
fourday ntsb hearing the board is trying to identify factors that 
caused the dc9 to crash moments after takeoff 
bruecher was a good student but had problems with takeoffs and 
landings and summerville once had to freeze the training 
simulator to avoid a crash during a practice landing he said 
thursday 
bruecher had trouble controlling altitude and airspeed within 
reasonable limits summerville wrote and repeated one course of 
the sevenpart flight simulator training 
however at the conclusion of the training summerville said he 
recommended bruecher for the federal aviation administration 
proficiency test needed to fly a specific kind of airplane 
bruecher finished a proficiency check on sept 14 1987 with 
another instructor who graded his performance average and began 
his initial operating experience as a line pilot with continental 
on oct 2 at the time of the crash he had only 36 hours piloting 
dc9s ntsb investigators have said 
zvonek had 198 hours on a dc9 with only the previous 33 hours 
as captain 
ntsb officials on thursday also questioned capt dave dickerson 
manager of continentals dc9 program at houston about training 
procedures dickerson said he saw no correlation between bruechers 
level of experience and the problems he experienced 
deicing was another subject of testimony 
summerville said he instructs pilots during training to 
reevaluate the condition of their aircraft if 20 minutes or more 
elapse between the time the plane is deiced and takeoff 
i tell them to look at the parts you can see from the cockpit 
including the nose the windshield wipers unheated windows and any 
aircraft around you 
depending on the weather conditions summerville said he 
sometimes would advise pilots to go into the cabin and look out at 
the wings but we all know thats not the best way to look to see 
if youve got ice on the wings a mechanics inspection at the 
gate would be better he said 
earlier testimony showed that a mixup by air traffic officials 
delayed flight 1713s takeoff by minutes but no conclusions were 
drawn on whether that had any role in the crash 
also under investigation is the possibility that a wing vortex 
or swirling wind triggered by another planes wing moving through 
the air could have contributed to the crash

as a result 
the truck driver had threatened to shoot anyone who approached 
police said officers from three agencies surrounded the section of

democrat gary hart dropped out of the 
presidential campaign today saying i got a fair hearing and the 
people have decided as republicans bob dole and pat robertson 
vowed to stay in the race 
hart left the campaign last may after disclosure of his 
relationship with model donna rice but then rejoined it in 
december declaring let the people decide 
today in denver as he withdrew again he said the people had 
had their say clearly i should not go forward 
hart failed to win any delegates in the primaries and caucuses 
polled no more than 5 percent of the vote in any of the super 
tuesday primaries and lost his eligibility for further federal 
matching funds 
my friends and supporters have given the word loyalty new 
meaning he said theyve toiled tirelessly in an uphill 
fight 
dole said today in remarks to illinois farm bureau leaders i 
want to make certain you understand i am in this race press 
reports had noted he had taken his television ads off the air in 
illinois and had drastically cut his campaign staff after being 
beaten by vice president george bush in 16 super tuesday contests 
noting those reports he said today its hard to focus on the 
issues sometimes because the press wont let us do that they would 
rather write about how many staff you reduced your numbers by i 
never thought that a campaign was a jobs program 
in peoria robertson said im in it until new orleans site 
of the republican national convention it looks overwhelming for 
one of the republican candidates but goliath was pretty 
overwhelming as well were going to win 
five days before the illinois primary democratic candidates 
participated in a televised forum thursday night but in contrast 
to many of their joint appearances not a cross word was exchanged 
it was all sweetness and light said illinois sen paul 
simon after the forum sponsored by wlstv and the roosevelt center 
for american policy studies 
simon greeted people eating breakfast today at the golden nugget 
pancake house on the north side of chicago and predicted the 
democratic convention would need at least two ballots to choose its 
presidential nominee 
i think i have as good a chance as anyone he said 
then simon stopped by the polish national alliance where he 
received the endorsement of the polish daily zgoda a polish 
language newspaper 
a washington postabc news poll published today but conducted 
wednesday the day after the super tuesday primaries and six days 
before illinois votes said vice president george bush had the 
support of 58 percent of republicans 
on the democratic side simon was backed by 38 percent of the 
likely voters surveyed and chicagobased jesse jackson had support 
of 33 percent the figures for simon and jackson were well within 
the 8 percentage point margin of error 
in alaska democratic officials said today that jackson finished 
first in the states precinct caucuses posting a narrow victory 
over massachusetts gov michael dukakis in a nonbinding preference 
poll 349 percent to 31 percent 
uncommitted caucus delegates ran a close third with the other 
candidates far behind 
rep jack kemp of new york ended his presidential bid on 
thursday and said the idea of being the republican candidate for 
vice president was a very flattering and awesome thought 
kemp declined to endorse any of the surviving candidates bush 
dole and pat robertson describing them all as reagan 
conservatives 
dole scotched rumors that he was about to join kemp on the 
campaign sidelines 
bob doles no dropout he said in a statement issued in 
washington and illinois im in this one to win 
bush beat dole in all 16 super tuesday primaries and now has 705 
national convention delegates compared to 165 for the kansas 
senator 
dole did not say whether he would remain in the race if he loses 
to bush in illinois but an aide said i think its clear to dole 
that its do or die 
dole canceled all television commercials in illinois and ordered 
deep layoffs in his staff an aide said the campaign was 
considering airing a 30minute paid broadcast in the closing hours 
of the campaign 
one bright spot for the kansas senator was the endorsement of 
the chicago tribune which said that bushs identification with 
president reagan while a big help in republican primary contests 
might be a handicap in the general election 
nowhere have the republican candidates asked or answered the 
kind of harsh questions the democrats surely will raise in november 
about the reagan administration whose colors mr bush has been 
able to wave more furiously than anyone else the newspaper said 
in an editorial headlined why illinois should pick dole 
robertson who also had a disappointing day on super tuesday 
also ordered deep staff cuts 
we want to stay lean and mean he said declining to give 
the number of employees laid off 
the vice president also was campaigning in the state in advance 
of tuesdays primary illinois voters will elect delegates and also 
express their preferences in a beauty contest on the ballot 
bush told a governors club luncheon in chicago that he was 
tired of being embarrassed by scandals involving government 
officials and he called for establishment of a white house ethics 
panel 
bush has refused however to criticize any administration 
officials including attorney general edwin meese iii who have 
come under investigation by grand juries

a snowstorm caused south dakota democrats to 
postpone a statewide caucus called for saturday when the party was 
to decide how to apportion 15 of the states national convention 
delegates 
its a quality snowstorm said rick hauffe acting director 
of the south dakota democratic party it really dumped 
the friday storm was expected to leave from 4 to 18 inches of 
snow across the state 
hauffe said the caucus has been rescheduled for march 19 
missouri rep richard gephardt won the states democratic 
primary on feb 23 but national party rules would not permit the 
election to have any directly binding effect on the national 
convention delegates 
the dispute with the national party centered on the timing of 
the primary which came two weeks earlier than allowed by national 
party rules 
the statewide caucus meeting within the time allowed by the 
national rules was to decide whether to allocate the delegates 
among the presidential candidates in proportion to the primary 
results under the rules the caucus is free to use the primary 
results or reject them entirely basing the allocation instead on 
the presidential preferences of the people attending the caucus 
if the caucus decides to use the primary results only gephardt 
and massachusetts gov michael dukakis would qualify for any 
delegates 
based on the primary results gephardt would receive nine pedged 
delegates to the democratic national convention and dukakis would 
get six party officials have said

authorities broadcast warnings friday to tibetan 
rebels to turn themselves in by march 20 or face punishment 
according to a western source in the tibetan capital of lhasa 
the source a tibetanspeaking traveler said vans with 
loudspeakers were driving through the city every hour repeating the 
same message 
police with machine guns meanwhile remained posted in front of 
the citys holiest temple the sprawling whitewashed jokhang 
temple and on the roofs of nearby buildings western tourists 
said it was at the jokhang that last weekends riots began 
theyre warning people to do their duty report troublemakers 
theyll be rewarded if they give information the 
tibetanspeaking traveler said in a telephone interview from 
beijing 
she said one announcement called for people to surrender 
people who were involved in the disturbances before the 20th 
otherwise they would be punished 
thousands of tibetans demanding independence from china stoned 
police and set bonfires throughout lhasa last saturday in a day of 
violence triggered when one buddhist monk stood up at a prayer 
festival and began shouting antichinese slogans 
official reports said one chinese police officer and one tibetan 
were killed however an american traveler in lhasa who saw some of 
the violence said tibetans estimate 21 tibetans and three police 
were killed 
the official xinhua news agency said a heros funeral was held 
friday in lhasa for the dead policeman 21yearold yuan shisheng 
who was stabbed and thrown out of a secondstory window it said 
more than 2500 mourners attended 
the hong kong branch of the china news service also an official 
mainland agency reported that a local tibetan civil and religious 
official and two 18yearold tibetans were arrested wednesday the 
brief report said they were accused of taking part in violent 
antichinese protests in october 
at least 14 people were killed in the largest of those protests 
when thousands of tibetans stoned and burned a police station on 
oct 1 
the china news service report did not say why the three were 
arrested only now it was the first official report of any arrests 
since the march 5 uprising 
unofficial reports of widescale arrests continued to filter out 
of lhasa estimates ranged up to 1000 but none of the figures 
could be confirmed authorities have refused to allow foreign 
reporters to visit lhasa this week and have halted sales of plane 
tickets to lhasa to all foreigners 
the approximately one dozen foreign travelers in lhasa have been 
virtually the only source of information on events in the remote 
milehigh city surrounded by mountains 
an ethnic tibetan from nepal who left lhasa on friday said 
police came to his uncles house several times in recent days 
making housetohouse checks for suspects 
the western woman reported 10 arrests among the families of her 
tibetan acquaintances she said the tibetans reported police 
dragged suspects from their homes in the middle of the night 
beating them 
she said she had stopped visiting tibetan friends for fear of 
drawing police attention to them 
she said it was almost impossible to telephone outside of 
lhasa and interrupted the interview several times to say people 
here running the hotel are getting very nervous about her 
conversation 
trucks carrying armed police also drove through the city friday 
but in smaller convoys than earlier in the week the foreigners 
reported 
on wednesday and thursday one american said he counted more 
than 100 trucks each carrying 20 to 30 police driving in a parade 
through the city in a show of force 
even under normal circumstances tibet is a heavily militarized 
region because of its long border with india with which china has 
clashed several times large police and military installations rim 
the capital city of about 150000 people and some western experts 
estimate there is one chinese soldier for every 10 tibetans 
china claims tibet has been part of its empire since the 13th 
century however the remote region was effectively ruled for much 
of that time by the buddhist monasteries and the dalai lama whom 
tibetans regard as a reincarnation of their protector god 
the current dalai lama regarded as the 14th in a line of 
reincarnations fled to india in 1959 nine years after chinese 
communist troops entered tibet his flight was triggered by a 
massive antichinese uprising in which thousands of tibetans were 
killed

strong winds and unseasonably warm 
temperatures whittled a 70yearold mushers lead in the 1150mile 
iditarod trail sled dog race to a matter of minutes according to 
standings this morning 
at last report joe redington known as the father of the 
iditarod because he helped organize the first race 16 years ago 
still was on the trail between cripple and sulatna crossing today 
the seventh day of the race 
its only 47 miles between the two checkpoints and the length 
of time it was taking redington to cover the distance was a 
reflection of the weather normally iditarod teams average 810 
mph 
all 50 dog teams in the race from anchorage to nome were slowed 
thursday by temperatures that climbed into the 40s turning the 
trail soggy and overheating the coldloving huskies who pull the 
sleds 
redington waited 11 hours after reaching cripple for more 
favorable weather and by the time he decided to move secondplace 
herbie nayokpuk decided his team was rested enough to push on 
nayokpuk known as the shishmaref cannonball had arrived in 
cripple more than six hours behind redington but he left at 320 
pm only five minutes after the leader 
in third place was martin buser of big lake who pulled into 
cripple at 250 pm he was followed by fourtime iditarod champion 
rick swenson of two rivers at 320 pm joe garnie of teller at 
322 pm and defending champion susan butcher of manley at 435 
pm 
redington who arrived in cripple 525 miles from the start at 
450 am tried leaving at 9 am thursday but the sunsoftened 
snow turned him around 
no use to fight that let it harden up a little bit he said 
just before leaving thursday afternoon the dogs were right up to 
their bellies going along about 4 to 5 miles an hour i went out 
about three miles and came back thought id wait a while 
the delay gave an advantage to teams that have been hounding 
redington since he took the lead 260 miles back in rohn but he 
said there was little choice given the soft trail 
it doesnt hurt to give the dogs a little more rest he said 
from cripple the trail heads to ruby on the yukon river then 
follows the frozen river to kaltag and cuts over to unalakleet on 
the bering sea coast 
the first musher to reach nome will win 30000 the next 19 
finishers will split the rest of a 150000 purse 
two teams have dropped out of the race and two of the more than 
800 dogs running have died race officials said both deaths were 
ruled accidental

the marine corps already renowned for its 
rigorous physical conditioning is about to make things tougher for 
those who have already made it through basic training 
a new training policy order signed last week and now being 
prepared for distribution to the field will require all commands 
to refocus their physical conditioning program so that it goes 
beyond just staying in shape to pass the standard physical fitness 
test 
among other things all marines are going to be expected to 
start lifting weights or to engage in some equivalent type of 
progressive resistance training such as isometric exercises 
or partner resistance exercises 
the new directive was signed by brig gen fe sisley the 
corps deputy chief of staff for training but was really prompted 
by gen alfred m gray jr the man who took over as the corps 
commandant last july 
gray a stocky tobaccochewing general who rose through the 
ranks by staying away from the pentagon complained shortly after 
arriving in washington he was sick and tired of seeing his marines 
jogging for exercise in cute little sneaks 
marine headquarters looks like a morgue every afternoon 
because everyone is out jogging to look nice gray added 
i think if we would run a little more each day wed be the 
best looking outfit ever to get run off a hill 
reflecting that philosophy the new directive states 
historically the purpose of many physical conditioning programs 
has been to prepare marines for fitness testing rather than 
training them for the physical rigors of combat 
the focus therefore of our programs must change each 
commander must emphasize unit and combat fitness training instead 
of physical fitness testing and reflect this distinction in 
training plans and schedules 
the directive makes it clear the corps is not changing its 
standard physical fitness test which all marines must pass at 
least once every six months that test requires marines to meet 
standards for a 3mile run and performing situps and pullups 
rather the directive says commanders must ensure their marines 
face a minimum program of three hours per week of exercises 
that can be divided between anaerobic conditioning progressive 
resistance training and aerobic conditioning 
anaerobic conditioning would include calisthenics and other 
exercises to increase speed flexibility and agility while 
aerobic includes running and any exercise that enhances 
cardiovascular endurance 
weightlifting will fulfill the requirement for progressive 
resistance training and is needed because of the correlation of 
muscular strength and endurance to success in combat operations 
the directive states 
moreover when a marine is finished with his regular physical 
conditioning his commander should make sure he gets some 
occupational conditioning the directive continues 
a marine who is schooled as an infantryman for example should 
face some progressive loadbearing marches dry net training 
swimming obstacle courses confidence courses etc the 
directive says 
and once the marine is done with his occupational training his 
commander should include some competitive conditioning activities 
to foster competitive attitudes 
however the directive does warn the commander to keep in mind 
the stark truth of the saying no enemy has ever been killed by 
a basketball 
the overall objective the directive concludes is to develop 
in marines a reserve level of physical fitness that will enhance 
their chances of winning in a combat situation

a private college group urged president reagan 
on friday to sign the civil rights restoration act even though the 
act fails to include a broad exemption for religious schools 
richard f rosser president of the national association of 
independent colleges and universities said his organization was 
the main proponent of efforts that failed in the house to add a 
socalled religious tenet amendment to the bill 
but the association of 800 private institutions including 
catholic and other religiousaffiliated colleges still wants 
reagan to sign the bill which restores the scope of civil rights 
laws restricted by the supreme court in a 1984 case involving grove 
city pa college 
rosser in a letter to reagan said it was made clear during the 
house debate that the legislative intent of the new bill is to 
give deferential treatment to requests for religious exemption 
under title ix 
as the lead organization seeking passage of a religious tenet 
amendment we hope that the religious liberty concerns we 
articulated can be addressed by the congress at a future time 
rosser said 
we want to reiterate our unqualified support for this 
legislation he added 
reagan has repeatedly threatened to veto the legislation which 
was passed by margins of 7514 in the senate and 31598 in the 
house easily enough to override a veto 
the senate approved the bill last month after adding an 
amendment that says nothing in the bill or existing law requires 
any institution to perform or pay for abortions 
the house passed the bill march 2 despite a written warning from 
reagan that he would veto it if it is presented to me in its 
current form 
he said then it dramatically expands the scope of federal 
jurisdiction over state and local governments and the private 
sector and poses a particular threat to religious liberty 
the restoration act specifies that entire institutions and 
government agencies are covered by federal laws protecting the 
civil rights of women minorities the handicapped and the elderly 
if any program or activity within the institutions receives federal 
aid 
the bill exempts farmers getting crop subsidies people on food 
stamps and others receiving federal assistance

when sen paul simon asked local 
supporters this week to cast nine votes for him in illinois 
democratic primary it wasnt an incitement to vote fraud 
simons plea reflected illinois twopart presidential ballot a 
nonbinding beauty contest preference vote and dozens of local 
races for the democratic and republican delegate slots that are the 
real prize on tuesday 
unlike many states in which delegates are apportioned on the 
basis of a statewide vote illinois delegates are elected directly 
by voters in congressional district races 
its a key feature of the political terrain for presidential 
candidates in illinois offering advantages to simon george bush 
and bob dole and posing daunting problems for others political 
obervers say 
the 82 republican and 113 democratic delegate slots to be filled 
tuesday are apportioned among the states 22 congressional 
districts on the basis of relative strength in previous primaries 
for example in the heavily democratic 1st district on chicagos 
south side democratic voters will select nine delegates and three 
alternates while republicans will choose two delegates and two 
alternates 
recruiting delegatecandidates is a key organizational hurdle 
for the presidential campaigns without backers on the delegate 
ballot a candidate cant translate illinois support into 
convention votes 
the system is further complicted this year by the crowded 
presidential field leaving voters in some areas to choose among as 
many as 70 delegate candidates 
i am asking for nine votes simon told backers at a 
springfield fundraiser on wednesday six for delegates two for 
alternates and one for that beauty contest all nine votes are 
important 
simons political roots in illinois gave him an edge in 
recruiting wellknown delegatecandidates with a voter appeal of 
their own his slates are studded with state legislators labor 
leaders and party activists 
basically we looked for people that have wellknown names or 
would bring in a supporting group a laborunion leader a person 
from nuclear freeze an elected official or party leader said 
mike kreloff simons illinois delegate coordinator 
theyll help him hold off michael dukakis but their impact 
is minimized by the fact that the presidential candidates name 
appears on the ballot alongside the delegatecandidates said 
steve copple jesse jacksons national delegate coordinator the 
bulk of the people are going to vote for their presidential 
candidates supporters 
illinois delegate selection system is a handicap for jackson 
whose stronghold is three predominantly black districts in chicago 
those districts will elect 24 of the 113 democratic delegates but 
his chances of success elsewhere are questionable 
simons other democratic foes had little success in recruiting 
big names and only he and dukakis have full slates in every 
district albert gore has no supporters on the ballot in three 
districts and richard gephardt is short of a full slate in five 
districts 
even favorite son jackson has no delegate slate in the heavily 
republican 12th district and is short of a full slate in three 
other districts 
we were looking for people who had a fundamental commitment to 
al gore and his philosophy said larry perlman who runs the gore 
campaign in illinois that meant we didnt get a lot of people 
who have been around party politics for a long time 
on the gop side bush and dole both assembled impressive slates 
with the help of their state chairmen gov james r thompson and 
illinois house republican leader lee daniels pat robertson also 
has a full slate in every district but virtually all of his 
candidates are political unknowns 
bush operatives acknowledge that wellknown dole 
delegatecandidates such as former gov richard ogilvie and former 
us attorney dan k webb might help dole revive his candidacy 
i dont think name recognition alone is going to win for the 
delegates said ed murnane deputy director of bushs illinois 
campaign but in the really close tight races thats where name 
recognition probably does have some impact

half the arab policemen in 
the west bank resigned by plo order friday and israeli soldiers 
closed the main gaza mosque on the moslem sabbath for the first 
time worshipers could remember 
the al amari mosque in gaza city has been a rallying point for 
protest since riots began dec 8 in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip with prayer leaders sometimes calling over its loudspeakers 
for resistance to the army 
israeli troopers shot and wounded nine palestinians during 
street battles after friday prayers at other mosques in the 
occupied territories the army demolished the homes of four arabs 
accused of attacking either israelis or palestinians accused of 
collaborating with them 
two alleged collaborators have been killed by fellow arabs one 
of them a policemen israeli bullets or beatings have killed at 
least 87 palestinians in more than three months of violence and 
hundreds have been wounded 
army units turned journalists away from hebron and nablus but 
the press restriction was not as widespread as on march 4 when 
nearly all the west bank was put offlimits 
prime minister yitzhak shamir made his first public criticism of 
new us peace proposals secretary of state george p shultz 
brought to the region declaring the only word i agree with in 
the us plan is the name shultz about half the 500 arab police 
officiers in the west bank resigned in response to a call from the 
palestine liberation organization and underground united national 
command of the uprising sources reported the order was given in a 
leaflet circulated thursday 
mustafa adani 44 said he resigned after 25 years on the force 
along with almost all the police in the bethlehem station about 
50 to 55 the only ones who didnt quit were those who didnt know 
about the orders 
a senior military official said the resignations would have a 
negative impact on other palestinians who work with israel in the 
territories it is not very encouraging 
leaflet no 10 also demanded the resignations of west bank 
residents who serve in jordans parliament apparently to reinforce 
the plo role as the sole representative of palestinians 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip 
from egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
soldiers wounded eight palestinians two of them seriously 
during riots friday at a mosque in beit ummar 10 miles south of

broke a window falling inside the mosque arab witnesses said 
half a dozen soldiers entered the mosque during prayers to ask 
the imam or religious leader to urge protesters on the mosque 
loudspeaker to go home the witnesses said 
the soldiers entered the mosque while we were still kneeling 
barefoot on our prayer rugs people started shouting allahu akhbar 
god is great youssef hassan khalil 30 said at mukassed 
hospital he lay on a cot with a wounded right ankle 
witnesses said the presence of israeli soldiers in the mosque 
during prayers inflamed the arabs who hurled rocks and bottles and 
received volleys of tear gas rubber bullets and gunfire in return 
in the gaza strip soldiers wounded a palestinian in the leg 
while trying to disperse protesters at the jabaliya refugee camp 
hospital officials said 
an army cordon around al amari in gaza prevented a weekly prayer 
service that normally attracts 2500 worshipers

statement accusing israel of blocking some mosques raiding others 
and confiscating loudspeakers used to call palestinian moslems to 
prayer 
sheik said adin alami called on worshipers to defend the 
mosques by all possible means despite the attackers 
the army said it demolished three arab homes overnight in 
biddya 30 miles northwest of jerusalem to punish palestinians 
accused of involvement in an attack march 5 on an arab suspected of 
cooperating with israel 
soldiers also blew up the home in hebron of ahmed mahmoud 
abdullah kawasmeh whose 22yearold son is accused of knifing an

the rhode island supreme court on friday 
refused to block efforts to get a deposition from a priest 
regarding talks he had with another pastor later convicted of 
sexually molesting young boys 
the roman catholic diocese of providence is being sued for 12 
million by a narragansett woman and her son who contend the diocese 
knew the rev william c oconnell was molesting boys but did 
nothing about it as a result the suit contends the boy became 
one of oconnells victims 
the familys attorney r daniel prentiss has been trying to 
take a deposition from the rev richard c bucci but bishop louis 
e gelineau and auxiliary bishop kenneth a angell named as 
defendants in the suit with oconnell argued any conversations 
between bucci and oconnell are privileged 
the diocese contended the discussions are protected by a state 
law that prohibits a priest from testifying about confidential 
communication entrusted to him in his professional capacity 
prentiss contended the state law is intended to prevent a priest 
from divulging what he is told in confession 
my interpretation was that a statutory privilege absolutely 
does not apply and cannot be used to silence a witness the way they 
were trying here prentiss said friday 
monday a superior court judge denied the dioceses request to 
permanently block the deposition but granted church attorneys a 
temporary stay pending a supreme court appeal 
prentiss and diocese attorney william t murphy met in chambers 
friday with supreme court associate justice florence k murray 
about an hour later or less i got a telephone call from the 
court saying there was not going to be a stay of the deposition 
prentiss said 
there was no elaboration on the decision prentiss said 
he said bucci is scheduled to give his deposition monday 
murphy indicated he would not appeal the high courts decision 
oconnell was arrested in 1985 on charges of sexually assaulting 
three boys he was accused of fondling them in the rectory of st 
marys church in bristol and in his south kingstown summer cottage 
between 1982 and 1984 
he pleaded no contest to 26 separate counts in 1986 seven of 
them involving the plaintiff in the civil suit and was sentenced 
to one year in jail he also agreed to spend two years in therapy 
at a churchrun program for clergy members with alcohol and 
psychological problems 
the woman and her son contend the diocese and the bishops failed 
to remove oconnell from his position as pastor of st marys after 
being informed of his sexual involvement with boys some of them 
altar boys 
buccci an assistant pastor at st marys in 1984 and 1985 has 
not publicly admitted discussing oconnells behavior with diocesan 
officials but he did file statements with police about oconnell 
and he provided information to the state department for children 
and their families

forty million children in 34 countries 
will be vaccinated in the next four years under a program to 
eradicate polio in latin america and the caribbean a doctor said 
friday 
dr ciro a de quadros an adviser to the world health 
organization said governments in the region have committed 350 
million to the project which is expected to cost 450 million 
the rest is to be donated by other groups such as the us 
agency for international development unicef who and the private 
rotary international 
quadros spoke at a threeday meeting of development experts 
doctors and health ministers in this alpine town the conference is 
sponsored by the task force for child survival whose members 
include unicef who the un development program the world bank 
and the rockefeller foundation 
quadros told the group that the polio campaign expects to reach 
10 million of the 11 million children born in latin america each 
year between now and 1991 the goal is to reach 85 percent of the 
children in every country in latin america either through 
established health care systems or special immunization days 
the campaign is an intensified version of a project already 
under way 
in paraguay and the dominican republic health workers have gone 
doortodoor administering the oral polio vaccine nine countries 
last year held special immunization days including el salvador 
where government troops and rebels called a oneday truce to allow 
children to be immunized 
we are four years away from wiping out polio and we are very 
confident quadros said adding that the incidence of the disease 
is already low when compared to other childhood diseases 
fourteen latin american countries last year reported about 900 
cases of polio he said three times more than in europe 
the united states has been virtually free of the paralyzing 
virus for a decade 
so the longterm goal of the polio project not just to wipe 
out polio quadros said in an interview it is to establish an 
infrastucture a health care system in developing countries that 
can be used for other types of immunization and for delivering 
other care 
in addition success in fighting polio is expected to boost the 
morale of health care workers and communities struggling against 
the enormous medical problems that confront the impoverished third 
world 
dr william h foege executive director of the task force and 
former head of the centers for disease control in atlanta said 
lessons learned in south america will be used to set a date for 
eradicating the disease in asia africa and elsewhere 
among those attending the meeting at a 16th century stone 
monastery in the french alps are world bank president barber 
conable unicef executive director james p grant who director 
general halfdan mahler leaders of more than a dozen other 
international aid agencies and health ministers from 11 countries 
since the early 1980s task force organizations have been 
cooperating to vaccinate children against diptheria whooping 
cough tuberculosis and neonatal tetanus in addition to polio the 
project aimed at developing countries has raised immunization 
from 5 percent to 50 percent of the worlds children in less than a 
decade

a senior state department official on friday 
defended an agreement giving japan access to us nuclear wastes 
and disputed reports that negotiations with congress to avert a 
move to kill it had broken down 
were more than prepared to continue the discussions with the 
congress to see if there is a basis for moving forward on the 
agreement fred mcgoldrick director of the office of 
nonproliferation and export policy said 
mcgoldrick said the agreement concluded last november with japan 
and facing a disapproval vote next week in the senate has adequate 
safeguards against proliferation and terrorism 
we think the agreement is very much in our interest 
mcgoldrick said if we do not have this kind of agreement the 
japanese will simply go elsewhere to buy their enriched uranium 
that not only has commercial implications we would lose export 
revenues it means we do not have nonproliferation controls and 
influence that we have in this agreement 
two former pentagon officials and the congressional general 
accounting office have been sharply critical of the pact which 
allows japan to retrieve plutonium the primary ingredient of 
nuclear weapons from us nuclear fuel once the fuel has been used 
critics of the nuclear cooperation agreement said thursday they 
may move to kill the accord next week in congress 
the former pentagon officials richard n perle and frank j 
gaffney jr said the defense department was not given a 
significant role in negotiations and considers the agreement 
seriously flawed 
the strong position that the department has taken against 
nuclear proliferation would have helped to shape the accord 
differently they said in a letter written to sen john glenn 
dohio and obtained by the associated press that we are quite 
sure is why the department of state went to such lengths to work 
around us 
perle and gaffney cited two provisions of the agreement as 
especially troublesome first they said the pact gives japan 
advance us consent for 30 years to reprocess and use american 
plutonium in any japanese facility without restriction on the 
amount or the purpose 
second they said the pact imposes extraordinary and 
unprecedented restrictions on the right of the united states to 
suspend that prior consent 
perle and gaffney said they were the pentagon officials 
responsible for nonproliferation issues while the agreement was 
negotiated 
a gao report meanwhile said the agreement would leave the 
united states without effective control over reprocessing of 
the hazardous material 
the feb 29 report also found fault with the agreements 
provisions to guard against proliferation and said it deprived 
congress of its oversight function 
congressional opponents want the united states to have the right 
to review japanese use of plutonium on a casebycase basis and to 
be able to suspend the agreement to counter terrorism threats or 
address other national security concerns 
the congressional foes also want the agreement to be reviewed 
every five years 
these changes would require renegotiating the terms with japan 
which the state department declines to do said a congressional 
source speaking on condition of anonymity 
mcgoldrick said the united states has an unfettered right to 
suspend our approval to use plutonium that would result in a 
significant increase in the risk of proliferation or a threat to 
the national security 
and he said the pact includes defined safeguards against 
misuse of the plutonium 
mcgoldrick said canada and australia which have strong 
nonproliferation policies have entered into similar agreements 
with japan and west european countries without casebycase 
restrictions 
the gao report said the agreement did not meet various 
requirements of the atomic energy act it said giving blanket 
approval to japan for reprocessing plutonium would leave the 
united states with no effective control over the life of the 
proposed agreement 
in december the senate foreign relations committee voted 153 
to return the pact to president reagan and asked that it be 
renegotiated opponents argued that it sets a precedent to 
encourage potentially hazardous trade in plutonium which is a 
potent cancercausing agent 
under the agreement japan would ship the spent nuclear fuel 
from the united states to reprocessing plants in britain or france 
which would separate plutonium from the waste the plutonium then 
would be shipped to japan by air

dogs that helped seize 135 million 
worth of drugs in less than a year have enraged drug traffickers 
who are offering 30000 to anyone who kills the animals federal 
authorities say 
the threats are aimed mostly at one dog nicknamed rocky who 
has become a sort of mascot in the fight against drugs and is used 
in many drug awareness programs for children according to terry 
mcintosh deputy regional chief of the us border patrol in dallas 
however mcintosh said wednesday the threats made by telephone 
a few months ago to the mcallen office cover all 14 dogs used by 
the border patrol 
the callers said they have put out the word they will pay to 
have the dogs killed mcintosh said 
the dogs are stationed in mcallen and laredo as well as in 
marfa el paso and del rio 
mcintosh said the dogs have been guarded round the clock since

informal meetings were held friday in the 
afghanistan peace talks after what un mediator diego cordovez 
said was a week spent tackling enormous difficulties in the 
proposed settlement to end nine years of fighting 
he told reporters that he asked the afghan and pakistani 
representatives to seek strengthened instructions for the next 
session scheduled monday in the indirect talks between the two 
sides 
this would be just one day before a march 15 target date set for 
the negotiations by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev last month he 
said moscow would bring home its troops beginning may 15 if the 
settlement was signed by march 15 
however sources close to the talks have said the date was not 
meant as a deadline after which the soviet pullout might be in 
doubt 
in peshawar pakistan meanwhile a moderate faction that split 
from the alliance of moslem afghan guerrillas last week rejoined 
the alliance friday 
sibghatullah mojaddedi told members of his afghan national 
liberation front that assurances from other leaders and from 
pakistani officials persuaded him to rejoin the guerrillas effort 
to hammer out an interim government to oversee the withdrawal of 
soviet troops from afghanistan 
mojaddedi split with the alliance because he was worried that 
moslem extremists would dominate the interim government 
in geneva cordovez reiterated that agreement existed on the 
substance of things 
the problem now concerns the sequence of actions in afghanistan 
leading up to and including the withdrawal of the 115000 soviet 
troops 
it also hinges on pakistans insistence that an interim 
government be ready to take control in kabul before the soviets 
begin their withdrawal 
emerging with him from a closeddoor meeting was the chief 
pakistani delegate acting foreign minister zain noorani who said 
the negotiations were inching slowly 
pakistans position about the interim government came under new 
fire from the soviet union thursday with moscows special envoy 
nikolay kozyrev saying the talks had bogged down because of it 
kozyrev warned that islamabad would bear the responsibility if 
there was no final agreement despite completion of all the main 
elements of the settlement 
he also said that moscow felt free to continue military 
assistance to afghanistan even after the troop withdrawal he 
rejected a us demand that military aid should be cut off 
simultaneously to both the kabul government and the anticommunist 
guerrillas kozyrev said assistance to the government was not 
covered in the draft agreements 
sources close to the pakistani delegation said the cutoff issue 
was among items discussed with cordovez at the informal meeting 
friday but they did not dsclose details

washington president reagan stepping up us economic 
pressure on panama today ordered that a 65 million payment due 
that country on tuesday be put into escrow 
the move was part of a series of sanctions designed to weaken 
panamas militarydominated government which reagan called 
illegitimate and orce strongman manuel antonio noriega from 
power 
reagan called on noriega to resign as commander of the 
panamanian defense forces and said in a statement that the united 
states can no longer conduct business as usual with noriegas 
government 
reagan ordered that us government payments due to panama be 
held in escrow until constitutional rule is restored in panama the 
payment due tuesday relates to operations of the panama canal 
reagan also ordered that the trade benefits panama receives 
under a special system set up for third world countries be 
withdrawn similarly he suspended panamanian participation in the 
caribbean basin initiaitve under which some panamanian products 
receive dutyfree access to us markets 
in addition reagan said he has ordered that panama be subject 
to intensified scrutiny by us immigration and customs officials 
the purpose of that move he said is to apprehend drug 
traffickers and money launderers 
secretary of state george p shultz said there was no need to 
impose an additional sanction relating to the fees panama receives 
from alaskan oil shipments transferred to us east coast ports 
through a panamanian pipeline 
shultz told a news conference those fees already have been 
frozen based on earlier court action 
shultz noted that the presidents statement referred to the 
panamanian government as illegitimate 
thats a very strong word shultz said underscoring the 
seriousness with which the united states views the situation there 
he accused noriega of trying to impose a military coup in panama 
by deposing president eric arturo delvalle whom the united states 
regards as the legitimate constitutional authority 
under the caribbean basin initiative panama and about 20 other 
countries are eligible to sell most products dutyfree to us 
markets 
but this measure will have mostly symbolic impact because the 
bulk of panamas exports to the united states are not subject to 
duties in the first place panama exported between 342 million and 
388 million worth of products to the united states last year 
according to figures provided by us government agencies 
on thursday the house voted 3672 in support of a nonbinding 
resolution demanding noriegas ouster 
the resolution which took note of allegations of drug 
trafficking murder money laundering and racketeering against 
panamas defense forces was approved shortly before the white 
house meeting was convened 
it called on reagan to consider seriously additional 
economic and political sanctions 
members on both sides of the political spectrum lashed out at 
noriega and gave the administration virtually carte blanche to 
impose additional sanctions rep mel levine dcalif said the 
government of panama is in the hands of a thug a common criminal

the government said friday that retail sales 
edged up 06 percent in february bolstered by strong demand for 
autos but economists expressed worries that sales in january were 
much weaker than previously believed 
in good news on the inflation front wholesale prices fell 02 
percent in february pushed down by drops in both food and energy 
costs 
for the first two months of the year the labor department said 
prices have been rising at an annual rate of 11 percent half the 
modest 22 percent increase in 1987 analysts said inflation should 
remain moderate for the rest of the year 
the commerce department report on retail sales said that 
consumers purchased 128 billion worth of goods last month up 714 
million from january after adjusting for seasonal variations while 
the february increase was in line with expectations many 
economists focused on a sharp downward revision to the january data 
instead of a 05 percent rise in sales the government said 
sales actually fell 02 percent during january showing that the 
consumer sector is weaker than previously believed 
ever since the record collapse of stock prices in october 
analysts have been worried that consumers would become more 
cautious and cut back on spending since consumer spending accounts 
for twothirds of overall economic activity any significant 
slowdown in this area could topple the country into a recession 
the large downward revision in january shows that the consumer 
sector is quite weak said bruce steinberg an economist with 
merrill lynch car sales are doing ok with the incentives but 
other than that nothing seems to be doing very well 
david wyss an economist with data resouces inc a private 
forecasting firm said that since october americans have been 
building up savings reflecting worries about the future caused by 
the stock market decline 
but he said that strength in other sectors reflected by the 
strong employment gains in february should provide enough momentum 
to keep the country out of a recession wyss predicted that overall 
economic growth as measured by the gross national product would 
be an anemic 15 percent this year less than half the 39 percent 
gnp growth turned in during 1987 
auto sales in february increased 16 percent following an even 
stronger 2 percent advance in january february sales accounted for 
almost onefourth of total retail spending during the month 
without the strength in auto sales which has been bolstered by 
new incentive programs total retail sales would have risen a 
smaller 03 percent last month 
the general merchandise category which includes department 
store sales suffered a 16 percent decline in sales in february 
following a 01 percent decline in january january department 
store sales had originally been reported as an increase and the 
backtoback declines in this key sector were particularly 
disappointing to economists 
consumer spending is weaker than we had anticipated but we 
werent looking for much strength in this sector this year 
anyway said sandra shaber an economist with the futures group 
a washington consulting firm 
sales of all durable goods items expected to last three or more 
years were up 16 percent in february boosted by the increase in 
car sales while sales of nondurable goods edged down 01 percent 
wyss said the car data indicated to him that dealers were having 
trouble selling used cars and consumers should be able to find some 
good deals in this area in the months ahead 
sales at building materials and hardware stores jumped a sharp 
23 percent in february while sales at furniture and appliance 
stores were up a more modest 03 percent 
sales at specialty clothing stores climbed 06 percent in 
february only a partial rebound following a giant 33 percent 
january decline 
sales at gasoline stations fell 16 percent in february while 
sales at restaurants edged up 01 percent and sales at drug stores 
posted a 06 percent increase 
sales at grocery stores enjoyed a 07 percent rise in sales in 
february reversing a 06 percent january decline 
the labor department report on wholesale prices said that food 
prices declined 11 percent in february while energy prices dropped 
08 percent the cost of lettuce which had skyrocketed through the 
late fall and early winter fell a dramatic 70 percent

alpine skiers who seek out daring runs 
on unmarked trails accounted for half of all swiss avalanche deaths 
last winter and also pose problems for the environment officials 
said friday 
maj hugh lindsay a close friend of britains prince charles 
was killed thursday by a snowslide while skiing outside the normal 
slopes above klosters switzerland the traditional royal winter 
resort 
the heir to the british throne escaped unhurt 
the swiss federal avalanche research institute had warned 
thursday of considerable avalanche danger above 5250 feet in the 
region the party was skiing at about 5900 feet 
one obviously doesnt like seeing anyone getting killed but 
when you ski off the path that is your own responsibility said 
david bramwell a british skier vacationing in this remote village 
90 miles southeast of zurich 
in a statement before leaving switzerland charles said everyone 
in his group understood the dangers before they embarked into the 
avalancheprone area 
i would like to emphazise that all members of my party 
including myself were skiing off the piste trail at our own risk 
and we all accepted that the mountains have to be treated with 
the greatest respect charles said 
but many vacationing skiers and residents in klosters indicated 
they thought charles should have not been so willing to lead his 
companions down the dangerous slope 
last winter eight of the 16 people killed by snowslides in 
switzerland were offtrail skiers said claude francois jaccard 
director of the avalanche research institute atop mount 
weissfluhjoch 
over the longterm they make up about 30 percent of all 
avalanche deaths the toll is highest among ski hikers who tour 
across mountains on skis often for days jaccard said 
about 1 million skiers including many foreigners cut loose on 
unmarked runs every year the swiss national association for sports 
says 
christian tischauser chief ski warden at corvatsch about 30 
miles south of klosters recently called on the swiss government to 
consider legislating curbs on offtrail skiing 
neighboring austria has banned the practice as of this year 
with violators facing fines 
switzerland has not followed suit but one recent outing became 
expensive for three swiss who set off an avalanche as they skied 
off marked trails near zermatt 
a court last month made them pay the cost of sending out search 
teams 
swiss authorities tourism offices and sports associations have 
taken the tack of appealing to skiers responsibility when 
venturing off regular runs 
some resorts in the grisons region where klosters is located 
already have limited such skiing 
a nationwide information campaign was launched late last year to 
make offtrail skiers aware of safe areas to practice the sport 
the basic capital for tourism is unblemished nature said 
peter anrig of the swiss tourism association 
inexperienced skiers are known to rip through saplings 
ultimately killing off a future tree in a country concerned about 
widespread forest damage from pollution he said snow tourists 
also tend to litter in the otherwise virgin areas 
alpine animals are jolted by offtrailers experts say citing 
the example of the snow grouse skiers often scare the birds out of 
snow caves in which they hibernate leaving them to die of cold and

seventy members of the israeli parliament on 
friday presented a petition calling on president reagan to pardon 
jonathan j pollard the navy analyst who was convicted of passing 
secrets to israel 
the petition presented to us ambassador thomas pickering was 
signed by most of the rightwing likud bloc in the knesset or 
parliament and by the leftwing mapam faction it was a rare 
display of unity among israels divided legislators 
the committee for justice for the pollards released news of the 
petition in the united states 
it called on reagan to pardon pollard a civilian navy 
intelligence analyst convicted last year of selling secrets to 
israel and sentenced to life in prison the petitioners also asked 
reagan to pardon pollards wife anne hendersonpollard who was 
sentenced to five years in jail for being an accessory 
it is very rare for an issue to so cut across party lines as 
does the plight of the pollards according to the petitioners 
all israel is praying for their release 
the israeli government was severely embarrassed by pollards 
arrest outside its washington embassy in 1985 saying it had not 
authorized the spying operation public pressure however forced 
the government to foot the bill for some of pollards legal fees 
the pollard committee noted that the pollards punishment was 
particularly harsh in view of the fact that he spied for a us 
ally 
in general spies for allies are treated more leniently if 
they are prosecuted at all the committee said

the archbishop of canterburys office on friday 
attacked the jesus is alive postmark that is being stamped on 
millions of letters mailed in britain but the post office said it 
would not withdraw the slogan 
bishop ronald gordon archbishop robert runcies chief of staff 
said the post offices decision to frank letters with the easter 
message was inappropriate and an imposition 
the belief that jesus is alive is at the heart of the 
christian faith and christians must be expected to wish to affirm 
it on appropriate occasions gordon wrote in reply to a letter of 
protest from the british humanist association 
but the imposition of a postmark by a public monopoly is 
hardly an affirmation of faith since the sender can exercise no 
choice in the matter in this respect the imposition may be 
regarded as insensitive he added 
the post office said it was surprised by the criticism and said 
many religious groups had used the postal service in the past to 
spread religious messages 
there has been a large measure of popular support for this 
particular postmark said a post office spokesman speaking on 
condition he not be identified 
the postmark which also has drawn protestfrom jews is being 
stamped on nearly all letters mailed in britain it says jesus is 
alive next to a cross 
paul slennett an evangelist bookseller paid the post office 
the equivalent of 92000 to use the postmark for six weeks 
starting march 1 he says it is an easter message and that god told 
him to do it

up scarce fertilizer led to a protest by 400 farmers a newspaper 
reported friday

township in sichuan province according to the official china 
daily it said liu was under investigation for using the back 
door to buy up chemical fertilizer

sale and distribution

cooperative to sell him 990 pounds of fertilizer for family 
members the report said cooperative workers and truck drivers took 
that cue to use their own connections to obtain fertilizer before 
it was distributed to local farmers 
when distribution began in december farmers reportedly broke 
into the cooperative to get fertilizer and remained there for three 
days until county officials persuaded them to hand it all back the 
daily said

a group of us senators told mikhail s gorbachev 
on friday that soviet superiority in tanks and artillery scared the 
west into a nuclear defense so cutbacks in those arms should 
precede strategic missile reductions 
the senators said they sensed the soviet leader is less worried 
about president reagans strategic defense initiative but they 
said they doubted that signaled greater tolerance of it 
i think there has been a lessening of soviet apprehension 
about sdi said sen sam nunn chairman of the senate armed 
services committee i think they recognize that it is a longterm 
project 
the senators met with reporters after a weeklong exchange with 
highlevel soviet military and political officials 
the kremlin wants to link a superpower agreement on reduction of 
strategic weapons to compliance with the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty the treaty outlaws spacebased defense systems like 
that seen under sdi popularly known as the star wars program 
nunn said the americans pressed for delinkage of the two 
issues but they did not get any encouragement at all along that 
line 
the official news agency tass in its account of the meeting 
said gorbachev reiterated the kremlins allegiance to its 
position on a direct linkage of missiles cuts with abm compliance 
violating it destroys the entire machinery of the agreement 
tass quoted gorbachev as saying we shall never be able to bridle 
the rabid charger of the arms race if it is let loose in outer 
space 
gorbachev and reagan signed an agreement eliminating all 
mediumrange nuclear weapons at their washington summit in december 
sen alan cranston dcalif said he assured gorbachev that the 
treaty was likely to be ratified this spring with no crippling 
amendments and that the concern of the congress and 
administration had turned to the issue of how to cut strategic or 
longrange nuclear arms 
us and soviet negotiators are at work in geneva on a proposed 
treaty to eliminate 50 percent of the superpowers longrange or 
intercontintal nuclear missiles 
both sides have said they would like the treaty ready for 
signing in late may or early june when reagan visits moscow but 
the senators expressed doubt it would be ready in time 
nunn said the kremlin should first cut its overwhelming 
superiority in conventional weaponry such as tanks and artillery 
there is a great correlation between our firstuse reliance on 
nuclear weapons and their massive conventional forces nunn said 
he said he explained to gorbachev during the groups meeting 
which lasted more than three hours that a soviet rollback of tanks 
and artillery from eastern europe would go far in reducing the 
fears of americas european allies about a soviet military threat 
the north atlantic treaty organization nations which will lose 
their mediumrange missiles under the agreement signed in december 
have balked at further nuclear cuts without prior reductions in 
soviet conventional arms 
we would like to see the soviet union save some money so it 
can devote it to their economic development nunn said he told 
gorbachev 
the senate group which also included sens william cohen 
rmaine alan simpson rwyo and carl levin dmich also met in 
the past week with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
communist party foreign affairs secretary anatoly f dobrynin and 
army chief of staff sergei f akhromeyev

a soviet dissident said friday he saw scores of 
tanks and soldiers police and militia keeping order in a 
frightened southern city where ethnic rioting killed at least 32 
people 
andrei shelkov who works on the independent political 
publication glasnost said residents of sumgait were still 
hysterical about the rioting that broke out there two weeks ago 
shelkov told a news conference in moscow that he was in sumgait 
in the republic of azerbaijan for about five hours on wednesday 
he returned to moscow the following day 
shelkov said that on one street there was a solid line of 
light tanks i counted 47 of themnearby were about 40 civilian 
buses full of soldiers he said 
streets were full of soldiers police and civilian militia a 
curfew was in effect but businesses and schools were operating 
shelkov said he said he talked to azeris as the natives of 
azerbaijan are called and russians in sumgait but did not meet any 
of the estimated 18000 armenians who lived in the industrial city 
of 160000 people 
tensions between armenians and azeris whose republics are next 
to each other erupted in violence in sumgait on feb 28 the 
rioting was believed sparked by armenians demands that 
nagornokarabakh an armeniandominated region of azerbaijan be 
annexed to armenia 
an hourlong general strike had been proposed in armenia on 
friday but a communist party official in the armenian city of 
kafan told the associated press it was canceled to avoid stirring 
up unrest 
gamlet kocharyan a member of armenias party central committee 
and of kafans governing body said by telephone that tanks and 
troops remained in regions where ethnic tensions had erupted but 
that the situation is quieting down a little 
we are waiting for the 26th when a party and government 
meeting on the fate of nagornokarabakh is to be held he said 
kocharyan said armenians are convinced the moscow leadership 
will make the only just decision and return nagornokarabakh 
region to armenia 
former political prisoner sergei grigoryants the editor of 
glasnost said he traveled to the armenian capital yerevan to 
witness a march tuesday by hundreds of thousands of fellow 
armenians in memory of those killed in the sumgait rioting 
he showed journalists photographs of streets packed with people 
and said they were taken at the march 
some armenians claim the death toll in sumgait was 350 to 400 
but the government has put the official death toll at 32 
shelkov said he could not reach the cemeteries in sumgait 
because they are outside the city and roads were blocked off 
western reporters have not been allowed to travel to the region 
shelkov said he was told by a nurse who worked in a maternity 
hospital that azeris broke in during the riots and threw babies out 
the window and that one woman had been disemboweled 
a man who addressed a gathering of armenians in moscow on 
tuesday also said he had seen the body of a slain pregnant woman 
and her mutilated unborn baby 
neither report was confirmed 
the army arrived on march 2 to restore order to sumgait shelkov 
said 
it was simply a hysterical scene he said of his 
conversations with residents of the city 
the russians and azeris claimed that the violence was the work 
of azeris who came to sumgait from throughout azerbaijan 
grigoryants said armenians at tuesdays memorial march did not 
blame average azeris for the killings 
almost every armenian family will recall how azerbaijanis hid 
them or tried to hide them he said 
but he said armenians were angry with the moscow media for 
portraying as extremists those who demonstrated in favor of 
annexation of nagornokarabakh 
azeris are predominantly shiite moslems and most armenians are 
christians

the drivein church can move but 
when the spririt moves its members theyll have to keep their 
hands off the horn 
the citys planning commission on thursday approved the new 
location for the drivein church on the condition that its mobile 
worshipers abandon a tradition of honking their horns when they are 
compelled to make a joyful noise 
for 18 years sunday services have been held at the woodland 
drivein theater but the drivein is being torn down causing the 
fifth reformed church to hunt for a new locale 
city officials said the threat of increased sunday traffic and 
the possibility of a particularly moving sermon causing a racket at 
the new site prompted some opposition to the plan 
so church officials said theyd tell the faithful to flash their 
lights when they felt particularly illuminated during services 
commissioners thought that idea was ok but wrote a nohornhonking 
provision into the resolution supporting the proposal

years after the mother state endorsed it the 1789 federal 
constitutional amendment allows congress to approve a pay raise for 
itself but the raise would not be effective until the following 
congressional session 
the amendment was approved by eight states before it dropped by 
the wayside in the 1790s said the sponsor del david mckinley 
virginia which divided to form west virginia in 1863 approved it 
197 years ago 
but congress neglected to put an expiration date into the 
proposal and it has hung around ever since mckinley said 
the house of delegates approved it last month and the senate 
followed suit on thursday endorsing it on a 340 vote 
del jim humphreys balked at the proposal its got more mold

the news around newport news isnt good 
for those who are tired of having their hometown mistaken for a 
newspaper 
lawmakers in the southeastern virginia city have rejected a 
proposal that would drop the cryptic news making the citys 
name simply newport 
based on historical facts and information it would serve no 
good purpose to change the name of newport news to newport the 
citys historical commission said thursday 
the suggestion for the name change came from councilman joseph 
c ritchie who said he was tired of going on business trips and 
saying he was from newport news which invariably brought the 
response how do you like working for a newspaper 
the committee discovered that around the turn of the century 
the city tried to persuade officials of newport va near 
blacksburg to change their hamlets name then newport news could 
become the newport 
but the original newportians resisted taking their case to 
court where as the current names suggest they won 
in its research the commission also established that the 
newport in the citys name came from explorer capt christopher 
newport but where the news came from is anybodys guess

premier giovanni goria resigned friday as the leader 
of italys 47th postwar government saying there was no reason to 
delay the fall of the shaky coalition for talks to smooth the 
transition of power 
it was the third time the christian democrat quit since taking 
office in august but president francesco cossiga rejected his 
earlier resignations and persuaded him to stay on 
goria handed in his latest resignation to cossiga on friday 
night cossiga asked him to stay on as a caretaker premier until a 
new government can be formed 
goria who at 44 was italys youngest premier resigned for the 
first time in november in a dispute with the tiny liberal party 
he quit again feb 10 after defectors in his own party caused 
him to lose a series of secret votes on the budget however 
cossiga talked him into returning to office to help pass the 
national budget before the april 30 deadline 
the lower house of parliament gave final approval thursday night 
to a budget that includes a deficit of 122 trillion lire or 988 
billion the spending plan was very different from the original 
proposed by the coalition which forecast a deficit of 833 
billion 
with the budget passed gorias days were numbered as the head 
of the coalition of christian democrats socialists republicans 
social democrats and liberals 
throughout gorias seven months in office political infighting 
and defections in secret votes made it difficult for him to govern 
goria was expected to resign next week with the start of 
consultations among leaders of the various political parties about 
his successor 
but goria said he decided to step down immediately because it 
was clear that the intentions of some parties was not to reach an 
understanding that had the interest of the country at heart 
he did not specify any political party but cabinet ministers 
from various parties said goria quit because of socialist party 
opposition to the governments plan to resume construction at a 
nuclear power plant 
the government announced a moratorium on the construction of the 
plant after voters in a referendum expressed their opposition to 
nuclear power 
the governments decision wednesday to go ahead with the project 
angered the socialist party leaders 
at the time of his resignation in february analysts suggested 
some christian democrats wanted to undermine goria and make party 
secretary ciriaco de mita the premier

why do americans have different beers for

exhibit now at cincinnatis union terminal center had some 
questions for members of the cincinnati public relations company he 
visited thursday 
employees at smith kaufman public relations were confused by his 
beer question 
they understood when kozitsyn explained that he had seen a 
television commercial saying the night belongs to michelob 
and another thing why is k mart americas favorite store 
he asked 
any advertising or public relations effort in the soviet union 
is done very slowly with much care and deliberation kozitsyn 
said he described the american media as fast colorful and timely 
there is much to learn about the methods here he said 
much of thursdays informal discussion was spent explaining to 
kozitsyn the distinctions between us advertising public 
relations and journalism 
in our country it isnt so important to explain everything 
he said 
kozitsyn said interest in public relations methodology is 
increasing in the soviet union because the country under communist 
party leader mikhail gorbachev is taking a hard look at its 
traditions 
we have not only successes we have mistakes kozitsyn 
said there is a need for us to explain our mistakes in history 
and modern life there is the need to understand truths 
there is much we need to teach our own people and much to 
learn about accomplishing that kozitsyn said

former national security adviser robert c 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty today to four misdemeanor charges of 
withholding information from congress about reagan administration 
efforts to help nicaraguan contra rebels during a statutory ban on 
military aid 
mcfarlane standing before us district judge aubrey e 
robinson jr admitted that he withheld information about the 
activities of lt col oliver l north and other members of the 
national security council staff in three 1985 letters to house 
committees 
he also admitted withholding information from the house foreign 
affairs committee when he told the panel on dec 8 1986 that he 
was unaware of any efforts to solicit donations for the contras 
from a third country 
each of the four charges carries a maximum penalty of one year 
in prison and a 1000 fine 
after entering his plea mcfarlane told reporters that he did 
withhold information from congress on the occasions cited in the 
charges but added 
my actions were motivated by what i believed to be in the 
foreign policy interest of the united states 
mcfarlane said that since the irancontra affair became public 
in late 1986 he had spent more than 200 hours testifying privately 
and publicly without immunity from prosecution he promised to 
continue cooperating until this matter is finally resolved 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh said he could have sought 
more serious perjury charges against mcfarlane but settled for the 
misdemeanor charges because the former white house aide had shown 
remorse and had tried to correct his original testimony 
president reagan boarding a helicopter for a weekend at camp 
david md refused to comment when asked about mcfarlane its 
in the court reagan shouted to reporters 
each charge carries a minimum sentence of one month in prison 
but robinson reminded mcfarlane he could receive a maximum 
fouryear sentence 
you understand that imprisonment could be consecutive the 
judge asked 
i understand that said mcfarlane who spoke in a very soft 
subdued voice 
q this is the action you knowingly took with respect to 
writing the letters 
a it is your honor 
referring to testimony mcfarlane gave the house foreign affairs 
committee the judge asked that was a knowing response 
it was your honor mcfarlane replied 
robinson filed under seal a letter of cooperation that mcfarlane 
and his attorney leonard garment had signed as part of plea 
bargain struck with walsh who is investigating the irancontra 
affair 
robinson did not set a date for sentencing indicating that he 
will assess mcfarlanes degree of cooperation with the prosecutor 
before making a decision 
mcfarlane was released on his personal recognizance 
the charges of withholding information from congress were 
detailed in a criminal information which is filed when a defendant 
hs agreed to enter a guilty plea to charges 
secretary of state george shultz asked at the white house about 
mcfarlanes guilty plea told reporters that if he has made some 
mistakes i dont know about that bud mcfarlane continues to 
have my strong friendship 
the document filed today alleges that mcfarlane made false 
statements in letters sent in 1985 to the house intelligence and 
foreign affairs committees and a foreign affairs subcommittee 
the charges involve assurances to congress that members of 
mcfarlanes national security council staff specifically lt col 
oliver l north were not involved in private efforts to help the 
contras 
in an oct 7 1985 letter to the house intelligence committee 
mcfarlane wrote that lieutenant colonel north did not use his 
influence to facilitate the movement of supplies to the 
resistance the information said 
in addition it said mcfarlane assured the committee there was 
no official or unofficial relationship with any member of the nsc 
staff regarding fund raising for the nicaraguan democratic 
opposition 
another charge states that on sept 5 1985 mcfarlane withheld 
information from the house intelligence committee when he wrote 
i can state with deep personal conviction that at no time did i 
or any member of the national security council violate the letter 
of spirit of the boland amendment which banned us military aid 
to the contras 
the sept 5 letter also stated that we did not solicit funds 
or other support for military or paramilitary activities either 
from americans or third parties 
the charge notes that the letter unlawfully withheld material 
information from the panel because mcfarlane then and there 
knew and believed that a member of the nsc staff had violated the 
letter or spirit of the boland amendment by among other things 
soliciting support for military and paramilitary activities of the 
contras and offering certain advice for the conduct of the contras 
military activities and organization 
the letter was written in response to an aug 20 1985 letter 
from the panels chairman rep lee hamilton dind requesting 
information about news reports that the nsc staff was helping the 
contras 
another charge relates to dec 8 1986 testimony in which 
mcfarlane told the house foreign affairs committee that he was not 
aware of any third country or citizens of a foreign nation helping 
the contras 
the concrete character of that is beyond my ken mcfarlane 
told the committee 
the court documents said mcfarlane was withholding his knowledge 
that since 1984 the nationals of the third country referred to 
had expressed willingness to contribute millions of dollars to the 
contras and that mcfarlane gave a representative of that third 
country with the number of a contracontrolled bank account into 
which the funds could be deposited 
the plea bargain was negotiated by mcfarlanes attorney leonard 
garment and walsh who is expected to seek a round of indictments 
in coming weeks from a federal grand jury that has been 
investigating the arms sales to iran and diversion of profits to 
the contras 
mcfarlane has testified extensively before the grand jury 
impaneled by walsh last year mcfarlane tried to kill himself with 
an overdose of the tranquilizer valium the day before his scheduled 
testimony before a presidential commission that investigated the 
irancontra affair 
two other irancontra figures have entered guilty pleas in 
walshs investigation and are cooperating with the independent 
counsel 
two conservative fundraisers carl r spitz channell and 
richard miller admitted last year that they participated with north 
in an illegal scheme to use a taxexempt foundation to raise money 
for the contras 
mcfarlane who resigned as white house national security adviser 
on dec 4 1985 traveled with north to tehran in may 1986 aboard a 
plane that delivered spare parts for hawk missiles that had 
previously been shipped to iran by the israelis 
mcfarlane carried a cake and a bible to give to the iranians 
during negotiations over the release of american hostages being 
held in lebanon 
during testimony before congressional investigators last summer 
mcfarlane said he ordered his nsc staff not to solicit private 
funds for the contras 
north however testified that i never heard those 
instructions he said mcfarlane had asked him to help keep contra 
forces operating after congress imposed a ban on direct us 
military aid 
mcfarlane said he was not aware that arms sale proceeds were 
being diverted to the contras until north told him about it during 
their return trip from iran 
north testified that mcfarlane told him to include false 
information in a chronology of the arms deal which was prepared in 
the fall of 1986 while the irancontra affair was uraveling 
mcfarlane denied he knowingly falsified the chronology and said 
incorrect information was given to him during a meeting led by 
north

panicked soccer fans fled knifewielding 
ruffians and triggered the collapse of a sports stadium in libya 
killing at least 20 people according to news reports friday 
maltas state radio said two libyans were arrested in tripoli 
after the collapse 
newspapers in belgrade quoting a report from the yugoslav state 
news agency tanjug from tripoli said at least 20 people were 
killed and hundreds injured when a stadium dividing wall fell 
thursday during a match between malta and libya 
joe sacco the general secretary of the maltese football 
association who was in tripoli with the maltese team said friday 
there was speculation in the libyan capital that the death toll 
could be higher 
the libyan news agency jana said a row of seats collapsed at the 
june 11 stadium and that a number of spectators were injured 
the stadium reportedly has a capacity of 70000 it was not 
immediately known how many people were at the game 
the times of malta said panic occurred when someone in the 
stands brandished a weapon and the spectators rushed to get out 
politika ekspres a belgrade daily said the incident began when 
several fans pulled out knives during a quarrel 
some spectators returning to malta told reporters at the airport 
the same story while others quoted people in the stadium as saying 
a man was terrorizing the crowd with a snake 
politika ekspres said spectators seeking safety toppled an iron 
fence at the same time a sixfoot thick 15foot long wall 
dividing the second from the third level of the stadium also 
crashed down 
it is hard to believe that anyone under it could have remained 
alive politika ekspres said quoting eyewitnesses 
several hundred people reportedly were injured when the crowd 
from the third level surged down creating panic that soon spread 
to other parts of the stadium 
people rushed to all exits and that caused more injuries the 
paper said 
finally about 5000 fans in the field started chasing the 
culprits one of them was captured but police managed to drag him 
free from the hands of the crowd politika ekspres said 
maltas department of information said the foreign ministry was 
informed that no maltese nationals were involved in the accident 
the libyans were leading 10 in the exhibition game between the 
two national teams the game was stopped and did not resume 
maltese prime minister edward fench adami sent a message friday 
to libyan leader col moammar gadhafi extending our condolences 
and deepest sympathies to the familes of the bereaved and to all 
those hit by this tragedy 
the people of malta join me in sharing your profound grief at 
this unhappy moment during the sports festival fenech adami said

iran and iraq stopped nearly two weeks of 
attacks on each others cities friday but the iraqis said they got 
in the last volley with 11 missiles fired before their afternoon 
truce deadline 
hundreds of civilians have been killed or wounded since the 
exchange began feb 29 
eight rockets were aimed at tehran on friday and three at the 
iranian holy city of qom the official iraqi news agency reported 
it said the last missile left its launcher at 344 pm just 16 
minutes before time iraq said it would stop shooting 
an iraqi military communique said iranian leaders would be 
sparing the blood of their people if they also observed a 
ceasefire but if they did not by god we will make them taste 
bitter defeat and we will deal them unprecedented violent blows 
tehrans official islamic republic news agency said eight 
civilians were killed and 20 wounded friday bringing the toll 
since the missile exchange began feb 29 to 165 killed and 440 
wounded iraq has reported many deaths and injuries but has not 
given figures 
thousands of people have been killed in periodic rounds of the 
war of the cities since the persian gulf neighbors went to war 
in september 1980 
iraq said its jets raided an iranian tanker in the gulf and 
seven cities in iran but maritime officials said they could not 
confirm the ship attack iran said civilians were killed in the air 
raids 
in washington us military sources said iran had begun 
building launch pads for silkworm antiship missiles on abu musa 
one of its gulf islands potentially increasing its ability to 
menace shipping 
there were no reports of iranian missile attacks after two were 
fired thursday night but iran said its artillery pounded basra and 
other southern iraqi cities and its warplanes bombed iraqi troop 
concentrations iraq said women and children were killed in the 
shelling 
a military spokesman said on tehran radio later friday that iran 
had stopped its deterrent attacks on iraqi cities but would 
respond if iraq attacked iranian residential areas 
turkey was instrumental in arranging the truce which it had 
intended to begin thursday the turks have good relations with both 
sides and represent the interests of each on the others territory 
iran had said it would start its ceasefire thursday afternoon 
but presumably continued its attacks when iraq did the same 
manuser mottaki irans ambassador to turkey said friday in 
ankara that the iranians would honor the truce if iraq did both 
combatants had made similar statements while turkey was arranging 
the ceasefire 
iraq reported firing 71 missiles in the 12 days 59 of them into 
tehran and iran said it launched 29 all but two at baghdad 
tehran was safe from attack by surfacetosurface missiles until 
now because it is 290 miles from the border and iraq did not have 
rockets capable of reaching it iran periodically fired missiles 
into baghdad which is only 80 miles from the frontier 
iraq said it developed its own longrange missile but military 
analysts say it is using sovietmade scudbs with strapon boosters 
for added range they say iran also uses scudbs which can fly 190 
miles without boosters 
the defense officials in washington who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said us intelligence had not yet detected efforts by 
iran to move any of its chinesebuilt silkworms to abu musa 
iran has batteries of silkworms which have a range of about 50 
miles on its shore of the narrow strait of hormuz southern 
gateway to the persian gulf 
it also has fired missiles believed to be silkworms into 
kuwaits main anchorage from the faw peninsula which it captured 
from iraq early in the war 
in washington the pentagon announced that the 16th convoy 
operation of 1988 had ended quietly friday with two reflagged 
kuwaiti tankers steaming out of the persian gulf into the gulf of 
oman 
the sea isle city and chesapeake city which began the 
southbound transit from kuwait through the persian gulf on 
tuesday were escorted by the guidedmissile frigate uss simpson

two former bank executives were portrayed friday 
as greedy men hungry for wealth as prosecutors began presenting 
their case in a fraud trial linked to the neardemise of 
continental illinois bank and trust co 
us district court jurors who may sit through six weeks of 
testimony listened to detailed descriptions of alleged fraud that 
involved millions of dollars and stretched from the oil fields of 
oklahoma to continentals offices in chicago 
the government has accused former continental vice president 
john lytle of buying highrisk loans from nowdefunct penn square 
bank in oklahoma city in exchange for nearly 600000 in kickbacks 
between 1980 and 1982 
defendant william patterson former head of energy lending at 
penn square gave the kickbacks to lytle in the form of unsecured 
loans the government contends 
a third defendant tulsa oil driller jere sturgis is accused of 
making payments to lytle in hopes of getting future loans from 
continental 
the three men have pleaded innocent 
ladies and gentlemen youre going to hear evidence that will 
prove that john lytle was not serving the interests of his 
employer assistant us attorney mark l rotert said 
he contended lytle was completely financially dependent on 
bill patterson 
lytles lifestyle rotert said involved the kind of 
consumption of goods that is associated in this country with the 
wealthy the welloff 
he was adding rooms to his home in northbrook he took 
vacations not oneweek vacations not twoweek vacations but 
monthlong vacations rotert said 
lytle who worked at continental from 1959 until his dismissal 
in 1982 bought furs and rare automobiles took trips to the french 
west indies and stayed in a luxurious condominium in vail colo 
where he liked to ski the prosecutor said 
he had a hot tub there with a retractable roof he could sit 
back and see the craggy peaks of the rocky mountains rotert said 
patterson meanwhile was the thirdlargest shareholder in the 
first penn corp parent company of penn square bank the 
prosecutor said 
the success of penn square bank was his future his career 
his livelihood rotert said 
patterson is accused of paying lytle to ensure continentals 
involvement in loans with penn square 
continental would be the principle lender in most cases but 
penn square benefited from finders fees worth thousands of 
dollars rotert said 
continental and penn square became lending partners on millions 
of dollars in loans largely because of the relationship between 
lytle and patterson the prosecutor said 
lytles job as the head of continentals gas and oil lending 
operation in oklahoma did not involve routine loan approvals but 
he constantly overruled loan officers who opposed risky deals with 
penn square 
mr lytle did what mr patterson wanted him to do rotert 
said 
lytle 52 and patterson 37 are charged with misapplication of 
bank funds and wire fraud 
sturgis 40 charged with wire fraud is acccused of joining the 
alleged scheme by helping lytle cover the unsecured loans from 
patterson after continental discovered lytles personal dealings 
penn square collapsed in july 1982 under the weight of energy 
loans it could not collect in 1984 continental survived the 
largest run on deposits in banking history with the help of a 45 
billion government bailout

sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of 
the senate labor and resources committee expressed his support 
friday for increasing the minimum wage to 505 per hour over four 
years but said he still remains committed to raises tied to 
inflation 
i continue to support indexing said kennedy in a statement 
released by his washington office its the best way to make the 
minimum wage a living wage 
kennedy said his committee has scheduled action on the minimum 
wage bill during the week of april 11 
the house education and labor committee voted thursday to raise 
the federal minimum wage to 505 an hour in several steps over the 
next four years 
the vote to increase the minimum wage to 505 instead of the 
465 voted last week by the house labor standards subcommittee 
was seen as an attempt by supporters of an increase to gain a 
bargaining chip that will assure the minimum wage will be at least 
465 when the measure leaves the house 
last week the subcommittee approved a bill to raise the 
335anhour minimum wage to 385 in 1989 425 in 1990 and 
465 in 1991 at the same time the subcommittee voted to strip 
the bill of a controversial proposal that would have indexed or 
tied future increases to the rate of inflation 
a fourth year increase is less satisfactory but it could make 
a stronger package given the presidents veto threats said 
kennedy the last time congress raised the minimum wage in 1977 
we enacted a fourstep increase too

a baptist minister and a secretary 
insisted friday that a convicted killer who has escaped floridas 
electric chair six times is innocent and should not be executed 
next week 
the rev sam sparks and christine bass also said they were 
disappointed that gov bob martinez refused to meet with them 
friday to hear evidence they hoped would clear willie jasper darden 
i think a lot of people in florida are wondering why he wont 
sit down for even 15 minutes with ms bass and me that seems 
reasonable said sparks 
meanwhile dardens attorneys filed a lastditch appeal on his 
behalf friday in the florida supreme court no immediate ruling was 
issued 
the governor said he was satisfied the courts had reviewed 
dardens case thoroughly 
there is nothing that would change my mind the evidence 
was clear the rulings were proper by the courts martinez said 
sparks and ms bass appeared at a news conference called by 
amnesty international which has tried to focus international 
pressure on the governor who signed a seventh death for darden 
this week one day after the us supreme court turned down an 
appeal 
soviet dissident andrei sakharov american actress margot kidder 
and british rock star peter gabriel are among those opposing his 
electrocution 
amnesty international delivered to the governors office 
petitions bearing the signatures of 10000 people in the 
netherlands who opposed floridas system of capital punishment the 
group also urged its supporters to call or cable the governors 
office friday 
it is a violation of human rights said magdaleno 
roseavila head of the groups campaign to abolish the death 
penalty 
darden 54 has survived more death warrants and has been on 
floridas death row longer than any other inmate except one his 
case has become a focal point for capital punishment opponents who 
say his trial was tainted by racial prejudice darden is black and 
the man he was convicted of killing was white 
sparks and ms bass have issued affidavits about the events of 
sept 8 1973 that conflict with the versions of the killing 
related by the victims wife and prosecutors 
darden was convicted of killing lakeland furniture store owner 
james turman during a robbery that netted 15 a store employee 
also was shot three times and crippled and turmans wife had to 
fend off a sexual attack 
sparks said turmans wife had told him all blacks looked alike 
to her and that her identification of darden was unimportant 
because the lawyers had told her that darden committed the crime 
helen baum formerly helen turman recently denied having made 
that statement to sparks and reaffirmed her identification of 
darden as the one who shot her husband mrs baum said it was her 
sister who made the statement sparks quoted but sparks insisted 
that it was mrs baum 
ms bass a lakeland secretary said darden had an accident near 
her house and that he waited for a tow truck until 535 pm her 
house was eight miles from turmans store and prosecutor say the 
crime occurred at about 6 pm 
willie darden is innocent and i know it ms bass said 
ms bass said she tried to meet with dardens attorney to tell 
him what she knew but was rebuffed 
sparks said he did not come forward sooner because he had been 
told by mrs baum about a month after her husbands death that 
darden confessed to the crime sparks said he didnt know otherwise 
until he started talking to ms bass and they compared notes on the 
crime

about 50 conservationists and residents 
of this scenic philadelphia suburb gathered friday to protest a 
planned power line through a farm made famous by artist andrew 
wyeth 
wyeth who is from chadds ford used the kuerner farm for more 
than 1000 studies and at least five paintings over 45 years 
he spent as much time here as i did farming he painted while 
we worked said karl kuerner jr 61 who raises cattle and grows 
hay on the 35acre farm 
philadelphia electric co plans to place wooden utility poles on 
a 250foot stretch of the farm as part of a 11mile power line 
between a concord substation and kennett square said bill jones a 
spokesman for the company 
growth in the area southwest of philadelphia near the delaware 
state line makes the new line necessary before peak demand in the 
summer he said 
the existing lines in the area were overloaded almost daily 
when the temperature got over 90 last summer jones said adding 
that there were several brief blackouts because of the demand 
philadelphia electric serves 14 electric customers in 
southeastern pennsylvania and northern maryland 
a power line already traverses the kuerner farm with three 
100foot metal towers standing on a meadow near a shingled barn 
the new line would come within 35 feet of the barn kuerner said 
demonstrators holding signs outside the entrance to the kuerner 
farm said an alternate route along a nearby highway would have less 
of an impact on the environment 
route 1 has already got poles and everything its not going 
to affect the aesthetics said harry g haskell jr a former 
mayor of wilmington who grew up with wyeth in chadds ford 
wyeth was ill with the flu and could not attend the 
demonstration said john sheppard a spokesman for the brandywine 
river museum where many of wyeths paintings are displayed 
jl peters a division manager for philadelphia electric said 
the route over the kuerners farm had the least impact 
we are cognizant of the natural beauty of the chadds ford area 
and we have spent considerable time and effort looking at all the 
possible routes through the area so as to minimize the impact on 
the aesthetics peters said 
we are convinced the route we have selected achieves that 
he said 
wyeths paintings using kuerners farm include snow 
flurries which is on display at the national gallery in 
washington evening at kuerners trodden weed pine

outgoing president antonio ortiz mena of the 
interamerican development bank predicted on friday that its loans 
to latin america will increase from last years 2361 billion to 
between 25 billion and 3 billion in 1988 
we can continue on this level until the end of the century 
ortiz mena told a news conference 
the bank owned by 44 governments is a major source of loans to 
raise the living standards of latin american countries most of 
which have seen declines in recent years from their already low 
levels 
after 17 years with the bank ortiz mena is returning to his 
native mexico he will be succeeded by enrique iglesias of uruguay 
ortiz mena blamed the drop in the banks lending in part on the 
drop in the value of the us dollar which he said cost the bank 
12 billion last year and will cost it another 2 billion in 1988 
the bank is deep in a dispute with the us government its 
biggest shareholder which is seeking more control over its lending 
ortiz mena denied that he had blocked a us effort to place a 
new man as the banks executive vice president james w conrow 
deputy assistant secretary of the treasury for developing nations 
he said the report was a fabrication 
ortiz mena will not be going to a meeting of the banks board of 
governors to be held in caracas venezuela on march 21 he said 
there would be discussion there of additional resources for the 
bank from japan he would not give a figure 
he added that there would also be discussion of increasing 
japans voting strength in the fund now 108 percent of the total 
the united states the largest contributor controls 345 percent 
of the votes 
ortiz mena said the major challenge for the interamerican bank 
is to help reverse the present situation in which capital is 
flowing out of latin america instead of into it the outflow much 
of it interest on old debts is estimated at 157 billion for 1987 
latin american countries can not fulfill theur debt 
commitments unless there is economic growth ortiz mena said 
to achieve growth it needs investment there can be no 
investment if it is exporting capital it needs to import capital

lyndon larouches attorneys demanded access friday 
to information a prosecutor relied on when he said a top fbi 
official conferred with a key figure in the irancontra scandal 
about an effort to collect information against larouche 
the attorneys said the information might help them prove their 
contention that former white house aide oliver north asked the fbi 
and cia to infiltrate larouche groups because they were interfering 
with norths private contraresupply effort 
also friday the trial judge again delayed the resumption of 
testimony in the fraud and conspiracy case against larouche six 
aides and five organizations because of pending searches of 
government records including those of the white house and vice 
president george bush for any evidence suggesting infiltration of 
larouche groups 
a prosecutor said the records searches ordered by us district 
judge robert e keeton would take up to three weeks 
assistant us attorney john markham urged the judge to allow 
testimony to continue in the interim but defense lawyers said they 
would be unable to competently question witnesses without first 
having all evidence of possible government infiltration of larouche 
groups 
keeton said the earliest the jury would be called back to court 
was tuesday he also said he would decide monday if a longer delay 
was necessary 
also friday the larouche attorneys unleashed several new 
allegations of prosecutorial and government misconduct they 
charged the government withheld documents favorable to defense 
claims that evidence against larouche and followers was fabricated 
by government agents working undercover in the political 
extremists organizations 
in a memo sent to north by retired air force maj gen richard 
secord one of norths principal operatives in the contraresupply 
network secord said that our man told him retired army sgt 
maj fred lewis had gathered info against larouche 
lewis is the executive vice president of rhyolite management 
systems a texas company the larouche lawyers contend was one of 
several private companies run by former military officers used by 
the cia to carry out covert activities 
assistant us attorney john markham had told larouche defense 
lawyers that our man referred to oliver buck revell a top 
fbi official involved in counterintelligence operations markham 
since has said he was mistaken and that the reference was to john 
cupp a secord associate who worked in the resupply effort 
secord and cupp in interviews this week also have said the 
reference was to cupp both denied any role in or knowledge of a 
government effort to spy on larouche 
if our man here is in fact oliver revell it would create a 
motive for highlevel forces in the fbi and national security 
council to conceal that in order to protect mr revell the 
defense motion said 
markham did not immediately respond to the request for 
information concerning revell an fbi spokesman earlier this week 
refused to relay questions from the associated press to revell 
saying the agency would not comment on matters that were at issue 
in a current trial 
an fbi document declassified this week quotes lewis and two 
other men as saying top fbi and cia officials asked them to 
infiltrate larouche groups larouche lawyers said they had evidence 
the three asked larouche aides to assist them in illegal activities 
markham contended in a document filed friday that lewis and the 
two other men were lying when they said they had been asked to 
infiltrate larouche groups 
larouche attorney odin anderson also said friday that he had 
evidence showing revell intervened to block a planned meeting 
between larouche and william clark who at the time of the alleged 
incident was president reagans national security adviser

nine wheaton college graduates go to court monday 
in an attempt to prevent the school from using funds raised by 
alumnae for new coeducational purposes 
the group claims to represent hundreds of alumnae around the 
country upset by the schools plan to admit men this fall for the 
first time in its 154year history 
at issue is 107 million raised by alumnae from 1983 to 1985 in 
a telephone fund drive marking wheatons 150th anniversary says 
alumna mary anne marsh 
the theme of the drive was preparing women for the 21st 
century said marsh we had been given no idea they planned to 
make the school coed 
alumnae first received letters informing them of the plan to go 
coeducational in january 1987 marsh said but she added its 
very clear that this plan was conceived before the first phone was 
picked up 
the trustees of this college of 1200 students 30 miles south of 
boston endorsed the move last may at that time president alice 
emerson said the change was not being made for financial reasons 
but because of a nationwide decline in high school graduates and 
studies showing a waning interest in singlesex colleges 
nancy mccann another of the nine alumnae expressed anger about 
the plan 
its important to keep womens colleges alive she said 
there should be options womens colleges afford women the chance 
to take a real leadership role while they are trying out their 
wings before they go into the real world 
wheaton spokeswoman lisa byrnes said the school would seek 
judicial approval to use these funds for coeducational purposes 
at mondays hearing in bristol county probate court

us rep mario biaggi and six codefendants 
were greedy thieves who plundered a nowdefunct bronx defense 
contractor for millions of dollars the government charged friday 
as the wedtech corp racketeering trial unfolded 
this is a case about corruption and greed and the purchase and 
sale of public offices it is a case about public officials who 
want to get paid twice once by the people who elected them to do 
their job again by someone else assistant us attorney howard 
wilson told the jury in us district court in manhattan 
this case involves the story of the rise of a little company 
in the bronx that began in 1965 as a machine shop and grew by 
1978 to 15 million in sales by taking advantage of laws that 
promoted the growth of minorityowned enterprises wilson said 
seven years later this company had grown like topsy to a 
defense contractor with 1000 employees and 117 million in 
revenues becoming the biggest single employer in the bronx he 
said 
the success was achieved through corruption and lies 
this case is part of a scandal that also led to the indictment 
of former white house aide lyn nofziger and two former associates 
of attorney general edwin meese iii 
nofziger was convicted last month of lobbying former white house 
associates within one year after he left the government on matters 
including a federal contract for wedtech 
defendants in the manhattan trial are biaggi 70 former bronx 
borough president stanley simon 57 bernard g ehrlich 59 of 
bedford biaggis former law partner and a former major general in 
the new york national guard biaggis son richard 38 of fort lee 
nj peter neglia 39 of armonk the former regional 
administrator of the small business administration john mariotta 
57 scarsdale former wedtech chairman and ronald betso 39 of 
brooklyn a former cop and friend of neglias 
they all treated this company like a gold mine said wilson 
some took a lot some took a little but they all took 
they engaged in the scheme by saying that mariotta who is 
hispanic was the majority owner of wedtech and thus the company 
was entitled to a federal program that allowed companies to get 
government business without bidding the government says 
the minority member of the company must own more than 51 percent 
of the firm but in fact wilson charged mariotta owned less than 
half 
biaggi at one point demanded 5 percent of wedtechs revenues 
but that was too much for wedtech officials wilson said who then 
gave him 5 percent of wedtech stock that was put in his sons name 
at another point biaggi asked for 50000 for expediting a 
lease before the citys board of estimate the prosecutor said and 
the law firm his son worked for received the money the day after 
the lease was signed 
in addition the law firm earned 1 million in retainers fees 
from wedtech from 1978 to 1985 wilson said 
simon who was borough president from 1979 to 1987 demanded and 
received over 50000 that came in cash in envelopes meals chips 
for gambling in atlantic city casinos pink marble in his home a 
trip to rome and contributions in his name to charities wilson 
said 
he also got a job for his brotherinlaw at wedtech and took 
half his raises over the years wilson said 
neglia as regional sba head and then as acting chief of staff in 
washington was wedtechs paidfor friend wilson said 
among other things wilson contended neglia warned the company 
about a congressional inquiry provided navy specifications for 
bidding on a pontoon contract wedtech wanted and helped wedtech 
obtain contracts of increasing value 
neglia was paid with stock options frequent meals 
contributions to the republican party in his name and the promise 
of a job once he left office wilson said less than a month after 
leaving the government in early 1986 he went to work for the law 
firm biaggi and ehrlich 
mariotta embezzled about 1 million and sold wedtech stock worth 
between 6 million and 8 million wilson charges ehrlich was 
mario biaggis partner in the plunder of wedtech when he got it 
he split it wilson charged 
richard biaggi became a lawyer in 1982 and became the front 
man in this case wilson said sometimes taking money or stock in 
his fathers name betso was a smaller player who took stock 
options in his name for his friend neglia wilson alleged 
wilson said he would present testimony from wedtech accountants 
supervisors workers sen alfonse damato and four former 
officials who have pleaded guilty to crimes involving wedtech 
defense attorneys begin presenting their arguments monday

in life bill britts refusal to budge from 
his makeshift hut in the woods earned him the image of cantankerous 
eccentric but friends and family on friday mourned the 52yearold 
hermit as a free spirit who loved nature 
my father never really was a hermit said his tearful 
daughter ingrid boughner 28 he was a naturalist he was 
the most colorful and articulate human being he loved me for being 
me and he gave me the courage to be myself 
bill britt was a truly rare human being there are not enough 
accolades to describe him he had a zest for life a passion for 
freedom independence and the beauty of the woods said bill 
baird the abortion activist who befriended britt 20 years ago 
britts daughter and son britton steven boughner 30 as well 
as his mother marion 86 two brothers and many other relatives 
gathered with his friends for the memorial service at a funeral 
home 
the oak casket at the front of the room was bedecked with 
flowers someone had also placed on it a photograph of the hermit 
hugging one of his beloved trees there was also a stuffed toy 
raccoon a memory of the mans love for wild animals and a 
handmade card written by his son and daughter 
the family planned to cremate the body baird said he would 
scatter the ashes saturday at britts favorite tree despite 
objections that a license is needed 
britt was once a married man with a house three children and a 
job in an office it all crumbled when he divorced in 1969 
britt cast off his threepiece suits and his threepiece name 
britton william boughner he began to spend time in the woods at 
the stateowned chestnut hill reservoir near the affluent suburb 
of the same name where he was born and raised they called him the 
hermit of chestnut hill 
but he was hardly a recluse 
britt was shrewd and stubborn given to tears when he didnt get 
his way he resembled a tall child as he rode the trolleys and 
hunted for pay phones to call reporters clad in castoff clothing 
and dragging a clattering armful of plastic buckets that served as 
his portable office 
bearshaped and nearly toothless britt had blind eyes swollen 
with infection he refused welfare and lived on the nickels he got 
for empty bottles and cans 
two years ago britt became the subject of legal efforts to pry 
him from the patch of state land 
britt fought back by cultivating the image of misunderstood 
hermit who wanted only to be left alone among the trees it landed 
him a spot on late night with david letterman actor mickey 
rooney suggested making a tv movie about britts life 
a sympathetic judge respected britts wish for a suburban eden 
and ordered the state to find a suitable alternative site 
britt refused them all 
last july he was finally forced from state land and moved to 
the adjacent boston cemetry 
officials said britt froze to death about two weeks before his 
body was found monday at the chestnut hill cemetery his remains 
were found by his daughter and son inside the leanto where he 
lived

contra rebels for nine days said friday the experience was the 
most terrifying of his life and his captors threatened to kill 
him if he tried to escape 
richard boren a 30yearold witness for peace volunteer from 
elkin nc said he was forced at gunpoint to go with the contras 
after they captured him during an attack march 1 on a northern farm 
cooperative 
they freed him wednesday night suffering from a cold but 
unharmed 
witness for peace based in durham nc opposes us policy on 
nicaragua and support for the rebels and seeks to document contra 
human rights abuses 
the explosions sounded like they were all around literally i 
thought wed end up getting killed boren said of the rebel 
attack on the cooperative 
i heard a shot right at the door to the house i was staying 
in he said i looked up and saw isabel ramos the 13yearold 
girl was wounded 
he said he left the house with his arms raised and was taken 
along with 12 nicaraguans by the contras i asked them if they 
were going to kill me and their response was yes if i ran away 
he added 
boren said his release wednesday night near quilali a village 
170 miles north of managua surprised him he said he plans to go 
back to the united states for a while to see his family and friends 
i have now personally experienced the terror the nicaraguan 
people are subjected to at the hands of the contras he said 
it has been the most terrifying experience of my life and i doubt 
the emotional scars from the experience will ever completely heal

the americanarab antidiscrimination 
committee said friday it has asked attorney general edwin meese iii 
to place israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir on its border 
watch list and order that he not be allowed to enter the united 
states as a private citizen 
the committee also filed suit in federal court demanding us 
government documents relating to shamirs activities as a member of 
the militant stern gang which waged guerrilla warfare in the 
struggle for an independent state in what now is israel 
we believe in the adc there should be one stand for 
terrorists one for friend and foe alike said abdeen jabara 
president of the committee we believe the us government should 
have one yardstick 
shamir is to visit the united states next week meeting with 
president reagan on wednesday even if he were on the watch list 
shamir would not be turned away since he is coming in an official 
capacity 
the united states last year placed austrian president kurt 
waldheim on its watch list because of his suspected participation 
in nazi war crimes during world war ii the watch list is so called 
because us consular officials around the world check the list 
before issuing visas for visits to the united states 
the basis for this request rests on the long history and 
involvement of mr shamir as a leader of the infamous stern gang 
which was responsible for numerous acts of terrorism said the 
adcs letter to meese dated thursday the department of justice 
had no comment on the letter 
the court petition also filed thursday asked for documents in 
the possession of the departments of justice defense and state 
the cia and the immigration and naturalization service 
shamirs violent opposition to the british forces in palestine 
led to his imprisonment on at least two occasions the court 
complaint said shamir was in charge of organization and 
operations of lehi the formal name of the stern group which had 
adopted a policy of individual acts of terror 
jabara said his group wants the documents to back its efforts to 
have shamir declared persona non grata 
shamir has never renoucned his participation with the above 
mentioned groups nor has he ever denounced their use of 
terrorism the adc complaint said shamir is legally excludable 
from entering the united states

the state department on friday questioned the 
right of the soviet union to provide arms to the government in 
afghanistan denouncing the regime in kabul as a faction in the 
afghan civil strife 
in a strong statement department spokesman charles e redman 
said us aid to the afghan rebels who have waged a civil war for 
more than eight years would not be halted until the soviets stopped 
their assistance to the kabul government 
there will be no cutoff of support for the resistance under 
any other circumstances redman said 
on thursday nikolai kozyrev the soviet foreign ministrys 
adviser on afghan affairs declared that moscow would not stop 
arming the kabul government as part of an agreement for an afghan 
ceasefire 
the official accused pakistan and the united states of holding 
up a peace agreement that would end the war and allow the soviets 
to withdraw an estimated 120000 troops from the country 
it was not immediately clear what impact the us and soviet 
disagreement on aiding the rival groups would have on negotiations 
the united nations is holding in geneva between pakistan and 
afghanistan 
soviet general secretary mikhail s gorbachev had offered to 
begin a troop withdrawal on may 15 if an agreement was concluded by 
next tuesday 
the geneva draft agreement calls for noninterference in 
afghanistan 
redman said it was only logical that the provision apply to 
the soviet union as well as the united states 
the soviets cannot claim a right to aid a faction in the 
afghan civil strife just because that particular faction tries to 
call itself the government of afghanistan the spokesman said 
the war in afghanistan in fact is on this central issue 
concerning the very legitimacy of the kabul regime he said 
even with soviet support redman said the present kabul 
regime has been barely able to secure the capital and a few other 
cities 
the us official did not mention the us weapons including 
stinger antiaircraft missiles that washington has sent the rebels 
through pakistan 
the stingers have downed soviet and afghan aircraft and 
helicopters and forced pilots to fly higher reducing the 
effectiveness of air power against the guerrillas

tass charged friday that us economic sanctions 
against panama are an attempt to subjugate that central american 
nation and reclaim the panama canal 
the official soviet news agency said in its commentary 
reports on developments around panama leave no doubt that the 
washington administration intends to crush the independence of that 
country and perpetuate us domination over its territory first of 
all the panama canal zone 
it described drugtrafficking accusations against panamas 
military strongman gen manuel antonio noriega as a convenient 
pretext for interfering in internal panamanian affairs 
it is only a short time ago that gen noriega was regarded in 
washington as one of ours tass stated 
president reagan stepped up economic pressure on panama friday 
ordering that a 65 million payment due panama next week be put 
into escrow 
trade benefits were suspended earlier and reagan ordered 
intensified scrutiny of panama by us immigration and customs 
service officials 
on thursday the us house of representatives passed a 
nonbinding resolution demanding noriegas ouster reagan has 
refered to the panamanian government as illegitimate 
tass said the united states is trying to pressure panama into 
renegotiating agreements requiring us soldiers to leave by the 
year 2000 
what washington would really like is to do away with panamas 
independence make it back into the obedient us puppet it used to 
be and seal the us right forever to own part of panamanian 
territory and keep us military bases there tass said 
noriega was indicted by us grand juries in florida in february 
on drugtrafficking and moneylaundering charges he has denied the 
charges 
the tass commentary lectured washington it should look first 
at what is happening under its very nose and accused lt col 
oliver north and former national security advisers robert mcfarlane 
and john poindexter of direct involvement in drugrelated 
crimes as part of the irancontra scandal

federal aviation officials on friday 
unveiled a regional air traffic control centers new computer 
system part of a 197 million nationwide system they say will 
improve air safety even though it will be replaced within 12 years 
published suggestions that the new computers already are 
outdated are very very misleading because the agency wanted 
computers with proven reliability not the newest models available 
said ed harris an associate administrator of the federal aviation 
administration 
we would have been crazy to gamble on a system that was 
unproven harris said before the dedication of the new computers 
at the los angeles air route traffic control center 
the center in palmdale about 50 miles north of downtown los 
angeles controls instrument flight operations in 177000 square 
miles of airspace over southern and central california southern 
nevada southwestern utah northwestern arizona and the pacific 
ocean out to 250 miles off californias coast

into restricted airspace over suburban cerritos and collided with 
an aeromexico jet on aug 31 1986 killing 82 people cerritos is 
20 miles southeast of the airport 
since the crash several reviews of faa records indicated its

outdated electronics many of which were inoperable or down for 
repairs a considerable amount of time 
the los angeles center is the 13th of 20 faa traffic control 
centers nationally to activate the new computer system made by 
international business machines corp 
but the faa will start replacing the new computers as well as 
display screens and other equipment used by controllers with a 
highly advanced 2 billion to 4 billion nationwide system by 
1995 and intends to complete installation by the end of 1999 said 
william carson jr of ibm 
thousands of ibm 3083s like the ones unveiled friday were sold 
to banks and businesses until ibm stopped making them last year 
carson said 
computer technology is advancing so quickly that if you waited 
for stateoftheart youd never buy anything said nobby owens 
an faa deputy associate administrator the old ibm 9020 system 
was at capacity the reliability of this ibm 3083 equipment 
offers use exactly what we want

the new ibm mainframe computers are up to 10 times faster and 
have four to five times the storage capacity of the equipment they 
will replace faa administrator t allan mcartor said in a 
prepared statement 
this will allow the air traffic control system to keep pace 
with projected traffic growth over the next decade and accomodate 
the introduction of new automation functions that will both enhance 
safety and increase controller productivity he added 
the los angeles centers system was activated march 1 but was 
formally dedicated friday by hc mac mcclure faa regional

traffic flow 
the 600employee center in palmdale handled about 19 million 
flights last year and is the fifth busiest in the nation 
the faa said the new computers are only one aspect of its 12 
billion 20year modernization plan which also will include new

robert c mcfarlane left congressional 
irancontra investigators in little doubt last spring that he had 
deliberately misled congress about efforts inside the reagan 
administration to sidestep a ban on aid to nicaraguas contra 
rebels 
some committee members said at the time they felt the former 
national security advisers underoath testimony must have been 
true because it was so selfdamaging 
mcfarlane put the seal on that judgment friday when he pleaded 
guilty to four misdemeanor charges accusing him of withholding from 
congress the fact that the administration had helped the contra 
movement stay alive in part through soliciting secret 
multimillion dollar contributions from third countries 
by pleading guilty mcfarlane in effect admitted he made false 
statements in letters sent in 1985 to the house intelligence and 
foreign affairs committees and in testimony in december 1986 before 
the foreign affairs panel 
in that testimony mcfarlane made this statement i did not 
solicit any country at any time to make contributions to the 
contras i have seen reports that various countries have 
that was challenged by john nields chief counsel of the house 
irancontra panel who referred to the country involved as 
country 2 although it had been independently identified as 
saudi arabia 
now in fact you did have a pretty good idea of country 2s 
funding of the contras didnt you nields asked 
yes mcfarlane replied 
nields in fact as youve testified yesterday and today you 
had a hand in obtaining contributions totaling approximately 32 
million from country two 
mcfarlane yes 
nields but you did not tell that to the foreign affairs 
committee at that time 
mcfarlane no i was trying to use some tortured language 
inappropriately i think it wasnt a full account this 
isnt as full an account as i could have given 
later he said that testimony and his statements in the 1985 
letters were clearly too categorical on my part 
in other portions of his irancontra testimony mcfarlane said 
he had helped alter documents failed to shut down an 
outofcontrol covert operation and did nothing when marine lt 
col oliver l north told him he planned to hold a shredding 
party 
mcfarlane said repeatedly that if anyone was at fault in all of 
this it was he 
summing up rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the house 
committee rejected mcfarlanes attempt to take all of the blame 
as the national security adviser you are the spokesman for the 
president of the united states hamilton told the witness 
and when we write to you we do not write to mr mcfarlane we 
write to you as the representative of the president 
and when you spoke to the congress and when you wrote to the 
congress we accepted your words and your assurances as those of 
the president 
you spoke for the president hamilton said and the 
responsibility must rest with him as well as with you you cannot 
it seems to me accept responsibility for mistakes as admirable as 
that may be and thereby absolve the president of any 
responsibility 
there is no rebuttal mcfarlane replied 
mcfarlane who has testified at length before the grand jury 
empaneled by independent counsel lawrence e walsh attempted 
suicide last year by swallowing 30 to 40 valium tablets one day 
before his scheduled testimony before a presidential commission 
that also investigated the irancontra affair 
walsh was not permitted to use mcfarlanes testimony before the 
irancontra panel as evidence in his case since mcfarlane 
testified before the congressional committee under a grant of 
limited immunity 
after resigning as national security adviser on dec 4 1985 
mcfarlane was asked the following may to lead a secret mission to 
tehran to open contact with socalled moderate iranians thought to 
have influence with lebanese radicals holding several kidnapped 
americans 
with north as a member of the party the group traveled aboard 
an aircraft carrying spare parts for hawk missiles previously 
shipped to iran by israel 
the cake and the bible signed by president reagan which 
mcfarlane also carried as gifts were to become celebrated symbols 
of the affair

koko the cover girl gorilla who 
communicates through sign language may be bred with colossus 
reputed to be the largest lowland gorilla in captivity a zoo 
official said friday 
koko whose ability to use sign language and doting upon a pet 
kitten landed her on the cover of national geographic magazine has 
signed to her keepers that she wants to have a baby said penny 
patterson director of the gorilla foundation at woodside calif 
where the ape lives 
she may get that chance with the aptly named 600pound colossus 
who is moving sunday from new hampshire to florida said pat quinn 
president and director of the zoo near this panhandle city 
an initial attempt at breeding may be through artificial 
insemination but quinn said he hoped colossus eventually would be 
able to mate naturally with koko and other females 
semen will be obtained from colossus just before he is flown in 
a chartered dc3 from bensons animal park in hudson nh to 
nearby pensacola and then trucked to the zoo quinn said 
we are hoping to obtain some of that for use with koko because 
she is very anxious to become a mother said ms patterson 
kokos original pet kitten which she named all ball because the 
manx cat had no tail was hit by a truck and killed after the 
national geographic story but koko was given a replacement she 
named smokey now fullgrown 
koko 16 and a male gorilla michael communicate with sign 
language to express their feelings ask for food and certain 
teachers and inquire about other animals 
colossus sperm may be used because captive gorillas sometimes 
develop incest taboos against cage mates so michael would be 
unsuitable ms patterson said also colossus was captured in the 
wild as an infant 20 years ago and isnt inbred with zoo gorillas 
we hope to socialize him so he will breed naturally with 
females quinn said 
colossus has never seen another gorilla outside his original 
family the socialization process would start by letting colossus 
see smell and touch a male chipanzee said quinn then he would be 
introduced to another bachelor male gorilla or a nonproductive 
female before trying to mate him 
quinn said he is working closely with lester fisher director of 
chicagos lincoln park zoo and chairman of the gorilla species 
survival plan for the american association of zoos and aquariums 
fisher a veterinarian said nothing definite has been decided 
on breeding yet but that he was happy to see colossus remain 
within the zoological community because he is the first gorilla in 
a long time to go on the auction block he would provide a new gene 
pool because he was born in the wild 
the plan is designed to develop a selfsustaining captive 
breeding program in north america because the number of animals in 
the wild are dwindling and threatened by encroaching civilization 
after his arrival sunday night colossus will be kept isolated 
for several days with a comingout news conference scheduled for 
friday quinn said

sixtythree percent of social security 
managers said in an internal survey that they were uncomfortable 
with deep staff cuts and most said staff morale was poor a union 
reported friday 
kenneth t blaylock president of the american federation of 
government employees released what he called a bootleg copy of the 
survey and said dorcas hardy got more than she bargained for in 
this survey 
he said it backs up union complaints to congress about the 
reagan administrations cuts in social securitys staff the 
agency which had nearly 80000 workers in 1984 is now down to 
69345 with 6000 more jobs slated for elimination by 1990 
phil gambino a spokesman for the social security 
administration confirmed that commissioner dorcas hardy ordered 
the survey of her managers last august and it showed there is 
quite a bit of concern and anxiety 
were aware there are a lot of anxieties and were going to 
act on that said gambino hardy plans to start meeting in april 
with managers in each of social securitys 10 regions to discuss 
their concerns 
at the same time gambino said the performance of our 
employees is excellent and client satisfaction has never been 
higher a recent check by the general accounting office indicated 
that most people are pleased with the service they get from social 
security 
according to afge the survey was distributed to all 9000 
social security supervisors grades 14 or below and more than 4700 
responded 
asked if they were comfortable with the way the agency was 
managing staff cuts 672 percent said they were not 142 percent 
said they were comfortable and 185 percent were undecided 
asked to judge employee morale 535 percent said it was poor or 
extremely poor fiftyfive percent said they would not recommend 
social security to friends as a good place to work 
the union said some of the responses to the survey corroborated 
afges charges that social security encourages cheating to meet 
productivity deadlines 
it quoted one anonymous supervisor as writing on the 
questionnaire everything looks great on paper but the reality 
is ssa is going to pot 
afge represents 60000 social security workers 
blaylock said the survey was a strong testimonial for an 
independent social security administration run by competent career 
federal employees instead of political appointees who know little 
or nothing of what ssa is all about

jesse jackson campaigned across his native 
state on the eve of its democratic presidential caucus stressing 
that his candidacy stands for blacks and whites 
jackson emphasized issues he said blacks and whites alike 
believe in raising the minimum wage cleaning toxic waste dumps 
reducing the flow of drugs into the country subsidizing day care 
and saving the family farm 
its not so much black versus white as it is barracudas eating 
us small fish they dont eat fish by color they eat fish by size 
what makes south carolina one today we meet not in 
confrontation we meet at the plant gate we meet at the toxic 
waste dump we meet on the corner where drugs are being 
distributed and killing the people 
the candidate said a new challenge for the new south is to 
find common ground where the people can come together 
the south carolina education association conference at a 
columbia motel was at a standstill as teachers waited in the halls 
and entrances for more than an hour to see jackson the cooks and 
maids stopped working to join the greeting line when the greenville 
native arrived 
when he arrived they screamed cried reached out to shake his 
hand or just tried to touch him 
im delighted to be home again jackson said as he stood on 
a chair in an impromptu speech 
you taught me said the candidate who was educated through 
high school in greenville you can have somebody in the white 
house that you taught send me 
jackson told crowds friday that half of the states have held 
primaries or caucuses and he has finished first or second in all 
but a few of them 
south carolina and louisiana were the only states jackson won in 
1984 most political experts and campaign officials concede that 
jackson should win the lions share of 44 delegates at stake 
saturday 
a survey of democratic chairmen and vice chairmen indicated 
jackson is the frontrunner with gore a distant second 
twentyfive said jackson was likely to win their counties five 
indicated they thought gore would win their counties two said rep 
richard gephardt might win and none predicted dukakis or sen paul

when he became president reagans national 
security adviser in october 1983 robert c mcfarlane epitomized 
the success that can come from a combination of luck hard work 
smarts and having the right mentors 
as the son of a texas congressman a us naval academy 
graduate career marine officer and protege of former secretaries 
of state henry kissinger and alexander haig mcfarlane had reached 
the pinnacle of power 
he mediated fights between the state and defense departments at 
home and between israel and its neighbors abroad helped salvage 
the mx nuclear missile and put out fires for the administration on 
capitol hill 
more than anyone else in this administration bud mcfarlane is 
the guy who has the confidence of members of congress rep les 
aspin dwis and chairman of the house armed service committee 
said at the time 
he had gotten the job despite opposition from conservative 
ideologues who wanted it to go to former un ambassador jeane 
kirkpatrick and no sooner did mcfarlane get the job than it began 
to unravel 
within a week 241 us marines were killed in beirut and 
mcfarlane lost his first major dispute as national security chief 
reagan sided with defense secretary caspar w weinberger to pull 
out the marines rather than retaliate militarily as mcfarlane and 
secretary of state george p shultz urged 
it only got worse disputes between mcfarlane and new white 
house chief of staff donald t regan erupted eventually leading to 
mcfarlanes resignation in december 1985 
while citing personal reasons and the desire to spend more time 
with his family as his reasons for resigning mcfarlane later told 
interviewers that white house infighting made the job no longer 
fun and professional and he complained that reagan did not have 
a great interest in foreign affairs 
then there was irancontra a scheme through which the 
administration sold arms to iran and used the proceeds to finance 
nicaraguan rebels in violation of a congressional prohibition on 
aiding them militarily 
although no one knew at the time mcfarlane was a central player 
in those events both before and after he left the white house 
on friday mcfarlane 51 agreed to plead guilty to four 
misdemeanor charges of withholding information from congress on the 
administrations secret help to the nicaraguan contras 
his plea was an appropriate epilogue to two years of drama that 
included a secret flight to tehran in may 1986 with plane load of 
missile parts to be swapped for us hostages a suicide attempt 
and sorrowful confessions that he bore the brunt of the blame for 
the irancontra affair 
what really drove me to despair was a sense of having failed 
the country mcfarlane told the new york times upon his release 
from the hospital after taking a overdose of the tranquilizer 
valium in february 1987 
if i had stayed at the white house im sure i could have 
stopped things from getting worse he said 
two months later in televised hearings mcfarlane told inquiring 
congressmen and the nation how i regret and continue to regret 
the mistakes i have made 
because of his suicide attempt just two months earlier 
congressmen did not bore in on mcfarlane as much as they did some 
other witnesses maintaining a stoic presence mcfarlane complained 
of being treated like a fragile flower and told his 
questioners shoot your best shot 
while his testimony was viewed as being fuzzy on the details he 
became a model for the psychotherapy community 
psychologist joyce brothers praised him as a man who though 
there was nothing left for him is very heroic on the stand 
hes shown a great deal of ego strength after being 
through the worst that life has to offer near death ms 
brothers said people can see someone else who has been through 
the valley and come out safely on the other side 
mcfarlane also has been a model as an achiever in his earlier 
secondary posts after graduating from the naval academy in 1959 
he began a 20year marine corps career that included stints at 
strategy schools and war colleges here and abroad between tours of 
combat duty in vietnam 
while still a marine he was brought into the white house as a 
military and legislative aide to president nixon switching to then 
national security adviser henry kissingers staff and remaining 
there when brent scowcroft succeeded kissinger under president ford 
after president carters election the marine corps sent 
mcfarlane to okinawa unhappy with the assignment he resigned in 
1979 with the rank of lieutenant colonel and took a staff job with 
the senate armed services committee working primarily for sen 
john tower of texas then the panels ranking republican and later 
its chairman 
with reagans election in 1980 secretary of haig as secretary 
of state hired mcfarlane as his military counselor when reagan in 
1982 named undersecretary of state william p clark as his national 
security adviser mcfarlane moved back to the white house as 
clarks deputy assistant 
twentyone months later clark decided he would rather be 
interior secretary and mcfarlane was elevated to the top national 
security job

president reagan on friday renewed his threat 
to veto trade legislation under consideration by a housesenate 
conference committee if it is anticonsumer antijobs and 
antigrowth 
speaking to representatives of a trade coalition gathered in the 
auditorium of the old executive office building reagan said i 
would note that on tuesday those who had predicted that 
protectionism would be embraced in the south were proven wrong 
reagan was referring to election returns on super tuesday in 
which rep richard gephardt dmo a proponent of tough trade 
sanctions against other nations managed to win only one of 20 
states his homestate of missouri 
too many backers of the trade bill talk about making america 
more competitive but support provisions that would bench some of 
the best competitors on our team the president said they talk 
about saving jobs but they want provisions that have the potential 
to destroy thousands if not millions of american jobs 
reagan said that any trade bill passed by congress should not 
violate accords the united states has signed in the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
he also said the provisions of any such legislation should not 
provoke retaliation against our bombing export business 
bringing a roar of laughter from the audience reagan quickly 
corrected himself saying wait a minute our booming export 
business

alaska democrats gave jesse jackson a 
narrow victory over massachusetts gov michael dukakis in a 
precinct caucus preference poll announced friday 
but it was the large bloc of uncommitted delegates that 
generated the most interest among the presidential campaigners 
with about 90 percent of alaskas 442 precincts reporting 
jackson claimed 872 delegates or 349 percent of the total to 
dukakis 769 delegates or 31 percent a close third were the 768 
delegates or 308 percent who remained uncommitted 
the winners will attend 27 district caucuses on april 910 
selecting 390 delegates to attend the state convention in fairbanks 
on may 1315 
the 12 delegates emerging from the state convention will attend 
the democratic national convention in atlanta in july and will be 
bound to a specific candidate at least for the first ballot in 
atlanta the state also will have five super delegates the 
governor and four members of the democratic national committee 
commenting on the results of the preference poll conducted 
among delegates selected at the precinct caucuses thursday night 
bob speed executive director of the alaska democratic party said 
that huge uncommitted figure represents a lot of people who want 
to support a democratic candidate but who havent made up their 
minds 
he added the strong showing by the jackson and dukakis people 
shows the level of their campaigns it was the lack of organization 
by the other candidates rather than apathy on the part of the 
delegates that made them go uncommitted 
tennessee sen albert gore jr finished far back with 47 
delegates or about 2 percent followed by illinois sen paul simon 
with 18 delegates and missouri congressman dick gephardt who had 
16 delegates less than 1 percent each 
russ meekins state chairman of the dukakis campaign said 
organizers will be trying to sway the uncommitted delegates before 
next months district caucuses 
as of now counting the gore simon and gephardt supporters as 
uncommitted for purposes of selecting national delegates the 
breakdown is five for jackson three for dukakis and four 
uncommitted 
henry lancaster statewide coordinator for the jackson campaign 
said with blacks comprising just 3 percent of alaskas population 
his candidates appeal was based on the antidrug and economic 
issues hes been voicing around the nation 
this state has a lot of workingclass people whove come from 
the south the midwest and the northwest lancaster said in 
down times people are looking for solutions and this is a down 
time 
that reference was to the collapse of alaskas oilfired 
economy about 85 percent of the states budget is supported by oil 
revenues and world oil prices are less than half what they were 
three years ago 
the democrats chose 2496 delegates in caucuses around the state 
thursday night the caucuses were open to any registered democrat 
and anyone who wished to register at the door

a former officer who was the principal witness in a 
series of miami police corruption trials was sentenced friday to 10 
years in prison for his part in a cocaine ripoff ring 
rodolfo arias 32 had pleaded guilty to tax fraud and 
conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute 
his testimony has opened many cans of worms us district 
judge kenneth ryskamp said of arias who helped convict three 
officers of drugrelated corruption in the socalled miami river 
cops trials in recent months 
the case was named after the officers most highly publicized 
theft a 1985 raid on a smuggling boat on the miami river in which 
three drug guards drowned after jumping into the water the 
officers stole millions of dollars in cocaine for resale 
arias cooperation was also instrumental in obtaining a dozen 
guilty pleas before the trials as well as the suspension or 
investigation of nearly 100 miami officers whose names surfaced 
during the investigation 
when this plea agreement was signed we never realized what 
that cooperation will be there will be more indictments yet to 
come said special federal prosecutor russell killinger 
arias could have received up to 20 years but ryskamp honored 
the governments recommendation for a 10year maximum 
arias will receive credit for time spent in the federal witness 
protection program and could be free in five years said his 
attorney eugene sauls 
this court has ambivalent feelings about this case said the 
judge acknowledging arias cooperation but adding that the former 
officers crimes cry out for retribution 
another officer who cooperated with prosecutors received a 
15year sentence friday carlos pedrera 27 had pleaded guilty to 
the same counts 
arias and pedrera were among a large group of officers the 
police department was forced to hire quickly after the mariel 
boatlift and liberty city riots in the early 1980s 
many of the officers worked the midnight shift and arias 
testified that his increasingly corrupt group turned miamis 
streets into its private crime kingdom 
the officers routinely took small quantities of drugs and cash 
from suspects they detained then expanded into stealing drugs 
directly from dealers

loss were disclosed during testimony in a federal court hearing on 
whether eastern should be allowed to go ahead with plans to lease 
26 eastern jets to orion air a north carolina cargo carrier 
the air line pilots association is asking the us court of 
appeals to stop the easternorion deal claiming it is designed to 
circumvent the pilots labor contract eastern has said it wants 
orion to fly the planes with nonunion pilots in case of a strike 
at eastern 
in an attempt to show that eastern is planning to lease only 
spare aircraft to orion the miamibased carrier produced internal 
documents showing a sharp increase in the number of pilots who have 
left the company 
the departures and a high rate of sick leave by pilots at the 
airline are leaving aircraft sitting idle testified william r 
croucher easterns director of planning and administration 
eastern submitted to the court internal documents showing that 
500 pilots left the company for various reasons in 1987 a number 
that croucher said is nearly 10 times the historical average pilot 
attrition rate at the airline 
he said so far this year 259 eastern pilots have either left 
the company or have given notice to depart within 90 days the 
airline anticipates losing a total of 600 pilots this year 
according to croucher 
the pilots union has said previously that the labor turmoil at 
eastern and a push by management to seek labor concessions has 
caused hundreds of pilots to seek early retirement or quit to join 
other airlines even though they are sacrificing their seniority 
the figures provided by eastern in court friday however are 
the first details as to how serious the pilot drain has become at 
the airline which has about 4000 pilots croucher said the 
airline is hiring about 30 pilots a week but that because of long 
training periods the number is inadequate to make up for the 
losses 
croucher said the pilot shortage has forced eastern to cancel 
several thousand flying hours that had previously been scheduled 
for march and april and to cut back total planned flying hours for 
the rest of the year 
during three days last month feb 26 through feb 28 eastern 
canceled a total of 135 singlepoint flights because no cockpit 
crews were available 
judge barrington d parker who is hearing the orioneastern 
case continued the matter until next monday after granting a 
pilots union request for internal eastern documents on various 
eastern aircraft including those that are to be leased to orion 
eastern had refused to turn over the documents claiming that 
they could be used by the pilots union to gain information about 
easterns plans in event of a strike parker directed that the 
documents be made available only to the unions three lawyers and 
two union members and that they not be copied

republican sen bob dole scrambling to salvage 
his presidential campaign challenged gop frontrunner george bush 
on friday to show up for a live 30minute television show dole has 
purchased for saturday night 
earlier friday as he campaigned around illinois dole vowed to 
stay in the race at least through the states primary on tuesday 
though he said he would reassess his chances after that 
dole who pulled most of his tv ads off the air in illinois 
earlier this week said he had bought television time on a chicago 
station and would broadcast live from a small college in galesburg 
ill 
he challenged vice president bush to join him there for a debate 
at knox college which was the site of one of the famous 
lincolndouglas debates 
bush has declined doles repeated challenges to a oneonone 
debate but dole said in any event ill be there to discuss the 
issues i dare george bush to have a debate with bob dole 
bush is tentatively scheduled to be in galesburg saturday night 
to attend a gop dinner 
earlier in the day dole had joked with reporters that he might 
have a cardboard cutout of bush on the stage if the vice president 
wouldnt show up in person 
were hanging by our fingernails dole said at an airport 
news conference in moline we need to somehow capture the 
attention of the illinois voters 
dole campaigning across central and western illinois denied 
reports that he and his aides had discussed the possibility of 
pulling out of the race but he conceded there had been some 
discussion of another less drastic option 
there was some talk about maybe just canceling a couple of 
days events to heighten whatever were going to do later dole 
said at a stop in bloomington where he spoke to illinois farm 
bureau leaders 
dole said his deep staff cutbacks were just good management 
made to save money and because most of the workers were no longer 
needed after super tuesday 
campaign aides said dole also was buying television time to air 
ads on sunday 
throughout the day dole made it clear that his task in 
illinois if he is to overtake bush is to draw the vice president 
out on issues and to separate him from the good will that many 
republicans feel for president reagan 
im sort of running against the ghost of ronald reagn the 
senator said 
in addition dole said that bushs victories on tuesday had 
given him a big boost in polls 
what we need to do is slow down this super tuesday momentum 
dole said 
one effort by dole is to continue to press bush to participate 
in oneonone debates even though the vice president has declined 
if we could just discuss the issues in one state i will 
win dole said its pretty hard to slow down a freight train 
if you dont talk about the issues 
one issue on which he has pressed bush is the vice presidents 
involvement in the irancontra affair a subject that was back in 
the news friday as former national security adviser robert c 
mcfarlane agreed to plead guilty to four misdemeanor charges that 
he withheld information from congress 
it is going to revive that whole issue again and ive said 
from the start that its not going to go away thats why it should 
be addressed dole said bush is going to have all these things 
happening through the summer he said 
one uncertain element in doles strategy is how illinois voters 
will react to the possibility that a bush victory in their state 
could effectively end the gop nominating race dole maintains there 
are many voters who have yet to decide which candidate they will 
back 
i know there are a lot of people probably 20 percent who are 
just now beginning to focus on who the candidates are said dole 
its like lastminute christmas shoppers some people dont even 
know what theyre going to buy until the last 24 hours and then 
they buy whatever is left we dont want that to happen 
asked whether he would abandon the race if he loses next week 
dole said we will reassess after illinois i am going to be very 
realistic about this

the government and bell helicopter textron 
signed agreements friday under which the fort worth texas company 
will pay 88 million to settle claims that it overcharged for 
military helicopter spare parts 
the settlement disclosed earlier in the week is considered one 
of the largest ever in a defense contracting case 
it resulted from inaccurate cost accounting information bell 
gave the government from october 1982 to october 1985 the justice 
department said in a statement 
the justice departments civil division and the army each signed 
separate agreements with the company 
during the course of the investigation bell consistently 
maintained that there was no wrongdoing and the us attorneys 
office in fort worth said it notified bell on friday that the 
office has declined criminal prosecution in the case 
that effectively closes our case assistant us attorney 
ron eddins said in fort worth we did that because of all of the 
factors that were disclosed during the investigation their coming 
forward and agreeing to work things out with the pentagon was a 
part of it too 
eddins said the justice departments civil fraud division has 
also issued an agreement with them that accepts the payment and the 
administrative agreement to settle the civil issue the case is 
closed there too 
bell president lm horner said the settlement which he 
described as encompassing issues well beyond those which were 
investigated cleans the slate and will allow for the normalization 
of relations between bell and the army 
under the settlement bell will pay the government 69 million 
within the next 30 days the government will also have its choice 
of about 11 million in spare parts inventory additional 
provisions of the agreement make it worth somewhere in the 
neighborhood of 88 million the pentagons chief spokesman dan 
howard has said 
bell will forgo claims to about 6 million worth of interest on 
contract progress payments withheld by the army and about 15 
million in legal fees offsetting that will be a 11 million 
payment by the army to bell to cover a separate contract that got 
sidelined in the dispute 
maj phil soucy an army spokesman has said most of the 
overcharges came as a result of an accounting system used in 
handling army contracts bell switched to a computerized accounting 
and inventory system that had the effect among other things of 
accelerating the companys requests for army progress payments for 
work performed 
bell agreed to implement a new accounting system that met the 
armys approval in october 1985

wests only active launcher 
the rocket blasted off at 728 pm from this jungle space 
center on the northern coast of south america arianes 21st 
launching and the first of eight planned for this year 
andre payet chief of mission said no technical problems were 
reported and weather conditions were good for the launch of the 
rocket owned by the european space agency 
the launch was first scheduled for december but was delayed for 
extra tests after anomalies were detected in the oxygen and liquid 
hydrogen thirdstage engine 
we preferred to take the time to understand the problem 
said frederic dallest president of arianespace esas commercial 
arm 
thirdstage engine failure was the cause of three of arianes 
four failed launches in september 1982 september 1985 and may 
1986 the last failure the 18th launch left the rocket grounded 
for more than a year 
the other failed launch occurred in may 1980 because of a 
problem with the firststage engine 
ariane produced a perfect 20th launch nov 21 1987 but the 
west german television satellite it placed into orbit developed 
problems with its solar panels and is not fully operational 
the 21st launch will thrust into orbit the american gte spacenet 
corps fifth satellite spacenet iii rgeostar r01 the satellite 
is aimed at increasing the companys wideranging 
telecommunications services in the united states and help set up a 
system of satellite communication with mobile units such as trucks 
cars and trains 
two transponders on spacenet iii purchased by the associated 
press are to provide the new yorkbased news cooperative with 
domestic satellite delivery services over the next 10 years a 
satellite being used is nearing the end of its operational service 
the french telecom ic the third in a series of satellites owned 
by france telecom the stateowned telecommunications system is 
used for telephones radio and television transmissions as well as 
military communications 
the new satellite is to replace telecom 1b which broke down 
jan 15 
with the us space shuttle grounded and titan 4 and delta 
rockets not yet competitive ariane remains the only active 
launcher for commercial satellites in the west however 
arianespace is watching the return of the americans to the 
lucrative space market as well as competition from the soviet 
union china and japan 
including fridays payload arianespace has 43 satellites on its 
order books worth 236 billion according to the company 
to keep up with the orders the kourou space center has made two 
launch pads available 
arianes 21st launch is to be the first of eight this year with 
nine launches each planned for 1989 and 1990 dallest said earlier

the environmental protection agency said 
friday it had approved field tests in wisconsin for a genetically 
engineered bacterium designed to improve the ability of alfalfa to 
use nitrogen in the air as a fertilizer 
the bacterium rhizobium meliloti grows naturally on alfalfa 
roots and mutant forms have been used to enhance plant growth in 
the past 
using the techniques of recombinant dna biotechnica inc of 
cambridge mass has reinserted the genes responsible for nitrogen 
use nitrogen fixation back into the organism giving it two 
copies of the genes 
lab and greenhouse tests indicate this will enhance alfalfa 
yield according to an epa announcement when the company applied 
for permission to test 13 months ago 
epa has an active regulatory program for genetically engineered 
pesticides but this bacterium is not a pesticide it is the first 
genetic engineering case under epas authority to regulate new 
chemicals and the test will precede under approval of the 
companys premanufacture notice for a new chemical

republican bob dole tried to rescue a presidential candidacy 
that was hanging by our fingernails on friday and the 
democratic presidential race left behind gary hart who 
acknowledged the people have decided against him 
democrat jesse jackson continued to roll with a narrow victory 
over michael dukakis in alaskas precinct caucuses he looked for 
further encouragement in saturdays caucuses in south carolina his 
native state and in tuesdays primary in illinois his adopted 
state 
the democratic sideshow in south carolina aside the 
presidential campaign in both parties focused on illinois its 
primary posed an opportunity for george bush to slam the door on 
doles presidential hopes and could present the democrats with a 
clearer race or a more muddled one 
trailing bush badly in delegates and in polls in that state 
dole pulled more than 200000 in television ads off the air and 
dismissed more than half his campaign staff 
were hanging by our fingernails he said in moline we 
need to somehow capture the attention of the illinois voters 
dole bought a half hour of live television time on a chicago 
station for saturday night and said i dare george bush to have a 
debate 
he pointed to the plea to irancontra charges friday by former 
white house aide robert c mcfarlane and said the irancontra issue 
wont go away for bush 
dole said his campaign had between 1 million and 2 million on 
hand but he was reeling from his 17state collapse on super 
tuesday when bush won 16 of those states and took a giant step 
toward the nomination 
what we need is to slow down this super tuesday momentum 
dole said 
we will reassess after illinois he added i am going to 
be very realistic about this 
the only other republican left in the race following jack 
kemps withdrawal a day earlier was pat robertson he campaigned 
in peoria ill and vowed im in it until new orleans where 
the republicans hold their convention 
bush campaigned with illinois gov james r thompson at his 
side telling farm leaders he hoped to win as big in the land of 
lincoln as i did in the land of cotton 
he said he would decline a oneonone confrontation with dole 
recalling he tried that with ronald reagan in 1980 a meeting that 
probably cost bush the nomination 
i may be older but im a lot smarter now too he said 
hart ended his democratic campaign for a second time flanked by 
family members at a denver announcement 
i got a fair hearing and the people have decided and now i 
should not go forward he declared 
harts exit contained only a trace of the defiance that marked 
his initial departure last may 
once the prohibitive frontrunner for his partys nomination 
hart dropped out the first time amid disclosures of his 
relationship with miami model donna rice he returned to the race 
in december but he failed to win a single delegate and never 
reached doubledigit percentages in the primaries 
sen albert gore jr continued his attacks on dukakis saying 
the massachusetts governors lack of experience in foreign policy 
means hed be a president who needs onthejob training 
his complete lack of experience in foreign policy is i think 
a major issue at a time when the next president must be prepared to 
seize the opportunities for a new relationship with the soviets 
gore said 
dukakis said he hopes to get a share of illinois delegates and 
demonstrate i can appeal to people all over the country 
dukakis began airing a new commercial that spoke to the 
possibility of a brokered convention being talked up by paul 
simons campaign some people would like to turn back the clock 
to go back to the days when the voters didnt really pick their 
presidential nominee they say you must turn over that power to 
them to use at a brokered convention the narrator intones 
new york gov mario cuomo also chimed in saying democrats 
should get behind the candidate with the most delegates at the end 
of the primaries even if he doesnt have a majority 
if mike dukakis has 41 percent get everybody together in a 
room and say jesse gore gephardt you came close but mikes 
the candidate cuomo said lets pick the guy whos ahead 
after california 
democrat richard gephardt campaigned in chicago and complained 
about two rivals who hit him with a barrage of negative television 
ads in the south 
i feel like dukakis and gore have mugged me in an alley he 
said they are borrowing my rhetoric but they dont have any 
substance behind it 
jackson claimed 35 percent of the vote in a nonbinding 
preference poll at thursday nights alaska caucuses dukakis was 
next with 31 percent 
campaigning in south carolina jackson urged blacks and whites 
to unite around him 
its not so much black versus white as it is barracudas eating 
us small fish jackson said they dont eat fish by color they 
eat fish by size

former presidential aide robert c mcfarlane 
pleaded guilty friday to misdemeanor charges that he misled 
congress by assuring lawmakers the reagan administration was not 
helping arm nicaraguan rebels during a ban on us military aid 
president reagans former national security adviser pleaded 
guilty to four counts of withholding information from congress when 
questioned about news reports that members of his staff 
particularly lt col oliver l north were helping to raise money 
and ship arms to the contra rebels 
mcfarlane who agreed to cooperate fully with independent 
counsel lawrence e walshs investigation could be sentenced to up 
to four years imprisonment and fined as much as 400000 for the 
guilty pleas he entered before us district judge aubrey e 
robinson jr 
robinson released mcfarlane on his own recognizance and did not 
schedule a sentencing date mcfarlane was subdued and spoke in a 
soft voice when responding to questions posed by the judge 
you understand that imprisonment could be consecutive 
robinson said referring to the option of making the four oneyear 
terms concurrent or consecutive 
i understand that mcfarlane said without showing any 
emotion 
the judge later asked do you know any reason i should not 
accept the plea 
no mcfarlane said 
mcfarlane played a major role in the irancontra affair even 
after he resigned as national security adviser in december 1985 
the following may he led a secret mission to tehran to open 
contact with socalled moderate iranians who were thought to hold 
influence with kidnappers of american hostages he brought with him 
a cake and a bible signed by president reagan 
mcfarlane attempted suicide in february 1987 by taking an 
overdose of a tranquilizer the day before he was scheduled to 
testify before a presidential commission investigating the affair 
president reagan leaving the white house friday afternoon for a 
helicopter trip to camp david md refused to comment on 
mcfarlanes plea 
its in the court he shouted to reporters 
north who is expected to be indicted for his role in the 
irancontra affair was asked by cbs news about mcfarlane i 
wouldnt comment about mr mcfarlane north said but as i 
think i told you once before this marine is never going to plead 
guilty to any charge and ill fight this or any other allegations 
of misconduct forever 
earlier in an impromptu news conference following the hearing 
walsh acknowledged that mcfarlane could have been charged with 
perjury a felony that carries a fiveyear sentence for each charge 
but walsh said he agreed to the misdemeanor plea because of the 
former national security advisers willingness to cooperate with 
walshs investigation and his undisguised expressions of remorse 
after the false testimony 
he tried to correct his testimony and actually imposed injury 
upon himself in a fit of depression walsh said of mcfarlanes 
suicide attempt 
walsh called mcfarlanes guilty plea a very important 
development in his 14month investigation in the coming weeks the 
investigation is expected to yield a round of indictments against 
north and others including rear adm john m poindexter who was 
mcfarlanes successor as national security adviser 
it furthers the work of the office of independent counsel 
because he has agreed to cooperate fully with our office in the 
pursuit of the remainder of our investigation walsh said 
mcfarlane told reporters i did indeed withhold information 
from the congress i believe strongly that throughout my actions 
were motivated by what i believed to be in the foreign policy 
interest of the united states 
after the irancontra affair unraveled in late 1986 mcfarlane 
said i believed profoundly that it was my personal obligation to 
testify voluntarily and fully to those bodies formally established 
to investigate this matter 
the charges involve statements that mcfarlane made in three 1985 
letters to house committees and in testimony before the house 
foreign affairs committee on dec 8 1986 when he denied knowing 
about solicitations of donations to the contras from an 
unidentified foreign country 
the charges involve assurances to congress that nsc staffers 
specifically north were not involved in private efforts to help 
the contras and that mcfarlane knew of no foreign donations to the 
rebels 
mcfarlane admitted withholding information from the house 
permanent select committee on intelligence in letters he wrote on 
sept 5 1985 and on oct 7 1985 in response to queries about 
reports that his staff was secretly helping the contras in 
violation of the 1984 boland amendments ban on direct or indirect 
military aid to the rebels 
in the oct 7 letter mcfarlane wrote that lieutenant colonel 
north did not use his influence to facilitate the movement of 
supplies to the resistance 
he further assured the panel in the letter that there was no 
official or unofficial relationship with any member of the nsc 
staff regarding fundraising for the nicaraguan democratic 
opposition 
this includes the alleged relationship with general 
singlaub mcfarlane said 
the letter was misleading the charge said because mcfarlane 
knew that north had used his influence to facilitate the movement 
of certain supplies to the contras and he knew that a member of 
the nsc staff had had contact with retired maj gen john k 
singlaub regarding fundraising for the contras 
in the sept 5 letter mcfarlane told the panel i can state 
with deep personal conviction that at no time did i or any member 
of the national security council staff violate the letter or the 
spirit of the law 
we did not solicit funds or other support for military or 
paramilitary activities either from americans or third parties 
he wrote 
he made a similar assurance in a sept 12 1985 letter to 
former rep michael barnes dmd who then headed the house 
foreign affairs subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs 
the fourth charge relates to dec 8 1986 testimony in which 
mcfarlane told the house foreign affairs committee that he was not 
aware of any third country or citizens of a foreign nation helping 
the contras 
the concrete character of that is beyond my ken mcfarlane 
told the committee 
the charge noted that mcfarlane was withholding the fact he was 
aware that citizens of the unidentified country had been donating 
millions of dollars to the contras mcfarlane also withheld the 
fact that he had provided a representative of the country with the 
number of a secret bank account where the funds could be deposited 
the charge said 
mcfarlane told the congressional irancontra committees that as 
early as may of 1984 he had met with the ambassador from what was 
called country 2 which later was learned to be bandar bin sultan 
of saudi arabia 
the ambassador offered to provide 1 million a month to sustain 
the contras at a time their money was running out mcfarlane told 
the panels he had not solicited the money but that it had been 
offered as a gift after he bemoaned the likelihood of the reagan 
administration winning additional contra support from congress

it was 50 years friday that the nazis 
annexed this country austrians honored the dead and demonstrated 
against president kurt waldheim who was made a silent spectator by 
his questionable wartime past 
conservative and socialist politicans emphasized that some 
austrians committed atrocities in the nazi era challenging the 
longheld view that the nation was a victim of the nazis huge 
crowds cheered adolf hitlers troops when they marched into his 
homeland march 11 1938 
a minute of silence drew little response friday on the streets 
of vienna and few people turned out in the early morning to watch 
political leaders lay wreaths at monuments to fallen soldiers and 
victims of the nazis 
shops businesses and schools were open 
about 300 protesters gathered outside the presidential offices 
in the imperial hofburg palace demanding that waldheim resign and 
dozens vowed to hold a threeday vigil waldheim has said he will 
not leave office until his term expires in 1992 
at a memorial ceremony in the hofburg foreign minister alois 
mock praised waldheim as having given austria prestige in the 
world in his decade as un secretarygeneral which ended in 
1982 
mock heads the conservative peoples party which backed 
waldheim for president in 1986 he was the only official to mention 
him directly at fridays ceremonies marking the annexation or 
anschluss 
waldheim was forced to cancel a speech at the ceremony because 
of unresolved questions about whether he committed war crimes while 
serving as a german army lieutanant in the balkans in 194245 some 
prominent austrians had said they would not attend if he spoke 
franz vranitzky the socialist chancellor told a special 
cabinet session austrians must recognize the fact of historical 
guilt and draw lessons from the past failures of society 
he dismissed the idea that austria was just a victim of the 
nazis 
many austrians unwillingly donned german uniforms he said but 
others did not see a shameful coercion in this but a simple test 
of strength in which for the most varied reasons they fulfilled 
their assigned duties 
addressing about 900 students later he urged young austrians 
not to make blanket accusations against an older generation or to 
reproach them after the fact with moral mistakes blindness 
bias and a lack of will to defend themselves 
he said one of the terrible aspects of nazism was that it arose 
in countries that regarded themselves as cradles of culture and 
guarantors of western traditions 
six of the seven parliamentary deputies of the small greens 
party walked out as soon as waldheim entered a special session of 
parliament the greens invited austrians to join them in marking 
the anniversary at the site of a former concentration camp 
in a leaflet they said they boycotted the parliamentary 
ceremony because waldheim was there 
on this particular day the presence of a guest who like 
hundreds of thousands of others only did his duty is not 
representative of the austria we want to remember the leaflet 
said 
the flier was referring to waldheims repeated declarations that 
he was only doing his duty during the war 
waldheim kept his war past a secret until march 1986 when it 
surfaced during his presidential campaign a panel of historians 
concluded last month that waldheim was in close proximity to nazi 
war crimes but did nothing to prevent them 
the report left open the question of waldheims guilt or 
innocence in atrocities and waldheim has always denied wrongdoing 
but he has come under increased pressure to resign 
dozens of antiwaldheim protesters chanted we do not accept 
waldheim resistance is our duty as survivors of nazi 
concentration camps and resistance fighters met on the square where 
the feared gestapo had its vienna headquarters 
speaking in front of a monument to the victims of nazism the 
socialist minister of social affairs alfred dallinger stressed 
that not only those who can be clearly identified as perpetrators 
were guilty 
guilt was also shared by the many who allowed what was carried 
out by others those who ran along who concurred who adapted 
themselves or looked away he said to loud applause

the new york post will add some panache to its 
bluecollar image built on sex and crime the tabloids new 
publisher promised friday 
we dont want to emasculate the new york post peter o 
price told the city club a civic group but he added our 
challenge is to make the new york post noticed for the right 
reasons and not for the wrong reasons 
the improved post he said will aim for depth in its writing a 
manhattan focus an even beefier sports section and more positive 
stories about education and race relations it might also launch a 
sunday edition he said 
the post the nations oldest continuously published daily 
newspaper officially became the property of developer peter 
kalikow on monday 
australianborn newspaper baron rupert murdoch who had owned it 
since 1976 sold the moneylosing tabloid to comply with federal 
regulations barring ownership of a tv station and a newspaper in 
the same city murdoch owns wnyw 
murdochs post was loud lively and controversial his british 
tabloid style relied heavily upon sex crime and violence price 
said many advertisers refused to place ads in the newspaper 
which they considered out of step with the image they were trying 
to portray 
price said the emphasis on what some regard as terribly lurid 
things is perhaps not so bad as people may think 
the pulse of journalism in the new york post is that sense of 
the city that savvy provocative bold quality thats very often 
talked about pejoratively because of rupert murdoch he said 
it very often gets people upset but it certainly does not go 
unnoticed our challenge is to make the new york post noticed for 
the right reasons and not for the wrong reasons 
kalikow paid 376 million for the paper which has been losing 
money and circulation for years it was founded in 1801 by 
alexander hamilton 
kalikow acquired the post only after the papers 10 unions 
agreed to a 22 million package of concessions including a 
lastminute gift of 3 million from murdoch

the canadian mortgage and housing corp has 
refused to revise building codes that have effectively barred 
american manufactured plywood from being used in canada the 
commerce department said friday 
a change in the canadian building codes is a key part of the 
plywood provisions in the proposed uscanada free trade agreement 
and rep ron wyden dore said that congress will have to get 
tough with the canadians in writing provisions to implement the 
agreement 
rep don bonker dwash said he was disappointed in the 
canadian decision and that while he thought the overall free trade 
agreement was a excellent package on this provision our 
negotiators got taken to the cleaners 
claire buchanan a commerce department spokeswoman declined 
comment but said the decision was under review 
the reagan administration had linked the elimination of plywood 
tariffs on both sides of the border to a revision in construction 
regulations by the cmhc a governmentcontrolled mortgage authority 
canadians insist american plywood is not sturdy enough to 
withstand the harsh climate of canada a claim officials of the 
american plywood industry say is unfounded 
rep peter defazio dore called the canadian refusal 
protectionism plain and simple 
if the administration gives into this they are just 
confirming it will be oneway free trade and that will be a 
disaster for the northwest plywood industry defazio said 
while construction sponsored by chmc accounts for only 10 
percent of canadas construction plywood market administration 
officials had hoped it would be a foot in the door for american 
plywood manufacturers and that changes would eventually be made in 
other building codes that have restricted us imports 
the door got slammed today wyden said this represents a 
major inequity in the free trade agreement and it is just more 
fodder for our position that we need tough enabling legislation 
oregon is the top plywood producing state in the nation 
wyden defazio and other northwest congressmen at a house 
subcommittee hearing earlier this week had warned that the free 
trade agreement would do little to open the canadian market to 
americanmaufactured plywood while at the same time it would give 
canadian plywood manufactuers unrestricted access to american 
markets 
the agreement calls for the total elimination of the 20 percent 
us tariff on canadian plywood and the 15 percent canadian tariff 
on us plywood over 10 years 
wyden and others have suggested that a provision be inserted in 
the treatys implementing language that would call for a review of 
american access to the canadian market before us tariffs are 
totally eliminated 
it looks like thats the way we will have to go wyden said

regiment bore the flagdraped coffin from the red and white jet of 
the queens flight 
the 39yearold heir to the throne was praised for helping save 
the life of another skier in his party but called foolhardy for 
skiing perilous slopes off the main trails of the klosters resort 
a private funeral service in devon was being arranged for 
lindsay but no date was announced independent television news 
reported that lindsay an avid cricket player had said he wanted 
his ashes to be scattered on the cricket ground in his home town of

expects a baby in may he was a former aide to queen elizabeth ii 
the princes mother 
in a handwritten statement read to reporters at the zurich 
airport after the royal party left charles said he and five 
companions were skiing at our risk and we all accepted that 
mountains have to be treated with the greatest respect and not 
treated lightly 
when the avalanche started with a trememdous roaring he and 
three others skied out of its path charles said 
then to my horror maj hugh lindsay and mrs 
palmertomkinson just failed to ski clear and were swept away in a 
whirling maelstrom as the whole mountainside seemed to hurtle past 
us to the valley below it was all over in a terrifying matter of 
seconds

snow with a shovel then with his hands both of her legs were 
broken and she is hospitalized in switzerland

herr sprecher acted with incredible speed and total 
professionalism the prince said he skied down as fast as 
possible having told the swiss policeman to radio for assistance 
sprecher located mrs palmertomkinson by a beeper on her body 
mr palmertomkinson and i skied down and just arrived as herr 
sprecher had reached mrs palmertomkinsons head the statement 
said he gave her mouthtomouth resuscitation and revived her 
he gave me the shovel to dig her out and i tried using my hands as 
well 
at this point i sat with mrs palmertomkinson while he 
sprecher quickly went to try and locate maj lindsay he found 
him about 15 yards above mrs palmertomkinson but tragically he 
had been killed outright during the fall 
mrs lindsay left the northolt base with her father she was 
carrying a bag apparently containing some of her husbands 
belongings that the duchess of york had given to her 
prince charles departed for windsor castle 20 miles away to 
see the queen and diana and the duchess of york went to kensington 
palace 
thereafter their movements for the weekend are private

months pregnant took a bad fall skiing 
that night the royal navy ship on which her husband prince 
andrew is serving lost a helicopter with two crewmen off portugal

the royal family to give up dangerous pursuits

consistently risked his life by going on increasingly deadly 
slopes 
charles is an ardent polo player who has taken many falls and

the police department rolled out its fabled 
battering ram after a twoyear absence to break into two fortified 
houses where crack allegedly was being sold 
civilrights lawyers who in 1986 forced police to garage the ram 
expressed satisfaction with the way the use of the armored vehicle 
was authorized under new guidelines but promised to keep a close 
watch on future deployments 
in a thursday night raid police used the vehicle with a 14foot 
metal pole to smash into a house in south central los angeles 
officers arrested five suspected drug dealers and seized drugs 
weapons and hundreds of dollars in cash 
police also raided four other houses without the ram in the same 
operation and took more than 25 people taken into custody 
on wednesday night police seized about 10000 worth of cocaine 
and about 500 in marijuana after ramming into another south 
central house where rock cocaine a crystalline form of the drug 
also called crack allegedly was being sold 
it was the most heavily fortified rock house weve seen in a 
couple of years said police spokesman cmdr william booth the 
house was reinforced with gun turrets metal bars and steel mesh 
he said 
police chief daryl gates who arrived after the thursday night 
raid pointed out the security measures used by the suspected drug 
dealers 
see how the bolts come all the way through gates said 
pointing to a steelbarred window theres no way you can pull 
those bars off you need a ram 
police said they had not used the ram in drug raids since 
february 1986 they wheeled it out in october when an armed man 
barricaded himself in a house but did not use it 
joan howarth an attorney for the american civil liberties union 
who had challenged the police departments use of the ram and 
forced its suspension said she was satisfied with the way it was 
used 
the judge told the lapd it could not use the ram until they 
did a surveillance of the locale to make sure there were no 
children present she said 
ms howarth had represented a woman whose house was the first 
target of the ram in 1985 the ram burst into a room only moments 
after the womans 5yearold son and two other children left it 
as a result of that case the state supreme court ruled that 
police must get a judges certification and a search warrant before 
using the ram a ruling the us supreme court upheld in october 
booth said obtaining judicial approval for use of the ram this 
week was not difficult 
we just dont run up and use it part of our tactics is to 
make a purchase just minutes before entering which enables 
undercover officers to look inside the house he said 
the ram has become a featured part of tv shows and films in 
last summers dragnet movie it was used to raid a suspected 
drug factory that turned out to be a dairy processing plant

the united nations issued a strong protest 
at the us decision friday to go ahead with closing the palestine 
liberation organizations observer mission 
the plo called it a stab in the back to the middle east 
peace process 
us ambassador herbert okun informed secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar of the justice department decision friday morning 
said un spokesman francois giuliani 
he said perez de cuellar strongly protested this violation of 
the headquarters agreement the 1947 treaty under which new york 
became home to the united nations 
the us state department also has said closing the plo mission 
would violate the pact and even americas closest allies have 
denounced the closure giuliani said perez de cuellars legal staff 
is studying several options he refused to elaborate but one 
possibility would be a legal challenge when the justice department 
seeks a court order closing the mission 
zehdi labib terzi the plos united nations observer said the 
plo would not challenge the justice department move in court 
we will not go into american court we will have nothing to do 
with american courts he told reporters after meeting with un 
legal advisers this is a matter between the united states and 
the united nations 
he said the plo would ask arab nations to request a meeting of 
the general assembly to consider whether un headquarters should 
remain in new york 
calling the us decision a stab in the back to mideast 
peace efforts terzi asked how could the united states really 
look like a peace broker when they want to throw out the 
representative of the palestinian people which is the principle 
party to the conflict 
the letter okun handed perez de cuellar said the justice 
department will initiate legal action to close the mission around 
march 21 it said the united states will not try to shut the 
offices until the litigation ends 
the mission is located in a fourstory townhouse the plo owns on 
manhattans fashionable upper east side 
the united nations released copies of okuns letter at a 
briefing 
the united states has refused binding arbitration of the 
dispute its worst with united nations 
at a special meeting last week the 159nation general assembly 
asked the world court in the hague to rule on whether the united 
states must agree to arbitration arguments before the court are 
set for april 11 
congress passed an antiterrorism law in december ordering the 
mission closed by march 21 
un officials and many diplomats regard the threat to the plo 
mission as a challenge to the independence of the united nations 
its a very serious development said norwegian ambassador 
tom eric vraalsen it goes beyond the plo because it violates the 
headquarters agreement 
several arab diplomats have suggested moving the general 
assembly to geneva if the mission is shuttered other diplomats say 
western nations probably would block such a step 
last year the state department closed down the only other plo 
office in the united states a washington information office in an 
attempt to head off legislation to close the un mission 
the united states and israel consider the plo a terrorist 
organization the united nations recognizes it as the only 
legitimate representative for palestinians

the pilot of the continental express commuter 
plane that crashed near durango colo in january killing nine 
people had traces of cocaine in his urine and evidence of the 
drugs byproducts in his blood the national transportation safety 
board said friday 
it appeared to be the first such accident involving us 
commercial airlines in which evidence of drug use by the pilots had 
been found aviation authorities said 
the board did not characterize the finding as a cause of the 
accident or indicate whether the pilot might have been impaired 
investigators have not determined whether the pilot or copilot was 
flying the airplane at the time of the accident 
nine people including both crew members perished in the jan 
19 crash the eight survivors were rescued after one of them peter 
schauer trudged 1 miles over a snowy mountainside to a house 
dr merrit m birky an ntsb chemist said the cocaine found in 
the pilots body is a small amount but he declined to comment 
further 
dr sorell l schwartz a pharmacology professor at georgetown 
university said that based on the amounts of the traces found the 
pilot was not under the influence of cocaine at the time of the 
accident 
schwartz also said it was unlikely that a habitual user of the 
drug would feel any lingering effects from the amounts of cocaine 
detected in the pilots body 
there can be impairments he said there can be impaired 
mental function but thats not usual 
the potential impairments could include a sense of wellbeing 
he said 
safety board spokesman alan pollock declined to characterize the 
findings 
this investigation continues and has quite a long way to 
go he said we dont expect to find a probable cause for a 
number of months 
he noted that investigators have not determined whether the 
pilot steven s silver 36 of denver was operating the 
twinengine turboprop aircraft when it plummeted into a mountainous 
part of southeastern colorado about 10 miles east of durango 
test results on the copilot ralph harvey 42 of denver are 
expected within the next two weeks pollock said 
the tests showed that silvers blood contained 22 nanograms per 
milliliter of benzoylecgonine a byproduct of the bodys breakdown 
of cocaine a nanogram is onebillionth of a gram 
silvers urine contained the same amount of cocaine and 1800 
nanograms per milliliter of the byproduct no other drugs were 
detected 
schwartz said cocaine leaves the body quite quickly with half 
of it being removed every 45 minutes he said that based on the 
information he could not estimate how much cocaine had been used 
or when 
silver was an employee of transcolorado airlines inc of 
colorado springs which leases planes and crews to rocky mountain 
airways a continental airlines subsidiary that operates in 
colorado as continental express 
bill white a denver attorney speaking for transcolorado said 
the company was obviously surprised were concerned white 
said he did not know how long silver had been a pilot for 
transcolorado 
there is certainly no way the company would condone anything 
like that cocaine use he said if there had been any 
indication he silver would not have been on the payroll its 
not the type of thing you do more than one time and get another 
chance 
the air line pilots association said it was deeply disturbed 
by the report and added that this would be the first instance 
where drug use by a pilot was shown to be the cause of an accident 
at a usscheduled airline 
the association which represents the pilots of the nations 
major airlines said however the report leaves unanswered more 
questions that it resolves 
before we draw any conclusions we must determine the accuracy 
of the report eliminate the possibility of a false positive 
reading determine the quantity and recency of the dosage 
determine whether the pilot was actually impaired at the time of 
the accident and then demonstrate that the impairment if any 
played a role in the accident said alpa president henry duffy 
george james president of airline economics inc a washington 
consulting firm to the airline industry said he was not aware of 
another commercial airline accident in which drug use had been 
involved 
just thursday the department of transportation proposed a drug 
testing program for more than a half million airline employees 
in a statement released by his office transportation secretary 
james burnley called the incident a tragic reminder that not even 
commercial aviation is exempt from the drug abuse problem which 
plagues our society 
the fairchildswearingen metroliner crashed at about 730 pm 
in light snow as it was approaching laplata county airport in 
durango the flight originated in denver

wyoming on friday became the last state to 
raise its drinking age to 21 
gov mike sullivan signed into law a bill raising the age from 
19 effective july 1 
when this becomes effective we will no longer be an island 
he said it is in the best interests of the state the country 
and foremost in the best interests of the young people of this 
state 
the signing marks the end of several years of debate on the 
issue in the legislature which has been unable to pass such 
legislation largely because of arguments that wyoming should not 
give in to federal blackmail 
wyoming stood to lose 82 million in federal highway funds 
immediately if the increase were not in place in july 
the government would continue to withhold funds until the state 
adopted the increase which was called for in a 1984 federal law

opportunity to extremely well here gore said

of textile imports such imports have caused plant closings and job 
losses in the states largest industry

violated gore said adding that as president he would be sure 
that agreements are enforced 
in the upstate friday gore spoke to textile employees in lyman 
where he said the reagan administration is aiding the wealthy in 
the hope that others will eventually benefit 
rather than asking whats best for those who are already well 
off i want to ask what is best for the man and the woman who work 
in the textile mills who work in the apparel industry the person 
who is behind the typewriter the small businessperson the small 
farmer and the person at the grass roots he said

irancontra affair was asked by cbs news about mcfarlane i 
wouldnt comment about mr mcfarlane north said but as i 
think i told you once before this marine is never going to plead 
guilty to any charge and ill fight this or any other allegations 
of misconduct forever 
earlier in an impromptu news conference following the hearing 
walsh acknowledged that mcfarlane could have been charged with 
perjury a felony that carries a fiveyear sentence for each charge 
but walsh said he agreed to the misdemeanor plea because of the 
former national security advisers willingness to cooperate with 
walshs investigation and his undisguised expressions of remorse 
after the false testimony 
he tried to correct his testimony and actually imposed injury 
upon himself in a fit of depression walsh said of mcfarlanes 
suicide attempt 
walsh called mcfarlanes guilty plea a very important 
development in his 14month investigation in the coming weeks the 
investigation is expected to yield a round of indictments against 
north and others including rear adm john m poindexter who was 
mcfarlanes successor as national security adviser 
it furthers the work of the office of independent counsel 
because he has agreed to cooperate fully with our office in the 
pursuit of the remainder of our investigation walsh said 
mcfarlane told reporters i did indeed withhold information 
from the congress i believe strongly that throughout my actions 
were motivated by what i believed to be in the foreign policy 
interest of the united states 
after the irancontra affair unraveled in late 1986 mcfarlane 
said i believed profoundly that it was my personal obligation to 
testify voluntarily and fully to those bodies formally established 
to investigate this matter 
in an interview later with nbc news mcfarlane sidestepped a 
question as to whether he thought president reagan might pardon him 
thats not for me and i dont think it ought to be for the 
american people the issue i guess thats really my central 
concern is why this really happened and to see if we cant 
correct the way we do business between the president and the 
congress so that this kind of thing doesnt happen again 
mcfarlane said 
the charges involve statements that mcfarlane made in three 1985 
letters to house committees and in testimony before the house 
foreign affairs committee on dec 8 1986 when he denied knowing 
about solicitations of donations to the contras from an 
unidentified foreign country 
the charges involve assurances to congress that nsc staffers 
specifically north were not involved in private efforts to help 
the contras and that mcfarlane knew of no foreign donations to the 
rebels 
mcfarlane admitted withholding information from the house 
permanent select committee on intelligence in letters he wrote on 
sept 5 1985 and on oct 7 1985 in response to queries about 
reports that his staff was secretly helping the contras in 
violation of the 1984 boland amendments ban on direct or indirect 
military aid to the rebels 
in the oct 7 letter mcfarlane wrote that lieutenant colonel 
north did not use his influence to facilitate the movement of 
supplies to the resistance 
he further assured the panel in the letter that there was no 
official or unofficial relationship with any member of the nsc 
staff regarding fundraising for the nicaraguan democratic 
opposition 
this includes the alleged relationship with general 
singlaub mcfarlane said 
the letter was misleading the charge said because mcfarlane 
knew that north had used his influence to facilitate the movement 
of certain supplies to the contras and he knew that a member of 
the nsc staff had had contact with retired maj gen john k 
singlaub regarding fundraising for the contras 
in the sept 5 letter mcfarlane told the panel i can state 
with deep personal conviction that at no time did i or any member 
of the national security council staff violate the letter or the 
spirit of the law 
we did not solicit funds or other support for military or 
paramilitary activities either from americans or third parties 
he wrote 
he made a similar assurance in a sept 12 1985 letter to 
former rep michael barnes dmd who then headed the house 
foreign affairs subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs 
the fourth charge relates to dec 8 1986 testimony in which 
mcfarlane told the house foreign affairs committee that he was not 
aware of any third country or citizens of a foreign nation helping 
the contras 
the concrete character of that is beyond my ken mcfarlane 
told the committee 
the charge noted that mcfarlane was withholding the fact he was 
aware that citizens of the unidentified country had been donating 
millions of dollars to the contras mcfarlane also withheld the 
fact that he had provided a representative of the country with the 
number of a secret bank account where the funds could be deposited 
the charge said 
mcfarlane told the congressional irancontra committees that as 
early as may of 1984 he had met with the ambassador from what was 
called country 2 which later was learned to be bandar bin sultan 
of saudi arabia 
the ambassador offered to provide 1 million a month to sustain 
the contras at a time their money was running out mcfarlane told 
the panels he had not solicited the money but that it had been 
offered as a gift after he bemoaned the likelihood of the reagan 
administration winning additional contra support from congress

president augusto pinochet on friday 
rejected an opposition demand to allow more than one candidate to 
run for president saying it would create chaos and anarchy 
pinochet the army commander who has ruled chile since a 1973 
coup vowed to carry out the governments plan for a single 
candidate in a yesorno plebiscite sometime this year 
pinochet made the remarks in an address to the nation to mark 
the seventh anniversary of the militarydrafted constitution which 
the opposition wants amended 
in a predawn attack before pinochets speech leftist 
guerrillas fired submachine guns and at least two rocket grenades 
at a suburban santiago police station wounding two officers and 
three civilians officials reported 
they said several extremists in two cars carried out the 
attack and one of the injured policemen was in serious condition 
officials reported three other guerrilla attacks early friday in 
the santiago area but no casualties 
another police station and a patrol car were fired at they 
said and at least four electricpower pylons were damaged by 
bombs blacking out some neighborhoods 
army patrols in combat gear were deployed in this capital city 
of 45 million people before pinochets speech which was broadcast 
on national radio and television 
according to the constitution the commanders in chief of the 
army navy and air force and the head of the national police will 
pick a single presidential candidate for a yesorno vote 
pinochet 72 is allowed by the constitution to seek election 
for the 198997 term and appears to be seeking the nomination he 
led the coup that ousted the elected government of marxist 
president salvador allende in september 1973 
no date has been set for the plebiscite but government 
officials have said it will be in the second half of this year 
in his 35minute speech pinochet made no reference to his 
candidacy but said the next president must identify himself 
with the constitution imposed by the military 
if the government granted the opposition demand to amend the 
constitution and block the governments election plan a 
situation of public unrest and serious uncertanties would follow 
he said 
according to the constitution if voters reject the military 
candidate in the plebiscite this year an open presidential 
election must be called in 1990 with pinochet remaining in power 
until then 
several thousand people gathered in front of a government 
building in downtown santiago as pinochet in a generals uniform 
arrived to make his speech some said they were government 
employees and had been ordered to go there 
police said there were scattered scuffles in santiago between 
government supporters and dissidents after pinochets speech

the usually tame soviet media provided sensational 
coverage friday of the hijacking of an aeroflot jetliner by a 
family of jazz musicians digging up details about the private 
lives of the air pirates 
interrupted flight read the headline of sovietskaya 
rossiya combat aboard a plane screamed the labor newspaper 
trud 
the simeons throw off their mask proclaimed pravda the 
official voice of the communist party referring to the name of the 
jazz ensemble 
nine people died in the attack including five of the 11 
hijackers 
the reports included dirt on the musical family from siberia and 
described in detail how they were duped into thinking they had 
landed in finland 
even under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs campaign for 
glasnost or openness the reports offered a rare account of an act 
of terrorism in the soviet union 
the hijackers were all members of the ovechkin family a 
siberian jazz ensemble from irkutsk that went by the name seven 
simeons 
armed with a bomb and shotguns they boarded the leningradbound 
tupolev154 in irkutsk and after a refueling stop in kurgan 
demanded that they be taken to london the newspapers said 
but the pilot set the plane down on a small airfield near 
leningrad five of the hijackers including the heromother 
described as the ringleader three passengers and a stewardess were 
killed in an ensuing shootout 
the newspapers covering the story didnt rely on dispatches from 
the official news agency tass they assigned their own 
correspondents 
trud said the group which was named after a russian fairy tale 
about a large family of farmers was a hit in irkutsk and was 
gaining popularity nationwide 
the ensemble visited japan in november their pictures appeared 
in the local press frequently and they were the subject of a 
documentary film 
the group had been scheduled to play a concert march 46 in 
irkutsk but canceled because one of the brothers was ill 
according to trud the real reason for the cancellation the paper 
suggested was that they were preparing to flee the country 
at that time they were selling all their household goods 
trud reported 
pravda said the trip to japan swelled their heads 
the boundless praise apparently made their heads spin the 
ovechkins began to dream about the good life abroad it said 
without citing a source 
it said the family members had everything going for them they 
had jobs and profited nicely from a private farm plot but pravda 
said there was a dark side 
the mother ninel ovechkin continued to deal in vodka even 
after her husband died a few years ago from excessive drinking 
the media reports indicated that mrs ovechkin described as a 
plump welldressed woman of over 50 had at least 11 children 
before setting out for the irkutsk airport the ovechkins left a 
note on their apartment door saying they were going to another 
siberian city and would return friday according to pravda 
all members of the family but the eldest sister boarded the 
flight trud said 
they carried only hand baggage mainly musical instruments 
according to pravda everything was searched except for the string 
bass which wouldnt fit in the xray machine pravda said the 
ovechkins refused to allow the bass to be checked into the baggage 
compartment and nothing suspicious was found in a visual 
inspection pravda said 
tass said thursday the weapons used in the hijacking had been 
smuggled aboard the plane in the instruments 
 
the newspapers portrayed stewardess tamara zharkaya as a martyr 
who negotiated calmly with the hijackers who were armed with 
16gauge sawedoff shotguns 
 
this girl took a tremendous responsibility upon herself 
pravda said she succeeded in psychological victory over the 
bandits 
sovietskaya rossiya quoted pilot first class valentin kupriyanov 
as saying the crew decided to accept the demand because the 
hijackers were becoming dangerous 
to avoid placing the passengers at risk we decided to fulfill 
the demands of the bandits and fly abroad kupriyanov recalled 
the ground flight controllers approved our action but the 
closer we got to leningrad the clearer it became that we would not 
reach even nearby finnish or swedish airports 
izvestia said the flight crew contacted the ground and a plan 
was worked out to dupe the hijackers into thinking they were 
landing in finland 
an assault team was waiting when the tu154 touched down media 
said 
the attack was over in minutes

president reagan imposed new sanctions friday 
against panama trying to weaken military strongman manuel antonio 
noriegas grip on power and end the illegitimate noriega regime 
in a written statement reagan said i believe that general 
noriega would best serve his country by complying with the 
instruction of president eric arturo delvalle to relinquish his 
post 
delvalle the civilian figurehead president regarded as the 
legitimate constitutional authority by the united states has been 
in hiding since feb 26 when he tried unsuccessfully to fire 
noriega as commander of the panama defense forces noriega is under 
indictment in the united states on drugsmuggling and racketeering 
charges 
reagan ordered that us government payments due panama be put 
in escrow until constitutional rule is restored in panama a 66 
million payment is due next tuesday for operations relating to the 
panama canal 
he also suspended trade preferences panama receives under a 
special system for third world countries and the caribbean basin 
initiative secretary of state george p shultz said 96 million 
worth of goods would be affected annually 
in addition reagan ordered stepped up scrutiny of panama by 
us immigration and customs service officials to apprehend drug 
traffickers and money launderers 
panamanian ambassador juan b sosa told a news conference he was 
pleased with reagans announcement he said that by themselves 
sanctions will not be enough to bring down noriega but that this 
goal will be achieved when combined with the actions of the 
panamanian people 
based on information he refused to disclose sosa said he was 
very optimistic that noriega intends to depart panama shortly 
abc news quoted diplomatic sources as saying the government of 
spain was prepared to offer asylum to noriega 
the two countries most mentioned by opposition leaders as 
possible asylum sites are paraguay and the dominican republic 
opposition leaders say they have sounded out the dominican republic 
and that noriega sent two military colleagues to paraguay this past 
week possibly to discuss asylum prospects 
the administration is trying to force noriegas ouster and 
weaken the militarydominated government by increasing the 
cashsqueeze in panama measures already taken with us support 
have caused a severe cash shortage prompting the government to 
suspend many banking operations crippling panamas economy 
us military and economic aid to panama was cut off last year 
following the initial popular uprisings against noriega in june 
last week the united states ruled that panama was not cooperating 
in efforts to control drug trafficking 
under the finding the united states was required to stop 
military and economic assistance which already had been done 
and to oppose panamanian requests for assistance in international 
lending institutions 
reagan said noriegas resignation would contribute very 
substantially to reducing political tensions and set the stage for 
a prompt transition to democracy in panama 
until such a time as democratic government is restored in 
panama the us cannot proceed on a businessasusual basis the 
president said today therefore i have taken a number of steps 
against the illegitimate noriega regime that will contribute 
significantly to the goal of a democratic stable and prosperous 
panama 
underscoring reagans use of the word illegitimate shultz 
told a news conference thats a very strong word 
what we think should happen is that he should leave panama 
and we want to see a return to civilian democratic rule and we 
also expect to see the panamanian defense forces resume an 
honorable and proper role in a constitutional government 
he said noriega has to get out of the way 
shultz said there was no need to impose an additional sanction 
to cut off fees panama receives from alaskan oil shipments which 
are transferred to us east coast ports through a panamanian 
pipeline he said that money already has been frozen under a 
temporary restraining order from a us court a source speaking 
only on condition of annymity said later that the order was issued 
by a court in massachussetts and ran until friday 
the first national bank of boston agreed to freeze activity on 
panamanian government accounts until the state department lifts 
sanctions against the nation according to a settlement filed in 
us district court there the action stemmed from a civil suit 
filed earlier this week by sosa 
a federal judge tuesday issued a temporary injunction against 
payments to any panamanian government agency from accounts at bank 
of boston and four floridabased banks in addition a restraining 
order was issued friday by a federal judge in new york against the 
bank of boston international which holds a panama government 
clearing account 
shultz accused noriega of trying to impose a military coup in 
panama by deposing delvalle 
shultz said the us actions will escalate panamas cash 
shortage that does have some effect on the economy but it also 
has an effect on the immediate ability to manage things 
he said the united states did not impose a broad trade embargo 
against panama because we dont want to punish the panamanian 
people instead he said were anxious to see general noriega 
get out of there 
shultz added were trying to very carefully and deliberately 
but strongly take actions that are focused in on things that we 
think will make a difference

soviet citizens are engaged in heated 
discussions about whether a new criminal code now being written 
should retain capital punishment tass said friday 
in a report from riga capital of latvia the official soviet 
news agency said a final decision will be made after nationwide 
discussion defendants sentenced to death in the soviet union are 
executed by firing squads 
heated discussions are going on over the problem of capital 
punishment tass said some people insist that it should be 
repealed altogether while others insist that it should be 
preserved for some special cases the latter view predominates at 
the moment 
the staterun media occasionally report executions of people 
convicted of such crimes as treason murder and widescale bribery 
and corruption the reports have not indicated how frequently the 
death penalty is imposed 
in an interview with igor karpets a latvian law professor tass 
said the revised code will contain a new section covering 
punishments for crimes against peace and humanity 
what behavior that section is intended to discourage was not 
clear but one possibility is terrorism 
soviet officials have referred frequently to the review of the 
28yearold criminal code but have not said when the draft will be 
completed

mikhail s gorbachev is to visit 
belgrade next week and sign a new guarantee of yugoslavias 
independence which the late president tito declared forcefully in 
1948 by breaking with the soviet union 
senior yugoslav officials said friday the declaration also 
appears to indicate the future course of soviet relations with 
other nations 
gorbachev is scheduled to arrive monday and stay four days on 
the first official visit to this nonaligned communist country by a 
soviet leader since 1976 
the new document will update previous declarations of 1955 and 
1956 and further confirm principles of noninterference on the 
basis of equality and sovereignty ilija djukic the deputy 
foreign minister told reporters 
the late leonid i brezhnev was the last kremlin leader to pay 
an official visit to yugoslavia which broke with the soviet bloc 
over ideological issues in 1948 but maintained economic and 
political links 
brezhnev attended titos funeral in may 1980 tito had visited 
moscow in 1979 
the declaration calls for noninterference of any kind in the 
internal matters of the two countries a senior official said on 
condition of anonymity

general change in soviet policy under gorbachev

call for cooperation with all nations and parties regardless of 
ideological differences and full and principled implementation 
of human rights in the whole world the official said

nine mile point 2 went into permanent 
commercial operation friday after 11 years of delays and cost 
overruns that have made it the nations most expensive nuclear 
plant at a cost of 63 billion 
the 1080megawatt plant which was to have been completed in 
1977 for 423 million went on line at 3 pm providing 
electricity to more than 9 million new yorkers said niagara mohawk 
power corp spokesman william romano 
it becomes the 105th nuclear plant operating commercially in the 
united states 
i feel great said niagara mohawk president william donlon 
its been a difficult period its been difficult on the company 
but we did succeed we did not fail where others have 
nine mile 2 on the lake ontario shoreline north of oswego will 
generate enough electricity to replace about 6 million to 8 million 
barrels of oil per year said romano 
besides niagara mohawk four other utilities own the 
boilingwater reactor new york state electric and gas long 
island lighting co rochester gas amp electric corp and central 
hudson gas amp electric corp 
nine mile 2 which already has produced 250 million kilowatt 
hours of commercial electricity during testing will be brought up 
to 100 percent operating capacity over the next several days 
romano said 
niagara mohawk was granted its construction permit for nine mile 
2 in 1974 and began construction a year later work was not 
completed until june 1986 
niagara mohawk has attributed the cost overruns and delays on 
upgraded safety standards and plant design changes required by the 
nrc critics have blamed mismanagement inefficient procurement 
practices and union corruption

a federal appeals court on friday upheld the 
reagan administrations refusal to release 180 million in revenue 
sharing funds that had been withheld two years ago under the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law 
the ruling by a threejudge panel of the us court of appeals 
for the district of columbia circuit reverses a lower court which 
had ordered treasury secretary james a baker iii to release the 
money 
an attorney for three associations representing local 
governments said an appeal of the latest decision was virtually 
certain 
my sense is the court did not fully comprehend the nature of 
our legal arguments i think its virtually certain well ask 
the court to reconsider its decision said david c vladek a 
lawyer for the national association of counties the national 
league of cities the us conference of mayors and 10 city and 
county governments 
the dispute involves president reagans feb 1 1986 order under 
the grammrudman law that set aside 43 percent of budget items 
including 180 million from that years 42 billion appropriation 
to the revenue sharing trust fund 
the local governments argued that the law provided that 
sequestered 1986 budget money should remain in government trust 
funds and be paid out in 1987 they argued that even though 
congress had abolished revenue sharing after 1986 it intended that 
any money remaining in the trust fund be distributed 
revenue sharing begun under the nixon administration provided 
nearly all local governments with unrestricted federal grants 
us district judge joyce hens green in a ruling last july 28 
found in favor of the local governments and said baker had 
illegally transferred the revenue sharing money from the trust fund 
to the general fund 
however judge john r gibson who wrote the appeals panels 
decision reversing judge green said congress intent with the 
grammrudman law was clearly to reduce the federal budget deficit 
merely freezing the monies in 1986 and resuscitating them 
in 1987 would not result in any meaningful deficit reduction and 
could be characterized by critics to be a sham said gibson who 
was joined by judges patricia m wald and david santelle 
the result in this case may be harsh but we believe it is 
consistent with congressional intent wrote gibson who was 
designated to the case from the us court of appeals for the 
eighth circuit in st louis 
among the plaintiffs are new york city kansas city mo 
milwaukee county wis and cuyahoga county ohio which includes 
cleveland 
the us conference of mayors at the time of the original 
district court decision last summer had estimated that new york 
would receive 10 million chicago 26 million los angeles 22 
million and detroit 13 million of the money 
other estimates were 606000 for new orleans 554000 for 
indianapolis 677000 for washington dc 440000 for denver 
and 104000 for des moines estimates for other cities were not 
provided

a british air force transport that 
made an emergency landing en route to the falkland islands left 
thursday after britain agreed it would return to ascension island 
uruguayan officials said 
the hercules c130 carrying a crew of seven and a cargo of 
tires cylinders of oxygen and munitions left carrasco 
international airport outside montevideo at nearly two days after 
landing here airport authorities said 
the plane developed an oil leak while flying from its base on 
ascension to mount stanley in the falklands british ambassador 
eric vines said 
officials said the return to ascension was a condition set by 
uruguayas foreign minister luis barrios tassano the former 
ambassador to argentina 
argentine authorities claimed the landing was no accident but 
part of the controversial military manuevers that britain began 
monday in the falklands 
argentina and britain fought in 1982 over sovereignty of the 
remote south atlantic islands the 74day war won by britain 
killed 712 argentines and 256 britons 
argentine foreign minister dante caputo said the emergency 
landing was actually a test to find out how uruguay would react in 
case of actual need during a similar wartime situation 
vines denied it

a former aide to gov evan mecham said 
friday he looked into an alleged death threat and assured the 
governor it was a little spat between employees that would 
probably go away by itself 
max hawkins former department of administration chief took the 
stand for the defense at mechams senate trial where the governor 
is accused among other things of trying to thwart an investigation 
of the alleged threat against a witness testifying before a grand 
jury investigating mechams finances 
hawkins said he confronted his employee prison construction 
chief lee watkins who was accused of making the threat against 
donna carlson and got a different version of the story first 
reported by mecham aide peggy griffith 
mrs griffith has testified that watkins warned that her friend 
carlson should stop talking or she might go on a long boat ride 
but hawkins said watkins told him i told peggy she should 
tell donna she should keep her mouth shut and stop running down the 
governor in the press he said there are a lot of people out 
there who are excitable and some harm may come to her 
hawkins said that mrs griffith told a smiliar story and that he 
did not think this constituted a threat 
asked what he told the governor hawkins said it was a matter 
that would probably go away by itself that it was a little spat a 
frivolous matter probably lee blowing off steam and peggy reacting 
to it and to leave it alone and it would go away 
hawkins was fired by acting gov rose mofford who took office 
after the 63yearold mecham was impeached by the house on feb 5 
mecham who took office in january 1987 is the first us 
governor to face an impeachment trial in six decades 
besides being accused of ordering an aide not to cooperate with 
the state attorney generals investigation of the alleged threat 
mecham was charged by the house with concealing a 350000 campaign 
loan and loaning 80000 in state money to his auto dealership 
in earlier testimony friday one of mechams closest aides said 
the governor believed he was divinely guided in making 
executive decisions 
sam steiger a special assistant who was forced out of office by 
his own indictment on political extortion charges also described a 
bitter battle between mecham and the states attorney general whom 
steiger blamed for mechams downfall 
i had the feeling that the governor did and does feel he is 
divinely guided steiger said in response to a question by sen 
john mawhinney a republican like mecham 
mawhinney asked if there was truth to rumors that mecham a 
devout mormon could and would make decisions on specific pieces 
of legislation through he believed some divine inspiration 
yes the governor believes his motives are divinely 
inspired said steiger at least adhering to principles that 
are divinely inspired 
mormon doctrine holds that faithful christians may receive 
guidance from god regarding wordly endeavors including their 
occupations church leaders also teach that god inspired the 
political principles in the us constitution and that it is gods 
will that government adhere to them 
asked by the associated press about steigers comment on divine 
guidance mecham would say only sam hes a little off the wall 
in some of his comments too 
although steigers defense testimony only peripherally addressed 
the charge he held senators riveted with his blunt colorful 
descriptions of the mecham administration 
steiger blamed the governors troubles at least partially on his 
fierce battle with fellow republican attorney general robert corbin 
that fight he said stemmed from mechams resentment that he 
took an inordinate public beating over eliminating the states 
martin luther king holiday for executive branch workers when it was 
really the attorney generals idea 
corbin had advised all 1986 gubernatorial candidates that the 
holiday had been illegally declared that year by thengov bruce 
babbitt and that corbin would have to sue the governor if it was 
observed 
in the most vitriolic comments of the trials two weeks steiger 
described corbin as not very bright but politically adept and 
suggested he manipulated legislators 
he corbin has deluded many of you into thinking he is a 
competent person he told the senators 
he declared that corbin had turned the attorney generals office 
into one of the most expensive in the country and disliked 
mechams costcutting policies 
i believe those people are capable of setting up anybody he 
said of corbin and his staff but i have no knowledge they did 
contacted for comment on steigers remarks corbin said oh 
well you know sam just remember the position he is in with regard 
to our office and you can draw your own conclusions 
steiger is being prosecuted by corbins office on charges that 
he tried to extort a vote from a parole board member 
mecham faces a criminal charge brought by corbins office 
alleging that he concealed the 350000 campaign loan 
he also faces a recall election may 22 but that could change if 
he is convicted by the senate a twothirds vote of senators could 
remove him from office and a second twothirds vote could bar him 
from holding any state office again

panicked soccer fans fled knifewielding 
ruffians and triggered the collapse of a sports stadium in libya 
killing at least 20 people according to news reports friday 
maltas state radio said two libyans were arrested in tripoli 
the libyan capital after the collapse 
newspapers in belgrade yugoslavia quoting a report from the 
yugoslav state news agency tanjug from tripoli said at least 20 
people were killed and hundreds injured when a stadium dividing 
wall fell thursday during a match between malta and libya 
but the libyan news agency jana said two spectators were killed 
the jana report monitored in london said some people had been 
treated and released and 16 were hospitalized 
joe sacco the general secretary of the maltese football 
association who was in tripoli with the maltese team said friday 
there was speculation in the libyan capital that the death toll 
could be higher 
jana said a row of seats collapsed at the june 11 stadium 
the stadium reportedly has a capacity of 70000 it was not 
immediately known how many people were at the game 
the times of malta said panic occurred when someone in the 
stands brandished a weapon and the spectators rushed to get out 
politika ekspres a belgrade daily said the incident began when 
several fans pulled out knives during a quarrel 
some spectators returning to malta told reporters at the airport 
the same story while others quoted people in the stadium as saying 
a man was terrorizing the crowd with a snake 
politika ekspres said spectators seeking safety toppled an iron 
fence at the same time a sixfoot thick 15foot long wall 
dividing the second from the third level of the stadium also 
crashed down 
it is hard to believe that anyone under it could have remained 
alive politika ekspres said quoting eyewitnesses 
several hundred people reportedly were injured when the crowd 
from the third level surged down creating panic that soon spread 
to other parts of the stadium 
people rushed to exits and that caused more injuries the paper 
said 
finally about 5000 fans in the field started chasing the 
culprits one of them was captured but police managed to drag him 
free from the hands of the crowd politika ekspres said 
maltas department of information said the foreign ministry was 
informed that no maltese nationals were involved in the accident 
the libyans were leading 10 in the exhibition game between the 
two national teams the game was stopped and did not resume 
prime minister edward fench adami of malta sent a message friday 
to libyas leader col moammar gadhafi extending our 
condolences and deepest sympathies to the familes of the bereaved 
and to all those hit by this tragedy 
the people of malta join me in sharing your profound grief at 
this unhappy moment during the sports festival fenech adami said 
in the message

panamas militarybacked government 
ordered cuts in public services friday as new us sanctions 
compounded a financial crisis police firing tear gas broke up an 
opposition rally 
the beleaguered government of strongman gen manuel antonio 
noriega reportedly also was considering delaying or reducing 
paychecks due early next week to nearly 150000 public employees a 
spokesman said no decision was made on those steps 
several businessmen said they were warned their stores could be 
expropriated if they refused to cash public employees paychecks 
a planned demonstration by government opponents in the central 
banking district was broken up friday afternoon by riot police 
firing tear gas grenades and spraying the stinging acrid liquid 
from portable canisters 
large numbers of police prevented any sustained gathering of 
demonstrators small groups gathered and then ran setting a few 
fires an associated press photographer at the scene reported more 
journalists on hand than police spectators and demonstrators 
at one site there were about 60 journalists and fewer than 20 
protesters who loudly chanted justice and taunted the police 
three journalists were injured when police sprayed gas in their 
faces at close range they were lucia annunziata a reporter with 
la repubblica of rome david walters a photographer with the miami 
herald and manolo iscala a cameraman for spanish television 
the nations new chief executive manuel solis palma ordered 
his cabinet into emergency session after president reagan imposed 
several new sanctions including putting some panama canal fees in 
escrow 
a spokesman for solis palma characterized reagans action as a 
state of war 
the cabinet ordered working hours in all government offices 
slashed from eight to six hours daily 
it also told government agencies and departments to cut their 
use of electricity fuel and telephones and asked employees to 
take vacations due them immediately 
treasury minister hector alexander was quoted by a panama city 
newspaper as saying upcoming paydays of public employees are 
going to have to be deferred because of a growing cash shortage 
the newspaper la estrella said the treasury minister did not 
elaborate on his remark about delaying paychecks which was carried 
in a brief threeparagraph story friday morning 
a source close to panamas government said the cabinet also 
contemplated delaying paychecks to government workers reducing 
their pay temporarily and giving them partial payment in food 
instead of cash 
the us sanctions were announced on the 10th day of a bank 
closure forced by a cash shortage in panama the country uses the 
american dollar as its currency and its central bank normally 
receives transfers from the us federal reserve 
the united states halted those transfers last week and attorneys 
for ousted president eric arturo delvalle have tied up an estimated 
50 million in official panamanian funds in private us banks 
directors of six supermarket and one pharmacy chains said mario 
rognoni the trade and industries minister told them the 
government could expropriate the chains if they did not cash public 
employees paychecks 
they said in a statement they would consider a general strike if 
the government followed through on its veiled threat 
if they cashed the checks they would have no money to operate 
in less than 24 hours the directors said 
rognoni denied he made any threat and said he only wanted to 
advance the idea of having chains give food to employees and deduct 
the value from the paychecks 
panamas most recent problems began in february when noriega was 
indicted in florida on us drugtrafficking and money laundering 
chages 
on feb 25 president delvalle tried to remove noriega as chief 
of the defense forces instead noriega arranged for the 
legislature to dismiss delvalle and a political and economic 
crisis ensued 
washington responded by imposing economic sanctions on panama 
and declaring its support for delvalle who went into hiding 
on friday reagan stepped up us economic pressure by ordering 
that a 65 million canal payment due tuesday be put into escrow 
reagan ordered several other measures and called on noriega to 
resign 
in boston the first national bank of boston agreed to freeze 
panamanian government accounts until the state department lifts 
sanctions against the nation according to a settlement filed in 
us district court 
the panamanian government normally disburses about 33 million 
in paychecks every two weeks but its cash reserves are said by 
diplomatic sources and private economists to be approaching zero 
the government managed to pay its 15000 soldiers thursday but 
must meet a bimonthly payroll for the nations 20000 public 
school teachers on monday and thousands of other government workers 
on tuesday 
the school teachers form a powerful lobby that brought down a 
civilian president in 1979 over a pay dispute 
public employees in general are considered to be among the few 
remaining backers of noriega

with help from a usled aid 
program a rundown site dividing roman catholic and protestant 
areas of belfast is being transformed into an industrial park for 
fledgling businessmen 
it is one of about 40 projects that have been promised money 
from the multimilliondollar international fund for ireland the 
most tangible outgrowth of the angloirish agreement of 1985 that 
aims to help reconcile feuding catholics and protestants in 
northern ireland 
the 16 milliontownsend enterprise park will create space for 
45 new businesses near the towering peace wall dividing the 
protestant shankill road district from the catholic falls road 
frank murphy the project head said it would not have gone 
forward without the funds 440000 contribution 
but just as the fund is getting off the ground its future has 
been put in question following an announcement that the us state 
department is dropping the fund from its 1989 allocations of the 
funds present kitty of 868 million 85 million has come from 
washington with 35 million more due this year 
the rationale behind the fund is that in a province with a 
17percent unemployment rate and the collapse of its traditional 
heavy industries only economic revival can eliminate slums 
joblessness and resentment 
another project helped by the fund aims at turning the 
firstcentury ruin of navan fort in county armagh into a tourist 
site another has given 4500 to frank odonnell a 24yearold 
londonderry catholic unemployed for two years to open his own 
business selling handcarved fireplace mantels 
when the fund was set up in 1986 the us congress approved 
120 million over three years to stimulate economic regeneration 
and foster catholicprotestant reconciliation seventyfive percent 
was earmarked for northern ireland and 25 percent for border 
counties in the irish republic to the south 
some protestants are suspicious since the angloirish agreement 
grants the irish republican government in dublin a say in their 
affairs the rev ian paisley the northern irish protestant 
hardliner called the fund yankee blood money and urged a 
boycott of its projects 
the european economic community which had been expected to make 
a major donation has held back because london and dublin cant 
agree on a joint application for funds canada is contributing 10 
million spread over 10 years and new zealand has given a onetime 
300000 payment 
bob myers us consul general in belfast said in an interview 
the united states wants more countries to contribute to the fund 
but concern rose in ireland in february when us deputy 
secretary of state john whitehead said the united states does not 
receive a real return on its contribution to the fund and was 
dropping it from the state departments 1989 foreign aid 
allocations 
in its present state the fund would die without the us 
donation and irishamerican congressmen such as sen edward m 
kennedy dmass say they are confident congress will continue to 
support the international fund 
the funds board has so far allocated only 20 percent of its 
money about 16 million to some 40 projects it says about 2000 
applications have come from both catholics and protestants despite 
paisleys call for a boycott and hopes to have distributed the 
whole amount within 18 months 
i would have liked to see quicker progress but im 
absolutely certain if we plunged in spending money like drunken 
sailors it would have been disastrous said charles eb brett 
the lawyer and former public official who chairs the funds 
sevenmember board 
the board gives priority to jobcreation programs tourism and 
venture capital companies one idea never tried before is the joint 
marketing of irish goods from both north and south 
the board has also approved projects to help universities 
develop marketable products and more than half a dozen programs to 
launch entrepreneurs like odonnell in londonderry 
danny morrison publicity director for sinn fein the outlawed 
irish republican armys legal political wing and the rev matthew 
wallace a catholic priest on the townsend park board in belfast 
complained that the fund was putting too little into catholic areas 
where unemployment is 2 times higher than in protestant areas 
wallace said he preferred to see american companies investing in 
northern ireland and creating real jobs 
thats more important than the money itself from the fund 
the money will do nothing the priest said 
i dont think we can expect violence to end unless we do 
something about unemployment said franklin adair a banker who 
heads the youth enterprise scheme yes the funds first grant of 
88500 went to yes which is helping hundreds of people under 25 
to start businesses 
we must give young people something to hold on to adair 
said otherwise what do they have to lose thats where i think 
the american funds can be best used in positive creation of 
employment thats the way to achieve peace

the government has rejected proposals for 
ceasefire talks under the central american peace plan and the 
guatemalan military has gone on the offensive against leftist rebel 
strongholds in the countryside 
president vinicio cerezo turned down guerrilla proposals for 
talks as a goodfornothing petition a few days before he did 
that the roman catholic archbishop prospero penados del barrio 
accepted a request from the rebels to mediate between the two sides 
the rebels the church and most political parties have urged the 
resumption of talks between the government and rebels in madrid 
spain last october the first in the 27yearold war 
but gen hector gramajo the defense minister repeated the 
militarys insistence that the rebels abandon their weapons first 
the army is very close to achieving a total victory he said 
a few days before the october talks began in madrid with the 
guatemalan national revolutionary union the umbrella for three 
guerrilla forces the army announced new operations in the 
rebelcontrolled northern part of quiche province and on the 
southern side of lake atitlan where the rebels have been most 
entrenched 
establishing a ceasefire is one of the commitments guatemala 
agreed to in signing the central american peace plan last aug 7 
along with nicaragua el salvador costa rica and honduras 
gramajo maintained however that with an amnesty that requires 
rebels to disarm and participate in the political process there 
is no need for talks 
the rebels refute gramajos claims that they have only 500 to 
700 now under arms down from 2500 to 3000 in 1986 and that the 
military offensive is a success in the early 1980s rebel strength 
was estimated at 4000 to 6000 combatants 
there is a flareup in the war in guatemala basically because 
of the army offensive said one of the guerrilla respresentatives 
who went to madrid in october speaking on condition of anonymity 
he called the armys current offensive the biggest ever in 
strictly military terms 
the army has thrown most of its strength of 43000 personnel 
including air support into the effort mainly focused on quiche 
the guerrilla organization claims 3500 combatants in its three 
armies the guerrilla army of the poor the group fighting in 
quiche a northwestern province the organization of the people in 
arms generally in the lake atitlan area and west to san marcos 
and the rebel armed forces in the northern peten panhandle province 
gramajo placed the armys casualties from september to 
midfebruary at 83 while the rebel source put them at 700 from 
october through december neither side gave rebel casualties which 
generally are lower because guerrillas use ambushes and other 
tactics that avoid direct combat 
one of the armys main targets is what it considers the rebel 
support population in northern quiche thousands of campesinos 
most of them indians who have hidden from the army for as long as 
seven years 
they remained behind when thousands of others fled into 
neighboring mexico or cities in the early 1980s when more than 400 
villages were destroyed and tens of thousands of civilians killed 
in the northwest highlands 
highlands residents diplomats and human rights groups claim the 
army did most of the killing the army blames the guerrillas 
the rebels say they are fighting for what they call real 
democracy and national sovereignty and against social injustice and 
poverty 
the most visible effect of the offensive in northern quiche 
around the area of nebaj is the hundreds of refugees being brought 
to the army base there gramajo says a sign of the armys success 
is its rescue of 2200 of the 4000 peasants in the area 
although the army is allowing them to return to a few villages 
near nebaj where it has reestablished permanent posts and is 
putting in roads the refugees must first receive three months of 
army reeducation in patriotism and nationalism officers 
said 
villagers farther north remain closed to them 
right now they cant return to those places the civilian 
affairs officer at the base said the army is going to have more 
success the fewer the people who are there 
one refugee identifying himself only as diego said some refugees 
are captured by the army and others turn themselves in when 
soldiers appear 
we saw well that there was no way out because the army was 
covering all the points he said in a whisper outside a 
woodplank army barracks at nebaj

even in the 100degree heat of midday the 
niger valley echoes with the sounds of the women beating their wash 
against the stones on the river bank 
their backbreaking days work will earn them an average of 250 
west african francs 88 cents 
the women their hard work and low pay epitomize the problems 
facing this west african nation shackled by constant drought and 
the economic difficulties that arise from it the world bank ranks 
mali as one of the five poorest countries in the world with a per 
capita income of 148 a year 
the washerwomen all from the dogon tribe were driven out of 
their homes in the north to bamako four years ago by the 
devastating sahelian drought they remain excellent vegetable 
farmers and the river banks behind them bloom with radishes 
tomatoes and strawberries 
but they live in isolation on the outskirts of this city of 1 
million they do not speak french malis official language nor do 
they know bambara the lingua franca of the region 
they are tolerated by their countrymen because for the moment 
there is no other room for them and there is still residual 
sympathy for the suffering they endured in the drought of 1983 and 
1984 but another dry spell could quickly make them unwanted 
another burden on a country already unable to feed itself 
average rainfall varies from 472 inches in the south to the 
desert north with less than 8 inches 
the next drought will mean the loss of more farm land and even 
more people will be forced south toward bamako to compete for the 
scant resources 
this huge largely desert or semidesert country with its 84 
million people spread across an area larger than california and 
texas combined has never known prosperity according to the 
economictrends report from the us embassy it will need 
continued foreign help for the forseeable future 
despite a national commitment to economic reform and 
relatively good soils in the south cereal production has fallen in 
recent years the report said over the past 10 years the 
climate throughout mali particularly the great inland delta of the 
niger has become drier this has resulted in serious losses of 
crops and cattle declining agricultural productivity and 
increased reliance upon donations of grains from the west 
the report says mali has made serious attempts at mending its 
ailing economy forcing retirements and imposing staff cutbacks in 
the public sector but 70000 government employees remain on the 
roles threefourths of all salaried workers in the country 
in 1986 while under the squeeze of economic reform the bottom 
fell out the price of cotton the countrys chief export 
plummeted the government discontinued much of an austerity package 
that formed the basis for loans from the international monetary 
fund and world bank but the imf money stoppoed coming because the 
government gave up on the austerity commitment 
now mali is broke 
teachers on strike since midfebruary for salaries three months 
in arrears have been joined by students demanding that scholarship 
payments be brought up to date 
president moussa traore said recently he hoped the 18monthlong 
misunderstanding with the imf could be cleared up and loans 
would be coming again 
we have said that we favor the structural adjustment program 
but we also favor the preservation of our human dignity and 
despite our difficulties the world economic situation and drought 
which we do not control we want people to understand us he 
told a news conference 
structural adjustment does not mean throwing workers into the 
streets without compensation nor does it mean dismantling the 
economy of a country or destroying the basis of an economy we are 
still expecting help from our partners

march is salsa star ruben blades month his new 
album is being released and his latest movie the milagro 
beanfield war opens 
blades who writes most of his songs also has a masters degree 
in law from harvard university how does he find time to do so much 
the answer is that i am very well organized he said in a 
recent interview i select chunks of time based on my interest i 
block that time and when it arrives i do only what that time has 
been devoted for 
i begin to plan things usually a year or two before the event 
occurs even if at the time the event doesnt seem like its going 
to happen i begin to plan for that event 
my interests are so diverse he added that i keep 
surprising everybody by literally jumping from one thing to another 
and yet to another for instance when i went to harvard to do my 
masters i didnt perform during those two years 1984 and 1985 
i devoted my time to studying i wrote some songs on the side so 
to speak but i didnt perform at all 
after getting his degree blades went to new mexico to shoot 
the milagro beanfield war directed by robert redford in 1986 
it was his first screen appearence since teaming up with whoopi 
goldberg in fatal beauty which was released that same year 
the year 1985 saw the release of crossover dreams a 
controversial film of dashed hopes and hot salsa in el barrio 
starring blades and directed by the cubanamerican filmmaker leon 
ichaso 
ichaso has a very good eye for the absurd which i think is a 
tremendous asset for anyone blades said talking about his work 
with various directors redford being an actor himself is a 
very patient director very protective they both make actors feel 
very comfortable he said 
the milagro beanfield war will open in new york and los 
angeles march 18 and nationwide on april 1 blades lp nothing 
but the truth will be released also on march 18 according to 
elektra records 
the 39yearold blades who was born in panama and moved to the 
united states in 1974 described the milagro beanfield war as 
a comedy with a very serious point 
the movie based on the novel of the same title by john 
nicholson is about the frictions and disputes between outside 
developers and local residents of a little fictional town in new 
mexico called milagro 
blades portrays bernabe montoya he is the man in the middle 
he is part of the community but he has been appointed as a sheriff 
by the developers he is the only one that has a genuine 
independent outlook of both sides 
blades said latin actors have more opportunity for film work 
today than 15 or 20 years ago i think that because of the rising 
interest of the anglo public toward the latin culture and because 
of the impact of the political realities in central and south 
america new opportunities are given now to latin actors and also 
latin directors blades said 
and i think this is a trend that will continue

sweet auburn long the lifeline of black 
atlantas business community has lost its luster and 
revitalization plans are hobbled by disagreement over what should 
be done in the district where martin luther king jr preached and 
louis armstrong played 
the citys auburn avenue area was a child of segregation for 
years a soaring black middle and professional class was allowed to 
do business or offer services nowhere else in 1956 fortune 
magazine called auburn avenue the richest black business district 
in america 
the avenue was a cradle of the civil rights movement but it was 
the movements success that eventually disseminated the middle 
classes to other parts of atlanta and started sweet auburn on its 
decline 
whether it can be renovated without its few remaining businesses 
being gentrified and whether the old flavor can or should be 
restored are issues along the avenue 
whatever is proposed the older people in the area seem to 
disagree with it said gordon joiner a former chairman of the 
martin luther king historical district development corp they all 
seem to agree that the area needs to be revitalized but thats 
where the agreement stops 
kings ebenezer baptist church his birthplace and his tomb are 
on auburn avenue and some redevelopment proposals center on that 
the development corporation envisions reverting part of the 
avenue to the way it was when king was young others want to 
revitalize the entire district into an area where people again will 
come to do business using its past as a tourist draw 
atlanta has budgeted 24 million this year for auburn 
avenuearea landscaping improvements on the stillfunctioning 
municipal market building and historic facade renovation the city 
also hopes to get some help from the national trust for historic 
preservation 
most grant money for the auburn district has gone to the east 
end where the martin luther king jr center for nonviolent social 
change sits and not to the dilapidated commercial sector 
nearly 500000 visitors a year travel the twomilelong avenue 
from downtown atlanta to the king center 
en route visitors pass a few remaining bars beauty shops 
small restaurants and boardedup businesses they pass a fourstory 
brick shell of a building with the names of lawyers dentists 
accountants and doctors in peeling paint on the remaining shards of 
windows 
prostitution and drug deals flourish along the avenue a 
highcrime area at night 
the poor and the prostitutes were always there 
the rev william borders 82 who just finished his 50th year as 
pastor at the wheat street baptist church remembers being 
propositioned years ago they used to make a pass at me and i 
would say dont you know who i am im the preacher and they 
would say i dont care who you are do you want to date me or 
not 
borders came to the avenue in the 1920s it was a lot rougher 
out there then than it is now he said 
my mother used to tell us we were born too late to be in 
slavery and too early to be out of slavery 
borders was instrumental in getting some substandard housing 
replaced by projects 
atlantas most prestigious black churches are still there along 
with the national offices of the southern christian leadership 
conference black fraternal lodges one of the nations first 
blackowned radio stations werd and the atlanta daily world the 
nations oldest blackowned daily newspaper 
the masonic building built by blacks in the early years of the 
century sits atop an underground river im proud to say we 
built it and proud to say we aint seen a drop of water yet 
said xl neal the grand master 
oldline atlantans remember the area for some of the best food 
in town and an alluring smoky pungence from the auburn avenue rib 
shack is comforting assurance that not everything has changed 
over time the region became known as sweet auburn in the 
1930s and 40s cab calloway louis armstrong and others packed 
patrons into the top hat club now long closed 
the royal peacock hosted another generation of black 
entertainers such as otis redding and ray charles it hung on for 
25 years until it closed in 1973 
the peacock has been leased by two white entrepreneurs who plan 
to reopen the secondstory walkup as a blues and rock showcase 
what visitors see of black atlanta is a poor reflection of 
what the auburn avenue area was all about said daniel moore 
director of apex a privately funded organization building a 
permanent display of atlantas black history on the avenue 
for a number of years there have been plans for auburn avenue 
but no one has taken the task seriously he said he said a 
recent study about what might be done cost 240000 and was one of 
a halfdozen over the past 10 years all of them expensive 
i dont see much chance of anything major being done before 
the democratic national convention scheduled for atlanta in 
july he said 
politically more has been said than done about the area and no 
unified leadership has emerged 
there are a number of factions on the avenue and the avenue 
does not have a czar to speak for all factions said portia 
scott whose family has published the daily world since 1928 
there are a whole lot of themes here not just martin luther 
king 
ben e smith a lifelong auburn avenue area resident and 
nightclub owner agrees 
of a move to put city funds from a defunct project into the 
area smith said recently ill make sure the king center doesnt 
get everything everything cant go to the gravesite 
smith who heads the sweet auburn merchants and professionals 
association is urging unity among the remaining businesses to 
assure their interests are covered in any revitalization plans 
smith ms scott and others fought hard against plans to tear 
out seven businesses on the avenue to make room for a black studies 
library and research center fulton county officials have agreed to 
try to find an existing vacant building for the center instead 
there is a diehard need for restoration that does not displace 
the merchants smith said adding that it is equally important to 
keep the history and character of sweet auburn a street 
described by many atlantans as one of the few in town with any 
character left

cbs is beefing up its schedule with four new 
comedies but from the looks of the first three the shows 
themselves will need some beefing up before they will help cbs 
because of its hourdramaheavy schedule the network wants more 
halfhour sitcoms thus eisenhower amp lutz premieres tonight in 
two half hours before and after newhart its regular time 
period will be monday in place of franks place which moves to 
tuesday 
trial and error and coming of age make their debuts 
tuesday a fourth comedy the dictator also was to have 
premiered tuesday but it has been delayed by the writers strike 
in the meantime cbs will bring back my sister sam 
the most promising of the three new comedies is trial and 
error it falters occasionally in the premiere half hour but 
mostly lands on its feet thanks to the comic abilities of its two 
stars eddie velez and paul rodriguez 
velez plays john hernandez a cleancut young lawyer just hired 
by a big los angeles law firm his childhood friend and now 
roommate tony rivera rodriguez is a tshirt entrepreneur 
rodriguez a standup comic delivers the oneliners with 
professional aplomb he takes his buddy to a fancy restaurant to 
celebrate his new job the waiter lists the specials including 
goat cheese 8 goat cheese eight dollars complains rivera 
i got a buddy in alhambra wholl sell me the whole goat for 
four 
velezs forte is physical comedy acting cool in his new office 
with his modular phone he whips the receiver around on its 
elasticized wire but ends up having to hide from it when it gets 
out of control 
the show doesnt make any heavy social points but does manage a 
meaningful plotline when hernandez faces the fact that he was hired 
by the law firm because he is hispanic the senior partner 
dismisses his protests by telling him there was a time he would 
have been rejected because of it at riveras urging he decides to 
take the break for what its worth 
eisenhower amp lutz also shows promise with occasionally crisp 
writing and a likable star scott bakula playing a palm springs 
shyster whos practicing alone but thought eisenhower on the firms 
name sounded prestigious 
his secretary quits over her pay remember two months ago when 
i interviewed for a job and we discussed salary and i said yes i 
wanted one 
so his girlfriend delane matthews a cocktail waitress fills 
in typing up his resume before his meeting with a big law firm he 
thinks might hire him he notes she included his alma mater 
southeast school of law i thought we were going to dress that up 
a little says he says she i took and acupuncture off 
the series is from mtm productions and executive producer allan 
burns an emmywinning writer formerly with the mary tyler moore 
show the lines are smart enough but the series needs to develop 
some heart 
coming of age was apparently meant to be kind of a coed 
golden girls it stars paul dooley as dick hale a 
wisecracking former airline pilot from pittsburgh reluctantly 
relocated to a sunny retirement village in the southwest with his 
wife ginny phyllis newman 
the comedy in the premiere episode is broad and sluggish though 
dooley can almost pull it off thats 27 he says gazing out 
the window as his wife unpacks what are you counting she

fifty years after the nazis closed the 
worlds first museum of jewish art in vienna a private exhibit of 
jewish ritual objects has been drawing large crowds of visitors 
some 800 items displayed at the judentum in wien jews in 
vienna exhibit housed by the museum of the history of vienna are 
all loans from a private judaica collection regarded by art 
historians as one the most important private collections of jewish 
life 
according to max berger owner of the collection most of the 
drawings paintings sculptures medals coins manuscripts and 
handicraft on show were in danger of being destroyed or lost after 
austrias annexation by nazi germany in 1938 
berger a viennese businessman who survived a nazi concentration 
camp pieced together his collection over years and this is the 
first time it has been shown in public 
the exhibit displays mementoes of jewish life from the early 
18th century until present focusing on vienna as an important 
center in the history of european jewry museum officials said it 
is the first step toward opening a permanent jewish museum here in 
the next two or three years 
about 6000 jews live in vienna today compared with 200000 who 
helped make this city a capital of science culture and the arts 
before world war ii they included sigmund freud gustav mahler 
stefan zweig arnold schoenberg and hundreds of others 
some 65000 austrian jews perished in nazi concentration and 
death camps during the war 
the exhibit is divided into eight sections including ritual 
objects and hebrew writings the jewish year and life the history 
of the viennese jews zionism antisemitism and persecution and 
jewish contributions to art and culture 
its the first time that the most important private judaica 
collection in europe is displayed for the austrian public after the 
war karlalbrecht weinberger a curator who helped set up the 
display said in an interview 
by march 3 the exhibit had been visited by some 30000 people 
on saturdays and sundays we have up to 500 visitors a day 
weinberger said adding that recently austrian school authorities 
advised schools to come and see the exhibit as part of their 
history classes 
more young austrians gradually have been educated about the nazi 
past and the holocaust in the two years since the first disclosures 
that president kurt waldheim had covered up his wartime past as a 
german army lieutenant in the balkans 
weinberger said the exhibit was planned before waldheim became 
president 
the most valuable objects displayed are a silverandgold torah 
crown made in austria in 1810 and a torah plaque made in 1806 of 
goldcovered silver 
the oldest display is a torah curtain made around 1700 of red 
velvet laced with silver threads 
weinberger said the first jewish museum in the world opened in 
vienna in 1895 with a very big collection of jewish art 
the nazis dismantled it in 1938 while some items were lost or 
destroyed others were taken by the germans to prague where they 
planned to open a big antisemitic jewish museum the museum never 
materialized but some objects have remained in the prague jewish 
museum which opened after the war 
asked if the austrians ever asked the czechs to return the items 
held by the vienna museum weinberger said they never did 
its difficult to prove what objects belonged to the jewish 
vienna museum as all catalog were destroyed during the war he 
said

your eyelids freeze its dark much of the time 
polar bears stroll the streets every so often and a heat wave is 
when the temperature goes above 40 degrees in the summer not many 
outsiders go to the worlds northernmost city but a moscowbased

thawed out it is one of a series of periodic ap reports on life

igor perlovsky is a big man in dickson 
he runs the only bar in town he owns the only vcr 
and for the 5000 soviets who inhabit the worlds northernmost 
city on the icebound kara sea drinks and movies at perlovskys 
coupole lounge are a cherished escape from the 10 months of 
winter when temperatures plunge to 75 degrees below zero and the 
wind freezes the moisture in the corners of peoples eyes 
outdoor sports are out of the question on the desolate ice 
desert that stretches more than 300 miles from here to the south 
even for those hardy enough to play outdoors its hard to see a 
soccer ball during the threemonth polar night nor is there 
swimming during the twomonth summer when the mercury climbs 
to an average high of 40 
there used to be an automobile in dickson which is reachable 
only by air and sea but the novelty of driving on the citys three 
or four roads wore off and the 11yearold moskvich subcompact has 
been garaged with only 70 kilometers 44 miles on the odometer 
every few weeks a resident sights a polar bear lumbering along 
the moguled ice paths that pass for streets and telling tales of 
narrow escapes from the arctics natural inhabitants is a popular 
pasttime 
police sometimes are summoned to chase the bears away by firing 
rifles into the air but they are forbidden to shoot the beasts 
except in lifethreatening situations polar bears are protected by 
the soviet red book the endangered species list 
at first glance dickson appears uninhabited the plume from a 
single smokestack atop the citys steamgenerating plant provides 
the first sign of life on closer inspection a few furhatted 
pedestrians can be seen bobbing between the snowbanks the silence 
is broken by the roar of a jeep or the thrashing of a tracked 
vezdekhod the refitted armored personnel carriers that serve 
as dicksons police cars ambulances and buses 
the city which lies 500 miles inside the arctic circle and 
1100 miles below the north pole is named for oskar dickson a 
swedish brewer and financier who bankrolled the international 
expedition that discovered the port in 1875 dicksons retention of 
his name through a century of political tumult in russia is 
evidence of its isolation from moscow and the official penchant for 
renaming places for soviet heroes 
the first settlers arrived in dickson in 1915 to operate a radio 
transmitter at the port by world war ii a few hundred were living 
here to handle shipping on the yenisei river that flows into the 
kara just to the south 
today dicksons port is the gateway to the northern sea route 
that provides europes only direct sealink to the pacific ocean 
gennady m svetkov deputy chief of the citys governing 
council said the port which is the only major enterprise in 
dickson generates revenues of 6 million rubles 10 million a 
year that figure could skyrocket if the soviet union reopens the 
northern sea route as communist party chief mikhail s gorbachev 
proposed last october it has been closed to all but soviet vessels 
since 1964 
in winter supply ships shepherded by icebreakers make their 
way into the frozen port every month or so but in july and august 
the waterfront bustles as soviet cargo ships ply the arctic ocean 
with goods bound for japan china and points south 
increased ship traffic and the arrival of foreign crews could 
change this arctic outpost but dicksons city fathers regard an 
international port as a distant prospect 
such decisions are in the hands of the mainlanders said 
svetkov referring to those who live beyond the tundra 
for now dicksons residents appear content to bear with the 
hardships to keep the sea lanes open and gather data from eight 
weather research stations drifting in the arctic ocean

its not so cold here said 20yearold marina rovenska 
its just boring miss rovenska a clerk at dicksons shopping 
center came here with her parents from the ukraine eight years ago 
she and a friend yelena cherevik said young workers flock to 
perlovskys bar several times a week for the best dickson has in 
social life 
perlovsky a 36yearold native who returned after a few years 
as a seaman in odessa on the black sea where its warm is a 
respected businessman among dicksons youth who are paid double 
salaries for working under hardship perlovsky bought a germanmade 
video deck last year for a 10000 rubles 16000 two years his 
salary as a state bartender from a friend of a friend of a 
diplomat his tapes recorded from finnish television or soviet 
film libraries have been collected through a farflung network of 
friends and connections his library of about 100 titles cost him 
about 100 rubles 160 each 
while perlovsky is a state bartender he is a private video 
operator at the coupole a woodpaneled anteroom of cafeteria 
no 1 he operates in part na levo literally on the left a 
russian expression for doing things outside the law but his video 
bar exemplifies the freer hand soviets have in remote communities 
to bend the rules to make their system work 
for 150 rubles 250 or three times the price of a movie 
ticket elsewhere in the soviet union a dickson resident can settle 
down at perlovskys bar and watch a soviet film classic or western 
rock video once everyone has agreed on the nights selection 
liquor appears to be in greater supply here than in most areas of 
the soviet union again illustrating a concession from moscow 
where gorbachevs tough antidrinking crusade has made alcohol both 
expensive and hard to find 
some guys come in here and drink themselves into such a state 
that they have to be helped home said perlovsky who as a former 
national rowing champion is equal to the task of bouncer but i 
wouldnt say we have an acute problem with drunkenness at least 
not like in central russia where guys will drink up their last 
kopek most people just want a place where they can gather 
older residents cite its advantages over other areas of the 
country crime rates are low they say because thieves cant flee 
the city and stolen goods are hard to hide in housing that is 
mostly communal 
the north is like a sifter observed gennady ilchenko the 
director of the weather station who has lived in dickson for 37 
years those who are weak or lazy or untalented fall out 
quickly 
schoolteacher larissa duvinets a 28year resident says 
children are taught in the citys two schools to value the northern 
lifestyle and plan for futures in their parents footsteps 
but city officials concede that at least 20 percent of dicksons 
population turns over each year 
i dont think ill stay here after school days said 
13yearold sergei lutsenko as he led visitors on a tour of the 
citys threeroom museum i feel its cut off from the outside 
world 
he and his friends said they long for bigcity life with subways 
and buses and the simple pleasures of summer like swimming and

the texas hill country seemed an odd 
backdrop to talk with a man who ruled louisiana much like a king 
when he wasnt rolling dice in monte carlo and las vegas flirting 
with beautiful women or fighting off racketeering charges 
but gov edwin edwards is preparing to leave office monday and 
his texas ranch has been a hideaway used more frequently by the 
governor who became the most propular official in the bayou state 
since huey long until he was undone by the collapse of oil and 
questions about his honesty that wouldnt go away 
in a recent interview at the ranch overlooking the greenish 
waters of the south llano river edwards spoke softly about his 
political career and about leaving it all behind 
the 1400acre ranch is dotted with scrub oaks stunted by the 
scant rainfall a far cry from edwards louisiana estate with its 
massive mosscovered oaks and enough green grass in the yard to 
more than feed the 60 head of cattle barely surviving on what they 
can find here 
still the texas spread is far from the swirl of politics and 
controversy that has been his life 
edwards brother once said hes an introvert trying to be an 
extrovert 
thats accurate said edwards gently rocking and fiddling 
with the bottom button of a down jacket its almost ludicrous to 
say that but ive done a good job in overcoming it i have a basic 
tendency to get away thats why i have this ranch 
the ranch is not so much a place to relax for edwards who at 
60 still doesnt know how to take it easy 
if hes not hunting hes on that tractor or using a 
bushhog an aide told a reporter 
the reporter recalled a comment years ago by edwards 
brotherinlaw hes not relaxed like a normal frenchman 
maybe thats because hes ambitious said edwards 
motherinlaw 
edwards sprouted from impoverished south louisiana the son of a 
sharecropper education was the only escape route 
at 21 he had finished law school and six years later in 1954 
he was elected to the crowley city council from there he was 
elected to the state senate to congress and finally to the 
governors office in 1972 and again in 1976 
he never lost an election 
he was adored by the people because he brought les bons 
temps good times by prodding the legislature to tax oil at a 
percentage of value in 1973 just before prices soared government 
was on easy street and the economy was beautiful 
people were tolerant even proud of his candor when edwards 
commented that gambling turns me on they smiled when he 
flirted openly with women 
he left office after serving two consecutive terms the most 
allowed by law but returned in 1984 for an unprecedented third 
term overwhelming oneterm republican dave treen 
edwards was so powerful that while the republican served the 
populist cajun opened an unofficial governors office and began 
collecting 13 million for a campaign that kept treen looking over 
his shoulder 
edwards won with nearly 63 percent of the vote despite 
unfavorable publicity during his first two terms 
he had acknowledged receiving 20000 from a south korean 
whose dealings with congressmen and others led to the koreagate 
investigations 
he had shrugged off a book written by a former aide who 
accused edwards of selling state jobs and conquering legions of 
women 
he was investigated by the internal revenue service after all 
of the publicity about his gambling 
he was investigated during the fbi brilab probe that led 
to the conviction of a top aide 
edwards survived it all 
but in these last four years the king was felled by the 
collapse of oil prices which devastated the states economy and 
continued attacks on his honesty 
louisiana has one of the highest unemployment rates in the 
nation and the government is nearly bankrupt 
his answer to economic woes this term was a lottery and casino 
gambling something lawmakers would not buy edwards lost control 
of the legislature partly because of his two federal racketeering 
trials 
he went on trial in 1985 accused of brokering hospital permits 
obtained while in and out of office the jury was hung with all but 
two voting for acquittal 
in 1986 a second jury acquitted edwards and all other 
codefendants including his brother marion and several friends 
and aides 
i was shunned by the legislature during and between trials 
edwards said planting his boots on the ground to stop the rocking 
chair they saw how us attorney john volz used the federal 
grand juries they were scared if they can do that to you i 
dont want to be close to you there was an aura of fear in 
louisiana if volz and the other republicans could do that to me 
what could they do to legislators that was the feeling 
the polls showed that the people went along with the lottery 
idea and feeling the masses were still behind him edwards tried 
last year for a fourth term 
as a 44yearold congressman he had first swept into the 
governors office on a reform platform at age 60 he was beaten by 
buddy roemer a 44yearold congressman who used a reform platform 
complaining that edwards had given louisiana a banana republic 
image 
theres always been a mania to knock the man from the top of 
the mountain said edwards but it took them a lot of years 
its been a costly journey to the top 
in the last four years its been even worse my family has 
suffered my net worth has gone down considerably ive paid an 
awesome price onslaughts on my integrity from unfair 
investigations indictments but i think ive faced it 
realistically and altruistically 
in a 1979 interview edwards was reminded that he said that what 
he would like more than anything else is to convince people im 
honest 
i guess that is more what i would like to do now than ever 
but it seems like it is something that is going to escape me he 
said 
but i remind the people that despite all of the money spent 
all of the efforts made by people over the years theyve yet to 
prove anything 
whats going to happen now can edwards relax 
for about four days he said grinning i guess the phones 
will continue ringing people will still come to see me i feel 
nothing is going to happen with a new administration if thats 
true i will be sought out if not ill try to accept that 
in the meantime edwards will practice law with one of his sons 
and offer himself to the nations universities as a lecturer for 
5000 per appearance hell talk about legalized gambling and his 
career 
hell also hunt gamble and yes flirt 
i dont believe ive mellowed with age he said

spring has come to central alabama the 
redbuds are blooming the fire ants are pushing up fresh mounds of 
earth and jesse jackson is the peoples choice in dallas county 
where the infamous bloody sunday attack at the edmund pettus 
bridge shocked the nation 23 years ago 
jackson overwhelmed the presidential primary field here tuesday 
23 years and one day after alabama state troopers savagely beat 
black voting rights advocates attempting to march from selma to 
montgomery the episode shown on national television helped 
galvanize congress to pass the federal voting rights act later that 
year 
on tuesday jackson carried alabama by a narrow margin but he 
held better than a 5to1 edge over his nearest democratic 
challenger in dallas county where blacks constitute 55 percent of 
the 50000 residents 
the official county tally showed jackson with 4872 votes to 923 
for the runnerup sen albert gore of tennessee vice president 
george bush easily won the republican race with 1282 votes 
selma mayor joe smitherman who was serving his first term when 
bloody sunday took place said he thinks a lot of white democrats 
didnt vote but would have gone for bush if theyd been able to 
cross over however he acknowledges that blacks gave jackson an 
undeniably smashing victory in selma and dallas county 
the black community really turned out for jesse he was here a 
week before the election and i accompanied him as he walked 
through a poor black section of town said smitherman who 
admits he was a segregationist back when it was fashionable 
you had to be a segregationist to be elected in the south when 
i was starting out said the 58yearold mayor but weve 
matured ive matured we were wrong to try and deny people their 
right to vote and im sorry for what we did 
given the changes that have occurred in selma smitherman said 
its really no surprise jackson did so well 
however the man who led the bloody sunday march rep john 
lewis dga professed amazement that a black could score such a 
victory in dallas county 
to me it is simply unbelievable said lewis when contacted 
at his washington dc office when hosea williams and i led 
that march back in 1965 only 21 percent of dallas countys black 
residents were registered to vote 
since then smitherman points out a lot of the alabama river 
has flowed beneath the edmund pettus bridge 
when i was first elected mayor in 1964 only 50 percent of our 
streets were paved and less than half of our homes were connected 
to the sewage system but after 1965 we started taking advantage of 
the federal programs and grants that existed at the time now 
every street is paved and the sewage system is all over town 
also we now have an appointed black county school 
superintendent who makes more damned money than i do half of the 
city council is black and the assistant police chief is black 
blacks probably have made more progress in selma than in any other 
whitecontrolled city in the alabama 
the rev joseph rembert pastor of browns chapel where the 
bloody sunday march began acknowledges there have been changes in 
selma but he adds that whites still hold most of the power and 
that many of the changes have come about as the result of federal 
court actions initiated by blacks 
attitudes are slowly changing in selma he said but like 
most places weve still got a long way to go what we really need 
here desperately is jobs our county unemployment rate runs about 
16 percent and its probably as high as 25 percent for blacks 
rembert adds though that he would rather be one of selmas 
27000 residents than live in a big northern city like new york 
we dont have a utopia here but at least when we stage a 
protest these days nobody gets hurt blacks and whites may fight to 
the bone over an issue but when its over they also may go off and 
have lunch together and thats a big change from the past 
edwin moss one of the citys three black city councilmen said 
he has seen many changes during the 73 years he has lived in selma 
weve made some big political strides in this county and 
weve made social progress too said moss who founded and 
manages a federal credit union with a largely black membership 
now he added we need economic progress we need jobs we 
need financing for blackowned businesses 
smitherman in the midst of his sixth fouryear term agrees 
selma needs more jobs but hes obviously proud of his city with 
its wide main street and gracious neighborhoods he points out he 
couldnt be mayor without the support of both blacks and whites and 
is quick to show visitors his accomplishments in integrating 
government and improving the local standard of living 
thats why i personally like jesse jacksons message he 
said hes talking about the same things i deal with as mayor 
hes talking about jobs about the problems of working people 
about the homeless and the poor 
you know he said jesse reminds me a lot of george 
wallace 20 years ago theyre both populists 
yet he said neither he nor most other local whites voted for 
jackson last tuesday 
its funny but youll hear a group of whites talking politics 
and somebody will say jesse makes more sense than any of them 
then hell up and add that hes voting for bush or gore a blacks 
just not going to get many white votes around here not yet at 
least smitherman said i dont know why i didnt vote for 
jesse maybe its because i dont think he can win 
at present there is only one elected black county official in 
dallas county which is under a federal court mandate to create 
four voting districts two predominantly white and two 
predominantly black by the fall election 
that one black official is district judge nathaniel walker who 
left selma and got his law degree at fordham university then 
returned home walker the first black to hold countywide office 
here said he is heartened by the changes he has seen in his 
hometown 
i was among the marchers who were attacked on bloody sunday 
he said back then the courthouse was off limits for blacks it 
was a place to be feared 
but jesses victory is an example of what we were fighting 
for last tuesdays election shows that the people recognize just 
how dear is their right to vote and that theyre determined to 
exercise their franchise 
john lewis who was hospitalized for two days with injuries he 
received on bloody sunday said much the same thing 
thats what the civil rights movement was all about lewis 
said we were trying to build a biracial democracy in alabama 
and throughout the south jesse jacksons overwhelming victory in a 
place like selma proves this is possible

united auto workers president owen bieber says he 
is optimistic that early contract negotiations with chrysler corp 
will produce an early settlement and soothe chryslers bruised 
labor relations 
the uaws 140member national chrysler bargaining council 
representing 71700 chrysler workers voted thursday to grant 
chryslers request for early talks 
if i was overly pessimistic i doubt that we would have called 
the meeting today or taken the action that we did said bieber 
who along with uaw vice president marc stepp had urged the council 
approve the request 
no date has been set for the talks aimed at replacing the 
existing threeyear contract that expires sept 14 but they could 
begin as soon as late april talks usually begin in midsummer 
there will be no strike deadline but the two sides will set a 
target date for a settlement when they decide a starting date for 
the talks 
the company is hopeful that a new contract that is equitable 
to both sides can be reached expeditiously said chrysler 
spokesman lloyd northard 
bieber said the union will seek a twoyear contract so that in 
1990 all big three automakers contracts can be negotiated 
together for the first time since the union reopened its chrysler 
contract in 1979 to make concessions needed by the company 
last fall the union negotiated a jobprotecting industry 
pattern contract at ford motor co the contract quickly was 
accepted at gm leaving only chrysler workers without its 
protections this year 
the union would not have agreed to early talks if chrysler had 
not indicated it was willing to accept the pattern as a basis for 
negotiations giving chrysler workers 
the relationship between the uaw and chrysler has been badly 
injured in the past few months by chryslers abortive attempt to 
sell its 28000worker acustar inc parts subsidiary 
to block the plan which the union said was a threat to 
companywide job security angry workers prepared for a series of 
crippling plantbyplant strikes and stopped participating in 
critical unionmanangement programs for improving productivity and 
quality 
last week chrysler backed down and stepp moved quickly to 
settle a dispute at a key stamping plant in sterling heights where 
the first strike was to occur weekend talks brought a settlement 
early monday morning 
but stepp didnt tell workers to renew participation the joint 
programs until the thursday meeting after he received a written 
promise that top chrysler executives will resume monthly meetings 
with top union officials 
in the past two years the chrysleruaw round table where 
union and company officials had consulted on major decisions since 
its creation in 1979 met only once stepp said 
stepp said the lack of round table meetings indicated chrysler 
had changed its attitude toward its workers for the worse 
with the agreement of chrysler chief negotiator anthony st john 
to resume the meetings stepp said he believes workers anger will 
ease 
the two sides still must work out an acustarrelated sore point 
chrysler said it will close four acustar plants if it cant sell 
them within 18 months the uaw wants to protect the plants 2000 
workers 
during the week of march 20 national union officials and the 
elected 10member rankandfile chrysler negotiating team will draw 
up their demands and strategies for fitting established auto 
industry contracts to chrysler 
the gm and ford contracts prohibit plant closings unless 
production is cut because of slow sales make the transfer of work 
to outside suppliers more difficult and slow the rate of attrition 
they also contain a profitsharing formula based on the 
companies us performance at ford workers reaped average 
profitsharing checks of more than 3700 apiece from fords record 
46 billion profit 
chrysler workers have no profitsharing formula and instead 
receive a 500 bonus annually regardless of their companys 
performance

companies making computer hardware and 
communications equipment may be growing rapidly but a private 
survey released today finds many have been less profitable than the 
general run of american companies during recent years 
intense competition from japan and other foreign rivals is one 
reason for the profit squeeze on those companies according to 
harvey poppel a partner in broadview associates of fort lee nj 
the investment banking firm that conducted the survey 
a broadview survey of 269 usbased hardware and equipment 
companies found they had a median return on equity of 65 percent 
in 1987 with a large number of poorly performing small companies 
dragging down the results 
poppel said the median return on equity for major american 
companies is typically about 11 or 12 percent 
return on equity is a widely used measure of a companys 
performance it is the companys profit as a percentage of its 
shareholders equity or net worth 
when the survey results were adjusted to give the heaviest 
weight to the companies with the biggest stock market values such 
as highly profitable international business machines corp the 
average return on equity was 107 percent roughly in line with the 
average for american business 
broadview associates specializes in mergers and acquisitions in 
the computer software and services industry poppel said a survey 
of nearly 200 of those companies found their return on equity was 
above average about 186 percent last year 
poppel cited several reasons for the difficulties of the 
computer hardware and communications equipment companies 
japan and other aggressive competitors are willing to accept 
lower profit margins to gain shares of the world market 
many nations protect their home markets and domestic companies 
especially in the case of western europe with telecommunications 
equipment 
products have short life cycles giving companies only a short 
time to recoup their heavy investments 
it is easy for new companies to enter the market especially at 
the low end because the basic components such as computer chips 
are readily available 
in contrast poppel said the information services companies have 
higher return on equity because their offerings cannot easily be 
rendered obsolete with new technology and are protected by high 
barriers to entry of new competitors 
prices of products such as software and database services can be 
kept relatively high and companies have fewer expensive assets such 
as factories poppel noted

it was a marketing phenomenon that turned into 
the focus of an international battle with multibilliondollar 
implications 
within a year of introducing its 4500 pony subcompact to north 
america in 1984 hyundai corp of south korea captured 7 percent of 
the canadian market it then invaded the united states and sold 
168182 of its excels in just 10 months 
but were the koreans exploiting a market void or unfairly 
dumping the autos at belowcost prices in order to grab a share of 
the lucrative market 
the canadian import tribunal is considering evidence from four 
weeks of hearings that concluded thursday over claims by domestic 
automakers such as general motors corp and ford motor co of 
unfair pricing by hyundai hyundai could be slapped with a 26 
percent duty if found to be dumping cars 
the case has worldwide implications as americas car giants 
compete against asian rivals whove grabbed more than 25 percent of 
their auto market 
a ruling is expected march 23 and both sides have the right to 
appeal 
in antidumping hearings held in ottawa gm and ford 
subsidiaries in canada accused hyundai of purposely setting 
belowcost prices to grab a niche in the competitive smallcar 
market 
the carmakers asked the canadian import tribunal to uphold 
revenue canadas preliminary finding last november that hyundai has 
been dumping pony excel and stellar hatchbacks and sedans in 
canada at an average 26 percent cheaper than they cost in south 
korea 
a 26percent duty would add more than 1000 to the price of 
hyundais in 182 showrooms across canada and could lead to similar 
cases against other foreign makes 
gm and ford told the tribunal they were forced to slash prices 
and offer cash rebates in order to compete with hyundais 
bargainbasement approach 
future injury is going to take the form of reduced production 
reduced employment and reduced utilization of productive 
capacity penny bonner legal counsel for the two companies 
testified thursday 
hyundai acknowledged using canada as a spearhead to penetrate 
the american market but argued that it never hurt gm or ford 
because the rearwheeldrive pony had no direct competition at the 
bottom end of the market 
the pony was swept along because in a real sense there was no 
competition said hyundai lawyer richard gottlieb he termed the 
success of the nice little car a fluke coming right at the end 
of a recession when american carmakers virtually had given up on 
the subcompact market 
in surprising testimony on thursday lawyers for the canadian 
governments consumer affairs department supported hyundai they 
said the korean company answered a need ignored by north american 
manufacturers thereby helping consumers 
hyundai zoomed to a 21 percent share of the smallcar market in 
canada in 1985 with sales of 79072 ponies and stellars 
but since the preliminary antidumping ruling the canadian 
subsidiary has been in a tailspin and some dealers have resigned 
according to company spokesman greg young 
it destroyed us in the marketplace in terms of public 
perception and confidence in the product young said 
while still the thirdranked import behind honda and toyota 
hyundai expects to sell just 45000 cars this year led by the 
excel which starts at 5835 
people may say i like the honda civic but before making up 
my mind im going to take a look at the excel but the honda 
salesman just says why bother because of the possible duties 
young said 
but he said the bad publicity has not reached the united states 
and american hyundai sales are still climbing after reaching 
263610 cars last year 
to save the day in canada hyundai has launched a here to stay 
and proud of it tv and newspaper advertising campaign 
it pledged to proceed with a 259 million manufacturing plant in 
bromont quebec and 16 million parts factory in newmarket 
ontario scheduled to open later this year the plants will create 
1300 jobs and give hyundai the capacity to make 100000 newmodel 
compacts a year 
the plants will expand a canadian car industry that grew out of 
the milestone 1965 auto pact with the united states which permits 
vehicles and parts to move dutyfree across the border dominated 
by gm ford and chrysler subsidiaries the canadian car and truck 
plants employ 140000 workers with another 400000 related jobs 
young said hyundai will remain in business here but may be 
forced to reassess operations if antidumping duties are imposed 
it may be step one against all import car companies against 
all competition he said

get back into the entertainment business by making an unsolicited 
7701 million offer for troubled lorimar telepictures corp and 
has indicated he may be willing to go even higher 
davis 17pershare cash buyout offer was disclosed thursday 
only three days after lorimar announced it was holding preliminary 
talks about a possible acquisition by new yorkbased entertainment 
conglomerate warner communications inc 
a source close to the situation indicated davis the former 
owner of 20th century fox film corp was very serious about 
acquiring lorimar the culver citybased entertainment concern best 
known as the producer of such television programs as dallas and 
knots landing 
lorimar appeared to give short shrift to the proposal stating 
that it would bear davis letter in mind 
lorimar stock rose 1 to close at 1537 on the american stock 
exchange after the announcement of davis offer the company has 
453 million common shares outstanding 
davis made his offer in a letter to lorimar management 
on monday lorimar and warner announced they had entered 
preliminary merger talks over the weekend 
analysts have suggested lorimars stock is worth between 14 and 
20 per share 
lorimar is a leading producer of original television 
programming but in recent years has been troubled as its ambitious 
plans to expand into other areas disintegrated sometimes causing 
the company to incur losses or heavy costs that depressed earnings 
for the first nine months of its current fiscal year lorimar 
posted a loss of 826 million on revenue of 6168 million the 
deficit included 45 million in writedowns on five movies and 22 
million in reserves for possible future losses in its homevideo 
unit 
the company replaced managements of both the movie and 
homevideo units 
for the fiscal year ended last march 31 the company lost 586 
million mostly because of restructuring costs on revenue of 
7662 million 
davis has been seeking to get back into the entertainment 
industry since selling fox to media magnate rupert murdoch in 1985 
for 575 million davis had owned fox for four years but the 
company was beset by persistent losses 
last year he made an unsuccessful 3219 million bid for the 
906 percent he didnt already own of texasbased spectradyne inc 
the nations largest supplier of cable television and payperview 
movies for hotels 
on wednesday four disgruntled shareholders filed a class action 
lawsuit against lorimar in federal court alleging the company 
overstated its income and net worth and did not reveal problems 
with its homevideo unit thereby causing investors to pay more for 
stock then they believed they should have

afg industries inc is left with a single suitor 
following an investment partnerships decision not to top the 940 
million buyout bid the glassmaker already has accepted from its 
chairman 
forstmann little amp co which previously indicated it might be 
willing to make a higher offer said thursday it decided against 
making an offer based on its review of afgs internal records and 
its adherence to strict acquisition criteria 
a company led by afgs founder and chairman rd hubbard 
stated from afg headquarters in irvine calif that it intended to 
proceed with its earlier offer to take afg private in buyout valued 
at 33 a share 
afgs stock finished down 5 a share at 3162 in trading on 
the new york stock exchange 
larry selwitz a securities analyst for the investment firm 
bateman eichler hill richards in los angeles said the odds 
favored hubbards bid for the company i would be really 
hardpressed to see who might come into it now he said 
another analyst donald pattison of cyrus j lawrence morgan 
grenfell in new york said forstmann probably decided against 
proceeding because of the strong possibility that hubbard would 
leave the company hed go off with his own company and probably 
eat their lunch pattison said 
forstmann little announced march 2 that it proposed paying more 
than 33 a share in cash for all of afgs common stock subject to 
a review of afgs internal corporate information and meeting with 
afg management 
on thursday forstmann little said it had completed the review 
that afg had promptly furnished requested confidential information 
and that afg management had cooperated fully in the review 
based on this review and forstmann littles adherence to 
strict acquisition criteria it has determined that it will not 
make an offer to acquire afg the new yorkbased leveraged buyout 
specialist said 
the firm declined to elaborate 
afg announced feb 25 that it had agreed to a buyout by a new 
company headed by hubbard that would pay 33 a share in cash for 94 
percent of afgs common stock and 33 per share in preferred stock 
or a combination of cash and stock for the rest of the shares 
afg has 285 million common shares outstanding 
afg is one of the leading manufacturers of window glass and has

an impending battle for media 
general inc is heating up with television producer burt sugarman 
boosting his stake in the company and signaling a fight to force a 
shareholder vote on his 175 billion buyout bid 
sugarman said thursday that two companies he controls boosted 
their stake in media general the virginiabased broadcasting and 
publishing corporation to 10 percent from 98 percent 
sugarman also repeated his contention that media generals board 
of directors was legally bound to put his buyout plan to a 
shareholder vote 
however media general disputed sugarmans contentions on how 
the companys two classifications of stock would be allowed to vote 
on a merger 
media general has 28 million shares of class a common stock 
entitled to one vote each and 559168 class b shares that have 
disproportionate voting rights and elect seven of the companys 10 
directors 
the family of media generals chairman d tennant bryan owns 
71 percent of the companys class b stock 
shortly after sugarman made his 6150pershare takeover offer 
late last month the bryan family said it wasnt interested in 
selling the company 
in a letter sent thursday to media generals president and chief 
executive officer james s evans sugarman contended that under 
media generals charter all shareholders should have equal voting 
rights in deciding on a proposed acquisition of the company by 
someone holding at least 10 percent of its stock 
in all other cases the class b stock would retain its special 
voting rights sugarman contended 
sugarman reiterated that if media general directors failed to 
put the proposed merger before shareholders they will be 
breaching their fiduciary duty 
media general disputed sugarmans claims saying company 
counsel found sugarmans legal reasoning incorrect 
media general said that under its charter any merger would 
require the vote of twothirds of each class of stock in addition 
to the charter requirement the company said virginia law requires 
that a merger be approved by more than twothirds of the class b 
stock 
media general owns a number of daily papers including the 
richmond va timesdispatch and news leader the winstonsalem 
nc journal and the tampa fla tribune plus 32 weeklie in 
southern california and a 40 percent interest in garden state

the credo of banana republics new travel 
magazine is simple people shouldnt travel halfway around the 
world only to find the same hamburger joints theyve got back home 
we are on the brink of becoming mcglobe warns mel ziegler

of trips a quarterly launched nationwide this week 
ziegler says 300000 customers already have expressed interest 
in 10ayear subscriptions to the magazine which promises to 
lead you down the back alleys of cairo onto forbidden islands or 
through your own hometown in search of stories that will transcend 
the distinctions between traveler and fantasist 
we wanted to publish the worlds first honest travel

travel magazines you get the idea travel is painless nothing ever 
goes wrong we all know nobody ever takes a trip like that

is aimed at the same affluent urbanites who made such a success of 
the 10yearold adventurewear company which was sold to the gap 
clothing chain for an undisclosed sum in 1983 
it also attempts to latch onto a recent boom in travel magazines 
that has seen a handful of new publications in recent months 
the inaugural issue is a trek into the offbeat and bizarre

a 57 chevy can get you just about anything in burma 
also included is a section where worldweary travelers pass on 
tips to surviving off the beaten path

the union representing 6700 northwest 
airlines flight attendants is warning travelers about the 
possibility of a strike during the busy spring break 
as the travel increases over spring break and easter it is to 
our advantage to keep ready for a strike dennis quinn the 
teamsters national strike coordinator told a news conference 
thursday 
however he added we have not set a firm strike deadline at 
this time 
quinns comments came as the union termed unacceptable the 
contract which northwest plans to impose april 1 
the minneapolis airline has been free to impose the contract 
since a feb 26 strike deadline passed and the union has been free 
to strike 
terry erskine northwests vice president of law and labor 
relations said he would not rule out making changes in the 
contract before april 1 if the union comes forward with suggestions 
but quinn said northwest intends to force a strike it is 
moving into a situation where there are no other alternatives but a 
work stoppage and that it is a very good reason for you to 
indicate yes we are serious 
northwest spokesman redmond tyler denounced the teamster 
announcement as rhetoric and said spring travelers would 
encounter no problems even in the event of a strike 
continue to plan your travel because we anticipate no 
disruption in service tyler said we regret any attempt to 
intimidate we are disappointed our employees would take this 
tactic to confuse their companys customers 
meanwhile a taped message on a teamsters hotline for flight 
attendants criticized the contract and said the companys move did 
not end the unions right to strike 
northwest assumes you will accept this substandard contract 
please show them how wrong they are dottie malinsky president 
of teamsters local 2747 which represents the minneapolis unit 
told attendants on the taped message 
this company action will backfire on them nickel and diming 
the employees is not going to change the bad management at 
northwest she said 
teamsters have called a strategy meeting monday in washington 
dc for local union officers and strike captains at northwest 
leaders of the unions representing northwest ground workers and 
pilots are expected to attend that meeting malinsky said 
claudia bushbaum secretarytreasurer for teamsters local 2747 
said the airlines offer to negotiate on the contract was 
meaningless northwest is unwilling to bend on the issue of when to 
elevate lowerpaid employees who are on what the company and union 
call a b pay scale to higher pay scales she said 
if the company does not come back to the table and negotiate 
and move off of their position of the extended b pay scale there 
is all likelihood we will strike when the time is right bushbaum 
said theyre willing to sit across the table from you and say 
theyre going to negotiate but sitting across the table from you 
and saying no is not negotiations and that is exactly the way 
northwest negotiates when we talk about the b pay scale 
under the new contract northwest says union membership would no 
longer be a condition of employment bushbaum who called that a 
unionbusting tactic said teamsters attorneys were reviewing 
the legality of this action 
erskine said wednesday that if attendants decide to strike now 
the airline is prepared to hire permanent replacements

labor secretary ann mclaughlin today said a 
proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to 505 an hour over 
the next four years may sound like the right thing to do but it 
actually would cause a loss of jobs 
mrs mclaughlin said the proposed increase likely to be 
approved next week by the house education and labor committee 
would be particularly hard on young people with no skills who are 
seeking their first jobs 
this is a tough one 505 an hour im afraid would make 
almost any economist have some jitters mrs mclaughlin said in 
an interview on nbctvs today show the body of economic 
thinking is that the increase in the minimum wage while 
wellintentioned and it sounds like the right thing to do actually 
will cause a loss of jobs particularly impacting on young people 
who need to get into the workforce 
education and labor committee chairman augustus f hawkins 
dcalif scheduled a session next wednesday for final action on 
the minimum wage bill the panel had been unable on thursday to 
address all the amendments to a proposal that was approved by the 
house labor standards subcommittee a week ago 
the subcommittee approved an increase from 335 to 465 an 
hour over a threeyear period with a 50cent raise in 1989 and a 
40cent jump in both 1990 and 1991 
during the full committees hearing rep carl c perkins 
dky proposed an amendment for an increase of another 40 cents in 
1992 in an effort to keep the federal minimum at approximately one 
half of the nations average wage 
the committee approved the perkins amendment on a vote of 1814 
with only two democrats reps austin j murphy of pennsylvania and 
timothy j penny of minnesota joining republicans in opposing the 
proposal 
murphy chairman of the labor standards subcommittee said his 
panel had fashioned a measure which would be acceptable to the full 
house and the senate and possibly the white house 
we dont know what impact the fourth year will have on the 
loss of jobs murphy said 
rep stephen j solarz dny however read from a letter 
written to hawkins by labor secretary ann mclaughlin who said 
senior white house advisers would recommend to president reagan 
that he veto any legislation increasing the minimum wage 
it doesnt matter what we do the executive will be against 
it he said 
rep dick armey rtex who opposes any increase proposed an 
amendment to the perkins measure to raise the base to 20 an hour 
but withdrew it after hawkins called it absurd 
the committee approved 2013 an amendment by rep tommy f 
robinson dark to increase the tip credit for restaurant 
employers 
current law allows employers of workers who regularly receive 
tips such as waiters and waitresses to count the tips as earned 
wages equivalent to 40 percent of the minimum wage 
thus a restaurant owner could pay a worker 201 an hour with 
the remaining 134 40 percent of todays 335anhour minimum 
wage supposed to come from tips 
the robinson proposal would increase the credit to 50 percent 
the senate has a companion bill sponsored by sen edward m 
kennedy dmass chairman of the labor and human resources 
committee which raises the minimum wage to 465 an hour over a 
threeyear period

retail sales boosted by strength in autos 
rose 06 percent in february following a january decline the 
government reported today 
the commerce department said that retail sales rose a seasonally 
adjusted 714 million to 12799 billion last month 
while the february increase was generally in line with 
expectations the government revised the january report to show a 
small decline of 02 percent instead of an originally reported 
increase of 05 percent 
even with the january decline analysts said the retail sales 
report generally reflected that the october stock market crash has 
had little effect on consumer buying plans 
ever since the record 508point drop in stock prices which 
occurred on oct 19 economists have been closely watching to see 
whether the consumer sector would weaken 
since consumer spending accounts for twothirds of overall 
economic activity any significant faltering in this area could 
topple the country into a recession 
continued strong gains in employment growth have apparently 
calmed initial jitters over the stock market many economists have 
recently revised up their growth forecasts for 1988 
the february report said that retail sales rose to the highest 
monthly total since august 1987 
much of the strength came from a 16 percent rise in auto sales 
which followed an even stronger 2 percent increase in new car sales 
in january 
without the gain in autos which accounted for almost onefourth 
of total sales last month retail sales would have risen a smaller 
03 percent in february 
the important general merchandise category which includes 
department store sales suffered a 16 percent decline in sales in 
february following a small 01 percent drop in january sales 
sales of all durable goods items expected to last three or more 
years were up 16 percent in february while sales of nondurable 
goods edged down 01 percent 
in the durable goods category sales at building materials and 
hardware stores jumped a sharp 23 percent 
sales at furniture and appliance stores were up 03 percent in 
february following an even stronger 27 percent january increase 
sales at specialty clothing stores climbed 06 percent in 
february only a partial rebound following a giant 33 percent 
january decline 
sales at gasoline stations fell 16 percent in february while 
sales at restaurants edged up 01 percent and sales at drug stores 
posted a 06 percent increase 
sales at grocery stores enjoyed a 07 percent rise in sales in 
february reversing a 06 percent january decline

kuwait said friday that it has raised its stake in 
british petroleum co plc to 2125 percent breaching the level bp 
has said was acceptable 
the kuwait investment office an agency set up for the purpose 
of bp investments said it intended to push the stake to 225 
percent when market conditions permit the group said it now holds 
1269 billion bp shares 
bp chairman sir peter walters said last month that 20 percent 
was an acceptable holding 
bp has declined to comment on the kuwaiti groups latest 
disclosure 
in february the kio declared a 1953 percent stake or 1165 
billion shares 
analysts say bp and the british government have failed to obtain 
kuwaiti assurances that it will stop buying the shares 
i think bp will be very unhappy about the increased stake 
said chris grudniewicz an analyst at smith new court research 
bp will probably now try to get the british government to lean on 
the kuwaitis to get some assurance theyll stop buying 
recent heavy turnover in bp new shares had already raised 
speculation that the kio was building on its stake in bp

manufacturers hanover corp the nations 
sixthlargest bank holding company says it expects to net at least 
807 million this year and that the number would be much higher if 
brazil resumes payments on its debt 
brazil is negotiating terms of an agreement to restart those 
payments which it suspended last year should that happen 
manufacturers hanovers net earnings would kick up by another 
150 million after tax james hambleton a senior vice president 
of the bank said today 
in its annual report released thursday the bank said it will 
pick up about 230 million from the sale of undervalued assets 
in 1988 
operating earnings should total at least 377 million including 
95 million after a restructuring announced earlier this year 
according to figures contained in the report 
in addition it said it planned to apply about 200 million of 
tax benefits to its 1988 balance sheet the benefits come from 342 
million in tax benefits remaining from the 17 billion addition to 
loanloss reserves last year 
the huge loanloss provision which was made to cover shaky 
third world debt was largely responsible for a 114 billion loss 
in 1987 several other major banks also suffered losses or 
decreased earnings due to the foreign debt crisis 
manufacturers hanover said that as a result of the sale of 
undervalued assets which it did not name and the tax 
benefits it expected to improve shareholders equity 
shareholders equity is a corporations net worth after 
subtracting all liabilities 
restoring common shareholders equity to 4 percent the ratio 
prior to the reserving action is our overriding priority the 
company said

the us geological survey has lowered its 
estimates of undiscovered onshore oil and gas in the united states 
by about 40 percent but industry spokesmen question the data 
the american gas association says the government is not counting 
all the different potential reservoirs and the american petroleum 
institute says the new numbers for oil are just another in a long 
line of underestimates 
terry uhl the gas associations spokesman calls it 
misinformation and disinformation to say onshore undiscovered 
reserves amount to 254 trillion cubic feet down from 427 trillion 
cubic feet 
the association uses the estimate of 400 trillion cubic feet 
from the potential gas committee an industry panel operated by the 
colorado school of mines 
ozzie girard the geological surveys deputy assistant director 
for engineering geology said thursday he doubted there was much 
difference between the survey and the gas committee estimates once 
adjustments for comparability are made 
the survey has not counted gas in certain shales tight sands or 
reservoirs of less than 5 billion cubic feet all of which are 
counted by the committee hardtoexploit tight sands formations 
probably hold 100 trillion cubic feet girard said 
no such adjustments can account for the change in estimates of 
undiscovered onshore oil 
the survey said undiscovered oil likely is between 196 billion 
barrels and 519 billion barrels with the best estimate at 334 
billion barrels the range in 1981 was 417 billion barrels to 71 
billion barrels with the best estimate at 546 billion barrels 
in 1981 the survey relied heavily on the judgment of expert 
geologists in the last two reports the survey has been able to 
use detailed drilling data from the entire country girard said 
charles dibona president of the petroleum institute said the 
nation has produced three times the oil estimated by a presidential 
commission in 1952 in the category of oil remaining to be 
discovered 
you never know until you drill dibona said 
most of the change girard said resulted from drilling 
disappointments in 1981 there had been major new finds in the 
overthrust belt east of the rockies and government geologists 
thought the sky was the limit but drilling failures since then 
have reduced expectations 
also some pools of oil have moved from the undiscovered to 
the discovered category 
also the price has fallen sharply the 1981 study used 30 a 
barrel the new study assumes a price of 18 a barrel certainly 
there was some effect from the lower price said girard but he 
could not quantify it 
this could mean lower estimates for offshore oil which the 
minerals management service sister agency in the interior 
department to the geological survey estimated in 1985 at 122 
billion barrels down from 27 billion barrels in 1981 
tom derocco spokesman for the service said new offshore 
estimates expected next month were made on the assumption that oil 
costs 18 a barrel the 1985 estimates assumed 29 a barrel 
he declined to say what the new estimates would be but did say 
theres no question economics has a lot to do with this 
a higher price for oil makes pools with more expensive 
production costs profitable to drill

oil prices may be headed higher again after 
months of declines amid swelling inventories and lackluster demand 
analysts say prospects of good summer demand and indications 
that major producers might take action to help curb the recent 
slide should help boost prices in coming months 
unconfirmed reports that the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries was studying a plan to shave 850000 barrels from its 
daily production sent futures contracts soaring on thursday and 
that rally continued today 
near midday on the new york mercantile exchange contracts for 
april delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark us 
crude stood at 1619 per 42gallon barrel up 19 cents from 
thursday when the price closed up 51 cents at 1600 
refined products also built on thursdays strong advance 
wholesale heating oil up 090 cent thursday stood at 4444 cents 
per gallon up another 051 cent wholesale unleaded gasoline stood 
at 4555 cents per gallon up 041 cent after leaping 114 cents 
per gallon to close at 4514 cents thursday 
james steel an analyst at refco inc commodities said traders 
were encouraged by reports that opec was considering cutbacks even 
though cartel officials later denied that the purported idea of 5 
percent output cuts for all 13 members except iraq was getting 
serious consideration 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries also indicated 
that its pricing committee was unlikely to meet soon despite calls 
by member venezuela for a meeting 
but steel said futures traders pushed prices higher because the 
reports suggested the cartel was at least taking some action to 
deal with the declines before they started getting out of hand 
in the persian gulf for example crude recently has been 
selling at levels between 13 and 14 per barrel far below opecs 
18perbarrel target while in the united states west texas 
intermediate has been bouncing in the 15to16 range after 
selling near 18 in january 
analysts have blamed the slump on sluggish worldwide demand and 
swelling inventories worsened by an unusually warm winter in 
europe 
some opec members desperate to preserve their market shares 
have aggravated the decline by discounting prices to lure customers 
away from opec competitors and nopec countries such as mexico 
britain norway and a host of other smaller nations 
dillard spriggs president of the petroleum analysis ltd 
consulting firm said crude prices could fall another dollar in two 
weeks if world production does not slow down quickly 
in a worstcase scenario buyers might then disappear to wait 
for even lower prices heightening downward price pressure 
but chances are probably pretty good theyll rein it in 
spriggs said citing prospects for increased summer demand i 
think were in this cycle of upanddown that will go on until 
about 1990 
analysts said opecs problem was that the production quotas the 
cartel set at its december meeting simply were too high 
since december opecs official aggregate quota has stood at 
175 million barrels a day spriggs said the cartel would have to 
cut production to about 168 million barrels daily to match demand 
and bring prices back to its 18perbarrel target 
as a result cartel members had to discount the extra barrels to 
sell them said ed krapels of the washingtonbased energy security 
analysis inc consulting firm 
still krapels said the worst is over because demand 
should pick up during the summer driving season 
we expect the situation to be a little easier for opec to 
handle in the next three months than in the last three he said 
at the oppenheimer amp co securities firm oil analyst paul ting 
said he also believed oil prices will head higher continuing in a 
cycle of strengths and weakness 
opec is all too aware of the billions of dollars of income it 
lost by casting off production constraints in 1986 he said 
back in 1985 nobody in his right mind would have thought oil 
could drop below 18 a barrel they got quite a surprise when it 
got down to 8 i think theyre not likely to repeat that again 
ting said 
i think theyre going to get their acts together because 
they really cant live at prices significantly below 18 for a long 
time he said

while the market for new stocks has turned 
chilly since black monday last oct 19 wall street has found 
strong demand for one category of new issue closedend bond funds 
in the first two months of 1988 standard amp poors reports 
investors snapped up more than 35 billion in shares of these 
investments 
on friday massachusetts financial services of boston added 2 
billion more to the total with the debut of its mfs intermediate 
income trust in what stands as the largest initial public stock 
offering ever 
the attraction of these funds is not the hope of spectacular 
growth or quick trading profits but rather yields as high as the 
10 percent to 11 percent range 
there is no denying the appeal of such returns especially in a 
period when interest rates have been generally declining pushing 
the yield available on longterm government bonds below 85 percent 
but some analysts wonder whether all the eager buyers look 
beyond the yield to gain a full understanding of this particular 
breed of security and how it has often behaved in the past 
a closedend fund operates very much like a mutual fund with 
one very important difference 
mutual funds stand continuously ready to sell new shares and 
redeem old ones at a price that is determined by the net asset 
value of their portfolios on any given day 
shares of closedend funds by contrast are traded like any 
other stock on an exchange or in the overthecounter market 
the number of shares remains fixed except for special occasions 
on which the fund might decide to increase it with a new offering 
or reduce it by buying in some of its stock 
so while the operating performance of a mutual fund is the sole 
determinant of its price a closedend funds price is also 
influenced by supply and demand forces in the open market 
its shares can trade at a premium above net asset value or a 
discount below net asset value 
during periods of strength in fixedincome markets such as at 
present some bond funds may temporarily sell at a premium to 
nav standard amp poors analysts observe in the firms weekly 
publication the outlook 
if history is any guide however the premiums tend to shrink 
and give way to discounts once interest rates begin to rise 
closedend funds of all types have enjoyed a revival of interest 
in the past few years fund managers say they like the format 
because it allows them to pursue their investment strategies 
undisturbed by the ebb and flow of money that can occur in mutual 
funds 
in theory at least a popular mutual fund may have to make 
bigger or riskier bets than it would like when money pours into its 
coffers conversely it may have to sell securities it would rather 
keep when redemptions increase 
the recent evidence lends some support to this view sampp quotes 
statistics from lipper analytical services showing an average total 
return of 85 percent over the last five years for closedend bond 
funds 
in the same period a comparable group of fixedincome mutual 
funds averaged a total return of 72 percent 
nevertheless veteran observers of closedend funds say when 
you are approached by a broker recommending a new fund it makes 
sense to look at the similar alternatives that may be available in 
existing funds 
says sampp consider acquiring a closedend fund in the 
aftermarket when premiums often shrink after a few months and you 
need pay only a normal brokerage commission and not a builtin 
initial underwriting fee of about 7 percent

commission macy indicated 29 billion in federated assets would 
be sold if its bid is successful macy said the nondepartment 
store divisions would be put up for sale as well as certain other

analysts believe macy would sell two department store divisions 
abraham amp straus and richs which directly compete with macy 
stores

union meatpackers say they will appeal a 
federal court verdict that found illegal a sixmonth strike outside 
john morrell amp cos sioux falls plant last year which erupted in 
violence several times 
a jury in a 40 million lawsuit brought by the company against 
local 304a of the united food and commercial workers ruled thursday 
that union members refusal to cross a picket line set up by 
members of another local was a violation of their contract 
a new jury will be picked this summer or fall to decide the 
amount of damages if any that are due morrell 
union officials are confident they will win on appeal allen 
zack a spokesman in washington 
the jury had been asked to determine whether a may 1 walkout at 
the sioux falls plant was a sympathy strike and whether the current 
contract allowed the strike 
about 2500 local 304a members in sioux falls refused to cross a 
picket line set up may 1 by striking morrell workers from sioux 
city iowa 
the strike led to rockthrowing vandalism and other incidents 
of picketline violence during its early days a state judge issued 
an injunction against the union because of the violence 
the company argued that the work stoppage was a primary or 
economic strike and not a sympathy strike and that the strikers 
broke their contract because they were concerned about possible 
wage cuts 
the jury agreed with the unions contention that the work 
stoppage was a sympathy strike but it agreed with the companys 
position that all strikes are illegal under morrells contract with 
local 304a 
union leaders testified that the nostrike clause in the 
contract prohibited sioux falls workers from striking over issues 
in their contract but that the may 1 strike was not over the sioux 
falls pact 
morrell hired replacement workers at both its sioux falls and 
sioux city plants 
us district judge richard battey of rapid city presided

former merchant banker lord patrick spens was 
freed on 920000 bail raised by two friends after appearing in 
court friday to hear charges related to the guinness financial 
scandal 
spens a former managing director of merchant bankers henry 
ansbacher and co ltd was arrested and charged thursday for his 
alleged role in one of britains largest financial scandals 
he was ordered to appear in court again april 12 along with four 
others charged so far in the affair surrender his passport to 
police and not to contact employees from the ansbacher group 
two business friends alan lewis the chairman of a textiles 
company and charles longbottom former chairman of an ansbacher 
subsidiary paid spens bail the british domestic news agency 
press association reported 
police are investigating guinness tactics during its 4 billion 
1986 takeover of distillers co plc a scotch whisky and gin maker 
in what was then britains biggest acquisition ever 
spens 45 resigned from henry ansbacher in january 1987 under 
pressure from the bank of england and told reporters his alleged 
role in the guinness affair was perceived as an error of judgment 
he was subsequently charged in two counts with involvement in 
the improper payment of an interestfree loan of 14 million from 
guinness to ansbachers to fund the buying of more than 2 million 
shares in the brewing giant 
two other counts allege falsification of a document for 
ansbachers and conspiracy to create a false or misleading 
impression of the market value of guinness shares 
guinness has admitted arranging the allegedly illegal repurchase 
of its stock in an apparent effort to boost the price and make its 
cash and stock offer for distillers more attractive than a rival 
bid from argyll group plc a supermarket operator

koppers co friday sued shearson lehman hutton 
inc and british investor brian beazer accusing them of violating 
securities laws in trying to acquire the pittsburghbased chemicals 
and construction company 
koppers said it was attempting to break up an ongoing illegal 
scheme to acquire control of koppers in blatant violation of 
the disclosure requirements of securities laws 
koppers asked the court to block the shearson and a 
beazercontrolled investor group from acquiring any more of the 
companys stock and to award damages over the alleged manipulation 
of the stock 
bns partners on march 3 offered 45 per common share and 10775 
per preferred share or 126 billion for shares it did not already 
control the offer is scheduled to expire march 30 
bns is a general partnership 49 percent owned by bright 
aggregates inc of dallas itself a unit of beazer plc the 
british company is chaired by beazer 
shearson proposed making a tender offer for koppers to 
beazer shearson was and remains the driving force behind the 
offer and it controls the offer koppers said 
shearson officials did not immediately return telephone calls 
for comment despite the fact that shearson has combined with an 
english predator to dismember an american company it holds itself 
out to the public as assisting businesses in protecting against 
takeovers the suit said 
the lawsuit claims that the terms of the takeover financing are 
so vague that is questionable 
bns does not have adequate funding to complete the offer and 
has obtained only a selfstyled commitment for only about onethird 
of the amount that it will require the suit said 
koppers claims the offer is misleading in light of beazers 
subsequent comments on plans to sell koppers chemical and building 
products businesses which together account for 40 percent of 
annual sales 
koppers stockholders are being misled as to the value of the 
stock they are being asked to tender the suit said

kuwait will raise its stake in british petroleum 
co plc to 225 percent but no more and will not seek 
representation on the board of directors an official of the 
persian gulf nations investment arm said friday 
the remarks by the chief investment manager of the kuwait 
investment office were the first direct statements of kuwaits 
immediate intentions toward bp 
industry analysts disagreed on the arab countrys motives some 
said they believed kuwaits previous assertations that it was 
simply buying the shares as an investment 
others suggested it was buying the stake as a first step in an 
effort to establish closer ties ultimately giving kuwait access to 
bps extensive refining and marketing operations in europe and the 
united states 
the kuwaiti agency raised speculation it was building on its 
1953 percent stake by announcing early friday that it held 1269 
billion bp shares or 2125 percent 
the stake breached the 20 percent level bp has said is 
acceptable 
kio policy with regard to all its investments is to regard 
them as investments and not as a means of influencing the policy of 
the company in question said the kuwait offices chief 
investment manager trevor ball this is equally so in the case 
of bp 
the kio looks on this as a long term holding in a company for 
whose management and policy kio have a high regard and which it is 
confident will act in the interests of shareholders he said 
for that reason kio doesnt propose to seek representation on its 
board 
the kuwait office said it will increase its stake to a target 
225 percent as soon as market conditions permit bp refused to 
comment on the situation friday 
jeremy elden an oil analyst at the british brokerage phillips 
and drew said kuwait originally intended to build up a 25 percent 
stake in bp 
elden said the 225 percent target stake looks like a classic 
compromise worked out between between bp chairman sir peter 
walters and kuwaiti oil minister sheik ali khalifa alsabah 
kuwait had hoped for a 25 percent stake in bp because that would 
give it the right to block special resolutions put to bp 
shareholders elden said the resolutions have to receive approval 
of at least 75 percent of the stockholders 
that would have given them real power over the company if 
they had ever wanted to exercise it elden said 
in milwaukee wis george j gaspar an analyst with the robert 
w baird amp co securities firm said he thought kuwait eventually 
hopes to trade its stock for a position in bps downstream 
operations 
they keep saying its only for investment but i dont believe 
it he said i think kuwait is going to use its investment in 
bp to encourage some joint operation between the two 
kuwait is just one of several large producers to have taken 
steps in the direction of acquiring interests that would provide 
guaranteed longterm outlets for their supplies 
texaco inc and saudi arabia are in the midst of negotiating a 
joint venture involving texacos refining and marketing operations 
those talks come less than two years after venezuela acquired 
half of southland corps citgo petroleum co refinery operations 
an interest in champlain oil in the united states and other 
ventures in europe 
not all industrywatchers agree with gaspars theory however 
stephen smith an analyst at bear stearns amp co said he 
believed kuwaits bp stake is just an investment 
kuwaits got plenty of channels for its refined products 
already he said theyve done at least two maybe three deals 
for outlets in europe where theyre selling their products under 
the name q8 
the kuwaiti office began accumulating bp shares soon after bps 
27 billion pound share offering was massively undersubscribed last 
october in february it declared a 1953 percent stake or 1165 
billion shares 
walters indicated in february that he viewed the kuwait offices 
stake as acceptable provided the office didnt increase its holding 
beyond 20 percent

why do americans have different beers for 
different times of the day asked a visiting soviet public 
relations executive who was confused by some us advertising 
techniques and wound up confusing his hosts 
valentin v kozitsyn who is traveling with a soviet cultural 
exhibit now at cincinnatis union terminal center had some 
questions for members of the cincinnati public relations company he 
visited thursday 
employees at smith kaufman public relations were confused by his 
beer question 
they understood when kozitsyn explained that he had seen a 
television commercial saying the night belongs to michelob 
and another thing why is k mart americas favorite store 
he asked 
any advertising or public relations effort in the soviet union 
is done very slowly with much care and deliberation kozitsyn 
said he described the american media as fast colorful and timely 
there is much to learn about the methods here he said 
much of thursdays informal discussion was spent explaining to 
kozitsyn the distinctions between us advertising public 
relations and journalism 
in our country it isnt so important to explain everything 
he said 
kozitsyn said interest in public relations methodology is 
increasing in the soviet union because the country under communist 
party leader mikhail gorbachev is taking a hard look at its 
traditions 
we have not only successes we have mistakes kozitsyn 
said there is a need for us to explain our mistakes in history 
and modern life there is the need to understand truths 
there is much we need to teach our own people and much to 
learn about accomplishing that kozitsyn said 
lora l doerr an account supervisor with smith kaufman said 
the cincinnati firm first came in contact with kozitsyn while 
arranging publicity for the exhibit

crude oil prices moved deeper into 16abarrel 
territory friday but analysts disagreed as to whether fundamental 
or technical factors were responsible for the twoday breakout 
above the 15 range 
some said traders were anticipating new moves by oil producing 
countries to trim their excessive output bringing world supply and 
demand closer into balance others noting that continuous 
profittaking had dampened the rally friday suggested that it 
lacked strong conviction 
contracts for april delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude closed 29 cents higher at 1629 per 
42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange adding to 
thursdays strong 51cent gain 
refined products also built on thursdays robust advance 
wholesale heating oil settled at 4469 cents a gallon up 076 cent

thursday 
theres a growing confidence that by whatever means it might 
take our oilexporting friends will contain the discounting and 
get prices moving up said bob baker an analyst for 
prudentialbache securities inc 
since late last year sluggish demand and growing surpluses have 
put downward pressure on oil prices that weakness was aggravated 
by discounting on the part of members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries 
analysts said the 13nation cartel has been sticking to its 
aggregate quota of 175 million barrels a day but that the total 
goal set in december was simply too high for the worlds needs 
as a result by early this week prices had eroded to levels 
between 13 and 14 per barrel in the persian gulf far short of 
opecs 18 target and to 1537 per barrel on the new york merc 
2 to 3 cheaper than january levels 
indications that worried opec and nonmember countries were 
attempting to find ways to boost those prices sent the market 
strongly higher thursday although crude had picked up 12 cents in 
light trading on tuesday and wednesday 
while crude continued to gain ground in fridays session 
however product prices did not put in all that good a showing 
said jayne ball an analyst at the dean witter reynolds inc 
securities firm 
at this point its unclear whether this is just a technical 
correction or whether its a serious recovery she said

the first national bank of boston agreed friday to 
freeze activity on panamanian government accounts until the state 
department lifts sanctions against the nation 
the action stems from a civil suit filed earlier this week by 
panamas us ambassador juan b sosa the recognized 
representative of the government of deposed president eric arturo 
delvalle 
a federal judge tuesday issued a temporary injunction against 
payments to any panamanian government agency from accounts at bank 
of boston and four floridabased banks in addition a restraining 
order was issued friday by a federal judge in new york against the 
bank of boston international which holds a panama government 
clearing account 
under a settlement filed in us district court in boston the 
bank of boston prohibits transactions against any account of the 
republic of panama banco nationale de panama or petroterminale de 
panama unless approved by sosa 
bank of boston however can transfer up to 4 million a month 
to petroterminale from its panama branch to cover salaries and 
operating expenses for the company which runs a ship fuel pipeline 
alongside the panama canal 
the settlement presented to district judge edward harrington 
was reached following talks between lawyers representing the bank 
and the delvalle government overthrown in late february by gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
attorney michael gardener representing the delvalle government 
estimated the bank of boston handles several million dollars in 
panamanian government assets 
bank spokesman wayne taylor declined to estimate a figure but 
said the banks settlement may set a precedent for sosas suit 
against the florida banks 
defendants in that suit are the citizens and southern 
international bank republic national bank of miami barnett bank 
of florida and the bank of new england international 
a federal judge in miami has scheduled a march 16 hearing for 
the suit 
on march 7 a federal judge in new york added 10 days to a 
restraining order preventing marine midland and bankers trust from 
transferring an estimated 50 million to the banco nationale de 
panama 
irving trust was dropped from that order after agreeing not to 
transfer any money to the panama bank last wednesday another 
defendant republic national bank of new york was dropped when it 
agreed to transfer 10 million in panamanian funds to the federal 
reserve bank 
delvalle is still recognized by the us government as the 
legitimate head of panama 
two us grand juries in florida indicted noriega on drug 
charges feb 4 delvalle sought to dismiss noriega feb 25 but was 
ousted the next day by noriega supporters and went into hiding

assistant us attorney nicholas harbest in seeking lengthy 
incarceration said fisher was entrusted with the taxpayers 
funds and abused that trust a prison sentence will send a ringing 
message to other defense industry executives that this type of 
conduct will no longer go unnoticed and unpunished 
harbest told the judge that fisher between january 1975 and 
december 1984 set prices for the goverment contracts litton 
obtained that were well above the real costs to produce the item 
and that other individual defendants participated in the scheme 
specifically fisher was found guilty of racketeering 
obstruction of a government agencys proceedings making false 
statements and mail fraud 
two other litton employees were sentenced earlier in the case 
michael millspaugh 35 a former controller from buffalo grove 
ill received one year and a 10000 fine while joseph diliberto 
69 a former materials manager of levittown pa received 5

the new york stock exchanges 5weekold 
collar on computerized trading appears to be an effective 
therapy for easing volatility in the postcrash market and luring 
back frightened investors analysts say 
but the restriction also makes the market less attractive to 
investors who thrive on risk which could drive them overseas 
and some market experts even argue that the restriction would do 
little to squelch another panic 
the collar as nyse officials call it has played a role in 
blunting runaway moves in the dow jones industrial average since it 
was enacted feb 4 judging from the markets behavior since then 
it works by banning use of the exchanges computers for a 
trading technique known as index arbitrage when the dow average 
moves 50 points from the previous close an earlier voluntary 
restraint was triggered by a 75point change 
since the 50point collar was announced it has never been 
breached the dow average approached it three times moving up 
4758 on feb 10 up 4841 on feb 29 and down 4824 on thursday 
i think its got to be more than coincidence that it doesnt 
get to 50 said richard wholey a brokeranalyst at the wayne 
hummer amp co investment firm in chicago i would say theres got 
to be a very strong connection 
by comparison in precollar days the dow average jumped 7642 
points jan 4 fell 14058 points jan 8 and fell 5720 points jan 
20 it exceeded a 50point swing six times in december and four 
times in november 
last october when the market suffered the worst decline since 
the great crash of 1929 the dow average careened over 50 points 12 
times capped by the unprecedented 508 point plunge on black 
monday oct 19 
some wall street strategists knowledgeable about index arbitrage 
believe the collar directly influences market behavior when index 
arbitrage traders see the dow average moving 40 or more points 
beyond the previous close they turn off the computers that run the 
automatic trading programs 
the limit is a definite factor said leigh stevens stock 
index futures strategist at painewebber inc in new york the 
traders will see they are near it theyll stop at that point 
because if its going to touch 50 theyd be forbidden to use it 
for the rest of the day 
index arbitrage enables investors to sell massive volumes of 
stock in new york and simultaneously buy the equivalent stockindex 
futures traded in chicago or vice versa in an attempt to profit 
from price differences 
the technique has been blamed for playing a role in the wall 
street crash and subsequent price swings that frightened millions 
of ordinary investors 
several prominent wall street firms concerned they were killing 
their own business and arousing congressional hostility have since 
abandoned index arbitrage for their own accounts 
i dont see anything under the surface thats detrimental 
about the new york stock exchanges limitation said john a 
conlon jr executive vice president and director of institutional 
equity research at nikko securities co international in new york 
any step toward attempting to quell the kind of volatility we saw 
is an intelligent posture 
others agreed but said the limit was discouraging speculators 
who thrive on the risky futures markets this has helped cause a 
drop in the futures business and raised fears that less restrictive 
foreign markets will benefit 
i consider the collar a stabilizer and from the point of view 
of the country or market as a whole its very positive said 
haskel b benishay an economics professor and market expert at 
northwestern universitys kellogg graduate business school 
but of course its less exciting and creates less 
opportunities for index arbitrage program traders to make money 
he said 
some futures experts believe the nyses move reflects a broader 
failure by the securities business to take coordinated steps aimed 
at averting another market collapse a key recommendation of a 
presidential commission 
the critics say the nyses collar wont mesh with the 
circuitbreaking mechanisms imposed in the futures market since the 
crash 
new price limits established to regulate stock index futures 
trading on chicago exchanges could theoretically paralyze those 
markets in response to a sharp decline in prices in such a case 
traders would rush to dump stocks on the nyse which would be 
prevented by its collar from relieving the pressure 
if we should have a sharp market break the markets would 
unlink automatically alger b chapman chairman of the chicago 
board options exchange told an annual futures industry meeting in 
florida earlier this week it would be worse than in october

home shopping network inc the leader in 
televised shopfromhome programs said friday that telephone 
problems were responsible for a 44 percent decline in 
secondquarter earnings 
the telephone problems since corrected prevented some 
potential customers from placing orders and contributed to an 
inventory buildup that the company is still trying to reduce by 
cutting prices on some merchandise according to roy speer 
chairman and chief executive of home shopping 
at a briefing for securities analysts conducted at the american 
stock exchange speer said were out of the telephone problems 
now and we hope that the future will be bright 
nonetheless the st petersburg flabased companys stock 
slumped in the wake of the earnings report home shopping fell 
137 a share to 612 in trading on the amex 
mark riely who follows the company for the investment firm 
eberstadt fleming said the phone situation may have hurt them 
last year but one would have expected sales to have been higher in 
last couple of quarters 
for the three months ended feb 29 home shopping said it earned 
52 million or 6 cents per share compared with 93 million or 
10 cents a share a year earlier 
revenue for the quarter rose 166 percent to 1928 million from 
1653 million a year earlier 
for the first six months of its fiscal year the company said it 
earned 83 million or 10 cents a share down 56 percent from 
188 million or 21 cents a share a year earlier 
sixmonth revenue rose 41 percent to 3788 million from 2687 
million a year earlier 
speer told the analysts that the companys sales of 582 million 
for the fiscal year ended aug 31 1987 had fallen far short of the 
800 million the company had forecast for the year 
but he said the reason was that the telephone system the company 
was using proved incapable of handling the volume of calls that 
home shoppings two television networks were generating 
the company had ordered merchandise on the presumption that it 
would sell 800 million worth of goods last year he said and 
couldnt halt deliveries 
as a result he said the companys inventory rose steadily to a 
peak of 135 million in november he said the company has been 
liquidating it gradually by cutting prices but that the backlog 
remains at 78 million 
the company didnt discover the telephone problem until last 
april speer said and has since changed telephone companies and 
filed a suit against its former telephone service supplier 
he said the new phone system is operating well and that the 
company helped itself by moving its operations into a new and 
bigger facility in st petersburg the networks old facility was 
in clearwater 
home shopping sells merchandise ranging from jewelry to 
computers on two television networks that are carried on cable 
systems seen by about 19 million subscribers or satellite dish 
owners and on 22 broadcast television stations reaching about 37 
million households 
the company has previously said it planned to sell financial 
services through the television networks but officials indicated 
they are taking a more deliberate approach in that area 
lowell paxson president of home shopping had told a marketing 
group last may that the television networks would be selling 
financial products by the spring of 1988 on friday he said the 
telephone problems had commanded so much of managements attention 
that that timetable had been delayed 
but he noted that in the past six months home shopping had 
acquired two seats on the new york stock exchange and one seat on 
the amex and bought a dallasbased brokerage wealth planning 
resource center 
paxson said home shopping hopes to sell a family of investment 
funds through the television programs eventually but said we 
are going to move very slowly and declined to estimate when that 
would be

higher in a volatile session precious metals were mixed grains 
and soybeans were mixed energy futures advanced and stockindex 
futures moved higher 
strong technical buying boosted nearmonth cotton futures prices 
on the new york cotton exchange but fundamental factors also 
played a role in the rally said ernest simon cotton specialist in

from a fundamental point of view the futures market is the 
cheapest market around for us cotton simon said 
with futures priced three to five cents below cash cotton users 
who do not need supplies immediately can buy cotton at a bargain on 
the futures market 
but the buying interest also tends to raise futures prices 
effectively bringing the futures markets more in line with cash 
prices 
simon also noted some decertifications of deliverable 
stocks indicating a company with obligations to deliver cotton 
planned to make those shipments using the type of cotton traded on 
the cotton exchange 
cotton settled 60 cent to 145 cents higher with the contract 
for delivery in may at 6320 cents a pound

in a volatile session marked by a failed attempt to rally the live 
cattle market above its previous highs

disappeared at that point and the april contract dropped to 7267 
cents on profittaking late in the day said philip stanley an 
analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc in chicago prices

increase in planted soybean acreage which totaled 574 million 
acres in 1987

the general services administration on friday 
extended by one month the deadline for bids on a new multibillion 
dollar government telephone system to give us sprint communications 
co more time to draft its proposal 
the gsa said it was reluctantly extending the deadline to 
april 29 but said it was doing so to insure the fullest possible 
competition for the contract one of the biggest ever let by the 
government 
besides sprint only two other teams of companies are bidding on 
the project the work for which will be split 6040 between two 
vendors 
the other bidders are a team led by american telephone amp 
telegraph co and another headed by martin marietta corp with mci 
communications corp 
us sprint a joint venture of gte corp and united 
telecommunications inc will team with gte government systems 
according to industry sources who spoke on condition they not be 
identified by name 
the contract for the new telecommunications system called 
fts2000 is valued at as much as 25 billion over 10 years the 
winners will replace the governments 25yearold phone system with 
a stateoftheart network for voice data video conferencing and 
other communications services 
the extension is the fifth time the bid deadline has been 
postponed since the contract was opened to bidding in january 1987 
last fall under pressure from congress the gsa revised the 
contract to split the award between two vendors instead of giving 
it all to one bidder 
us sprint originally had teamed with electronic data systems to 
bid on the project but they withdrew citing confusion in the 
procurement process however after the contract was revised us 
sprint decided to reenter the bidding 
us sprint officials declined to comment on the companys request 
for the extension but the gsa said us sprint needed the additional 
time to address many functions and aspects of the procurement 
they had previously assigned to eds in the original joint venture 
gsa administrator terence c golden said the agency determined 
that us sprint is indeed committed to competing for fts2000 and 
has in place the necessary resources to live up to its commitment 
to submit a proposal by april 29

bond prices rose friday in reaction to news of a 
decline in wholesale prices and slowerthanexpected retail 
spending 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond rose 2132 point or 
about 656 per 1000 in face amount as its yield fell to 850 
percent from 855 percent late thursday 
the government reports were interpreted as bullish for bond 
prices said elizabeth g reiners vice president for moneymarket 
research at the investment firm dean witter reynolds inc 
the labor department reported that wholesale prices fell 02 
percent in february following a 04 percent rise in january bond 
traders were heartened by the slowing in inflation ms reiners 
said 
the bond market fears inflation because it erodes the value of 
fixedincome securities 
also friday the commerce department reported retail sales rose 
06 percent in february but the department also revised its 
january figures to reflect a drop in consumer spending that month 
consumer spending accounts for twothirds of overall economic 
activity so any dropoff heightens concern about a possible 
recession but bond traders respond bullishly to such negative 
statistics because the federal reserve board is considered unlikely 
to rein in credit by raising interest rates if the economy is 
sluggish 
bond prices and interest rates move in opposite directions so 
lower interest rates mean bonds would be worth more 
partially offsetting the favorable news from the government was 
an increase in oil prices and a small decline in the value of the 
dollar 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues ranged 116 point to 332 point higher 
intermediate maturities rose between 532 point and 1332 point and 
20year issues rose 2332 point according to figures provided by 
telerate inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer rose 239 to 118183

a delaware chancery court judge friday denied 
henley group incs request for a preliminary injunction against 
santa fe southern pacific corp clearing the way for santa fes 
restructuring plan to proceed 
the legal action is the latest in a series of manuevers 
involving santa fe and a pair of companies henley and olympia amp 
york of toronto canada vying to take over the chicagobased 
railroad and energy conglomerate 
the courts denial means santa fe will immediately begin issuing 
debentures of 5 per share to stockholders who already received a 
special cash dividend of 25 per share santa fe spokesman bob 
gehrt said 
the debentures at 16 percent interest come due in 2004 the 
payments are part of a restructuring plan aimed at thwarting a 
hostile takeover bid from henley of la jolla calif

issuance of the debentures 
the lawsuit also asked the court to declare santa fes recently 
enacted shareholderrights plan invalid to rescind the appointment 
of two olympia amp york executives to the santa fe board and to 
allow henley to propose an amendment that would make it possible 
for henley to elect a majority of directors at the santa fes 
annual meeting may 24 
vice chancellor jack b jacobs denied all four requests 
were studying the ruling and considering our alternatives 
said henley spokesman norman ritter 
olympia amp york controlled by the canadas reichmann family had 
launched a tender offer to boost its own holdings in santa fe but 
agreed to support the restructuring in exchange for board

wall street speculator john mulheren accused of 
plotting to kill convicted financier ivan boesky and a former 
boesky aide arrived at a private psychiatric hospital thursday 
after a federal appeals court lifted an order preventing his 
release from prison detention 
mulheren went to the carrier foundation in belle mead nj 
following the morning ruling by the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals in manhattan 
the family and john are delighted with the results and look 
forward to the day when john can be home with them said one of 
mulherens attorneys otto obermaier 
the court denied the governments motion to continue holding 
mulheren in the metropolitan correctional center saying evidence 
provided by a psychiatrist showed the speculator presented no 
danger 
the government had argued that the private facility was not 
secure enough to house mulheren the senior partner at jamie 
securities co and a former friend of boesky central figure in an 
insider trading scandal 
mulheren carrying a loaded assault rifle was arrested feb 18 
by the police outside his rumson nj home 
he was charged with threatening to kill boesky and michael 
davidoff boeskys former head trader the men reportedly have 
implicated mulheren in possible securities law violations 
mulherens lawyers argue that he is a manic depressive who had 
failed to take a drug used to control impulses

insurer farmers group inc to put a merger proposal from unwanted 
suitor batus inc before shareholders at farmers annual meeting 
may 20 
the court also ordered farmers to make its shareholder lists 
available to batus by next wednesday so batus can effectively 
solicit proxies for its proposal 
however the judge did instruct that the nonbinding proposal be 
revised to recommend only that farmers board reconsider its 
decision not to negotiate with louisville kybased batus the 
us subsidiary of bat industries plc of britain

immediately enter negotiations with batus

spurned by farmers the offer expires march 30

requires farmers to include batus negotiation proposal in farmers 
proxy cards being sent to shareholders for the annual meeting 
in a separate statement farmers didnt go beyond outlining the 
decision and reiterating its opposition to batus takeover effort 
farmers based in los angeles filed suit in nevada because that 
is where it is incorporated

directors unanimously rejected the batus offer as inadequate and 
urged its shareholders to do likewise 
farmers said thursday it was exploring a variety of alternatives 
to a batus takeover including restructuring or merging with 
another company adding that it has held discussions with an 
unidentified third party about a possible leveraged buyout 
batus has asked repeatedly to meet with farmers management to 
discuss all conditions of its takeover bid including price but

believes batus offer is substantially less than the company is 
worth

after state farm and allstate and is the seventhlargest property 
and casualty insurer

efforts have been blamed for morton thiokol incs layoff of more 
than 100 workers from its space division 
morton thiokol spokesman rocky raab said friday that another 100 
employees have been transferred from the division to other jobs in 
the companys wasatch operations 
the space division has a work force of more than 2600 
raab said the layoffs came after the company learned nasa is 
going to limit some smallscale tests and other analyses in the 
shuttle redesign efforts 
however none of the largescale tests will be cut he said 
the company has been working on a redesigned shuttle booster 
rocket since the jan 28 1986 challenger disaster a presidential 
commission blamed a leaking rocket seal for igniting the explosion 
that destroyed the shuttle and killed its sevenmember crew 
meantime morton thiokol also is reorganizing management in its 
strategic division to improve safety control and efficiency raab 
said 
two other divisions under the aerospace group tactical and 
automotive products wont be affected by the changes he said 
raab offered few details of the management restructuring but 
the standardexaminer reported friday that a morton thiokol 
employee who asked to remain anonymous said the move was at least 
partially due to the dec 29 1987 fire at an mx missile motor 
plant that killed five workers 
i think that put the icing on the cake said the employee

the nation must take bold controversial 
actions to control federal spending in order to reduce the huge 
budget deficit federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
thursday 
greenspan also indicated the fed would continue making the 
battle against high inflation the cornerstone of its longterm 
monetary policy 
greenspan at a luncheon of the federal reserves 12th district 
banks emphasized that future federal budget cuts not tax 
increases would be a major factor in bringing down the massive 
deficit 
hiking taxes carries with it the risk that expenditures also 
will be raised and that the resulting deficit improvement will be 
small greenspan said 
he referred to the tax resistance movement of the 1970s chiefly 
triggered by californias successful taxlimiting proposition 13 
ballot initiative 
greenspan who previously has called for slashing the budget 
deficit reiterated the federal reserves recent report to 
congress that gross national product was expected to grow by 25 
percent in 1988 while time prices were expected to climb between 3 
percent and 4 percent 
the nation could not count on continued foreign capital inflows 
to help finance the deficit greenspan said calling such a trend 
neither a satisfactory nor a sustainable solution over the long 
run 
greenspan also said that keeping inflation pressures under 
control was critical to continued progress in reducing the deficit 
in this regard monetary policy must maintain as a longrun 
objective establishing reasonable price stability he said 
greenspan praised what he said was the publics alertness to the 
dangers of inflation and said he sensed there is still a deep 
reservoir of support for policies to keep inflation in check
