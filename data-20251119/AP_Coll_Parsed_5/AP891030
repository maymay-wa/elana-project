the watch sold to a private collector for the highest price ever 
paid for a watch at auction in the united states said sothebys 
the photo sale was a record price for a single lot of photography 
a spokeswoman for christies auction house said 
the watch with a face measuring 14 inches was made by swiss 
craftsmen and took three years to complete it was designed and 
commissioned in 1927 by james schulz who worked for tiffanys 
before opening his own business and who also designed watches for 
cartier 
it was the most complicated watch of its size ever to be 
made said daryn schnipper a watch expert for sothebys 
in addition to a standard dial that tells time the watch face 
has four smaller dials one gives the month one gives the day of 
the week one registers the date and has a second hand and another 
gives the phases of the moon 
the previous record for a watch sold at auction was set earlier 
this year when a wristwatch went for 275000 
stieglitz equivalents three series of seven each was 
bought by an anonymous collector said bethe goldberg a publicist 
for christies the series consists of 21 different blackandwhite 
photos of clouds each measuring 3 by 4 inches dating from the 
1920s

in the explosion in el minuto de dios a northwestern suburb of 
this capital city of 6 million people

buildings and the other caused minor damage at the social security

negotiate with drug traffickers

hired killers on aug 19 after leading presidential candidate sen 
luis galan was assassinated

ron ferguson never learned how to salute 
or put on a military uniform properly because the only time he 
spent in the army was after he was arrested as a deserter and 
threatened with courtmartial 
ferguson who has sued the army for 5 million says the whole 
mess began when someone stole his identity by taking his name 
and social security number and enlisting 
the army admits the arrest was in error but claims it was 
fergusons responsibility to clear up the confusion before it got 
that far ferguson says he notified a recruiter whose name he 
cant remember several years before the imposter deserted 
now ferguson 35 of louisville is awaiting a judges ruling in 
the case after a nonjury trial earlier this month in us district 
court here the judge has not indicated when he will rule 
after fergusons arrest in june 1985 he spent two days in the 
jefferson county jail and nine hours at fort knox before his wife 
with the assistance of us rep romano mazzolis office got him 
released 
ferguson said he was frightened when an officer said he was to 
be sent to a military prison at fort leavenworth kan for 
courtmartial 
all this was new to me said ferguson who said when he was 
told to put on an army uniform he didnt know he was supposed to 
tuck his pants into his boots and just because i didnt put it 
on right they made me do pushups 
failing to salute a lieutenant brought more pushups he said 
the calisthenics along with sleeping on a concrete floor at the 
jail for two nights aggravated a back condition he said besides 
physical suffering ferguson claims his reputation was damaged and 
he suffered emotional distress he spent a month in a louisville 
psychiatric hospital this year and damage to his credit rating 
he has had problems with the internal revenue service the 
social security administration and demands for payment of the 
impostors debts to the veterans administration and others he said 
he claims he was hospitalized in february because he was 
paranoid and cautious of others 
i used to even look at the telephone man and think he was 
spying on me he said 
a man calling himself ron ferguson and using fergusons social 
security number joined the army at memphis tenn in 1975 he was 
sent to south korea where he eventually deserted ferguson said 
the nonmilitary ferguson found out about the impostor in 1981 
when the irs said he had not been paying taxes on military income 
it still puzzles me right now ferguson said i wonder 
why and of all people why me i have enough problems i dont 
need any more problems 
people do give the wrong social security number occasionally 
either intentionally or by accidentally scrambling the numbers 
said tony higdon the social security administrations district 
manager for louisville and jefferson county 
the best thing someone can do is check their social security 
record periodically and make sure the annual earnings match the 
figures on the income tax return for each year higdon said 
the army doesnt deny the mixup caused ferguson trouble 
theres no question that he had a rough time spending 48 
hours in jail and another day down at fort knox said scott c 
cox the assistant us attorney who is handling the armys case 
but cox said the responsibility was fergusons 
hes the one who had the potential to be harmed by the 
mistaken records so i think he had an obligation to follow up and 
make sure action was taken cox said

the cab drivers will still be surly the statue 
of liberty will still light the harbor the bronx will still be up 
the battery down and the folks will still ride in a hole in the 
ground 
but new york is on the edge of a momentous change one that 
will alter the way the nations largest city is governed 
in a referendum that has drawn little attention in the midst of 
a tumultuous mayoral campaign city voters this nov 7 will have an 
opportunity to approve or reject a charter that would strengthen 
the mayor and city council while wiping out an entire governing 
body the board of estimate 
the board is arguably the most powerful segment of new york 
citys government with final say over the budget but the us 
supreme court has ruled that it is unconstitutional so the city 
must change 
i think one of the things were doing is making new york city 
like normal governments in america said frederick ao schwarz 
jr chairman of the commission that came up with the new 393page 
city charter 
that means forming a bigger city council changing the mayors 
duties and responsibilities and creating new ways to award 
contracts approve the budget and myriad other procedures 
polls indicate the new charter will pass easily despite 
considerable if disjointed opposition 
the board of estimate dates back to 1901 it reflected a new new 
york in 1898 staten island the city of brooklyn and what is now 
queens joined manhattan and the bronx to become one consolidated 
city 
each of those five boroughs has a president and those 
presidents sit on the board of estimate along with the three 
officials elected citywide the mayor comptroller and city council 
president 
for 89 years the board has been approving contracts deciding 
most landuse questions and approving the annual budget the 
citywide officials have two votes each while each borough 
president has one 
so staten island with 350000 residents has the same voice as 
brooklyn with 22 million that the supreme court ruled last 
march violated the principle of oneperson onevote 
the new plan is updated to suit a changing new york where 
minorities account for more than half the population but only 25 
percent of the council is black or hispanic 
we paid a lot of attention to making sure that minorities had 
fair representation schwarz said 
the city council would be expanded from 35 to 51 members under 
the new plan and the smaller districts are expected to produce 
more minority members perhaps as many as 20 or 40 percent of the 
council 
with the board of estimate dissolved the council will become a 
true legislature with final say on the budget and most land use 
and zoning questions 
the mayor will continue running executive agencies appointing 
commissioners proposing the city budget and estimating revenues 
a crucial element in spending debates 
what the citys doing is moving from a unique screwball form 
of government to one that looks a lot more like what other cities 
do thats a strong mayor strong council form of government 
said gene russianoff attorney for the new york public interest 
research group 
supporters say the larger council and new requirements for 
public disclosure and a new independent budget office will check 
the mayors power 
but without the board of estimate critics contend the mayor 
will be too powerful we will have an imperial mayor said 
ralph j lamberti borough president of staten island 
lamberti and his fellow borough presidents stand to lose the 
most power under the plan and are among its most outspoken 
opponents the other opponents come from a variety of sources that 
dont necessarily have much else in common 
theres the far left and the far right and were sort of the 
center schwarz said these people are utterly strange 
bedfellows they couldnt possibly come up with a solution 
most city residents seem only vaguely aware of the proposed 
changes which arent after all going to revolutionize life in 
new york 
the average resident schwarz said is going to find 
government more responsive and that will be a plus but will it 
pave the streets with gold no

investigators found a trail 
leading to malta as the likely source of the bomb that blew up pan 
am flight 103 over scotland killing 270 people prosecutors 
spokesman jochen schroers said monday 
authorities said a libyan man may have played a role in the dec 
21 bombing 
schroers of the prosecutors office said a suitcase coming 
from malta aboard an air malta flight was the presumed 
container for the bomb 
the suitcase was put aboard the air malta flight on the tiny 
mediterranean island nation before being transferred to the pan am 
flight at its originating point in frankfurt officials reported 
other evidence recently uncovered by investigators in europe 
adds to suspicion that the bombing was carried out by the popular 
front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command the new york 
times reported in its tuesday editions 
sixteen members of the palestinian group were arrested in raids 
in west germany in october 1988 and a bomb similar to the one 
believed to have destroyed the plane was seized in that 
investigation us officials told the times that mohammed abu 
talb a palestinian now being held on terrorism charges in sweden 
has told investigators he retrieved one bomb overlooked in the 
raids and passed it to another person 
officials declined to identify to whom talb said he passed the 
bomb but they also said talb was spotted in malta in october 1988 
in the company of hafez dalkamoni a suspected leader of the 
palestinian group who was arrested in the west german raids later 
that month 
londons sunday times first disclosed the evidence of a possible 
maltese connection it said the bomb was placed in a suitcase 
containing clothing made and purchased in malta 
citing british sources the newspaper said the baggage list 
showed one suitcase was transferred to flight 103 from air malta 
flight km180 which originated in malta on the morning of dec 21 
no passenger accompanied the bag on the pan am flight it said 
all 259 people on the jumbo jet and 11 residents of lockerbie 
scotland died as a result of the dec 21 bombing 
in a statement sent by fascimile machine to news media schroers 
said west german investigators earlier informed scottish 
investigators about suspicions regarding malta 
the suspicions were made more concrete when the scottish 
officials informed the germans that clothing made in malta was in 
the presumed bomb suitcase the statement said 
it said passengers on the air malta flight were not under 
suspicion 
the statement denied british news media reports of friction 
between west german and british investigators 
schroers said earlier in a telephone interview with the 
associated press that west german investigators are in malta but 
the scottish officials are taking the lead 
it was possibly a man of libyan extraction but we cant say 
more than that schroers said of the person who investigators 
believe bought the clothes that were in the suitcase 
the investigation into this lead has not been completed 
previous reports said the bomb was placed on board in luggage 
checked in at frankfurt west german investigators repeatedly 
denied any evidence existed to substantiate those claims 
pan am flight 103 originated in frankfurt taking on passengers 
and luggage flown in from other areas on international feeder 
flights passengers and bags were transferred to the doomed 
boeing 747 at heathrow airport in london 
willi fundermann a spokesman for the federal criminal 
investigations office in wiesbaden said investigators have a hot 
trail leading to malta 
there are clues that a suitcase from malta may have played a 
part said fundermann 
there are also clues that someone from libya or at least 
someone with a libyan accent may have bought the items 
the flight 103 bomb was packed into a toshiba radiocassette 
player investigators have said 
malta about 180 miles north of libya enjoys good relations 
with the government of radical leader col moammar gadhafi in 
tripoli 
in scotland the chief investigator and head of the judiciary 
both refused monday to disclose any details of the hunt for the 
bomber 
george esson chief constable of dumfries and galloway who is 
leading the international investigation issued a statement saying 
investigators are pursuing a number of encouraging lines of 
inquiry in a number of countries 
lord fraser scotlands lord advocate and its top judicial 
officer said in a separate statement that the investigation 
continues to make encouraging progress he said he feared that 
premature disclosure of the progress of the investigation could 
cause grave prejudice to the investigation itself 
esson said since the outset of this inquiry there has been a 
close liaison between the scottish police the fbi and the bka 
information exchanged at regular meetings between these three 
agencies has contributed greatly to the ongoing and very active 
criminal investigation

stonethrowing mobs blackened hulls of 
burned shops and the smell of gunpowder and smoldering ashes evoke 
dreaded memories of the bloodiest chapter in modern indias history 
town after town in northern india is erupting in religious 
rioting 
even the former princely state of rajasthan has become a victim 
of the frenzy and hatred it escaped during the birth of hindu india 
and moslem pakistan in the 1947 partition when an estimated 1 
million people were killed 
hindumoslem riots and violence have claimed about 200 lives in 
the past six weeks against that backdrop with prime minister 
rajiv gandhis government and the opposition blaming each other for 
the renewed violence next months parliamentary elections could be 
the most divisive and violent in indias 42 years of independence 
the situation is so bad there might be a bloodbath before the 
elections i feel it is the worst since independence said 
indrajit gupta deputy secretarygeneral of the communist party of 
india 
nationwide the communal caldron is on high boil more than 500 
people have died this year in sectarian violence in the hindu 
heartland states bihar uttar pradesh rajasthan madhya pradesh 
gujarat and maharashtra more than double the number killed in the 
three previous years 
even for those of us who lived through the partition there is 
no reason for this poison pill said shabir mohammad shah a 
63yearold moslem shopkeeper in jaipur the picturesque pink 
city of rajasthan 
people now have blood on their hands hatred in their eyes 
revenge in their hearts and their souls are ruled by rumors he 
said 
as the election draws closer one rightwing opposition party is 
offering a different vision and fanning the communal flames 
the bharatiya janata party or indian peoples party and called 
bjp has revived the idea of a hindu india attacking the secular 
base on which modern india was created it sees a groundswell of 
public support in this hindudominated country particularly in 
northern india which has almost half the 542 seats at stake in the 
voting on nov 22 24 and 26 
the bjp contends hindus have been discriminated against because 
of secularist policies dating back to jawaharlal nehru indias 
first prime minister and the current prime ministers grandfather 
while minorities and particularly the moslems have been pampered 
the bjp is not a major party but the main centrist opposition 
party the janata dal or peoples party has agreed to share seats 
with it in the north largely because it sees no other way to 
defeat gandhi and his congress party 
the obsession with vote banks seems to have driven out all 
rational thought the conservative times of india newspaper said 
in an editorial 
its heads i win tails you lose because brave words 
notwithstanding the peril of communal animosity is still not taken 
seriously it is all a game in which there is no prize beyond 
votes the editorial said 
indias religious and ethnic mosaic has been inhospitable to a 
hindu party until now 
although hindus comprise more than 80 percent of the population 
they have long been divided along caste and class lines except in 
times of danger they rarely vote as a bloc 
moslems on the other hand make up just 11 percent of indias 
880 million people but often wield pivotal electoral influence yet 
they number more than 100 million giving india the worlds biggest 
moslem population after indonesia 
moslems traditionally have tended to vote as a bloc making up 
more than 20 percent of the electorate in about 100 constituencies 
but now the quest is for a new vote bloc a consolidated hindu vote 
cutting across caste lines 
never before have hindus voted en bloc and hence all 
political parties have ignored them vitally affecting their 
interests said vishnu hari dalmia president of the vishwa hindu 
parishad or the world hindu conference a fundamentalist 
organization and a staunch bjp ally 
the fundamental issue today is whether minorities are going to 
enjoy the status of a privileged class or are treated on par with 
their hindu counterparts dalmia said thanks to the 
appeasement politics of the congress toward minorities for the last 
four decades today a hindu in his own country is a secondclass 
citizen 
there are other undercurrents but the primary reason for the 
sharpened hostility among hindus and moslems is the revival of a 
dispute over babri masjid a mosque in uttar pradesh that is 
believed built on the site of a demolished hindu temple 
the disputed site was locked in 1949 neither hindus nor moslems 
could pray there until 1986 when a judge ordered the building 
unlocked for worship the issue became a rallying cry for militant 
hindu organizations that revived the call for building a temple and 
set nov 9 for the foundationlaying ceremony

about 25000 people attended a memorial 
service monday night for 22 workers who died in a series of 
explosions at a plastics plant last week and three more bodies 
were recovered from the rubble 
among those attending the 45minute service at the john ray 
harrison convention center were 259 relatives of those who died in 
the phillips petroleum co plant disaster last monday 
no one can really explain why happenings such as this occur 
said sr buddy jones jr chairman emeritus of bank one of 
texas here i surely dont know but i do know this a tragedy of 
this magnitude brings us all closer together and demonstrates the 
love the care and the concern we have for one another 
sgt jim cluck chaplain of the police department asked 
phillips employees to honor those who died by having the strength 
to return to work and live their lives the way they would want 
you to live 
the recovery of three bodies brought the confirmed death toll to 
17 the remains of five workers remain missing the explosions 
injured 124 people 
despite thunderstorms and heavy rain work crews continued 
moving tons of steel and concrete in hopes of recovering the last 
of the victims 
us rep mike andrews dtexas whose district includes this 
city of 119300 toured the plant and met with authorities 
you really have to be here to see how absolutely devastating 
that blast was andrews said fully a quarter of the plant has 
been eliminated there is still a safety factor at the plant site 
there are still fires burning it is an awesome sight to see 
much of the search has concentrated on the plants control and 
finishing rooms where debris is stacked as high as 40 feet 
officials said 
the polyethylene plant maufactured almost 20 percent of the 
nations production of plastic pellets used to make milk jugs and 
grocery bags 
phillips officials believe flammable hydrocarbon vapor from 
ethylene and isobutane gases escaped from a leaking chemical 
reactor triggering the explosion but company officials have said 
they dont know how the gases were ignited and wont concentrate on 
finding a cause until all the missing victims have been found

an advisory committee to the department of 
veterans affairs this week may open the door a crack to disability 
benefits for vietnam veterans exposed to agent orange 
responding to a federal court decision in may the 15member 
veterans advisory committee on environmental hazards will look 
again at scientific papers and studies on the herbicide used to 
clear dense foliage that hid the enemy 
this time however the committee will use standards considered 
less strict than those used for determining other serviceconnected 
disabilities 
no one is predicting the outcome but there is agreement that va 
secretary edward j derwinski wants to resolve the issue quickly 
and in favor of veterans 
i dont think hes going to fool around very long va 
spokesman don smith said hes so far exhibited a degree of 
willingness if not impatience to go along rather rapidly with 
this 
once the committee does its work derwinski is kind of on his 
own as to how he wants to fly on this smith said he said 
derwinski will make a final determination on the committees 
recommendations within two weeks of receiving results of the 
meeting 
according to one congressional source derwinskis actions mean 
hes almost promised people that he will take some positive 
action for veterans 
veterans blame exposure to agent orange for cancers skin 
diseases and genetic damage leading to miscarriages or birth 
defects the committee will spend its first two days reviewing 
about 20 or 30 studies on the connection between exposure and 
nonhodgkins lymphoma one of the most frequently cited cancers 
then study other diseases at later meetings 
on friday it will issue recommendations on nonhodgkins 
lymphoma and agent orange 
the fouryearold advisory committee and government scientists 
have thus far rejected a link between agent orange exposure and 
health problems other than a skin condition known as chloracne 
the american legion the prime veterans group in this dispute 
contends the committee has a longstanding bias against veterans 
not so says oliver meadows the disabled veteran and scientific 
layman in charge of the panel their greatest interest is their 
own integrity as scientists he said 
the government says the main problem with studies up to now is 
that there has been no way to verify exposure to dioxin the 
american legion and others say the government has detailed records 
on spraying activities that can be combined with equally detailed 
records on troop movements 
agent orange an orangebrown liquid that was shipped in 
orangestriped barrels was sprayed in vietnam from january 1965 to 
april 1970 more than 230000 veterans have registered with va 
claiming to have been exposed more than 36000 veterans have filed 
for disability benefits claiming agent orange exposure caused their 
problems and two have been granted compensation for chloracne 
agent orange is suspect because it contains phenoxy 
herbicides associated with certain cancers as well as dioxin which 
has been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals 
dioxins links to human health problems are disputed although 
its links to human birth defects are more firmly established 
a ruling in may by us district judge thelton e henderson in 
san francisco created a way out of the impasse over agent orange a 
new administration and the elevation of the veterans 
administration to cabinet status added another ingredient 
henderson ruled may 2 that the va imposed an impermissibly 
demanding test for linking agent orange with health problems 
although the va has relied on a cause and effect 
relationship in determining serviceconnected disabilities the 
committee was to use a different standard a significant 
statistical association 
derwinski told attorney general richard l thornburgh on may 8 
that he had decided against an appeal 
new regulations for reviewing studies using the new standard 
effective wednesday say a link will be deemed to exist if the 
studies associating agent orange with health problems outweigh the 
evidence that there is no association 
the regulations say the va secretary can give the benefit of 
the doubt to the conclusion that the association exists 
in early october derwinski named adm elmo r zumwalt jr as a 
special adviser with a specific emphasis on agent orange 
zumwalt ordered spraying of agent orange during vietnam and he 
lost a son who served in vietnam to a cancer linked with that 
spraying zumwalt is known as a veterans advocate on this issue

the nations first black governor was a 
freed slave and a savvy politician who served a caretaker period of 
four weeks in louisiana after the civil war historians say 
interest in pbs pinchback louisianas governor from december 
1872 to january 1873 has revived with the possible election in 
virginia this year of a black governor democrat l douglas wilder 
wilder virginias lieutenant governor and a grandson of freed 
slaves is running against republican j marshall coleman a former 
attorney general who lost the states 1981 election for governor 
if wilder wins he would be the first elected black governor of 
a us state pinchback was not elected to the louisiana office 
pinckney benton stewart pinchback was the most intelligent 
resourceful and dynamic of the black legislators during 
reconstruction said mark t carleton a history professor at 
louisiana state university in baton rouge he was a very able 
leader a very persuasive speaker 
the son of a georgia slave owner and a black slave pinchback 
was freed by his father before the civil war and was a captain in 
the union army 
after the war pinchback settled in louisiana and joined the 
republican party of blacks and radical whites he was elected to 
the louisiana senate in 1868 and was chosen as the chambers 
president pro tempore 
when lt gov oscar dunn who also was black died in november 
1871 pinchback moved by constitutional succession to the states 
no 2 office under louisianas carpetbag governor henry clay 
warmoth 
at the time warmoth was becoming a political maverick a 
republican he was attempting to shift his power base to the 
democrats apparently sensing a revival of louisianas prewar 
white power structure 
in the 1872 election warmoth supported president grants 
opponent horace greeley but grant won and the next month the 
louisiana legislature brought impeachment proceedings against 
warmoth 
during the trial pinchback became acting governor the 
impeachment case was still under way in january when louisianas 
newlyelected republican governor william pitt kellogg was sworn 
into office 
in his four weeks as governor pinchback did nothing of 
consequence said lawrence n powell a history professor at tulane 
university in new orleans 
he was a colorful very adroit and pragmatic politician who 
always seemed to manage to land on his feet said powell in 
louisiana during reconstruction that was no mean feat 
pinchback later was elected to congress but was not seated 
because the vote was contested he eventually moved to washington 
dc where he was a member of an informal cabinet of black leaders 
involved in national political matters he died in 1921 
before wilders campaign in virginia this year major parties 
have nominated two black politicans for governorships in recent 
years 
in 1982 and 1986 los angeles mayor thomas bradley ran as 
californias democratic candidate for governor losing both times 
to republican george deukmejian in 1986 michigan republican 
william lucas failed to unseat democratic gov james j blanchard

the availability of legal abortions for many 
women may one day hinge on rulings by their states highest court 
a key but oftenoverlooked battleground in the political fight over 
abortion 
public focus thus far has centered on state legislatures 
congress and the supreme court but the role of state courts was 
dramatically underscored on oct 5 when the florida supreme court 
ruled that the state constitution gives women a right to abortion 
as a result women in florida would be unaffected if the 
nations highest court some day reverses its landmark 1973 decision 
and says the federal constitution does not provide the right to 
abortion 
if the florida legislature merely passed a law criminalizing 
abortions the state supreme court surely would overturn it 
antiabortion activists instead would have to try to amend the 
state constitution an involved process not undertaken successfully 
since 1968 
a state may never give its citizens fewer rights than those 
guaranteed by the federal constitution but it is free to provide 
greater rights and the ultimate interpreter of each states 
constitution is not the us supreme court but that states highest 
court 
for example although governmental refusals to fund abortions 
for women on welfare have survived attacks based on the federal 
constitution such refusals were ruled invalid under the 
constitutions of california connecticut massachusetts new jersey 
and vermont 
the florida courts broad ruling was not unprecedented the 
california supreme court years ago found an abortion right in its 
states constitution 
both state courts based their decisions on explicit statements 
guaranteeing the right of privacy although no other court has 
ruled directly on a right to abortion at least five other state 
constitutions those of alaska arizona hawaii louisiana and 
montana provide a right of privacy 
in a few other states most notably new jersey and 
massachusetts rulings by the highest court have implied a state 
privacy right that could include the right to abortion 
we have studied those state constitutions and are looking at 
the makeup of the highest court in each of those states said 
dawn johnsen legal director of the national abortion rights action 
league 
part of the abortion rights strategy will be to ask state not 
federal courts to overturn new restrictive laws based on state 
constitutional grounds 
mary spaulding of the national right to life committee says her 
organization began to focus on state constitutions long before the 
florida ruling 
this battle will be in the states and state court rulings on 
their constitutions therefore are included she said we know 
we have a problem in some states and we are studying the matter 
in those states in which there is no state constitutional right 
of privacy challenges to restrictive abortion laws might be based 
on such legal notions as liberty due process equal protection and 
sexual equality 
such moves likely will be accompanied by efforts on both sides 
of the fight to amend state constitutions and to reshape the 
memberships of state legislatures and high courts 
patricia ireland of the national organization for women says 
getting more abortion rights supporters appointed to state high 
courts must be made part of the feminization of power her group 
seeks 
state courts are part of the political package we are looking 
at she said they are present and future arenas

before solidarity took power in poland jan 
nowak was the communist governments enemy no 1 because for 24 
years he headed the polish section of radio free europe the 
ussponsored radio station that beams into the soviet bloc 
when nowak returned to warsaw aug 28 for his first visit since 
1945 he was stunned to find the airport crammed with senior 
solidarity leaders they took time out from forming the first 
noncommunist government in the soviet bloc to welcome him as a 
hero 
lech walesa called nowaks return a visible symbol of 
change said nowak and his warm reception was symbolic of an 
improved status for radio free europe and radio liberty behind the 
crumbling iron curtain 
the stations were created in 1950 and 1951 during the cold war 
and despite their ups and downs over the years are thriving in the 
current thaw nowak headed the polish section for 24 years starting 
in 1951 
official polish television which formerly condemned the 
socalled foreign voices that carried news censored from 
staterun media not only reported nowaks triumphant return it 
broadcast an interview with him 
when nowak stepped out the next day to take a nostalgic walk 
through the city i had not visited for 45 years a taxi driver 
veered over took him around town and refused to accept payment 
the driver told me he had seen the airport arrival on 
television he said i listened to radio free europe for so many 
years without paying anything how can i take money from you 
nowak 76 recalled during an interview after he returned to his 
home near washington 
like nowak radio free europe and its sister station radio 
liberty are enjoying their new role not only in poland but in the 
soviet union and other countries of the communist bloc 
it has become a very exciting place to be the radios are 
on the cutting edge of the changes underway in the soviet bloc 
said gene pell a former nbctv correspondent who now directs the 
twin radio stations 
the stations were founded by the central intelligence agency 
and in 1971 after revelations of cia misdeeds were separated from 
the spy agency and funded by congress 
congressional reports requested by the senate foreign relations 
committee in 198485 criticized the stations for sometimes 
broadcasting material considered abusive of communist and 
government officials in the soviet bloc 
since pell took over in november 1985 said a foreign relations 
committee aide he has done a fine job in curbing the problems we 
saw four years ago 
but media in the soviet bloc continued to depict the voices 
as branches of the cia jammed their broadcasts to major cities 
and bitterly condemned emigres like nowak who worked for them 
nevertheless the stations had an audience estimated at 50 
million according to the 1985 congressional report 
under the reforms launched since then by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev the vituperation has ended and the audience 
has expanded 
the major breakthrough was in november of last year when they 
turned the jammers off pell said in a recent interview in 
washington 
taking advantage of the thaw radio liberty which broadcasts to 
the soviet union has hired reporters in moscow leningrad kiev 
and novosibirsk said pell who was the nbc correspondent in moscow 
in the late 1970s when most soviets feared speaking with 
westerners and could receive prison sentences of up to seven years 
for listening to radio liberty and radio free europe 
radio free europe which broadcasts to the rest of the soviet 
bloc has received permission to open an office in hungary and 
wants a bureau in warsaw 
official press criticisms have tapered off and the weekly 
moscow news last year praised radio libertys coverage of the 
december 1988 earthquake in armenia calling it better than radio 
moscows 
in this case we heard on a foreign band what we should have 
heard on our own vladimir ostrogorsky wrote in the dec 18 
1988 moscow news 
although ostrogorsky said the voices in the past had 
broadcast rumors misrepresentations and outright lies and had 
pushed their own ideological goods packaged as information he 
praised the end of the jamming as testimony to the progress of 
glasnost or greater openness 
pell said simultaneously another thing happened the most 
significant of all the place opened up we could call people they 
could call us 
broadcasters in munich tape reports from throughout the soviet 
bloc and transmit them back in 
we now have a broadcast called at the kiosk in which our 
moscow correspondent reads excerpts from press reports the same day 
they are published said pell the show is popular because the 
most interesting newspapers sell out quickly even in major cities 
and may not be available at all elsewhere

state police and guards kept watch sunday 
over the remaining inmates at a riottorn state prison and 
investigations were planned to determine what caused two nights of 
bloody violence at the overcrowded penitentiary 
in philadelphia a small fire broke out at a city prison sunday 
night forcing authorities to move about 100 inmates said a police 
detective who spoke on condition of anonymity 
no one was injured in the fire at northeast detention center 
which came one night after a much more serious riot at another city 
prison and was the fifth disturbance to hit a pennsylvania prison 
within a week 
the 100 inmates were taken to a gymnasium as smoke from the fire 
cleared the detective said four young men refused to return to 
their cells and guards forced them to return according to the 
officer 
the prison near camp hill where more than 100 people were 
injured in two nights of rioting last week was calm sunday said 
corrections department spokesman kenneth robinson 
the uprising there and at other prisons resulted in injuries to 
at least 183 people 
camp hills troubles came between a disturbance at the 
huntingdon state prison that left 48 injured last monday and one at 
a philadelphia county prison saturday night which resulted in 
serious injuries to three guards and the hospitalization of nine 
inmates 
the camp hill uprising left at least 123 injured almost half of 
the facilitys buildings destroyed or damaged by fire and hundreds 
of inmates without cells 
five people taken hostage thursday were released friday when 
state police stormed the prison restoring order after a 
buildingbybuilding assault 
robinson said 744 camp hill inmates had been transferred to 
other state prisons since friday he said 200 more inmates would be 
sent to a new federal prison in bradford in northwest pennsylvania 
and as many as 600 others would be sent in groups of 50 to other 
federal jails 
hundreds of convicts had been forced to sleep on the ground at 
camp hill under the eyes of guards and police officers 
with the transfers and cleaning and repairing cells at camp 
hill officials hoped to make cell space available for all inmates 
by monday robinson said 
weve got a lot of people in there cleaning up cellblocks as 
well as the kitchen buildings robinson said 
the disturbance saturday at holmesburg prison a county jail in 
philadelphia was a copycat of the camp hill riot said city 
prison commissioner j patrick gallagher 
during the riot which officials said began after an argument 
between several prisoners and a guard inmates could be heard 
chanting camp hill camp hill 
fortyseven guards and 114 inmates were taken to hospitals and 
nine inmates were admitted three with head wounds gallagher said 
other convicts suffered broken bones and cuts said hospital 
officials who did not have an exact count three of the 47 guards 
suffered broken bones and deep cuts but none were hospitalized 
gallagher said 
gov robert p casey said saturday that he would appoint an 
independent commission to investigate why inmates rebelled at camp 
hill on wednesday and how they were able to get out of their locked 
cells to resume and escalate the violence thursday 
the state senate judiciary committee and a state house judiciary 
subcommittee also planned to conduct their own reviews at least 
one of the committees plans to study prison overcrowding a problem 
at both state and county prisons 
officials say overcrowding may have been a contributing factor 
to the two stateprison problems as well as the philadelphia 
disturbance 
casey said he also would back a criminal investigation of the 
riot accelerate plans to replace the lost prison space and lessen 
overcrowding elsewhere move to punish the inmates behind the 
uprising and review the need for more corrections officers 
after the first day of violence ended wednesday camp hill 
superintendent robert freeman said the prison did not have enough 
guards to deal with the prison population which was 45 percent 
over capacity when the riots began 
no damage estimate was available yet 
robinson said four of the five hostages thursday had been 
released from hospitals the remaining guard was in fair condition 
three other prison staffers and six convicts also remained 
hospitalized sunday

a decline in us oats production is prompting 
congress to look into the situation and agriculture department 
analysts say consumer demand for oatmeal is one of the many factors 
for consideration 
some believe the governments price support program for oats 
should be modified to encourage farmers to plant more oats instead 
of turning to other feed grains such as barley corn or sorghum 
whatever remedies are forthcoming the united states since 1982 
has been a net importer of oats instead of an exporter canada 
sweden finland and argentina are the major foreign suppliers 
the us market share of all world oats imports rose to an 
annual average of 44 percent in 198588 largest of all importing 
countries says the departments economic research service 
the agency in a new staff report prepared as background for 
1990 farm legislation said oats are grown in most states but are 
concentrated in the north central region including the dakotas 
minnesota iowa and nebraska 
in the 1950s oats were grown on more than 40 million acres and 
annual farm prices averaged 58 cents to 72 cents per bushel in 
recent years oats have been produced on 6 million to 10 million 
acres with farm prices climbing from 121 per bushel in 1986 to 
156 in 1987 and a record 267 in 1988 
the value of oats production in 1987 ranked 16th among major 
us field crops at 606 million by comparison corn was 14 
billion soybeans 113 billion hay 9 billion and wheat 55 
billion 
the principal domestic use of oats is for livestock feed 
although it has recently become a specialty feed for race and 
pleasure horses the report said 
oats as human food includes the traditional oatmeal along with 
oat flour natural cereals meat product extenders cookies and 
breads granola oat bran and baby food 
recent medical research has shown that certain fibrous plant 
materials in the diet can lower serum cholesterol concentrations 
the report said the fibers however must be water soluble oat 
bran is water soluble but wheat bran is not watersoluble dietary 
fibers also lower postmeal blood glucose levels in 
insulindependent diabetics 
the report added thus oat bran or whole oats is beginning to 
play a larger role in improving health through diet oats 
consumption by humans appears to be increasing as us diets seem 
to be shifting toward cerealbased foods and away from fatty 
highprotein animalbased foods

agriculture department scientists say they 
have developed a new lethal snack for cockroaches grasshoppers 
crickets and fire ants that smells too yummy to resist 
the bait includes corn mash left over from the manufacture of 
fuelgrade alcohol ethanol and a waterabsorbent gel the mixture 
is laced with a slowrelease insecticide 
according to the departments agricultural research service the 
new bait was initially designed to use against cockroaches but 
researchers at the agencies insect laboratory in gainesville fla 
found it attracted the other species too 
entomologist richard j brenner said the combination of corn 
mash and gel tends to retain moisture and remains aromatic under 
high temperatures and dry conditions that makes it particularly 
attractive to roaches which become hungry and thirsty when the 
temperature rises 
the bait has been tested in the field as well as in the 
laboratory and is waiting on approval by the environmental 
protection agency he said 
although the mashgel combination was developed by brenner and 
an agency colleague richard s patterson there are two other 
coinventors roger r pierce of pierce services inc cashier 
nc and marvin hult of air vent inc peoria ill 
air vent and pierce services signed research agreements with the 
usda agency in february 1988 and hold first rights to license the 
bait when a patent is granted 
pierce to protect the baits aroma and moisture during storage 
suggested wrapping the bait in wax film that a hungry cockroach can 
open easily hult recommended using a bait holder which would 
extend the shelf life of the mixture and protect it until ready for 
use 
brenner said that while the corn mash attracts roaches hoppers 
crickets and fire ants it doesnt attract warmblooded animals as 
do baits of fruit bread raisins or beer

the worlds rice production is expected to 
rise slightly in 198990 but will fall short of meeting global 
demands according to agriculture department projections 
significant harvest increases are expected in china indonesia 
the philippines and japan said the departments economic research 
service indias production may drop 6 percent from last years 
record level but still would be the secondlargest 
total foreign rice production was forecast at 326 million metric 
tons and the us crop at 493 million tons milled equivalent 
analysts said that would be the fourth straight year that us 
rice production has fallen short of total use meaning another 
reduction in the us rice stockpile by next aug 1

a trainer jet crashlanded sunday 
afternoon on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier lexington in 
the gulf of mexico killing five people and injuring at least two 
the navy said 
the 330 pm cst crash of the twoseat t2 buckeye caused 
several fires on the world war iiera ship that sailors quickly 
brought under control officials said 
the lexington the navys oldest aircraft carrier was 30 miles 
south of its home port of pensacola when the accident occurred 
said harry white a civilian spokesman at pensacola naval air 
station 
officers on the ship said five people were killed in the 
crashlanding and at least two were injured said white 
the jet was assigned to training squadron 19 based at the 
meridian miss naval air station white said the victims 
identities were being withheld pending notification of their 
relatives 
in addition to destroying the jet the crash did major damage to 
two aircraft on the flight deck and minor damage to another said 
army maj john smith a spokesman at the pentagon 
navy helicopters took the dead and injured to the west florida 
regional medical center and the us navy hospital in pensacola 
and to the university of south alabama medical center in mobile 
authorities said 
one of the injured anthony lopez 21 was in critical but 
stable condition at the mobile hospital with second and 
thirddegree burns over 40 to 45 percent of his body hospital 
spokeswoman monica knight said lopez was the only sailor brought 
to that hospital she said white said he did not know lopezs rank 
or hometown 
the lexington was heading back to pensacola and was expected to 
arrive at the citys commercial port around 10 am monday 
officials said 
the coast guard sent a jet from mobile to fly a team of ordnance 
experts in panama city to pensacola coast guard lt mark kasper 
said in new orleans the navy apparently was concerned that fuel 
cells aboard the jet might explode after being damaged in the 
crash kasper said 
the 46yearold lexington is the only aircraft carrier used 
exclusively by the navy for training it has 1440 men and women 
assigned to it 
the accident occurred a week before the 45th anniversary of a 
japanese kamikaze attack that killed 47 crew members and injured 
127 on nov 4 1944 
the original lexington crew plans to hold a reunion next weekend 
in pensacola that includes a day cruise on the carrier on saturday 
nov 4 to commemorate the attack 
the lexington was commissioned on feb 17 1943 its planes sank 
or destroyed more than a million tons of japanese shipping and 
1039 enemy aircraft 
the carrier was dubbed the blue ghost by japanese 
propagandist tokyo rose during world war ii because she had 
reported it sunk several times only to have it return to battle 
painted a solid bluegrey color unusual in wartime when ships are 
usually camouflaged 
the lexington was mothballed after the war but was reactivated 
in 1955 it reported to pensacola on dec 29 1962 to serve as the 
navys training carrier it is scheduled to continue that role 
after moving next september to corpus christi texas 
the ship has been a favorite of movie producers with roles in 
the film midway and the madefortelevision miniseries war 
and remembrance

the supreme court is being asked to decide 
whether a federal judge may impose a tax increase to pay for 
courtordered school desegregation in kansas city mo 
at issue in todays oral arguments is a federal judges 1987 
order doubling the property tax of residents in the kansas city 
school district to finance a courtordered plan for racially 
desegregating the public schools 
legal scholars and education officials say the courts decision 
could shape future school desegregation plans across the country 
and define the federal courts power to remedy constitutional 
violations involving issues from prison overcrowding to fair 
housing 
the state of missouri is asking the justices to overturn a 
decision by the 8th us circuit court of appeals that upheld the 
property tax increase ordered by us district judge russell clark 
the state contends that the federal courts lack the power to order 
higher taxes even to correct a constitutional violation such as 
racial discrimination in schools 
the school district and a group of school children who brought 
the original desegregation case in 1977 are urging the high court 
to uphold the tax decision the district contends that state 
property tax law and local voters cannot be allowed to frustrate 
the constitutional rights of kansas citys minority schoolchildren 
to an equal educational opportunity 
clark ordered the tax increase in september 1987 after the local 
school district was unable to pay its share of a more than 400 
million desegregation plan he had approved for capital improvements 
in buildings and establishment of special magnet schools 
state law says local property taxes may be raised only with 
voters approval and in some instances only with a twothirds 
majority district voters had not approved a levy increase since 
1969 with four tax increase proposals rejected in 1986 and 1987 to 
finance the desegregation plan 
in addition to doubling the property tax clark imposed an 
income tax surcharge on those people living or working in the 
school district 
the appeals court struck down the income surcharge in august 
1988 but upheld the district courts authority to order an 
increase in the property tax however the appeals court modified 
the procedure for imposing the higher tax levy 
the appeals court found that state law had effectively prevented 
the school district from levying the necessary taxes to pay for the 
desegregation plan it upheld clarks order as one that set aside 
levy limitations and empowered the elected local school board to 
set the needed tax levels within certain limits

congressional conservatives grappling with 
glasnost are having trouble coming to terms with the changes 
disclosures and confessions of the government of soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev 
there is little unity of opinion 
an example is the reaction to the recent admissions by soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze regarding afghanistan and the 
construction of a longcontroversial advanced radar system 
shevardnadze admitted the soviet invasion of afghanistan in 1979 
was immoral illegal and a mistake 
he said construction of a sophisticated phasedarray radar 
system at krasnoyarsk in the central soviet union was what its 
critics always said it was an outright and direct violation of 
the 1972 anti ballistic missile treaty 
two of the senates most conservative members took a look at the 
two confessions and came away with sharply different impressions of 
the soviet unions new openness 
one said glasnost had brought new evidence of soviet duplicity 
new reason to distrust any arms control treaty with the kremlin 
the other saw a new cause for hope 
one offered applause the other jeers 
sen jesse helms rnc said the admission that the 
krasnoyarsk radar was a treaty violation is all the evidence one 
could want that the soviet union intends to violate treaties before 
it signs them does violate them lies about the violations and 
cant be trusted now or in the future 
sen gordon humphrey rnh however reacted to the news of 
the soviet change of position on the invasion of afghanistan by 
saying bravo 
the policy shift could be the beginning of a turnaround to 
permit the afghan people to choose their own government free of 
soviet intervention humphrey said 
concentrating on shevardnadzes admission about the radar helms 
said he had pointed to it as the smoking gun of soviet arms 
control cheating shortly after us intelligence detected it in 
summer 1983 
helms noted that soviet officials spent years denying the radar 
installation was a treaty violation 
helms concluded mr shevardnadze has finally admitted the 
fundamental duplicity of soviet foreign policy he has finally 
admitted that the soviets conduct arms control negotiations on the 
basis of falsehood cheat on solemn arms control treaties and then 
try to camouflage and conceal their duplicity 
the admission confirms the suspicion that the soviets signed the 
abm treaty the salt i and salt ii treaties and the intermediate 
nuclear forces or inf treaty fully intending to violate all of 
them helms asserted 
helms said he believed the soviets made the admission only 
because the evidence had become so massive that it constituted a 
significant barrier to improving ussoviet relations 
this admission totally undermines any basis of trust in future 
treaties with the soviet union helms asserted 
focusing on afghanistan humphrey sounded an opposite note 
glasnost appears to be paying dividends at last he said 
humphrey has been the senates most persistent and outspoken 
critic of the soviet invasion of afghanistan 
but now he said the time has come for some praise 
shevardnadze called the soviet invasion which occurred during 
the rule of the late soviet president leonid brezhnev the most 
serious violation of our own legislation of party and civic norms 
and ethical standards of the times 
this sort of frank admission of sins long denied bodes well 
for the success of glasnost for openness and honesty of soviet 
officials humphrey said i say bravo 
the admission of error he said allows him to hope that the 
soviets soon will end their support for the marxist regime left 
behind in kabul when the soviet occupation army withdrew from 
afghanistan 
humphrey concluded i salute mr gorbachev for the courage to 
proclaim glasnost for the courage to persist where glasnost has 
led to painful reevaluations and even admissions of grave error

the district of columbia matched its yearold 
record for homicides sunday with five killings during a sevenhour 
weekend period that pushed this years total to 369 homicides 
three of the weekend killings were linked to drugs as are the 
majority of the deaths in the nations capital and the other two 
were a 13yearold girl and her aunt who were found stabbed to 
death in their apartment on saturday 
the most recent victim was a 41yearold man found dead of 
multiple gunshot wounds early sunday he had 11000 cash and a 
large quantity of heroin in his pockets when his body was found 
according to police homicide detectives 
its awful but people in this community are resorting to 
deadly violence to resolve conflict said police spokesman lt 
reginald smith 
police have estimated more than half the citys killings are 
tied to drugs with crack cocaine fueling much of the violence 
they said last at the end of 1988 that 372 people were killed in 
homicides but a police revised that number downward sunday when 
they subtracted three victims of police shootings from the official 
total

the socialists scored a third straight 
electoral victory but prime minister felipe gonzalezs 
parliamentary majority dwindled to just one seat through defections 
to the left results showed today 
analysts credited a fouryear economic boom and confidence in 
the future as helping push the socialist party over the top in 
sundays general elections 
however they said the governing partys majority was sharply 
reduced because organized labor was angry over gonzalezs 
probusiness policies and unwillingness to further boost social 
spending 
the man who first rose to power in 1982 has helped give spain 
europes fastest growing economy 
in sundays balloting the socialists won 176 seats or 3955 
percent of the vote the minimum needed for a majority of the 350 
seats in parliaments powerful lower house they had won 184 seats 
in 1986 elections 
the biggest gains were won by the united left coalition that 
includes the communist party which increased its seats to 17 with 
9 percent of the vote from the seven seats in 1986 
with all the votes counted interior minister jose luis corcuera 
also announced these results early today in the cortes or lower 
house the conservative popular party 106 seats 2583 percent of 
the vote the catalan convergence and union 18 seats 5 percent 
the democratic and social center of former prime minister adolfo 
suarez 14 seats 8 percent 
the remaining seats were divided among eight smaller parties 
the popular party under 36yearold jose maria aznar an 
inexperienced former tax collector who took over just two months 
ago remained the largest opposition force however it gained just 
one seat in this election 
in the 208seat senate the socialists won 109 seats the 
popular party 74 the convergence and union 10 the united left 1 
and the democratic and social center 3 the remaining seats went to 
the smaller parties 
during the campaign united left leader julio anguita hammered 
away at the socialists saying they had failed to distribute fairly 
the benefits of the countrys newly generated wealth 
the communists won 20 seats in 1977 general elections after the 
death two years earlier of gen francisco franco and spains return 
to democracy however they had suffered a constant decline until 
sundays vote 
gonzalez a 47yearold former labor lawyer and underground 
political activist during the franco era has provided the country 
with firm leadership guiding it out of near bankruptcy in 1982 to 
solvency and a starring role in the 12nation european community 
with these results it is possible to govern alone the 
prime minister said and were going to do it with the same hope 
and democratic attitude weve shown since 1982 when he swept to 
victory with a landslide 
analysts said the united left coalition won the protest vote by 
throwing support behind the nations two largest unions in their 
bitter battle with the government for greater spending on pensions 
unemployment insurance and wages for civil servants 
the coalition went from fewer than 1 million votes in 1986 to 
18 million votes sunday apparently snapping up the 900000 votes 
that the socialists lost according to electoral experts 
however economy minister carlos solchaga quickly dismissed any 
notion that the coalition would influence the socialists to move 
away from the probusiness policies that have contributed to 
spains average growth rate of 45 percent over the past four 
years the highest in europe 
he said the socialist government needs no leftward swing or 
allies 
inflation dropped from 14 percent in 1982 to 5 percent last 
year although it is now running at 7 percent 
despite the drop in votes any way one looks at the third 
socialist majority it appears to be further confirmation that the 
spanish society sees gonzalez as its best leader said veteran 
political comentator pedro altares 
spain is the third european country after sweden and austria 
to witness three successive terms of socialist majority governments 
the 699 percent turnout rate among the nations 295 million 
registered voters was up slightly from the 689 percent in the 1986 
elections but it was significantly lower than the 80 percent in 
the 1982 contest

a bush administration official expresses 
surprise at soviet statements that the kremlin would not object if 
hungary chose to leave the warsaw pact or east germany chose to 
reunite with west germany 
assistant secretary of state raymond g seitz said sunday the 
remarks by soviet party spokesman nikolai shishlin on hungary and 
the warsaw pact indicated a new kremlin policy 
i found his description about what the commitment to the 
warsaw pact was rather surprising seitz said sunday on abcs 
this week with david brinkley program he seemed to suggest 
that there was choice involved seitz said 
that would be welcome news if it is correct but that is not 
what the soviet government has been saying seitz said 
previously soviet and hungarian officials have stressed that 
hungary would stay in the kremlinled warsaw pact military alliance 
the statements by shishlin and foreign ministry spokesman 
gennadi gerasimov followed a declaration by president mikhail s 
gorbachev last week his nation had no moral right to interfere with 
changes underway in the soviet bloc nations of eastern europe 
gorbachev also declared a willingness to dissolve the warsaw 
pact if the west disbands the north atlantic treaty organization a 
step the bush administration has rejected as an effort to cut us 
influence in europe 
shishlin appearing on abc was asked whether the soviet union 
would object if hungary decided to leave the warsaw pact 
we respect the hungarian choice anyhow we are not afraid of 
these changes said shishlin 
asked whether hungary was free to leave the warsaw pact 
shishlin replied surely but you know that hungarian officials 
declared that they are ready to be in the warsaw pact until now 
in 1956 a declaration by hungarian leader imre nagy that his 
nation would quit the alliance prompted soviet military 
intervention in recent months reform leaders elected to power in 
hungary and poland have declared their intention to remain in the 
soviet alliance 
shishlin also appeared to leave the door open to reunification 
of west and east germany which have been divided since world war 
ii the us and west german governments historically have favored 
unification but the east german and soviet governments have not 
in light of the turmoil in east germany shishlin said nobody 
can predict what will happen and i am sure that this situation 
should be changed and it will be changed 
how will it be changed shishlin was asked 
by the right of choice he replied 
everything depends on the germans but it is necessary to 
understand our interests not to destabilize the situation in 
europe he said let us wait a little bit and i think we will 
find a new situation 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gerasimov appearing on the 
syndicated program oneonone called the new policy the 
frank sinatra doctrine 
frank sinatra has a very popular song i had it my way so 
hungary poland every other country has its own way they decide 
which road to take its their business and we watch watch 
closely but we do not interfere said gerasimov 
vice president dan quayle appearing on a different segment of 
oneonone said the administration was encouraged by 
president gorbachevs statement and the fact that he says that the 
soviet union does not have the right to interfere with eastern 
europe thats positive 
quayle advised caution in reacting to statements by soviet 
leaders 
we hope that perestroika succeeds he said using the 
russian word for gorbachevs reforms but as they talk about the 
frank sinatra doctrine also remember the nancy sinatra doctrine 
in song these boots are made for walking

as rescue workers dug for earthquake 
victims amid the crushed bodies and smell of death on the collapsed 
nimitz freeway the minds of some were not in oakland but in the 
steaming jungles of southeast asia 
a stress expert said vietnam veterans among the rescue workers 
began suffering emotional flashbacks as they pulled body after body 
from the rubble of the freeway that collapsed during the oct 17 
quake killing at least 39 people 
more than half the construction workers were vietnam vets 
said tom williams a psychologist and vietnam veteran himself who 
went to the freeway to counsel workers they started talking 
about vietnam again 
while the most obvious stress victims are those who lost a loved 
one and workers dealing with violent death experts say everyone 
who lived through the temblor is at risk of emotional upheaval 
there are 6 million people affected emotionally by the quake 
in this area williams said san francisco looks normal but if 
you stop anybody and ask them where they were during the 
earthquake you will listen to a litany of stress 
social workers and mental health experts warn that increases in 
physical abuse depression and possibly suicide will follow the 
71magnitude quake which killed at least 64 people 
the toll is already mounting santa cruz county officials 
reported 37 new complaints of physical and sexual abuse after the 
quake double the normal rate three women an unusually high 
number were reported raped in santa cruz the week after the quake 
in hardhit watsonville at least two women have been publicly 
beaten by their husbands in the tent cities the number of battered 
women seeking shelter at san franciscos rosalie house is up 20 
percent since the quake calls to the southern alameda county 
domestic violence law project in hayward have tripled 
throughout the region there are reports of people afraid to 
return to their homes 
suicide prevention inc of san francisco reported twice as many 
calls as usual in the past week with 90 percent related to the 
quake 
mental health experts say the best therapy is for everyone in 
the area to talk openly about the earthquake 
the apparent rise in domestic violence may stem from feelings of 
hopelessness that a natural disaster can generate said dr etta 
bryant of the california psychiatric society in san francisco 
posttraumatic stress disorders usually associated with war 
experiences and often taking months to appear are also expected to 
increase she said 
among the hardest hit people were the concrete and steel 
workers who busted through the interstate 880 roadway to expose 
vehicles that time and again contained mangled bodies said 
williams from aurora colo who spoke to a fortuitouslytimed 
society for traumatic stress studies convention here over the 
weekend 
the veterans administration sent stress counselors to the nimitz 
highway to help the former soldiers talk through their feelings 
williams said 
the convention planned a year ago brought 500 experts in 
stress management to the bay area they fanned out to disaster 
sites suicide prevention centers and talked to people at 
businesses 
people in the region have swung rapidly through a gamut of 
strong emotions including shock excitement and euphoria at being 
alive williams said 
now there is exhaustion williams said they are feeling a 
little helpless as reality is sinking in

blacks and hispanics were about twice as 
likely to be crime victims as whites last year according to the 
bureau of justice statistics 
while whites were robbed at the rate of 47 per 1000 people 
during 1988 the rate for blacks was 94 and for hispanics 101 
said the bureaus national crime survey released sunday 
males young people innercity residents and renters also were 
more likely to have been crime victims last year

year for the second straight year but remained below the high rates

venus and the crescent moon will make a 
brilliant pair in the evening sky thursday offering delightful 
viewing if the weather is clear 
the planet venus is the brightest star in the sky and will 
be visible in the southwest as night falls 
it will be shining close to the thin crescent moon making for a 
dramatic view reports sky amp telescope magazine 
millions of people went outdoors to watch a similar event in the 
spring of 1988 according to the popular astronomy magazine 
at sunset the planet will appear to the right of the crescent 
moon also visible should be saturn to the upper left though it 
will be much fainter 
with luck the magazine adds viewers may be able to observe the 
phenomenon of earthshine 
that is the reflected light from the earth brightening the 
normally dark portion of the moon so it becomes visible although 
not as bright as the crescent portion which is lighted by sunlight 
because the dark section of the moon glows dimly gray when this 
occurs it has been called the old moon in the new moons arms 
though venus and the moon look close together at this time they 
are really more than 65 million miles apart

attackers on a motorcycle shot and 
wounded two journalists in front of a television studio just hours 
after a purported cocaine kingpin was sent to the united states to 
be prosecuted 
no group claimed responsibility for sundays shooting in the 
capital but it appeared to be yet another response by cocaine 
barons to the governments extradition of accused drug traffickers 
to the united states 
jose abello silva the medellin cocaine cartels reputed master 
smuggler was handed over to us narcotics agents before dawn 
sunday at a bogota airport and then flown to tulsa okla to face 
drug charges us authorities said 
he was the fifth and most important drugtrafficking suspect 
extradited to the united states since the colombian government 
began an allout war on drug gangs 10 weeks ago eight more 
suspects are being held for extradition 
in sundays attack the two gunmen on a motorcycle shot jorge 
enrique pulido producer of the news program mundo vision and 
newswoman ximena godoy as they got into a car after leaving the 
studio police said 
pulido 45 was shot twice in the shoulder and once in the 
throat and ms godoy 22 was hit in the leg a police spokesman 
said both were in stable condition at a bogota hospital 
police said they captured one suspect and he was being 
questioned 
pulido and ms godoy were the ninth and 10th news industry 
employees shot since the government began its crackdown in august 
after the assassination of a leading presidential candidate the 
other eight died 
in the week after the crackdown began a group of drug 
traffickers calling itself the extraditables vowed in a letter sent 
to a radio network to attack the countrys journalists and public 
figures 
since then the offices of two newspapers have been bombed 
police said four bombs exploded in different locations in bogota 
on sunday night causing damage but no casualties 
twentytwo people have been killed and 220 injured over the past 
10 weeks in at least 175 bombings which the government blames on 
traffickers 
in tulsa us attorney tony graham said abello pleaded innocent 
to charges of conspiracy and distribution of cocaine during his 
arraignment before a federal judge there was no discussion of bond 
graham said abello would remain in the custody of the us 
marshals service pending another hearing thursday 
the arrest and extradition of abello silva represent a 
significant step in the federal antidrug offensive acting 
marshals service director john j twomey said in a statement 
released in washington 
cornelius dougherty a spokesman for the us drug enforcement 
administration said abello was considered a major transporter 
for the medellin cartel 
abello was arrested oct 10 in a bogota restaurant police said 
he had undergone plastic surgery to avoid detection 
he was indicted by a federal grand jury in tulsa on sept 2 
1987 along with florida stock broker frank palmero palmero later 
was convicted on drug distribution charges and sentenced to 16 
years in prison 
the us indictment accuses abello of involvement in a 
conspiracy to ship more than 1700 pounds of cocaine and 6200 
pounds of marijuana to the united states 
while abello is the most important drug trafficking suspect 
snared so far in the drug crackdown he does not figure in the us 
justice departments list of the 12 most wanted traffickers 
colombia has not captured any of those suspects who include the 
leaders of the medellin and cali cartels 
the two gangs are said by us officials to be responsible for 
smuggling at least 300 tons of cocaine into the united states each

the district of columbias 1989 homicide toll 
already equals last years record of 369 killings with more than 
half blamed on drugrelated violence and officials say they see 
no end in sight 
with two months remaining in 1989 district police reported that 
five slayings discovered during a sevenhour period over the 
weekend brought the tally to last years record death total 
three of the weekend killings were linked to drugs the other 
two were a 13yearold girl and her aunt who were found stabbed to 
death in their apartment saturday 
police blame more than 60 percent of the districts slayings on 
drugs particularly the arrival of crack cocaine 
the federal government is making the nations capital a test 
case for national antidrug strategies and city police are working 
long hours trying to curb drugrelated violence 
its awful but people in this community are resorting to 
deadly violence to resolve conflict said police spokesman lt 
reginald smith 
the most recent victim of the weekend was a 41yearold man 
found dead of multiple gunshot wounds early sunday he had 11000 
cash and a large quantity of heroin in his pockets when his body 
was found according to police detectives 
at the end of 1988 police had said 372 people were killed in 
homicides but they revised that number downward sunday by 
subtracting three victims of police shootings from the official 
total 
dc mayor marion barry whose political fortunes are slipping 
partly because the murder rate is skyrocketing calls the problem 
unstoppable 
national drug policy coordinator william j bennett acknowledged 
recently that the districts drug and crime problem the focus of 
special attention from his office will be difficult to solve 
no one should be surprised to learn that the nations capital 
is still plagued by a serious drug problem bennett said while 
reviewing federal efforts in the districts drug war the 
drugrelated murder rate is intolerably high the prisons are too 
crowded drugs continue to be sold openly around schools parks and 
housing projects 
bennett has lent federal prison space special agents and 
investigative tools to the citys antidrug effort and city police 
have been working 12hour shifts patrolling druginfested 
neighborhoods and housing projects 
but on friday president bush vetoed the citys annual spending 
bill delaying a special 32 million federal anticrime package 
by vetoing the bill because it would allow the city to use local 
tax money to finance medicaid abortions for poor women bush put on 
hold a plan to hire 700 extra police eight new judges and a host 
of schoolbased antidrug educational programs 
were going to have to study whether to cut out overtime 
police chief isaac fulwood said after the veto certainly we 
need to rethink purchasing strategies and slow them down this 
certainly wont help fight crime 
most city officials feel that until the citys appetite for 
drugs subsides there is little they can do 
the large percentage of the killings are related to the drug 
scene and in many cases hits that are put out in arguments 
over turf said barry spokeswoman lurma rackley we can delay 
them but as long as the drug market is still thriving those 
targeted killings are probably going to continue 
fulwood who has contradicted barrys negative view of the 
murder situation said the situation isnt as bleak as the mayor 
suggested 
we are making some progress and there are some things that 
are positive fulwood said the number of killings per day is 
decreasing its still too high but we are going in the right 
direction 
according to police statistics 49 people were killed in the 
nations capital during august 32 in september and 34 in october 
still the september and october figures represent a murder a day

one mans garden can be anothers 
eyesore especially when the landscaping is a 6foottall 
frontyard patch of wildflowers 
some residents of this tony cleveland suburb want joseph 
gyurgyiks lawn returned to a more traditional decor particularly 
now as the oncecolorful display is turning brown and wilting 
i think its an absolute eyesore said neighbor carolyn 
wallace 
the citys architectural board of review has declared the 
display in violation of a ban on inappropriate landscaping but 
gyurgyik said he will fight that ruling and any others 
the controversy has prompted city officials to try to tighten up 
the definition of whats appropriate in matters floral 
its like defining obscenity said david goss a councilman 
and member of the city board of zoning appeals thats a 
community standard really 
but gyurgyik says hes gotten many compliments on his tangle of 
50 to 75 varieties of domestic and wild flowers including poppies 
cosmos and blackeyed susans he says his neighbors are just being 
stuffy 
they like to have everything under control he said if it 
moves spray it 
theres also a practical side to the unusual garden gyurgyik 
admits the last thing i want to do after working 12 hours six 
days a week is come home and cut a lawn

pumpkin festivals are sprouting in some school districts where 
parents are trying to keep halloween out of the hallways and off 
school grounds because of its connection with witches and satan 
in alachua county fla robert guyer gathered the signatures of 
about 200 fellow parents who think the holiday is a religious 
celebration of wicca a modern pagan witchcraft cult 
when teachers dress up like witches what happens to these 
little christian kids like mine asked guyer a university of 
florida law student how are they going to feel when its 
dressup day and they dont dress up 
officials in alachua county left the decision on halloween to 
school principals 
in neighboring levy county the superintendent asked schools to 
avoid using halloween decorations and to cancel school celebrations 
halloween which is being celebrated tuesday night apparently 
sprang from an ancient ceremony honoring the celtic god of death 
in medieval england it came to be known as all hallows eve 
celebrated before the feast day of all hallows now all saints 
day as is the case with the pagan christmas tree few pay 
attention to its religious origins 
but guyer cites a recent 11th us circuit court of appeals 
ruling in atlanta that found that prayers before high school 
football games violate the constitutional separation of church and 
state 
as easter has been banned in favor of spring holiday as 
christmas has been banned in favor of winter holiday so too 
halloween should be banned in favor of fall holiday he said 
the rev bill ligon of brunswick ga agreed some of the 
symbolism used for halloween is used also by recognized religions 
i think the law as interpreted by the 11th circuit should be 
impartially applied to any religious activity at school 
halloweens defenders say it has become a nonreligious holiday 
the witches and goblins of halloween are no more believable 
than santa claus the easter bunny or the tooth fairy are they 
going to ban those tooasked charley mack a father of six in 
tallahassee fla where several schools are inaugurating harvest 
festivals in place of halloween 
in texas harlingen superintendent t carl mcmillan responded to 
parents anxieties by asking principals to tone down celebrations 
i asked them to review their practices and if they had 
anything that depicted blood and gore to try to eliminate that 
mcmillan said 
an elementary school in amarillo planned to celebrate pumpkin 
fun day rather than halloween 
and in frederick county md three elementary schools have 
discontinued halloween events at least one decided to hold a fall 
celebration instead 
i personally have trouble defending ghosts and goblins in our 
instructional curriculum said john thompson a county school 
official 
parents are upset by lurid descriptions of devil worship on 
television and in rock music said fred eisenbraun of the rapid 
city cops for christ in south dakota 
eisenbraun was in worthington minn last week to conduct an 
occult awareness seminar for teachers parents and teenagers 
satanists do not isolate themselves to new york to denver or 
to dallas eisenbraun said they like rural areas like 
worthington minnesota or rapid city south dakota where theres 
an availability of abandoned buildings animals and wideopen 
areas where there arent enough cops to check on them 
the popularity of slasher movies and costumes that imitate them 
worry other parents 
movies like halloween and friday the 13th are popular 
enough to make their protagonists among the hottestselling 
costumes this year outfitters say along with batman and jim and 
tammy bakker 
but freddy krueger the ogre of elm street isnt invited to the 
halloween party at the bethesda elementary school in waukesha wis 
students there were forbidden from dressing as characters in any of 
the graphically violent movies said principal nancy marsho 
we dont appreciate freddy here at bethesda ms marsho said

opposition activists heartened by 
their biggest protest in years say their movement is growing but 
that most people still dont seem to want to risk what comforts 
they have by getting involved 
in saturdays protest more than 10000 people gathered in 
wenceslas square to mark the 71st anniversary of czechoslovak 
independence police beat several dozen people and arrested 355 
including 17 foreigners 
the demonstrators called repeatedly for free elections a new 
government and the resignation of communist party leader milos 
jakes his popularity is said by informed czechs to be sliding even 
within communist ranks 
the rally was the first in which such strident calls for a new 
leadership were heard 
our leadership power is much more isolated after the changes 
in east germany noted jiri hajek a former foreign minister and 
now a leading activist with the charter 77 human rights group it 
is still strong and monolithic in czechoslovakia but they feel 
more alone 
the conviction that change is coming has grown markedly in 
prague in the last two months buoyed by the dramatic upheaval in 
east germany the emergence of a noncommunist government in poland 
and hungarys bold moves toward democracy 
but czechoslovaks have not suffered the privations endured by 
polish hungarian and east german consumers and many apparently 
are unwilling to risk economic problems in exchange for political 
change 
fear of losing material possessions coveted and gained by many 
czechs and slovaks a car a country cottage a videocassette 
player is the great brake on popular protest said dissident 
vaclav maly a roman catholic priest 
in addition the government in the past year has loosened 
restrictions on travel to the west and permitted freer expression 
in the arts 
to date there has been no stimulus to mass protest like in east 
germany where more than 50000 people have fled to the west since 
august with a tradition of caution and peaceful change many 
czechs and slovaks are not convinced that street demonstrations are 
the way to achieve reform 
this caution makes them wary of striking out for change while 
they perceive no strong leadership in the 30odd opposition groups 
banned playwright and activist vaclav havel is virtually the only 
nationally known figure in the ragged movement 
moreover czechs and slovaks for centuries have resisted their 
rulers from other larger nations with wit and ridicule rather 
than arms 
czechs are able to resist but not to sacrifice so much 
maly said we struggled spiritually 
the shock of the 1968 warsaw pact invasion to crush prague 
spring reforms is also deeply etched in the memory of 
czechoslovaks said dana nemcova of charter 77 
people really hoped then and then suddenly suffered a blow 
she noted the ensuing two decades of normalization as it is 
officially known have left many citizens very skeptical about 
change 
the people are very discontented but feel powerless she 
said they dont think words can change anything theyve heard 
so many words but especially young people are active and they 
have decided to struggle for their future 
prague abounds with talk of minirevolts inside the only two 
parties officially permitted by the ruling communists the peoples 
party and the socialist party 
in the past these two parties were instruments of the 
communist party noted maly now with calls for genuine democracy 
appearing in both parties and in their daily newspapers that is 
not so true

guerrilla factions have united to 
capture a major government garrison in central afghanistan raising 
fears in the military that rebel factions are ending feuds a 
government source and witnesses said today 
divisions have hurt the usbacked guerrillas in their campaign 
to topple the kabul government after the last soviet troops pulled 
out in february 
however a source in the moscowsupported government quoted 
military officials as saying officers were worried that the 
fractious rebels are now beginning to join forces 
several guerrillas factions reportedly fought together to 
capture the southcentral city of sore kallin the city is the 
hometown of the late noor mohammad taraki founder of the ruling 
democratic peoples party of afghanistan and the countrys first 
communist ruler 
thousands of rebels attacked the ghazni province city last week 
according to the government source and two truck drivers who 
arrived in kabul from the region today 
by friday rebel forces had routed the 3000member government 
garrison they said the truck drivers who spoke on condition of 
anonymity reported 10 rebels killed and 80 wounded but said they 
knew nothing of government casualties 
rebels captured many government weapons including thousands of 
ak47 assault rifles hand grenades and mortars the government 
source said 
taraki set up the garrison after he seized power in an april 
1978 coup that touched off the countrys civil war although taraki 
was ousted and killed in another coup in september 1979 the 
garrison had remained among the strongest in ghazni province the 
government source said 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said rebels 
have been trying to knock out the garrison for several years the 
victory was the result of their unity he said 
one truck driver said that after the rebel victory several 
mullahs or moslem clergymen were hung upside down from trucks 
after they were accused of supporting the government 
the government source said cooperation by separate guerrilla 
forces on a blockade of the governments main supply route from the 
soviet union also indicated new unity among rebel factions 
he said forces loyal to ahmad shah massoud and others led by 
gulbuddin hekmatyar had been coordinating the 10day blockade on 
the salang highway the northern route out of kabul 
the source said massoud a relatively liberal moslem had not 
previously united forces with hekmatyar a fundamentalist moslem 
rebels have also been blockading the three others highways out 
of kabul the capital according to private truckers 
the blockade was forcing up food prices and raising fears of 
shortages more than 2000 trucks were said to be stuck on salang 
highway north of the fighting 
in addition the rebels also stepped up rocketing on the 
capitals airport soldiers said at least six rockets crashed down 
there in the early morning today but no casualties were reported 
however they said air shipments from the soviet union were 
slowing down to about 10 a day from the usual 30 
government officials have said if land and air routes are shut 
the capital would be able to survive for about one month silos 
holding about 50000 tons of flour are said to be full and the 
government has also stockpiled gasoline

a delta air lines jetliner returned to 
dallasfort worth international airport shortly after takeoff when 
an engine failed and shot off sparks that witnesses said ignited 
grass fires 
it looked like a roman candle said irving resident mike 
sullivan who saw the boeing 727 while walking his dog it left a 
streak of sparks in the sky there were large chunks flying off of 
it 
flight 691 was bound for denver with 94 passengers and a crew of 
seven sunday night when one of its three engines failed shortly 
after takeoff said delta spokesman bill holland 
no injuries were reported officials said 
sparks coming from the failed engine ignited several grass fires 
in an open field near the airport witnesses told the irving fire 
department firefighters controled the blazes within an hour 
it was shooting off sparks and then it seemed to diminish 
sullivan said 
fire officials could not immediately confirm what started the 
fires the irving fire marshal was expected to investigate the 
blazes today said dispatcher gerard thompson 
federal aviation administration officials said the plane would 
remain at airport today while investigators attempt to identify the 
cause of the failure 
airport operation crews closed the runway and found several 
engine parts including what appeared to be pieces of turbine fan 
blades scattered along the runway said airport spokesman joe 
dealey jr 
there was a failure in the engine causing the parts to 
scatter holland said although he did not know whether the 
engine had caught on fire when the pilot saw he had the problem 
he circled the field and returned 
the plane took off at 719 pm and returned at 737 pm the 
plane taxied to an airport terminal under its own power said 
dealey 
shortly after the aircraft took off three grass fires were 
reported in irving about three miles southeast of the airport 
the irving fire department responded at 729 pm to the first 
report of a grass fire and sent at least four units to the scene 
thompson said 
john nash 80 of denver a passenger on the plane said he 
first knew something was wrong when he heard a loud noise about 
five minutes into the flight 
it was a pretty doggone loud noise like somebody fired a 
cannon or something nash said before that there were several 
other noises 
passengers boarded another plane that left for denver at 958

an antibusing initiative figures strongly in the 
nov 7 mayoral election that will result in either the citys first 
black or first republican mayor in more than two decades 
polls have shown strong support for initiative 34 which is 
backed by republican doug jewett they also give a slight edge to 
his opponent city councilman norm rice who is against the measure 
rice 46 would be the first black mayor in a city where blacks 
comprise only about 10 percent of the population 
if i win its going to say that people in seattle recognize 
how hard people work and how well they do their jobs rice said 
jewett the 42yearold city attorney would be the first 
republican to win the nonpartisan office since dorm braman in 1965 
the antibusing measure asks but does not require the 
independently elected and budgeted city school board to switch from 
a controlled choice attendance plan that requires busing of 
about 10 percent of the 40000 students for racial balance to a 
completely open enrollment system 
in exchange for abandoning mandatory busing schools would get 
about 45 million in annual sales tax revenue that now goes to the 
city with that money reserved for magnet programs designed to 
encourage racial balance 
jewett and rice finished onetwo among 13 candidates in 
septembers primary 
rice has trumpeted his democratic credentials including 
endorsements from the rev jesse jackson gov booth gardner us 
rep jim mcdermott and outgoing mayor charles royer who decided 
not to run for a fourth term 
a random telephone survey of 400 likely voters taken oct 1316 
for kirotv and the seattle postintelligencer showed rice leading 
by 4639 percent with the rest undecided 
in the poll which had a 48 point margin of error 46 percent 
favored the initiative 32 percent were opposed and the rest 
undecided 
many observers believe the washington supreme court did rice a 
favor by refusing to strike the initiative from the ballot 
opponents claimed the initiative violated the state constitution 
but the court decided to hear that claim only if the measure were 
passed 
as a result the overwhelmingly democratic electorate can reject 
busing while voting for rice 
rice sees crime as the top issue jewett says the schools are 
tops in his campaign but he accuses the news media of downplaying 
his positions on crime growth and other issues 
jewett helped draft the measure and has been its leading 
advocate city council and school board members generally are 
opposed 
so is rice who says the plan is racist in effect if not in 
intent he rejects suggestions that jewett is racially biased 
on oct 9 rice announced his own plan for assuring racial 
balance in schools with magnet programs stronger city support for 
education and incentives for housing integration the plan would 
eliminate any need for mandatory busing within four years he said 
jewett promptly accused his opponent of a nearflipflop to woo 
voters 
the political issue is that of leadership he said 
theyve watched norm rice go from adamant opposition to ending 
mandatory busing to embracing it 
rice admits a considerable change of heart because of what 
busing does to working families but said that if nothing else 
keeps the schools racially balanced mandatory measures must 
continue 
i still think that integrated quality education is important 
to the future of america he said

chinese police arrested four leaders of a 
dissident group that was active in the prodemocracy movement and 
worked to set up an underground armed force an official chinese 
report said today 
the report indicates chinese authorities are continuing the 
crackdown on people involved in the protests that swept the nation 
last spring 
the chongqing patriotic democracy league in sichuan province 
of southwestern china was formed may 21 after martial law was 
declared in beijing the official china news service said in a 
report appearing in hong kong 
police arrested the groups leader dai weiping and three other 
key members the news service said the brief report did not say 
when the arrests were made 
the report from chongqing called the organization a 
counterrevolutionary group a label that chinese officials have 
been using for the prodemocracy protests 
the news service said league members participated in illegal 
marches supporting the studentled protests in beijing gave 
reactionary speeches and incited turmoil 
after chinese troops crushed the prodemocracy movement in 
beijing on june 4 the league remained active by calling secret 
meetings and scheming to steal guns to set up an underground 
fighting force the report said 
hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed during the militarys 
june assault in the capital 
todays report also claimed that the league tried to get foreign 
support but did not elaborate 
the south china morning post an englishlanguage newspaper in 
hong kong quoted unidentified analysts in sichuan as saying they 
believed the league was an organization of workers including the 
unemployed 
china annnounced thousands of arrests at the beginning of the 
crackdown however few arrests have been publicized recently 
probably reflecting in part government sensitivity over foreign 
criticism

vietnam and the united states have 
agreed to expand joint efforts to resolve the cases of about 1700 
american soldiers missing from the vietnam war an official report 
said today 
the agreement was reached after two days of talks in hanoi 
between us presidential envoy john w vessey jr and foreign 
minister nguyen co thach said the official voice of vietnam radio 
it quoted a joint communique as saying the two sides agreed to 
refine and extend the process of joint cooperation to resolve the 
compelling cases of discrepancies including conducting additional 
research to determine the fate of these americans 
discrepancy cases are those to which the united states has 
assigned highest priority they are cases it says the vietnamese 
should have information on including instances where us airmen 
are believed to have parachuted to safety but were never heard from 
the broadcast did not give details of how the efforts would be 
expanded 
us and vietnamese specialists are now halfway into their 
eighth joint field investigation these have involved such work as 
interviewing villagers living near sites where us warplanes 
crashed 
the war ended in 1975 with the defeat of the south by the 
communist north 
the communique said the us side expressed appreciation for 
progress on programs to resettle vietnamese in the united states 
including halfamerican children and former inmates of political 
reeducation camps 
both sides agreed to continue efforts to sustain the current 
high level of cooperation on these important programs it said 
it said vessey repeated a us commitment to encourage the 
efforts by nongovernmental us organizations to help vietnam with 
its humanitarian problems including those involving disabled 
people and children 
in previous talks the united states has refused to discuss 
nonhumanitarian questions 
however the communique said vessey and thach also exchanged 
views on cambodia where a vietnameseinstalled government is 
fighting guerrillas supported by the united states 
vessey traveled to hanoi with senior state and defense 
department officials and ann mills griffiths the head of the 
private national league of families of american prisioners and 
missing in southeast asia 
it was his second mission to vietnam as presidential envoy his 
august 1987 trip resulted in vietnams agreement to speed up work 
on humanitarian issues and a us promise to encourage 
nongovernmental aid to vietnam 
the vietnamese seek american diplomatic recognition to end their 
isolation from the noncommunist world and bring in badly needed 
economic assistance 
they have complained that the united states has failed to move 
in that direction since vietnam in late september withdrew what it 
called its last 26000 troops from cambodia washington had called 
the action a prerequisite for establishing relations 
however washington is now demanding that vietnam work toward 
reaching a political settlement to the war in cambodia

investigators suspect a bomb that 
destroyed pan am flight 103 and killed 270 people may have 
originated in malta and that a libyan may have been involved a 
west german official said today 
londons sunday times first reported that the bomb came from 
malta an island nation that has enjoyed good relations with the 
government of radical libyan leader col moammar gadhafi 
the report said the bomb was transferred from a malta flight to 
flight 103 in frankfurt inside a suitcase unaccompanied by a 
passenger 
the newspaper which quoted airline personnel in malta also 
reported sunday that the suitcase carried clothing purchased in 
malta it said investigators had traced the clothing to a store 
where the shopkeeper remembered that a man he believed was libyan 
had bought them 
today a spokesman for west germanys federal criminal 
investigations office in wiesbaden confirmed the maltese link and 
said it was providing a hot trail for investigators 
the scottish detectives who are heading the investigation have 
contended for several months that the bomb was put on the jet in 
frankfurt where flight 103 originated passengers and luggage were 
transferred to a boeing 747 at heathrow airport in london 
all 259 people aboard and 11 residents on the ground were killed 
when the bomb ripped apart the jet over lockerbie scotland on 
dec 21 
there are clues that a suitcase from malta may have played a 
part said willi fundermann a spokesman for the federal 
investigations office 
there are also clues that someone from libya or at least 
someone with a libyan accent may have bought the items of 
clothing whether he also is the one who brought it the suitcase 
on board is still not known at this time fundermann said in a 
telephone interview 
scottish authorities have declined comment on any malta 
connection 
no one has been charged in the bombing 
there has long been speculation that a group of palestinians 
arrested in october in west germany may have been behind the 
attack but fundermann said there was no proof of that 
he said the initial clue about a malta connection came from an 
examination of the remains from the crash site he did not 
elaborate 
the sunday times said the evidence was in a computer list of all 
luggage put aboard flight 103 in frankfurt

rescuers located two more bodies in the 
massive steel and concrete debris of the phillips petroleum co 
plastics plant early today while the search continued for six 
workers still missing 
they were found in the area of the control room and the 
finishing room company spokesman rob phillips said 
thats really where we expect to find the rest of the missing 
but were talking about an area as big as a football field so 
theres still quite a lot of area to get through 
in the week since the plastics plant was ripped apart by a 
series of explosions 16 bodies have been recovered by crews 
working around the clock only five bodies have been officially 
identified 
phillips said the storm that dumped hail and up to 4 inches of 
rain around houston on sunday helped rescue efforts by damping dust 
from the rubble 
the rain didnt really slow them down yesterday phillips 
said today it kept the dust down and the asbestos that is being 
cleaned up and removed from the area from flying around from what 
i hear we may get more rain today so that could be good 
but the crews search was hampered sunday by a steel beam which 
was hanging loosely 150 feet over a control room area where 
rescuers believe they will find the missing bodies workers used a 
crane to stabilize the beam 
in addition to the two bodies found today searchers working 
over the weekend found six bodies saturday and another on sunday 
phillips spokesmen said 124 people were injured in the accident 
and nine remained hospitalized late sunday 
the polyethylene plant produced almost 20 percent of the 
nations production of plastic pellets used in the manufacture of 
milk jugs and grocery bags 
phillips officials believe flammable hydrocarbon vapor from 
ethylene and isobutane gases escaped from a leaking chemical 
reactor triggering mondays blast but they have said they dont 
know how the gases were ignited

east germanys new communist leader will travel to 
moscow within the next two days for talks with kremlin officials on 
political reform communist party sources said monday 
activists in leipzig where 300000 people marched one week ago 
in the largest such demonstration in east germanys 40year 
history said protesters would take to the streets again today to 
up keep pressure for democratic reform 
demands for reform have reached a fevered pitch this month and 
the government sponsored town meetings across the nation sunday to 
discuss change 
at least 20000 people attended the rally in east berlin and 
many jeered local officials and demanded explanations for misdeeds 
and blunders 
party sources said communist leader egon krenz would meet with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in moscow to discuss the 
course of reform talks now under way in east germany 
west germanys ard television network said krenz would go to 
moscow on tuesday 
meanwhile a leader of east germanys liberal democratic party 
charged that the nations political structure no longer 
corresponded to the will of the people 
manfred bogisch suggested in a commentary in his partys 
newspaper der morgen that the communist partys leading role 
would have to be won not dictated 
although bogisch reiterated that socialism was not at issue in 
the reform debate he said the communist leaderships policies are 
now a matter of debate 
those who were responsible for the stagnation will have to 
take responsibility for it he said 
the liberal democrats have been at the forefront of efforts to 
create more political pluralism within east germanys socialist 
system 
under east germanys constitution all political parties are 
aligned with the communist party the liberal democrats have said 
the parties should have more independence 
east germans have taken to the streets by the hundreds of 
thousands this month to demand a more open society with free 
elections a free press and an end to oneparty rule since 
midseptember more than 50000 have fled to the west many of them 
young skilled workers 
the communist party newspaper neues deutschland today described 
weekends rallies and protests as passionate and open pugnacious 
and constructive and made no effort to discourage future 
demonstrations that have been drawing thousands to the streets each 
night 
but it also declared that recent events stem from advances in 
socialism 
krenz has promised a new course for the country including 
freer travel to the west and an amnesty for people jailed for 
trying to escape what has been a tightlycontrolled society 
sundays meeting in berlin quickly turned into an emotional 
forum with speakers criticizing privileges accorded communist 
officials they also accused police of brutality against peaceful 
prodemocracy protesters earlier this month 
guenter schabowski east berlin party chief and a member of the 
countrys ruling politburo drew applause when he announced his 
support for approved and wellordered demonstrations in the 
city 
since krenz took power oct 18 officials have launched an 
unparalleled campaign of dialogue and openness aimed at winning 
public trust many activists are skeptical however saying 
communist leaders are only interested in reforms that do not 
challenge their monopoly on power 
communist officials in recent days have appealed to protesters 
to attend governmentorganized dialogue sessions rather than take 
to the streets 
a member of the countrys largest opposition group new forum 
was quoted in an interview with a west german newspaper sunday as 
saying street protests will continue as long as the government 
refuses to recognize opposition groups

both detroits major newspapers endorsed tom 
barrow the 40yearold accountant who has never held public 
office in his race against frontrunning mayor coleman a young 
who is seeking a fifth term 
the detroit news and detroit free press in sunday editions 
endorsed barrow in the nov 7 election barrow drew 39 percent of 
the vote in his 1985 campaign against young polls show the 
71yearold mayor first elected in 1973 is likely to win 
both papers said it was time for a change 
the plain fact is that coleman young has run out of steam 
the news said 
the free press said a vote for barrow is really a protest vote 
an almost desperate cry for the kind of sustained effort to achieve 
change that the city needs 
i cant explain the detroit media young said during a radio 
interview no other press anywhere in the nation of which i am 
aware is so negative toward its own city 
barrow said the endorsements show that even the establishment 
which has been supporting young for 16 years now is coming to 
agreement with the neighborhoods and recognize its time for a 
change

authorities say an arsonist may be responsible 
for a fire that damaged the home of the missing parents of 
elizabeth morgan the physician who was jailed for hiding her 
daughter in a child visitation battle 
no one was in the house when the fire began early sunday and 
there were no injuries but the fire caused 50000 damage to the 
suburban fairfax county va home said county fire department 
spokeswoman pam weiger 
ms weiger said today that investigators were trying to pin down 
the cause 
robert morgan elizabeth morgans brother said he believed the 
fire was set deliberately 
the way investigators told it to us is that arson is the 
only reason that makes sense but they cant say it was arson 
unless theres no doubt robert morgan said 
the report says that the point of origin was outside the 
house it was not the wiring or anything that did it and it was in 
the middle of the night he said 
ms weiger said she had no more information on the cause of the 
fire 
robert morgan said the home has not been occupied since 
elizabeth morgan was sent to jail more than two years ago for

foretich sexually molested the girl foretich 46 denies the 
charge and a washington judge has granted him visitation rights

that ended her imprisonment

1987 and the girl who is 7 years old remains missing

police said today they were 
investigating for possible prosecution participants in a rally by 
70000 people in which the outlawed african national congress 
guerrilla campaign was repeatedly praised 
all that was said and all that took place is being studied 
said police spokesman col vic haynes the morning after the welcome 
rally for seven recently freed anc leaders in a soccer stadium 
outside johannesburg 
nearly everything about the gathering violated security laws 
but police kept their distance and state television led the evening 
news with a report on what was the largest antigovernment rally in 
south africas 79year history 
newspapers including progovernment media today called on the 
government to do away with laws restricting political activity and 
the goverment hinted it may be considering lifting some 
restrictions on political expression to allow peaceful protests 
we must be prepared to run risks law and order minister 
adriaan vlok said on governmentrun television sunday night adding 
that maintaining the status quo is riskier than allowing mass 
protests 
but andries treurnicht head of the proapartheid conservative 
party called for parliament to meet immediately to discuss the 
direction the government was taking 
the anc under its own flag and that of the communist party 
alongside is enjoying complete freedom to propagate its aims and 
ambitions and issues one ultimatum after the other to the 
government treurnicht said 
socalled peace protests are escalating and are accepted by 
the government as legal utterances of grievances he said 
the government granted permission for sundays rally as part of 
an attempt by new president fw de klerk to promote blackwhite 
negotiations but a magistrate had warned organizers that speakers 
should avoid promoting anc aims 
we refused said cyril ramaphosa a union leader and one of 
the main rally organizers the anc lives it is amongst us 
today the anc has captured center stage in south africa 
declared walter sisulu 77 the groups former general secretary 
in the main address sunday to the cheering singing dancing throng 
which filled most of the seats in the recently opened stadium 
police and soldiers set up roadblocks nearby and searched 
vehicles but few security force personnel were visible at the 
stadium itself 
from a podium erected beneath huge banners of the anc and the 
south african communist party sisulu appeared with six anc 
colleagues freed unconditionally from prison oct 15 all but one 
had spent at least 25 years in prison 
deafening cheers arose when sisulu and his colleagues slowly 
circled the playing field each walking under an umbrella behind 
an honor guard of 20 young militants clad in khaki uniforms and 
marching in military style 
anc anc shouted the crowd many dressed in the movements 
green black and gold colors or wearing tshirts with the slogan 
anc lives and the names of the freed prisoners 
the crowd included white south africans and diplomats from at 
least 15 countries 
sisulu said his movement would never abandon its guerrilla 
campaign unilaterally but repeating previous offers he said it 
would consider suspending violence and entering talks if the 
government frees all political prisoners legalizes the anc and 
lifts the 40monthold state of emergency 
to date we see no clear indication that the government is 
serious about negotiation said sisulu who urged intensified 
economic sanctions all the utterances are vague 
the crowed roared when prominent activist murphy morobe read a 
letter of greeting from oliver tambo the exiled president of the 
anc who may not legally be quoted in south africa 
this is a joyful day for all of us said the message we 
meet to celebrate a victory that belongs to all the people of our 
country 
tambo directed part of his remarks at south african whites who 
seek to maintain apartheid which denies the nations 28 million 
blacks a voice in national affairs the 5 million whites control 
the economy and maintain separate schools districts and health 
services 
they are part of our heritage tambos message said in 
the end they too must learn to celebrate freedom and not 
oppression 
if the government tries to perpetuate minority rule said tambo 
blacks will win their stuggle through confrontation 
in addition to the seven anc leaders freed oct 15 the rally 
also honored govan mbeki released from prison in november 1987 
sisulu mbeki and four of the other men were sentenced to life 
imprisonment at a 1964 treason trial along with nelson mandela the 
ancs bestknown leader who remains jailed 
mandelas wife winnie who earlier this year was at odds with 
prominent antiapartheid leaders was introduced over the public 
address system and had a seat of honor on the podium 
state television showed footage of the crowd and paraphrased 
some of sisulus remarks but did not broadcast any excerpts of the 
speeches 
the rally went ahead despite anonymous threats that white 
extremists would shoot at black spectators there were no serious 
disturbances 
scores of buses brought blacks from communities across the 
country 
the anc has been outlawed since 1960 a year before it began a 
sabotage and bombing campaign it was founded in 1912 and spent its 
first five decades using nonviolent tactics to seek rights for 
blacks 
de klerk who assumed power in midaugust has offered to 
negotiate a new constitution within five years that would extend 
political rights to blacks but protect white interests 
the anc wants a constitution that would establish a oneperson 
onevote system

the supreme court today barred a lawsuit 
against the christian science church in the death of a 15monthold 
michigan boy who died of meningitis 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that a suit 
against the church and its members over faith healing would violate 
their religious freedom 
the case stems from the death of matthew swan on july 7 1977 
from brain abscesses caused by meningitis 
his parents douglas and rita swan of grosse pointe park mich 
were lifelong adherents of christian science at the time of their 
sons death 
they were advised by two christian science healers jeanne 
laitner and june ahearn to rely on religious faith when matthew 
developed a raging fever about three weeks before he died 
after their sons death the swans sued the two healers and the 
church alleging negligence the suit said among other things 
that the healers made inaccurate diagnoses and coerced the parents 
to forgo seeking medical help 
the church was accused of negligence for failing to train the 
healers properly 
a michigan state judge threw out the suit and the dismissal was 
upheld by a state appeals court in 1986 
by that time the swans had withdrawn from the case and were 
replaced as plaintiffs by a representative of their childs estate 
the appeals court said constitutionally protected yreligious 
freedom outweighs in this case the states interest in protecting 
children 
religious conduct is permissible and protected unless the 
state can show a compelling state interest in interfering with the 
conduct the state court said even then the state must act in 
the least restrictive manner we find no merit in the argument 
that a negligence suit is the least restrictive means of 
regulating spiritual healing practices 
lawyers representing matthew swans estate said the michigan 
ruling conflicts with others that have allowed churches and their 
officials to be sued 
for example they cited a suit against the rev sun myung moons 
unification church by two former california members who say they 
were duped into joining it 
the supreme court last may refused to block that suit rejecting 
an appeal by the unification church 
the justices in the past have declined to review cases of 
alleged clergy malpractice and those in which faith healing 
practices are at issue 
the case is brown vs laitner 89354

the supreme court today turned away a dispute 
over how to apply federal antibias laws to foreignowned 
businesses operating in the united states 
the court over one dissenting vote let stand a ruling 
challenged both by korean air lines and a philadelphia man replaced 
in his kal job by a korean citizen 
justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the case but 
four votes are needed to grant such review 
thomas v macnamara was fired in 1982 as kals 
philadelphiabased district sales manager for delaware 
pennsylvania and southern new jersey he was replaced by wan gin 
chung who is in this country on a visa 
macnamara said the airline violated that portion of the civil 
rights act of 1964 banning discrimination based on race or national 
origin 
macnamara 57 when he was fired also said kal violated a 
federal law against age bias chung was 42 in 1982 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals in its ruling last 
december gave partial victories to both macnamara and kal 
the appeals court ordered that macnamaras lawsuit go to trial 
but said he could prevail only if proving kal intentionally 
discriminated against him based on some illegal criterion 
the appeals court said that to win macnamara must prove that 
kal would not have fired him but for his race national origin or 
age 
macnamara cannot succeed by showing primarily with statistical 
evidence that his firing had the effect of discriminating against 
older white americans the appeals court said 
the 3rd circuit court rejected kals argument that it should be 
shielded from all bias suits because of a 1956 treaty of 
friendship commerce and navigation between the united states and 
korea 
the treaty gives businesses of each nation broad discretion in 
hiring on foreign soil 
the appeals court said the treatys limited purpose is to 
assure foreign investors the freedom to place their own citizens 
in key management positions thus facilitating their operational 
success in the host country 
the treaty does not authorize a broad exemption from laws that 
prohibit discrimination on grounds unrelated to citizenship the 
appeals court said 
kal lawyers said the ruling will discourage foreign investment 
in the united states and american investment abroad 
macnamara said the decision gives foreign corporations greater 
rights than those of domestic us corporations and exposes us 
workers to discrimination 
the bush administration urged the supreme court to reject the 
competing appeals 
the cases are kal vs macnamara 881449 and macnamara vs kal 
881551

fitz of hixson tenn and leslie shelton of goldsboro nc 
the grayback originally a missilecarrying sub was converted 
in the late 1960s to dispatch divers underwater 
general dynamics designed the diving chamber which then was 
built by the navy 
court records said the navy was aware of a problem with the 
ventilation valve it was difficult to turn and there were no 
warning devices to tell the divers it was not open completely 
but the sub operated safely for 13 years as the navy rather 
than redesigning the system chose to compensate for the problem by 
training divers to cope 
a federal judge in texas ordered general dynamics to pay 425 
million to the victims families the navy was not ordered to pay 
any money 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the damage judgment 
in february 
the appeals court interpreting a key 1988 supreme court ruling 
refused to shield general dynamics from the award 
the high court last year ruled that a military contractor is 
protected from being sued when the government approves equipment 
conforming to reasonably precise pentagon specifications and 
the company warns the government about any potential dangers of 
which it is aware 
the 5th circuit court said that ruling does not protect general 
dynamics because the navy in effect rubberstamped the 
contractors design plans thus the appeals court said it was the 
company rather than the navy that exercised discretion over the 
chambers design 
the government does not exercise a discretionary function by 
merely approving the contractors work the appeals court said 
if the government delegates its design discretion to the 
contractor and allows the contractor to develop the design the 
government contractor defense against being sued does not apply 
major military contractors and business groups joined general 
dynamics in urging the supreme court to overturn the 5th circuit 
court ruling 
the us chamber of commerce said the appeals court ruling 
undermines the 1988 supreme court decision and could discourage 
companies from competing for military contracts 
the case is general dynamics vs trevino 89376

a retired marine lieutenant colonel who worked 
for former sen roger jepsen riowa lost a supreme court bid 
today to revive a libel lawsuit against sen tom harkin diowa 
and two others 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that threw out 
james secrists suit 
secrist while still an activeduty marine was assigned to 
jepsens senate office staff in 1983 
the arrangement was a controversial one with secrist continuing 
to be paid his 45000 annual salary by the marine corps 
harkin a house member at the time who ran against and defeated 
jepsen a in a 1984 senate race criticized his republican 
opponents appointment of secrist 
harkin distributed a statement to the news media that said 
secrist helped raise funds for jepsens campaign the statement 
disputed jepsens claim that secrist was hired to help procure 
defense contracts for iowa businesses 
secrist retired from the marines in 1985 to become a washington 
lobbyist for defense contractor rockwell international corp in 
1986 he sued harkin pam mckinney the senators press secretary 
and harkins campaign manager john frew 
secrist said the 1984 news release was libelous because it 
implied he solicited funds for jepsen in violation of federal law 
secrist and jepsen denied that the former marine solicited campaign 
funds 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals last may upheld a federal 
judges decision to throw out secrists suit 
the appeals court said harkins campaign press release was 
opinion not fact 
a campaign press release is not a research monograph the 
appeals court said such a release is at least as likely to 
signal political opinion as a newspaper editorial or political 
cartoon 
only factual statements not opinions may be the basis of a 
libel suit the appeals court said 
also the appeals court said secrist failed to prove actual 
malice that the statements in the news release were made with 
knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity 
secrist said harkin and his staff aides failed to investigate 
before alleging the officer marine was raising funds for jepsen 
but the appeals court said such a lack of investigation is not 
evidence of reckless disregard for the truth 
the case is secrist vs harkin 89220

the supreme court today let stand rulings that 
may allow urbana ohio officials to ban as obscene five adult 
magazines generally not considered hardcore pornography 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by store owners 
who said their freespeech rights were violated by the ban 
store owners charles downing and paul veneroni said the 
magazines are known in the publications industry as adult 
sophisticate magazines similar to playboy and penthouse 
magazines of this genre generally contain erotic photographs 
of a woman or a man or couples in various poses often fully nude 
but avoid explicit depictions of sexual activity the store 
owners said 
the magazines are nuggets velvet juggs oui and big boobs 
copies were puchased by urbana law director john newlin on nov 
25 1985 at the main news and smoke shop run by downing and 
veneroni 
a municipal judge ruled that the magazines are obscene opening 
the way for city officials to ban their sale in urbana 
the ohio supreme court by a 52 vote upheld the ruling in may 
courts are not bound by the magazine industrys determination 
of what is explicit the state court said all five magazines 
contain either in the text photographs or their advertisements 
numerous depictions or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts they 
are legally obscene under urbana ordinances 
for example the state court said there are ads in the 
magazines showing sexual activity in which small black dots were 
used to obscure sexual organs the dots would not preclude a jury 
from finding the pictures are obscene the state court said 
the store owners said the ban violates a 1973 supreme court 
ruling that says material is obscene if the average person using 
contemporary community standards finds it appeals to prurient 
interests and depicts sexual acts in a patently offensive manner 
that ruling said the work must be judged as a whole and must be 
found to lack serious literary artistic political or scientific 
value 
the case is downing vs urbana 89298

the supreme court today refused to hear 
appeals by three drug manufacturers fighting lawsuits over the 
effects of des a drug once used by pregnant women to prevent 
miscarriages 
the court without comment left intact a new york ruling aimed 
at forcing all manufacturers of the drug to share in paying damages 
for injuries allegedly caused by des 
des the common name for the synthetic female hormone 
diethylstilbestrol was made and sold by some 300 phramaceutical 
companies from 1947 until 1971 
up to 3 million women used it to help prevent miscarriages but 
in 1970 researchers discovered a connection between des and cancer 
in the daughters of women who used the drug 
there was evidence the cancer often did not develop until the 
daughter of the des user was from 15 to 25 years old 
in the cases acted on today er squibb amp sons eli lilly and 
co and rexall drug co challenged a ruling last april by the new 
york court of appeals 
the state court said it is generally impossible to identify the 
manufacturer of the des ingested in any particular case 
druggists usually filled prescriptions from whatever was on hand 
and one brand of des pretty much resembled the next the state 
court said 
also it said because years or decades passed before the cancer 
developed it is practically impossible to trace the producer of 
des in any particular case 
the state court rejected manufacturers claims that they should 
not be held liable for potentially millions of dollars in damages 
when there is no proof they made the drug that caused any injury 
but the appeals court said 
it would be inconsistent with the reasonable expectations of a 
modern society to say to these women that because of the 
insidious nature of an injury that long remains dormant and 
because so many manufacturers each behind a curtain contributed 
to the devastation the cost of injury should be borne by the 
innocent and not the wrongdoers 
the state court said damage awards against each company should 
be paid based on its percentage of national des sales 
this socalled market theory corresponds to the overall 
culpability of each defendant measured by the amount of risk of 
injury each defendant created to the public at large the state 
court said 
that court also upheld a 1986 new york law that suspended the 
deadline for filing damage claims allegedly caused by des the law 
permitted suits to be filed for one year regardless of when the 
injury occurred 
because of the latent nature of des injuries we believe that 
an injustice has been rectified by creating the oneyear 
window the state court said 
the cases are rexall drug co vs tigue 89168 er squibb amp 
sons vs hymowitz 89204 eli lilly vs hymowitz 89397

the supreme court today refused to make it 
easier for police pursuing people suspected of minor crimes to 
enter their homes without court warrants 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that a 
moorestown nj man accused of numerous motor vehicle offenses 
was arrested unlawfully in his home two years ago 
richard j bolte was arrested at his home in the predawn hours 
of april 6 1987 
police officer william liss had followed a car he noticed 
swerving on and off the road he tried to pull the car over by 
activating his squad cars lights and siren 
the swerving car ignored the officers signals and made four 
loops through a residential neighborhood before pulling into a 
private driveway and into a garage 
liss stopped his car in the driveway and ran into the garage he 
told bolte to stop but bolte entered the house liss followed him 
telling bolte that he was under arrest 
when taken to a police station bolte refused to take a 
breathalyzer test he was charged with reckless driving driving 
while intoxicated refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test 
driving with an expired license failure to maintain a single lane 
eluding and resisting arrest and disorderly conduct 
bolte sought to have his refusal to submit to a breath test 
thrown out as trial evidence claiming that it was based on an 
unlawful arrest 
a trial judge turned down boltes request but a state appeals 
court and the new jersey supreme court ruled that the evidence must 
be suppressed 
the states highest court ruled that boltes warrantless arrest 
in his home amounted to an unreasonable police seizure banned by 
the constitutions fourth amendment 
in the appeal acted on today new jersey attorney general peter 
perretti relied on previous rulings in which the justices allowed 
such warrantless arrests in cases of hot pursuit by police of 
criminal suspects 
but the new jersey court said the hotpursuit exception to the 
fourth amendments warrant requirement has been interpreted to 
apply only to the pursuit of fleeing felons not people 
suspected of relatively minor crimes or misdemeanors 
the case is new jersey vs bolte 89417

the supreme court today ordered further study 
in a lawsuit thats been in federal court for 18 years in which 
black workers allege racial bias at a railroad freight car plant in 
alabama 
the justices in a brief order said the 11th us circuit court 
of appeals should restudy the case in light of three of their 
recent civil rights rulings 
in one key decision last summer the justices made it harder to 
win onthejob bias cases by using statistics to show racial 
disparities in an employers workforce 
the bessemer ala plant was at one time the worlds largest 
for building railroad freight cars it employed 2000 in 28 
departments before being shut down in 1981 
the appeals acted on today stem from a 1971 lawsuit accusing 
pullmanstandard and the united steelworkers union of agreeing to a 
contract that discriminated against blacks in hiring training 
temporary assignments promotions and in the companys seniority 
system 
the supreme court in 1982 overturned a federal appeals court 
ruling that the seniority system violated the federal civil rights 
act of 1964 the justices said the appeals court exceeded its 
authority in determining the seniority system intentionally was 
biased 
but the dispute was far from over the high court left many 
questions unanswered including whether blacks seeking damages 
proved the seniority rules had the effect of discriminating against 
them even if unintentional 
after ensuing lower court hearings the 11th us circuit court 
of appeals last year handed down a lengthy ruling that in part 
favored the blacks and in part favored the company and the union 
the appeals court said the workers proved the companys 
procedures for picking supervisors had a discriminatory impact 
against blacks 
the appeals court also said the seniority system was not created 
or maintained with discriminatory intent and that any 
discrimination in department assignments ended by february 1969 
but the appeals court overturning part of a trial judges 
decision said pullmanstandard may be forced to pay damages for 
racially discriminatory department assignments before february 1969 
pullmanstandard asked the supreme court to dismiss the suit 
the company said the appeals court relied incorrectly on 
statistical evidence to show discriminatory effects 
the companys lawyers also said the classaction suit on behalf 
of all black workers at the plant was defective because some 
employees who served as representatives of the class were 
ineligible to sue 
the black workers asked the justices to revive their attack on 
the seniority system and to make it easier to prove their claims 
and win damages 
the cases are pullmanstandard vs swint 881601 and swint vs 
pullmanstandard 881602

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
law enforcement officials who discovered marijuana growing on a 
maine couples heavily wooded property 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that officers 
violated the couples privacy rights when they entered the grounds 
without a search warrant 
the appeal stems from a search by officers from the kennebec 
county sheriffs department of paul wings 45acre property in 
litchfield maine on aug 19 1987 patricia magagnoli lived there 
with wing 
the officers after getting a tip that marijuana was being grown 
in the area flew over it in an airplane and spotted what they 
believed to be marijuana plants in a grassy clearing 
without a court warrant they entered wings property using a 
driveway that splits into a y about 100 feet from the road the 
left leg of the driveway leads to wings home and the right ends at 
a grassy area where the officers said they discovered the marijuana 
the grassy area turned out not to be the same clearing the 
officers observed from the airplane that clearing was on a 
neighbors property where marijuana also was growing 
the officers got a warrant before seizing the marijuana plants 
and searching the home where wing and ms magagnoli lived 
a state judge ruled the plants could not be used as evidence 
against the couple the judge said wing preserved the heavily 
wooded nature of the property to guard his privacy in effect using 
trees as a substitute for a fence 
the judge emphasized that wing and ms magagnoli said they 
sunbathed in the nude and made love in the grassy clearing the 
couple reasonably expected their intimate activities there 
would be as private as if they took place in the home the judge 
said 
the ruling was upheld by a 33 vote of the maine supreme 
judicial court last june 
maine prosecutors said the judges decision conflicts with a 
1987 supreme court ruling that allowed police without a warrant to 
enter fencedin but unwooded property and look into a barn 
located about 60 yards from a ranch house 
the justices ruled in that case that the barn was not part of 
the homeowners curtilage the area of land occupied by a 
dwelling its yard and other nearby buildings that are protected 
against warrantless searches by the constitutions fourth amendment 
the high court in 1984 reaffirmed a longstanding legal doctrine 
that police may enter and search even fencedin open fields 
without a court warrant 
the case acted on today is maine vs wing 89381

the supreme court today let stand a 15 
million award won by the family of a us forest service employee 
who died of cancer after his exposure to a dow chemical co 
herbicide 
the justices without comment refused to hear a dow appeal 
aimed at winning a new trial in the productliability case 
james greenhill in 197677 was seasonally employed by the forest 
service in oregon primarily as a fire fighter he also 
participated in a weedcontrol project in which he applied dow 
herbicides including dichlarophenoxyacetic acid or 24d 
greenhills exposure to 24d ended in 1978 when he was 
transferred to another national park 
a year later greenhill was diagnosed as suffering from 
hodgkins disease he died in 1986 
greenhill sued dow which is based in midland mich in 1979 
but his lawsuit sat dormant for six years after wrongly being 
included in a series of suits over vietnam veterans exposure to 
the herbicide agent orange when greenhill died his family 
replaced him as plaintiffs 
a federal jury in marshall texas awarded the greenhill family 
15 million in damages against dow in 1987 
at trial a physician hired as an expert witness by the 
greenhill family testified that 24d caused greenhills cancer 
among the doctors medical records submitted in the case those 
of another patient joseph moss mistakenly were included 
when a dow lawyer asked the doctor about moss the doctor said 
he did not know any such person 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for dow said they learned 
after the greenhill trial that the doctor had known moss they said 
the newly discovered evidence entitled dow to a new trial 
but the 5th us circuit court of appeals rejected that argument 
in upholding the award last april 4 
the doctors false testimony could not have affected the 
outcome of the trial the appeals court said the further 
revelation that the doctor had forgotten the name of one patient 
could not have affected the jurys verdict dow was not hurt by 
the doctors confusion 
the case is dow chemical vs greenhill 89395

the supreme court today agreed to use a 
chicago drug prosecution to consider expanding police search powers 
the justices said they will hear arguments that police acting 
without a warrant should be allowed to use evidence seized after 
they were allowed into a mans apartment by his girlfriend 
the defendant edward rodriguez was arrested on july 26 1985 
on charges he possessed cocaine and marijuana with intent to 
distribute the drugs police said the drugs and drug paraphernalia 
were in plain view at rodriguezs apartment 
gale fisher who lived with rodriguez parttime summoned police 
to her mothers home on july 26 she told them rodriguez had beaten 
her at the couples apartment and she wanted to make a complaint 
the police then accompanied her to rodriguezs apartment and she 
opened the door with a key she later testified that she took the 
key from rodriguezs dresser after the two argued earlier that day 
an illinois appeals court said police violated the defendants 
rights because ms fisher lacked authority to let the police into 
the apartment 
police may not enter and search a home without a warrant if 
the party who consented to the entry had apparent authority to do 
so but lacked actual authority the state appeals court said 
the appeals court noted that ms fishers name was not on the 
apartment lease and she did not help pay the rent also the state 
court said she was an infrequent visitor and did not have access 
to the apartment when rodriguez was not there she also had moved 
her clothes and children to her mothers home the state court 
noted 
all of these factors indicate that fisher did not have the 
common authority over the defendants apartment that was necessary 
to make her consent to enter valid the state court added 
the illinois attorney generals office in appealing to the 
supreme court said police acted in good faith when they relied on 
ms fishers apparent authority to permit entry into the home 
the supreme court in 1974 ruled that when one occupant of a home 
consents to a search of the premises evidence police find may be 
used against another occupant 
the case is illinois vs rodriguez 882018

stopped drivers to ask if they had been in the vicinity the evening 
of oct 22 when the boy was kidnapped

the supreme court today agreed to review a 
ruling government lawyers say threatens the federal program 
protecting the pensions of 30 million american workers 
the justices said they will decide what authority the pension 
benefit guaranty corporation a federal agency has to order 
employers to restore terminated pension plans 
a federal appeals court limited such authority by setting aside 
the agencys order that ltv corp and its subsidiary ltv steel 
co restore three pension plans with unfunded liabilities of 23 
billion 
the appeal acted on today said the ruling if not overturned 
could make the agency an openended source of industry bailouts 
and could lead to a financial crisis similar to that currently 
facing the governments insurance program for the savings and 
loan industry 
in other action the court 
turned away an appeal by a nebraska state agency that wants to 
test its employees for aids 
the court without comment let stand rulings that blocked the 
eastern nebraska human services agency from imposing mandatory 
blood testing of employees who come into direct contact with the 
mentally retarded people the agency serves 
agreed to use a chicago drug prosecution to consider expanding 
police search powers 
the justices said they will hear arguments that police acting 
without a warrant should be allowed to use evidence seized after 
they were allowed into a mans apartment by his girlfriend 
barred a lawsuit against the christian science church in the 
death of a 15monthold michigan boy who died of meningitis 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that a suit 
against the church and its members over faith healing would violate 
their religious freedom 
rejected an appeal by an american humanist association member 
who says he should have as much right as an ordained minister to 
perform marriage ceremonies 
the court without comment refused to hear arguments that a 
virginia law favoring ministers violates religious freedom and the 
constitutionally required separation of church and state 
refused to hear appeals by three drug manufacturers fighting 
lawsuits over the effects of des a drug once used by pregnant 
women to prevent miscarriages 
the court without comment left intact a new york ruling aimed 
at forcing all manufacturers of the drug to share in paying damages 
for injuries allegedly caused by des 
turned away an appeal by a former beechnut executiv e 
fighting his conviction for selling adulterated apple juice 
the court without comment left intact john f laverys 
sentence of a year and a day in prison and a 100000 fine 
turned down an appeal by james earl ray who is serving a 
99year prison sentence for the assassination of the rev martin 
luther king jr 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that rays rights 
were not violated 20 years ago when he pleaded guilty to 
firstdegree murder 
the pension benefit guaranty corporation modeled after the 
federal deposit insurance corp and the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp is wholly owned by the federal government its 
board of directors is comprised of the secretaries of labor 
treasury and commerce 
the agency protects the pension benefits of the 30 million 
americans who participate in singleemployer defined benefit 
pension plans 
when a pension plan is ended with insufficient money to satisfy 
promised benefits the federal agency becomes the pension plans 
trustee taking over its assets and liabilities the agency then 
pays all benefits workers had earned as of the date the pension 
plan ended 
in fiscal year 1988 the pension benefit guaranty corporation 
paid 3247 million in insured benefits to 113000 retirees who 
participated in 1476 terminated pension plans 
the cost of the pension insurance is paid primarily by employers 
with active pension plans and by employers who terminate 
underfunded pension plans 
the agency has money problems of its own in its most recent 
annual report the pbgc listed liabilities of 4 billion and assets 
of 24 billion 
the dallasbased ltv corp and ltv steel after filing for 
reorganization under federal bankruptcy law in 1986 advised the 
pbgc that they could not and would not fund the three pension plans 
they sponsored the plans which have about 100000 participants 
were terminated in 1987 
in a deal with the united steelworkers of america union 
however ltv steel agreed to what government lawyers contend is a 
followon arrangement under it ltv agreed to make up any 
benefits lost to employees because of the pension plans 
termination those benefits not covered by the federal pension 
insurance program 
the result employees continued to receive the same benefits 
they did before the plans were terminated and payment of unfunded 
pension liabilities was shifted to the pbgc 
ltv was responsible for 75 million in annual supplemental 
retirement benefits and the federal agency was making good on some 
400 million in annual obligations to ltv pensioners 
the pbgc contends such arrangements are abusive and the agency 
ordered ltv to reassume responsibility for the three pension plans 
when ltv refused the agency sought to enforce its order in 
federal court 
a federal judge threw out the pbgcs order for restoration of 
the pension plans and the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld 
that ruling last may 12 
federal law reveals no indication that congress intended the 
establishment of successive benefit plans to be a ground for 
restoration the appeals court ruled 
it also said the pbgcs action was arbitrary and capricious 
because it failed to consider the goals of federal bankruptcy and 
labor laws when issuing its restoration order 
the pbgc then sought supreme court review contending that the 
2nd circuit courts ruling places the pension insurance program 
in serious financial jeopardy and ignores what congress attempted 
to achieve in passing the employee retirement income security act 
of 1974 erisa 
other companies will follow ltvs example and use pension 
insurance as a subsidy to reduce costs and gain a competitive 
edge the appeal said 
justice department lawyers sided with the pbgc telling the high 
court the pbgc has reasonably concluded that restoration is an 
appropriate response to the adoption of abusive followon plans 
they said the appeals court ruling threatens to undermine a 
program already seriously in debt 
but lawyers for ltv said congress specifically rejected 
proposed prohibitions on followon plans when substantially 
amending erisa in 1987 
the case is pbgc vs ltv 89390

a jet practicing takeoffs and landings 
crashed into the tower of the aircraft carrier lexington then 
cartwheeled and burst into flames on the flight deck killing five

aviation fuel immediately ignited on the 889footlong blacktop 
deck but the fires were quickly brought undupreme court hears arguments 
on kansas city desegregation case 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the supreme court was urged today to strike 
down a federal judges order doubling local property taxes to pay 
for school desegregation in kansas city mo 
calling the judges 1987 order taxation without 
representation an attorney for the state of missouri h bartow 
farr iii argued that federal courts lack the power to order higher 
taxes even to correct a constitutional violation such as racial 
discrimination in schools 
there is no power to tax period farr told the justices in 
oral arguments 
the state asked the high court to overturn a decision by the 8th 
us circuit court of appeals that upheld the property tax increase 
ordered by us district judge russell clark 
lawyers for both sides spent perhaps a third of the 60minute 
argument session answering questions by several of the justices 
about a possible procedural flaw that could preclude any 
constitutional ruling in the case 
the school district and a group of school children who brought 
the original desegregation case in 1977 urged the court to uphold 
the tax decision the district also maintained that the state 
waited too long to file a supreme court appeal rendering it 
unnecessary for the justices to address the tax issue 
allen snyder an attorney for the district contended that state 
property tax law and local voters must not be allowed to frustrate 
the constitutional rights of kansas citys minority schoolchildren 
to an equal educational opportunity 
snyder said it was dangerously wrong to assume that federal 
courts lack powers to implement their orders to correct 
constitutional violations the courts he said have the powers 
and have the duty to use their equitable discretion to remedy 
such wrongs as racial segregation in schools 
the court is expected to issue a decision in the case by next 
july 
legal scholars and education officials say the courts decision 
could shape future school desegregation plans across the country 
and define the federal courts power to remedy constitutional 
violations involving issues from prison overcrowding to fair 
housing 
clark ordered the tax increase in september 1987 after the local 
school district was unable to pay its share of a more than 400 
million desegregation plan he had approved for capital improvements 
in buildings and establishment of special magnet schools 
state law says local property taxes may be raised only with 
voters approval and in some instances only with a twothirds 
majority district voters had not approved a levy increase since 
1969 with four tax increase proposals rejected in 1986 and 1987 to 
finance the desegregation plan 
in addition to doubling the property tax clark imposed an 
income tax surcharge on those people living or working in the 
school district 
the appeals court struck down the income surcharge in august 
1988 but upheld the district courts authority to order an 
increase in the property tax however the appeals court modified 
the procedure for imposing the higher tax levy 
the appeals court found that state law had effectively prevented 
the school district from levying the necessary taxes to pay for the 
desegregation plan it upheld clarks order as one that set aside 
levy limitations and empowered the elected local school board to 
set the needed tax levels within certain limits

armed police will replace soldiers in tiananmen 
square and troops have been withdrawn from intersections in a major 
scaling down of the capitals 5monthold martial law officials 
said monday 
the move appeared a test of beijings stability before martial 
law is lifted completely which a government spokesman recently 
said will happen before very long 
premier li peng ordered martial law in most of beijing on may 20 
as hundreds of thousands of students and citizens marched through 
the streets daily to demand democratic reform the army ended the 
protests june 34 by shooting its way through the crowd to retake 
tiananmen square the demonstrators base 
since achieving a decisive victory in the struggle to quell 
the counterrevolutionary rebellion the situation in the capital is 
moving daily toward stability and social order is basically 
normal the city government and martial law command post said in 
an announcement on the local tv news 
therefore effective upon announcement of this order 
martial law sentinels at overpasses and intersections will 
completely withdraw 
as of monday night overpasses where soldiers had stood around 
the clock under brightly colored umbrellas were unguarded except 
for surveillance cameras on lampposts the only soldiers in view in 
the city center were around the perimeter of tiananmen square and 
at nearby intersections 
few military trucks were on the streets monday night on recent 
nights convoys of hundreds of trucks of troops and supplies have 
been seen moving through the city their destination unclear 
the order said soldiers in tiananmen square will be replaced 
tuesday by ordinary police and peoples armed police a special 
security unit 
it made clear however that martial law was not being lifted 
some soldiers stationed in the city and suburbs together with 
police and peoples armed police will continue in some districts 
to carry out their martial law duties it said 
we hope that all city residents will voluntarily respect 
martial law orders and regulations and actively uphold the 
capitals normal work production education scientific research 
and social order 
martial law orders forbid marches strikes class boycotts 
public speeches distributing pamphlets spreading rumors and other 
destructive activity 
largescale resistance to martial law was crushed in the week 
after the june 34 army attack and since then only isolated cases 
of civilians attacking soldiers have been reported the government 
said many guns were stolen from army trucks during the troops 
sometimesbumbling entry into beijing and that martial law was 
necessary to protect social order 
gunshots still ring out at night without any official 
explanation 
the number of troops visible in the city has fallen sharply 
since midsummer when at least 150000 were stationed along main 
roads and in key facilities such as the television station and 
great hall of the people 
only several dozen now guard the perimeter of tiananmen square 
restricting access to what used to be a favorite recreation spot 
they are armed with automatic rifles and wear helmets 
despite the reduction in troop presence martial law has 
discouraged many tourists from returning and western diplomats 
have indicated that lifting martial law is a minimum requirement 
for their governments to lift sanctions imposed in june most 
western governments have halted highlevel contacts and military 
sales and have opposed new lowinterest loans to china by 
international institutions such as the world bank 
government spokesman yuan mu said last week martial law was 
for a limited time and it seems that it will be lifted before 
very long he refused to disclose a date

the supreme court in a case likely to affect 
other multistate agencies agreed today to decide whether a new 
yorknew jersey transportation authority may be sued in federal 
court 
the justices said they would hear arguments by the port 
authority of new york and new jersey seeking to kill lawsuits by 
two employees 
the authority was created in 1921 in a congressapproved compact 
between the two states it operates airports trains linking new 
jersey and new york city and other transportation facilities 
the authority is run by 12 commissioners six each appointed by 
the governors of the respective states the governors also have 
veto power over actions by the commissioners 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals based in new york city 
ruled in april that port authority employees charles t foster and 
patrick feeney may sue the agency in federal court the appeals 
court said the 11th amendment to the constitution shielding states 
from federal court suits does not apply to the interstate agency 
the 2nd circuit court said the authority may be sued for money 
damages largely because any judgment it would be forced to pay 
would come from its revenues rather than the taxpayersupported 
treasuries of the two states 
we believe that this insulation of state treasuries from the 
liabilities of the port authority outweighs both the methods of 
commisioner appointment and gubernatorial veto the appeals 
court said 
the appeals court invited the supreme court to review the 
ruling noting that the philadelphiabased 3rd us circuit court 
of appeals has issued a conflicting ruling on the authoritys 
immunity from suit 
the 2nd circuit court said the 3rd circuit was in error in 
concluding that the taxpayers of new york and new jersey could be 
forced to pay damages if a suit depleted the agencys resources 
feeney is seeking 3 million for injuries he suffered while 
working at a maintenance shop run by the authority in 1986 
the case is port authority vs feeney 89386

a socially active innercity episcopal 
priest who sued his diocese and its bishop lied when he accused 
them of conspiring to control his parishs money a church panel 
concluded today 
in the first ecclesiastical trial ever held in the newark 
diocese the five priests on the panel unanimously recommended that 
the rev george swanson be suspended for two years from ministerial 
or administrative involvement in the church bishop john s spong 
must still approve the recommendation and swansons attorney said 
he would appeal 
swanson who filed the lawsuit in 1988 accusing spong and the 
diocese of engaging in a conspiracy against his tiny jersey city 
parish did not show any emotion as the recommendation was read 
the lawsuit was dismissed from superior court on the grounds it was 
a church matter but swanson is appealing that decision 
about 20 ascencion church parishioners who had gathered at 
diocesean headquarters for the verdict appeared stunned but 
remained quiet 
swanson 56 a san francisco native has headed the church in a 
povertystricken jersey city neighborhood for 12 years 
teresa russell a parishioner for eight years said sunday that 
swanson had drawn her back into the episcopal church with social 
activism and efforts to make religion relevant to current problems 
swanson wore a button at todays announcement of the verdict urging 
south africa to free black activist nelson mandela 
swansons attorney edwin robertson said the priest would 
appeal to the churchs provincial court of review 
the panel decided that swanson had known that the allegations he 
made in the suit were false 
the filing of the secular court action should never be 
done lightly or unadvisedly and certainly not before exploring 
other avenues the panel said the group ruled that swanson 
failed to make a goodfaith effort to settle the dispute 
swanson who has been banned from practicing his priestly duties 
since march was the first church official to face an 
ecclesiastical trial since the episcopal diocese was founded 113 
years ago 
in his lawsuit swanson charged that spong diocese vice 
chancellor michael rehill and the diocese itself manipulated canon 
law to try to take control of the parishs assets including 
600000 paid out by an insurance company after a fire all but 
destroyed the church in 1986 
at the end of the nineday trial thursday diocese prosecutor 
richard b mcglynn called swanson a failed priest and a 
liar 
on sunday in the smokestained chapel of ascencion church a 
small cluster of faithful rallied on behalf of the priest the 
chapel is all that remains of the church it has received only 
makeshift repairs since the fire because the parishs funds became 
embroiled in a legal battle with the diocese

but he added let us not become mired in endless and fruitless 
recriminations over the seeming impasse both of our nations 
must now deal realistically with the aftermath 
he said the two powers should return to the formula of 1972 the 
year of nixons historic dooropening visit to china 
acknowledging our profound differences while realistically 
identifying and pursuing our common interests 
uschinese relations have hit a low since june with 
washington cutting off all highlevel official contacts and beijing 
accusing the united states of supporting forces trying to turn 
china into a capitalist state 
in washington asked about nixons statement that it was time to 
normalize relations white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
we have always said that we want to resume good relations with 
china at some point the question really is when and under what 
conditions i would say that at this point we have not reached that 
time and we have not seen the right conditions 
asked if nixon was carrying a letter from bush to the chinese 
leadership fitzwater said im not aware of a letter now he 
talked to the president and to gen scowcroft bushs national 
security adviser brent scowcroft before he left so maybe he 
interpreted that conversation as some kind of message 
nixon said it was in neither in chinas nor americas interest 
for china to return to its former isolation 
the choice is clear nixon said shall china turn away 
from greatness and consign itself to the backwater of oppression 
and stagnation or does it continue to venture forth on the open 
seas on a journey which may at times be rough but which leads to 
progress and peace and justice for its people 
nixon expressed confidence that a humanely governed china that 
is responsive to the yearnings of its people will continue its 
rapid ascent in world affairs 
let us therefore rise above the acrimony of the moment and 
resume the progress and cooperation that are worthy of two great 
peoples he said 
nixon traveling as a private citizen at the governments 
invitation was making his sixth visit since his 1972 trip that 
journey paved the way for restoration of chinaus ties in 1979 
at a banquet saturday night foreign minister qian qichen 
praised nixon for having shown the foresight and sagacity of an 
outstanding statesman in 1972 
at present when chineseus relations are at a difficult and 
critical moment he is paying his sixth visit to china once again 
showing his political foresight and courage qian said 
the former president who arrived saturday was expected to meet 
senior leader deng xiaoping on tuesday

less than a year ago chinese and us officials 
gathered at a glittering hotel and celebrated 10 years of 
friendship with dumplings and cocacola 
then came the chinese army attack in june on students 
demonstrating for democratic reform and both sides wondered if 
they hadnt made a terrible mistake 
americans expressed horror that a country they regarded as 
friendly was capable of such harsh repression 
chinese officials accused americans of taking advantage of 
chinas open door to sow subversive ideas among intellectuals 
and students 
the topic of relations has become so ideologically sensitive 
that chinese scholars on us affairs refuse to be interviewed 
many have been investigated for alleged involvement in the 
democracy movement 
months have gone by but emotions remain high on both sides with 
little prospect of cooling soon leading proponents of realpolitik 
including former president richard nixon and his former aide 
alexander haig have visited beijing and said it is in both sides 
interests to maintain good relations 
at a banquet monday nixon said china and the united states must 
overcome huge and unbridgeable differences and resume 
cooperation he also called for a humanely governed china 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in washington we 
have always said that we want to resume good relations with china 
at some point the question really is when and under what 
conditions i would say that at this point we have not reached that 
time and we have not seen the right conditions 
indeed each government has made it clear it expects the other 
to make the first move in returning to normalcy 
some say it was the past relationship that was abnormal with 
both sides allowing emotional attraction to outweigh differences in 
ideology and even practical selfinterest 
there was an element of delusion that things were getting 
better every day in every way said one american working in 
beijing even if the two governments mend their ties he said 
things are not going to be the way they were before 
the clearest symbols of the new relationship are the guards 
with battle helmets and automatic rifles who took up positions 
around the us embassy and ambassadors residence in june 
plainclothes officials lurk nearby in unmarked cars 
as long as chinese dissidents fang lizhi and his wife li 
shuxian remain in one of the us compounds the special guard is 
unlikely to leave 
things could get worse legislation is pending in the us 
congress that would suspend government trade and development 
programs bar sales of police equipment limit hightechnology 
transfers and allow chinese students in the united states to stay 
several years beyond their visa expiration dates 
so far the only sanctions are those announced in june by 
president bush who halted highlevel contacts and military sales 
and urged a freeze on international agencies loans to china 
bush said he is waiting for the proper signals from chinese 
leaders before lifting the measures but has not spelled these out 
signals might include an end to martial law in beijing imposed may 
20 during the peak of the student protests or other moves to ease 
the crackdown on dissent 
the united states has said it wants nonpolitical exchanges to 
go on especially cultural ones but here china has pulled back 
cancelling scholarly exchanges and plans to accept peace corps 
volunteers chinese education officials have indicated fewer 
students will be sent to the united states 
china also has avoided spelling out conditions for 
normalization but says the united states must take the initiative 
its basic demand is us silence on chinese domestic affairs 
the quarrel is not the first since china and the united states 
reestablished diplomatic relations on jan 1 1979 nor is it in 
some ways the worst us arms sales to the rival government on 
taiwan in the early 1980s triggered threats from beijing to 
downgrade relations 
china canceled sports and cultural exchanges in 1983 after the 
united states granted asylum to a defecting chinese tennis player 
hu na 
it may be proof of the relationships maturity that this time 
china has not threatened to cut or downgrade relations and that 
many normal exchanges have gone on including trade 
china also appears to be drawing a line between hardline 
statements for domestic consumption which condemn the united 
states as decadent and imperialist and accuse it of violating 
international law and foreign minister qian qichens more moderate 
statements to foreign audiences in which he stresses respecting 
differences and seeking common ground 
on neither side do conditions yet exist for compromise 
the lineup of forces in chinas domestic power struggle requires 
officials to prove their ideological purity by denouncing western 
bourgeois ideas 
in the united states the administration seems disposed to 
resume normal ties gradually but it is held back by continued 
anger from a public that watched the confrontation between troops 
and protesters on television 
chinese scholars noted last year even during the anniversary 
celebrations that the potential existed for serious rifts 
we are friends not allies said mei renyi an associate 
professor of american studies at the beijing university of foriegn 
studies he could not be interviewed now because he is being 
investigated for supporting the democracy movement 
our systems are different our ideologies are different he 
said then our expectations should be realistic

nicaraguas daniel ortega is being beseiged by 
the rest of central america to continue a 19month ceasefire with 
the contra rebels white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
today and the us position is one of waiting and watching 
ortegas threat at a weekend conference in costa rica to abolish 
the ceasefire since modified brought him ridicule from 
president bush joined later by sharp criticism from us 
congressional leaders 
the issue pretty much goes back to president ortega and the 
sandinistas in the sense that hes changed his position a little 
bit fitzwater said we obviously are urging that the 
ceasefire be maintained 
at this point its pretty much a point of waiting and watching 
to see what he ortega does the spokesman said 
he said ortegas threat to end the unilateral ceasefire has 
alienated most of nicaraguas neighbors and that ortega was being 
pressured by them to preserve the status quo 
after first declaring his intention to end the ceasefire the 
nicaraguan leader said he would decide tuesday whether to extend 
the truce or to resume hostilities between his leftist sandinista 
government and usbacked contras 
ortega had claimed he would abrogate the ceasefire because 
contra forces had violated it but fitzwater accused the 
sandinistas of violating the ceasefire far more often than the 
rebels 
violations by the sandinistas dwarf the violations by the 
contras he said 
at the same time fitzwater defended bushs depiction of ortega 
as a little man 
the president was referring to smallminded pettiness and 
not ortegas height he said 
even though administration officials privately said it was 
unlikely that the administration would seek a renewal of lethal 
military aid for the contras fitzwater refused to be drawn into a 
discussion of the prospects 
we just wont speculate on the possibility he said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and minority 
leader bob dole rkan on sunday joined bushs condemnation of 
ortega for threatening to end the ceasefire 
it was a very unwise move particularly the timing of it 
said mitchell dole calling ortega a tinhorn dictator said he 
will present a resolution to the full senate on tuesday condemning 
the nicaraguan leader 
for his part bush on saturday called ortega a little man 
and an unwanted animal at a garden party after ortega said he 
might no longer honor the ceasefire between his sandinista 
government and the usbacked contras that has been in effect 
since march 1988 
although he later said he would decide on tuesday whether to 
break the ceasefire ortegas original declaration marred a 
twoday western hemisphere conference held in costa rica to honor 
that nations 100 years as a democracy 
any effort to renew us military aid to the contras would be 
sure to generate strong new opposition in congress the agreement 
reached last spring between the administration and congress 
envisions a disbanding of the contras after the feb 25 elections 
the agreement gives congressional committees that oversee contra 
aid the authority to cancel a 49 million aid package when they 
review it a final time in late november 
bush asked at a news conference on saturday whether he would 
now press for more military aid for the contras said well let 
you know well let you know 
however a senior administration official speaking on the 
condition of anonymity said bush was not trying to hint that he 
might seek to renew military aid 
mitchell interviewed along with dole on nbcs meet the 
press called ortegas declaration which startled participants 
at the conference an outgrowth of a rivalry between the 
nicaraguan leader and costa rican president oscar arias 
it is my hope the free and open election process will go 
forward and that the results will be accepted by the people of 
nicaragua mitchell said 
he said we intend to honor the agreement with the 
administration last spring to provide humanitarian assistance 
through the feb 25 elections in nicaragua 
dole said he hoped as a result of ortegas statements wed 
have quick action on the remaining humanitarian aid 
there are 2 million people registered to vote in the 
election in which ortega is a candidate said dole i think 
ortega sees that as a danger to his dictatorship if its a fair 
election hes gone which would be good news for everyone 
the focus now remains one of support for ortegas opponent 
violeta chamorro in the february presidential election as well as 
measures aimed at ensuring that the voting is honest the united 
states is funneling 9 million through the national endowment for 
democracy a quasigovernmental agency that promotes democratic 
elections around the world 
a plan advanced in august by the presidents of five central 
american countries calls for the disbanding of the contras even 
before the elections by dec 8 
a ceasefire has never been formally agreed between the 
sandinistas and the contras though ortega has informally extended 
it on a monthly basis since march 1988 
scattered fighting has continued all along so whether ortega 
intends any real escalation of his military operations against the 
dwindling contra force such as attacking rebel camps in honduras 
remains to be seen 
an administration official said us policy is for neither side 
to violate the ceasefire in fact the official said the united 
states cut off assistance to a group of contras operating in the 
southern part of the country several months ago when us officials 
learned they were violating the ceasefire

the white house today rejected a republican 
leaders call for higher taxes on gasoline and also said president 
bush was not easing his opposition to democrats formula for 
raising the minimum wage 
we do not feel that an increase in federal gas taxes is 
necessary at this time said white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater 
senate republican leader bob dole had said sunday that although 
he still supports bushs no new taxes pledge he would back a 
gasoline tax increase to rebuild the us infrastructure such as 
roads bridges and other public facilities 
however dole said he would not back a gas tax hike for deficit 
reduction 
on the minimum wage fitzwater said we are not changing our 
position at this point although he noted that white house chief 
of staff john sununu has been conferring on the issue with house 
leaders 
house democrats are casting the minimum wage issue as a poor vs 
rich matter that along with his demand for a capital gains tax 
cut leaves the presidents allies a bit nervous 
the issue has been greatly simplified at least for a great 
many of us said sen pete v domenici rnm referring to a 
new scaledback democratic proposal its time to change the 
minimum wage 425 over the next two years from the current 335 
an hour is agreeable to me 
domenici is among several republicans and conservative democrats 
who last summer supported bushs veto of a proposed increase to 
455 an hour by 1992 but who dont want to walk the plank again 
they the white house know that things are moving away from 
them said rep timothy j penny dminn one of 28 house 
democrats who supported bushs veto everybody wants this to be 
the last time we have to vote on his bill 
house democratic leaders have scheduled a vote wednesday on a 
bill to raise the 335 wage floor which has not changed since 
1981 by 45 cents on jan 1 and by another 45 cents an hour in 
january 1991 to 425 
meanwhile the senate will be asked tuesday to adopt a 
resolution condemning nicaraguan leader daniel ortegas decision 
last week to call off a 19month ceasefire between sandinista 
forces and usbacked rebels 
senate democrats this week also will keep trying to prevent 
republicans from attaching a capital gains tax cut to legislation 
providing a threeyear aid package for poland and hungary or to a 
bill raising the ceiling on the federal debt 
obviously capital gains has nothing to do with aid to poland 
and hungary senate democratic leader george mitchell said sunday 
on nbctvs meet the press program i hope very much that 
well be able to proceed 
before turning to the minimum wage wednesday the house will 
consider bills tuesday appropriating 88 billion for the war on 
drugs and banning smoking on all airline flights 
house democrats have given the administration until tuesday to 
either sign on to their minimum wage plan or face a new series of 
claims that bush is insensitive to the poor while also seeking to 
cut the capital gains tax 
accepting a compromise would mean dropping bushs first best 
and only offer vow to veto any increase to 425 in less than 
three years he also vowed to veto any bill that does not include a 
subminimum training wage of 335 for any new hire for the 
first six months 
the new democratic version includes a 60day subminimum wage 
applicable only to firsttime workers with no previous job 
experience democrats have indicated a willingness to add another 
30 days to the training wage 
bushs aides are well aware that republican lawmakers up for 
reelection in a year are getting skittish i dont think the 
president would enjoy vetoing a second minimum wage bill house 
republican leader bob michel told reporters 
rep robert wise dwva suggested last week that democrats 
start referring to the minimum wage as a favorable minimum gains 
treatment to contrast it with bushs capital gains proposal that 
would give the wealthiest 600000 a 25000 windfall 
the house already has approved the capital gains tax cut an aid 
package for poland and hungary and legislation raising the debt 
ceiling to 31 trillion 
dole accused democrats of obstructing any effort to bring up 
capital gains 
just give us a vote thats our strategy dole said lets 
vote tuesday 
the current 287 trillion ceiling expires at midnight tuesday 
but the treasury department was borrowing an emergency 176 
billion today to keep the government in business for another week 
and cover november social security checks

the main opposition leader barely able 
to file in time monday because of a bomb threat and other delays 
accused the governing party of masterminding a plot to keep him 
out of next months elections 
analysts say the parliamentary elections nov 22 24 and 26 may 
be the closest since india gained independence from britain 42 
years ago 
vishwanath pratap singh leader of the janata dal party filed 
his nomination papers in the fatehpur district barely half an hour 
before the deadline on a day filled with delay and diversion 
he had been airborne 28 minutes when his plane part of the 
governmentrun vayudoot airlines fleet returned to new delhi 
because of a bomb threat 
singh conducted a protest at the airport united news of india 
reported after a threehour delay in which no bomb was found but 
an unspecified technical problem was reported the plane again took 
off for kanpur the nearest airport to fatehpur 
after that singh had to drive two hours to reach fatehpur in 
time an aide in new delhi said 
the 58yearold opposition leader a former ally of prime 
minister rajiv gandhi who has served him as defense and finance 
minister claimed gandhis governing congress party was responsible 
it is a defeat of the government said nc jain a janata 
dal official he reached fatehpur barely 30 minutes before the 
nominations were to close but he did it 
both gandhi and singh are running for parliament seats from 
uttar pradesh state east of new delhi gandhi filed oct 24 as a 
candidate in the amethi district 
singhs charges are among several unrelated problems besetting 
gandhi 
last week the forestry minister was accused of making improper 
advances to an environmentalist on monday the defense minister 
refused to run for reelection to parliament because he said an 
inexperienced nonpolitical coterie of gandhi aides would not 
let have the district he wanted 
as if his political difficulties were not enough gandhis 
dentist revealed that the prime minister had a serious toothache 
it came to light after gandhi and several bodyguards were seen 
arriving at the dentists clinic monday 
zr ansary the minister for environment and forests was 
accused by mukul dutta 26 an environmental activist from the 
himalayan hills of trying to molest her oct 9 in his office 
she told a new delhi news conference 2 weeks later that ansari 
lunged at her violently assaulting me in a most obscene and 
degrading manner 
ansari 64 called the charge a politically inspired 
fabrication even an insane sex maniac should be credited with 
more intelligence than to attack a woman in his own office with 
staff members nearby he said saturday 
defense minister krishna chandra pant said he wanted to run for 
parliament in nainital his home district in uttar pradesh and 
would not contest the new delhi constituency to which he was 
assigned 
the revival of state party bossism and the unwarranted 
interference of inexperienced nonpolitical coteries in political 
decisionmaking has been causing concern to all of us for some 
time pant said in a letter to gandhi 
his reference was to a group of gandhis old school friends who 
are closely involved in the campaign

a handful of chinese engineers in the united 
states to aid a 600 million arms sale to china have returned to 
work on the program but the state department said monday that 
weapons deliveries suspended by president bush in june have not 
resumed 
officials responding to a report in the los angeles times 
stressed that bush had suspended shipments not ended them after 
the beijing government cracked down on prodemocracy demonstrators 
the chinese engineers who apparently did not leave the united 
states over the summer returned during the last few weeks to the 
grumman factory in bethpage ny to provide technical support 
which will enable us work to continue during the suspension a 
state department official said 
the main parts of the deal with china are a program to improve 
avionics on f8 jets and the manufacture of torpedos radar and 
artillery ammunition 
in view of the longterm interest of the united states it has 
always been the presidents intention to suspend not terminate 
uspeoples republic of china fms foreign military sales 
programs with the hope that circumstances would permit a 
resumption of normal relations said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
still the official added there are no deliveries the 
presidents decision remains in effect 
the sanctions imposed by bush were considered inadequate by 
several members of congress who called for harsher measures as an 
expression of us human rights convictions 
the bloody june 4 crackdown on students in tiananmen square in 
beijing was seen by millions of americans on television 
contributing to public criticism here of the communist government 
as it reversed a moderating trend 
but bush and secretary of state james a baker iii emphasized 
then that maintaining strong ties with beijing was in the strategic 
interest of the united states 
two other sanctions apart from a halt to weapons deliveries 
have been reversed or watered down since june 
the presidents ban on the visit of highlevel us officials to 
china did not preclude baker from meeting with qian qichen the 
chinese foreign minister at a conference on cambodia in paris at 
the end of july 
also dependents of american diplomats who were evacuated from 
the us embassy in beijing and us consulates returned weeks 
later 
on monday former president richard nixon the most prominent 
american to visit china since the military crackdown called on the 
two nations to restore good relations and urged chinese leaders to 
shun the backwater of oppression and stagnation and respect the 
yearnings of their people 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said nixon spoke with 
bush and national security adviser brent scowcroft before he left 
for china however fitzwater said he did not know if nixon was 
carrying a letter from bush to the chinese leadership 
responding to nixons call for normalized relations between the 
two countries fitzwater said 
we have always said that we want to resume good relations with 
china at some point the question really is when and under what 
conditions i would say that at this point we have not reached that 
time and we have not seen the right conditions

helmeted soviet police wielding truncheons charged 
and clubbed demonstrators in moscow tonight following a candlelight 
vigil in memory of stalins victims scores of protesters were 
knocked to the ground beaten and dragged into police buses 
about 1000 soviets converged at dusk on kgb headquarters in 
central moscow to mark the unofficial day of the political 
prisoner and mourn the millions wrongly imprisoned or killed 
under the dictator josef stalin 
witnesses said the protest which lasted about one hour 
proceeded peacefully 
but then a splinter group of about 500 marched toward pushkin

former us national security adviser 
zbigniew brzezinski visited the site where more than 4300 polish 
officers were slain in world war ii and he called on the soviet 
union to take responsibility for the massacre 
at the same time of brzezinskis visit to the memorial to the 
officers in the katyn forest 17 miles south of the byelorussian 
city of smolensk a group of more than 400 polish relatives of the 
dead arrived for a commemorative mass 
its purely a coincidence brzezinski said when asked if he 
knew the polish group was coming he was visiting katyn while in 
the soviet union to participate in an eastwest conference 
a monument at the site pays tribute to the victims of fascism 
polish officers shot by the nazis in 1941 however most poles 
and western historians believe the officers the cream of the 
polish intelligentsia were killed by the nkvd stalins secret 
police in 1940 after they were deported to soviet union following 
the outbreak of world war ii 
the nazis discovered the graves in 1943 and blamed the soviet 
union but the soviets said the nazis had murdered the men in 1941 
during the german armys march on moscow 
we owe it to the families of the victims to say that this was 
done by stalin and the nkvd brzezinski said 
these victims represented a community of suffering shared by 
the polish and soviet people the truth of what happened should 
be a point of reconciliation for both countries he said 
a sovietpolish historical commission set up by president 
mikhail s gorbachev and polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski to 
clear up historical blank spots has yet to deliver a final 
verdict on the controversy which for poles remains their most 
painful wartime memory 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said in warsaw 
last week that the soviet union was still conducting investigations 
and searching for documents but that it was interested in finding 
the truth 
many poles hope the matter will be cleared up by the time prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki makes his first visit to moscow in 
november 
the polish side preempted a joint declaration on responsibility 
in august when the polish head of the commission jarema 
macizewski said that documents show the soviet union was 
responsible 
brzezinski known for his staunch anticommunist views 
indicated he believed the soviets would ultimately change their 
version of the massacre 
the fact that the soviet government has enabled me to be here 
and the soviets know my views is symbolic of the breach with 
stalinism that perestroika represents brzezinski said referring 
to gorbachevs political and economic reform program 
until the solidarity trade union was born in 198081 katyn was 
officially a taboo subject in poland 
but a group calling itself the families of katyn victims has 
thousands of members throughout poland more than 400 arrived in 
smolensk on the first special train organized by the polish and 
soviet tourist agencies 
it was the largest group of poles ever to visit katyn since 
soviet authorities began allowing poles to visit in groups about 
one year ago 
we never thought we would be able to come here said 
agnieszka stawowczyk whose father was killed at katyn 
three priests celebrated mass in front of a wooden cross which 
was surrounded by wreaths and solidarity banners

aspirants to top scientific jobs in the 
federal government will not have to pass an ideological test on 
abortion and other political issues health and human services 
secretary louis sullivan says 
sullivan said in a speech sunday at a meeting the association of 
american medical colleges that the socalled litmus test would 
not be used to gauge applicants for jobs in his department 
the secretary said the decision was meant to end the controversy 
over such political tests and to clear the air and not have a 
cloud hanging over these positions according to the new york 
times 
but sullivan said it was necessary and proper for president 
bush to use the litmus test to fill top positions in the 
administration including those of hhs secretary and assistant 
secretary for health in order to select people who share his views 
in the case of research administrators beneath that level

a local official said today he is 
considering rebuilding a bridge that collapsed plunging five 
people to their deaths even though he has not obtained a 
professional opinion about the tragedys cause 
the dead were among more than 30 people who witnesses said were 
rocking the bridge back and forth just before it collapsed 
spilling the group into the little red river officials have 
speculated that the swinging motion put tension on the cables 
supporting the 77yearold wooddecked structure and contributed to 
the collapse 
people were just running in the air said jennifer johnson 
who was driving to her nearby home when she saw the accident 
of the 18 people injured seven remained hospitalized today 
with conditions ranging from satisfactory to serious authorities 
said 
the dead who had gathered in a nearby town for a church 
meeting included three children 
county officials as yet have not had an expert test the debris 
to determine what happened 
county judge harvey adcock said today that he would seek a 
historic preservation grant or some other funds to aid in 
rebuilding the bridge which has been on the national register of 
historic places since 1986 in arkansas the county judge has no 
judicial power but is chief administrator of county government 
everybody feels a great sense of loss now that its gone 
adcock said 
he said a state police investigator had looked at the site with 
county officers but adcock didnt know whether the officer was an 
engineer the judge said he had the name and address of a private 
engineer that will probably look at it 
a state highway and transportation department engineer and an 
engineer from the us army corps of engineers said their agencies 
had no plans to get involved in the investigation unless they were 
asked 
no one has contacted us its out of our jurisdiction said 
david lambert heavy bridge and maintenance engineer for the 
highway department i guess thats up to the cleburne county 
authorites on how they want to handle it if we had a request to 
look at it it would be considered 
there were no signs at either end of the bridge setting capacity 
limits or warning visitors against swinging the bridge which was a 
popular pastime among young people officials did not believe any 
warnings were needed adcock said 
if we would have had any inkling that it wasnt safe we would 
have had it shut down adcock said 
those on the bridge were attending an annual meeting of the full 
holiness church movement at nearby prim 
ms johnson said she saw the upstream side buckle it just 
turned upside down and fell into the river she said 
one girl said it felt like a dream until she hit the water 
said cindy watkins who had traveled from oklahoma with her sister 
vicki for the church outing everybody was up there laughing and 
then all of a sudden it screeches and pops it was real scary 
another member of the church group daniel rafferty of seymour 
mo said he saw the bridge being rocked as he arrived 
we thought it was kind of fun and it scared some people 
rafferty said 
it just happened so quickly that no one had a chance to cry 
for help he said they didnt know what happened it was pure 
terror arms were flailing people were panicking everyone was 
trying to save themselves 
as crews worked with cranes and bulldozers to remove the debris 
residents brought flowers to lay at the foot of the bridge to 
remember the victims 
among the dead was gayla carlton the 34yearold daughter of 
the host pastor the rev vernon carlton of prim 
her uncle tony carlton had two teenage daughters on the 
bridge both survived 
at bedtime last night i told my daughters lets thank the 
lord that yall made it one more time we knelt at the bedside and 
prayed carlton said i have feelings for the others theres 
no way i can explain it 
the others killed were jason williams 16 of muldrow okla 
dana waltman 11 of vancleave miss david shane warren 13 of 
mayfield ky and catrina cotrell in her early 20s of stratford

the supreme court on monday rejected the 
appeal of a member of a secular group who argued that he should 
have the same right to perform marriages as does a priest or rabbi 
roy torcaso of wheaton md won an important victory in 1971 
when the high court held that maryland violated his rights by 
barring him from becoming a statecommissioned notary public 
because he refused to declare a belief in god 
in the current case the justices without comment refused to 
disturb a virginia law favoring ordained ministers in officiating 
at weddings the court rejected torcasos arguments that the law 
violates religious freedom and separation of church and state 
he contended that his constitutional rights are being denied 
because he is a counselor with the american humanist association 
an educational and philosophical organization 
torcaso said he is similar to a priest minister or rabbi and 
should have comparable rights he has been allowed to officiate at 
weddings in other states he said 
however he was rejected in 1988 when he applied to prince 
william county va to perform weddings there 
a virginia judge refused to overturn the county clerks 
rejection 
lawyers with the virginia attorney generals office said the 
state law requires a 500 bond by anyone who is not an ordained 
minister and wants to officiate at a wedding 
ministers are exempt from posting the bond because ordination 
creates a presumption that the officiant is trustworthy and 
responsible lawyers for the state said 
torcaso said he would have been barred under virginia law from 
performing the wedding even if he posted the bond the bond 
requirement he said applies only to judges or others who reside 
in the county where they seek to perform the marriage 
torcaso said other states have similar laws but that they more 
liberally create exemptions that allow nonministers to officiate 
at weddings 
the constitution prohibits states from establishing religious 
qualifications for persons who perform state functions his 
appeal said 
states cannot impose religious affiliation and belief 
requirements upon persons who solemnize marriages 
the case is torcaso vs virginia 89375

intends to bring criminal charges against the inmates responsible 
for the riot

the white house on monday defended anew 
president bushs abortionrelated veto of the district of 
columbias appropriations bill which critics say has tied up funds 
to battle drugs in the nations capital 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush would 
sign the funding measure in a nanosecond if congress would 
strip language liberalizing funding for abortions in the district 
bush on friday vetoed the district budget bill including the 
annual 435 million federal contribution to the citys 34 billion 
budget 
the bill would provide the city with an extra 32 million to 
hire more police build prison space launch a drug treatment 
initiative for pregnant women and other antidrug activities 
the 1989 murder rate in the city reached 369 over the weekend 
tying the 1988 record authorities say many of the slayings are 
drug related 
the measure would also lift a yearold restriction that bars the 
district from spending locally raised tax dollars to provide 
unrestricted abortions for poor women 
bush said saturday in san jose costa rica that abortionrights 
supporters were playing political games with the bill and he 
vowed to stand like a brick wall against efforts to lift 
restrictions on abortion funding 
the fact is the president vetoed it because of his beliefs on 
abortion thats the way it stands fitzwater said all theyve 
got to do is strip that out change the language back to the way it 
was and well sign that bill in a nanosecond 
fitzwater rejected the argument that the district should be free 
to do as it pleases with its own tax dollars under the law 
governing home rule for the district congress must approve the 
entire dc budget not just the federal contribution 
its all out of the federal money its federally 
appropriated everybody tries to use that argument its local 
money its not fitzwater said 
the national abortion rights action league says 30 states and 
the district pay for abortions through medicaid only to save the 
mothers life eight states pay for abortions in cases of rape or 
incest or certain other circumstances and 12 states pay for 
abortions deemed medically necessary 
the rev jesse jackson the former twotime democratic 
presidential contender who has moved to the district from chicago 
said sunday that the veto demonstrates the colonial status of the 
district of columbia and accused bush of tyranny

a former beechnut executive fighting his 
conviction for selling adulterated apple juice lost a supreme court 
appeal today 
the court without comment left intact john f laverys 
sentence of a year and a day in prison and a 100000 fine 
lavery former vice president in charge of operations for 
beechnut was convicted last year in new york city of conspiracy 
and mail fraud for selling as pure apple juice what essentially was 
corn syrup 
government prosecutors said lavery first was warned by a 
beechnut research director in 1977 that juice from its supplier 
universal juice co was adulterated the prosecutors said many 
similar warnings followed 
lavery did not fire universal juice co as supplier until 1982 
after a detective from the processed apple institute told him 
beechnut was going to be hit with a lawsuit the prosecutors said 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last march rejected 
laverys arguments that he improperly was convicted of conspiracy 
and fraud 
but the appeals court said the evidence was ample to permit 
the jury to infer that lavery conspired with the suppliers to 
perpetrate a fraud on the public through the distribution of the 
adulterated juice 
beechnut president niels l hoyvald also was convicted he 
received the same sentence as lavery but was not involved in the 
appeal acted on today 
beechnut was fined 2 million after pleading guilty to selling 
adulterated and misbranded apple juice 
the case is lavery vs us 89216

the pilot of a training jet that crashed 
into the uss lexington killing him and four others was making his 
first attempt to land on an aircraft carrier the ships captain 
said today 
the twoseat t2 buckeye based at the meridian miss naval 
air station slammed into the carriers tower and cartweeled in 
flames into the flight deck sunday afternoon during a practice 
flight about 30 miles south of here in the gulf of mexico 
as i see it said capt c flack logan he ended up in a 
position which in naval aviation is known as being low and slow 
which is a very terrible place to be when you are coming aboard a 
ship 
as the world war iivintage carrier the oldest in the navy 
returned to its dock late this morning several sailors wives 
burst into tears and waved wildly as they spotted their husbands on 
the deck the first confirmation that their loved ones were safe 
we werent sure what kind of news they were giving us 
kayleen edwards said after finding her husband they said they 
had hit where he works and they couldnt identify some of the 
bodies 
names of the dead were not released pending notification of next 
of kin one was a civilian worker logan said in addition to the 
five dead 17 were injured one critically 
logan said landing officers told the pilot who was alone in the 
plane to add power and waved him off but for some reason he was 
unable to comply the man was a qualified pilot logan said but 
was only beginning to learn the difficult skill of landing on a 
carrier 
the nose pitched up and he lost control of his ability to fly 
the aircraft and it went up and came into the island logan said 
the plane was upside down when its wing tip hit the island or 
tower of the 46yearold ship the captain said the jet then 
smashed into the side of the island before crashing in flames on 
the flight deck 
the wing tip broke off and remained imbedded in the 
superstructure today but overall damage to the ship was described 
as minor three planes parked on the flight deck were hit by 
debris logan said the damage to the planes was not severe 
when the plane crashed aviation fuel ignited on the 
889footlong blacktop deck but the fires were quickly brought 
under control said navy cmdr dennis hessler 
the ship which came under a deadly japanese kamikaze attack 45 
years ago this week has 1440 crew members and is the navys only 
aircraft carrier used exclusively for training it is also the only 
carrier on which women serve 
two of the 17 injured people were taken by helicopter to 
hospitals in alabama and pensacola crew member mark anthony lopez 
21 of west valley utah was listed in critical but stable 
condition at university of south alabama medical center in mobile 
said suzette george nursing supervisor he had burns over nearly 
half his body 
crew member sandra bailey of haleyville ala was admitted to 
the us naval hospital in pensacola logan said her injuries were 
not lifethreatening 
in pensacola relatives of crew members worried about finding 
out who the casualties were 
were all just shaken we dont know what to think one way or 
the other i just want to know something said cathy webb whose 
boyfriend serves on the carrier 
the crash occurred six days before the anniversary of the nov 
4 1944 attack that killed 47 and injured 127 on the ship in world 
war ii 
the original crew plans to hold a reunion next weekend in 
pensacola 
the lexington was commissioned feb 17 1943 and its planes 
sank or destroyed more than a million tons of japanese shipping and 
1039 enemy aircraft during world war ii 
the carrier was dubbed the blue ghost by japanese 
propagandist tokyo rose because she had reported it sunk several 
times only to return to battle painted a solid bluegray color 
unusual in wartime when ships are usually camouflaged 
after the war the lexington was mothballed until being 
reactivated in 1955 it reported to pensacola on dec 29 1962 to 
serve as the navys training carrier it is scheduled to continue 
that role after moving next september to corpus christi texas 
the ship has been a favorite of movie producers with roles in 
the film midway and the television miniseries war and

too subdued for some fans 
i prefer a parade but well take anything we can get said 
theresa held whose childhood home in santa cruz was destroyed by 
the quake people need to get back on with everything they 
shouldnt dwell on the quake i thought thats why they let the

and two blossoms was painted on and contained the barest stitches 
of clothing 
tickets were 25 and organizers are donating 25 percent of the 
proceeds to the disaster relief fund as in the past 15 percent is 
going to aids foundations 
perry mann a producer of the ball estimated the number of 
people attending the saturday night gala at 10000plus but said

helmeted riot police wielding truncheons 
repeatedly charged and clubbed demonstrators monday night after a 
candlelight vigil outside kgb headquarters in memory of stalins 
victims scores of protesters were knocked to the ground beaten 
and dragged into police buses 
about 40 people were detained the official tass news agency 
said in what was the harshest crackdown on protesters in moscow in 
more than 1 years tass said the protesters were trying to 
create as much disruption as possible to display antisoviet 
posters and shout antisoviet slogans 
the clashes took place on some of central moscows busiest 
streets and were especially jarring because of the more permissive 
political climate instituted under president mikhail s gorbachevs 
wideranging reforms 
about 1000 soviets converged on kgb headquarters at dzerzhinsky 
square after dusk to mark the unofficial day of the political 
prisoner and mourn the millions who were wrongly imprisoned or 
killed under josef stalin 
the hourlong protest in which two rows of people holding 
flickering candles lined up on three sides of the building 
proceeded peacefully it had been organized by the memorial 
society which seeks to commemorate those who suffered unjustly 
under stalin and the democratic union a selfstyled opposition to 
the communist party 
at the end of the demonstration a splinter group of about 500 
people mostly young men marched off in the direction of pushkin 
square a favorite rallying site for human rights activists 
chanting shame on the kgb and the kgb is the enemy of 
the people the group was confronted without warning by riot 
police two blocks from pushkin square as they passed out leaflets 
to homebound commuters 
the whitehelmeted police armed with long black rubber 
truncheons formed a line then waded into the protesters clubbing 
at least four of their leaders to the ground then dragging them 
into nearby buses for detention 
the demonstrators retreated then formed again and headed to 
gorky street the main thoroughfare leading to pushkin square the 
riot police and other uniformed officers sealed off the square and 
split the protesters into two groups 
on gorky street riot police again charged the demonstrators 
taking about six into custody as the protesters were dragged to 
the buses spectators shouted shame shame several passersby 
spat at a police car 
another group of demonstrators gathered on the southeast side 
of pushkin square was also repeatedly charged by riot police who 
ignored the dozens of television camera teams and foreign reporters 
who flocked there 
police formed a flying wedge to charge young people gathered 
under a gorky street archway and dozens were seized bodily and 
dragged away to the waiting buses 
it was the roughest treatment of an unsanctioned demonstration 
in moscow since december 1987 when about 200 burly men in civilian 
clothes roughed up jews who staged a protest demanding the right to 
emigrate on the eve of gorbachevs departure for his washington 
summit with ronald reagan 
the 6 pm protest outside kgb headquarters began quietly as 
dozens of regular uniformed police watched the demonstration and 
directed traffic around dzerzhinsky square at the center of the 
square is a statue of felix dzerzhinsky founder of the soviet 
secret police 
the demonstrators held candles and signs saying shame on the 
kgb executioners and down with the kgb 
they originally had planned to circle the building which houses 
the infamous lubyanka prison where soviets declared enemies of 
the people under stalin were executed by being shot with a pistol 
in the back of the head but police sealed off one side of the 
building to allow pedestrian and vehicular traffic to pass

firefighters aided by decreasing winds 
worked today to surround a wildfire that charred more than 4000 
acres and forced 2200 campers to flee a spokeswoman said 
a milliondollar estate and another home under construction 
burned sunday but there was no immediate estimate of total damage 
officials said among those who left their homes when the fire 
threatened areas in and around this celebrity enclave was 
entertainer dick clark according to a neighbor 
the fire which broke out about 5 am sunday in the santa 
monica mountains north of here was caused by a power line that was 
blown down by the wind said vicki crabtree a ventura county 
dispatcher and the same fierce santa ana wind helped fan the 
flames sunday before dying down today 
firefighters surrounded 80 percent of the blaze by early today 
ms crabtree said at one point during the morning officials 
declared the fire surrounded but ms crabtree said that 
firefighters decided later to again describe it as only 80 percent 
contained because some hot spots were causing problems 
we still have wind conditions but not as drastic as sunday 
she said this morning gusts had gone as high as 40 mph or more 
sunday ms crabtree did not have an exact wind speed figure this 
morning 
the fastmoving fire sent out thick dark smoke that forced 
closure for a time of 10 miles of the busy pacific coast highway 
jo ann malac a neighbor of clarks said she took her dog and 
fled in her car i freaked out we were both screaming and 
barking she said she got behind another car going down a road 
toward the ocean and in her panic i thought god hes not going 
fast enough she said she said she later learned the other 
driver was clark 
the fire left a barren trail similar to a moonscape up to 570 
firefighters from los angeles and ventura counties battled the 
blaze while four air tankers and six helicopters bombed a twomile 
front of flames with retardant and water 
we dont have access to the water up in those canyons we are 
fighting it mainly from the air said another fire spokeswoman 
sandy wells 
a pillar of smoke blew over the ocean north of malibu and could 
be seen for 30 miles to the south residents in the area hosed down 
the roofs of their homes while charred trees and smoldering brush 
lined the coastal highway 
in other areas flames burned down to the oceans edge where 
they were extinguished by waves 
about 2200 people were evacuated from five area campgrounds 
including 100 children from the hess kramer jewish temple camp 
the 12 and 13yearolds were on a threeday weekend retreat 
said camp coordinator paul kipness 
there wasnt time to be scared you could see the smoke 
kipness said the kids responded very well 
farther inland firefighters contained a 376acre blaze in the 
black canyonbox canyon area near simi valley sunday afternoon 
said fire spokeswoman virginia dillard no structures were burned 
and there were no injuries 
the simi valley fire moved east along black canyon away from 
the city of simi valley before it was contained ms dillard said 
the closest densely populated area the unincorporated susana 
knolls was not threatened 
the santa ana winds that pushed the fires sunday rose from a 
surfacelevel high pressure system in the pacific northwest that 
sent air racing toward lower air pressure in the southwest 
such winds pick up speed and heat as they run over the 
southwestern deserts canyons and mountain passes and can reach 
speeds of up to 100 mph in isolated mountain passes said national 
weather service meteorologist bill hoffer

soviet and us officials opened talks 
monday seeking to resolve differences in proposals to reduce their 
chemical weapons arsenals 
moscow wants a ban on the production of poison gas but the bush 
administration wants to continue producing chemical weapons even 
after an international treaty calling for their destruction is 
signed 
the soviets say they have stopped producing chemical weapons and 
will begin unilaterally destroying their stockpile 
the 40nation un disarmament conference in geneva which 
includes the united states and soviet union has a longstanding 
consensus that production of poison gas should end when a treaty to 
ban the weapons takes effect 
experts on chemical weapons fear that if the united states 
continues to make chemical weapons third world nations will be 
encouraged to build chemical factories capable of producing poison 
gas 
the superpowers hope that if they can agree to scrap most of 
their chemical weapon stockpiles they will spur global acceptance 
of a treaty banning poison gas 
five days of talks opened monday in new york said us 
spokeswoman caroline dulin max friedersdorf leads the us 
delegation and sergei batsanov is the chief soviet negotiator 
diplomatic sources said the talks were being held at the us 
and soviet missions to the united nations 
the negotiators will discuss the exchange of information on 
their chemical weapons capabilities and inspections of military and 
civilian factories and storage sites 
dulin said the talks also would take up the differences in the 
soviet and us approaches to scrapping chemical weapons 
these are the first negotiations since september when president 
bush and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze unveiled 
competing proposals to scrap the weapons 
on sept 25 bush offered to cut us chemical weapons 
stockpiles by 80 percent if the soviets reduce their arsenal to the 
same level moscow says it has 50000 tons of poison gas 
us stockpiles are estimated at about 30000 tons of nerve gas 
and the agreement would leave the united states and soviet union 
each with about 6000 tons 
shevardnadze on sept 26 said the superpowers should go further 
he challenged washington to agree to stop making all types of 
poison gas including binary weapons which are harmless until two 
chemicals are combined just prior to use of the gas shell 
congress has approved funds to continue production of binary 
poison gas bombs and shells and administration officials say they 
intend to continue production of the safer shells even after 
signing a treaty phasing out the weapons 
the pentagon wants to replace its singleelement gas shells with 
binary weapons the singleelement shells are extremely dangerous 
if they leak which sometimes occurs because of aging or damage 
bush proposed an agreement to begin cuts at once while an 
international treaty is worked out in which the united states would 
destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons over eight years if the 
soviets joined the ban 
the remaining 2 percent would be destroyed within 10 years if 
all nations capable of building such weapons agreed to a total ban 
a conference of more than 145 nations in paris in january called 
for a comprehensive verifiable treaty to ban chemical weapons 
the geneva protocol of 1925 adopted after 13 million people 
were killed or injured by poison gas in world war i banned the use 
of such weapons in war but allows their manufacture and possession 
iraqs repeated use of poison gas in its eightyear war with 
iran brought brought international attention to the issue 
the united states resumed production of chemical weapons in 1987 
after their manufacture had been banned in 1969 the reagan 
administration said new weapons were needed to match growing soviet 
stockpiles

the supreme court in a case closely watched 
by civil rights groups was asked monday to decide whether federal 
courts can order higher taxes to finance school desegregation 
the state of missouri urged the justices to invalidate a federal 
judges 1987 order that doubled local property taxes in kansas 
city saying it was taxation without representation 
h bartow farr iii an attorney for the state argued that 
courts lack the power to impose or authorize higher taxes even to 
correct a constitutional violation such as racial discrimination in 
schools 
there is no power to tax period farr told the justices 
although constitutional issues dominated the 60minute session 
lawyers for both sides answered questions by several justices about 
a possible procedural flaw that could preclude a ruling on the tax 
issue in the case 
the school district and parents of a group of school children 
who brought the original desegregation case in 1977 contend the 
state waited too long to file a supreme court appeal 
the school district asked the court to affirm a decision by the 
8th us circuit court of appeals upholding the property tax 
increase ordered by us district judge russell clark 
the supreme court is expected to issue a decision in the case by 
next july 
allen snyder the school districts attorney said it would be 
dangerously wrong to deny federal courts the broad powers 
needed to implement their orders to correct constitutional 
violations 
striking down the tax order he contended would permit state 
property tax law and local voters to frustrate the constitutional 
rights of kansas citys minority schoolchildren to an equal 
educational opportunity 
federal courts snyder argued have the powers and have the 
duty to use their equitable discretion to remedy constitutional 
wrongs 
several justices questioned whether there were any limits on the 
powers of the federal courts to correct racial segregation in 
schools at one point justice antonin scalia asked if a court 
could order higher taxes to gold plate all the schools 
snyder discounted the justices example but said a courts 
remedy to constitutional violations was limited to what was 
feasible and practicable 
justice anthony kennedy described the judges tax order as a 
drastic remedy and questioned whether the district court should 
have made an explicit finding that higher taxes were the only 
reasonable solution 
the state in response to questions by justice sandra oconnor 
maintained that the judge had failed to consider other options 
such as scaling back the desegregation plan one alternative 
opposed by the state farr conceded was to require the state of 
missouri to pay all of the costs 
clark ordered the tax increase in september 1987 after the local 
school district was unable to pay its share of a 400 million 
desegregation plan he had approved for capital improvements in 
buildings and establishment of special magnet schools 
state law says local property taxes can be raised only with 
voters approval and in some instances only with a twothirds 
majority district voters had not approved a levy increase since 
1969 with four tax increase proposals rejected in 1986 and 1987 to 
finance the desegregation plan 
the appeals court in august 1988 upheld the district courts 
authority to order an increase in the property tax but changed the 
procedure for imposing the higher tax levy in the future

human rights activist natan sharansky who 
spent nine years in soviet prisons is considering visiting moscow

confederation of the soviet union a newly formed umbrella group 
for soviet jewish organizations to visit moscow in december said 
the spokeswoman who insisted on anonymity 
she was speaking from the jerusalembased soviet jewry zionist 
forum headed by sharansky 
sharansky told the maariv newspaper that he was interested in 
visiting moscow to encourage jewish emigration to israel but was 
concerned that publicity from his trip might benefit president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
i have no special nostalgia for the soviet union sharansky 
said my consideration to return and visit there will be if such 
a visit would help our struggle to encourage the jewish awakening 
i know that gorbachev can benefit from a visit like that and i 
have to consider who would gain more soviet jews or gorbachev 
he said 
in the early 1970s sharansky was a member of the helsinki 
committee a human rights watchdog group headed by nobel prize 
laureate andrei sakharov 
sharansky made contacts with foreign journalists in moscow and 
gained prominence as a spokesman for organization he also 
championed the soviet jewry emigration movement 
he was denied an exit visa to join his wife who left for israel 
a day after their wedding in 1974 in march 1977 he was arrested 
and in 1978 convicted of espionage and sentenced to 13 years in 
prison 
he spent nine years in soviet prisons and labor camps becoming 
a symbol of the soviet jewrys plight thanks to the efforts of his 
wife avital who tirelessly campaigned on his behalf in the west 
sharansky was freed on feb 11 1986 when he came west on 
berlins glienicke bridge included in the swap were wolf georg 
frohn of east germany jaroslave jaworski of czechoslovakia and 
dietrich nistroy of west germany who were released by the east 
and jerzy kaczmarek of poland yevgeni semliakov of soviet union 
detlef scharfenorth of east germany and karl f koecher of 
czechoslovakia and his wife hana who were released by the west 
at first sharansky kept a low profile in israel but he emerged 
last year to found the soviet jewry zionist forum a lobby group 
seeking to improve conditions for immigrants from the soviet union 
he also heads the council of new immigrants organizations 
which represents 18 groups uniting immigrants from 40 countries 
sharansky told maariv he believed the soviets would issue him a 
visa 
the russians are making efforts to cut themselves off from the 
past yuri orlov also an activist of the helsinki committee 
has recently visited the soviet union despite once being convicted 
as an enemy of the state and faced no problems sharansky said 
this is not what may prevent my visit

each year at halloween the center which claims to be a 
nonprofit organization involved in research publishes a list of 
predictions based on a poll of 300 witches 
associate research director lewis scott insists these are not 
cackling types on brooms but instead include a new york real 
estate tycoon several members of congress and the wife of a 
television evangelist 
in addition to predicting that chicago will replace paris as a 
center for haute couture koch will become a diplomat and raw fish 
will be an even faster food than hamburgers this years survey 
finds that 
vice president dan quayle will write a book of rhymes for 
preschoolers 
geraldo rivera will claim he was captured by visitors from 
outer space 
there will be nationwide shortages of herring banjos 
billiard balls and marilyn quayle posters 
a new book will claim that zsa zsa gabor was born and raised 
in houston 
the japanese will market a line of large laptop computers for 
obese traveling executives 
the strange people claim a track record in previous years they 
predicted richard nixons resignation new freedoms for eastern 
europe and low ratings for pat sajaks talk show they say 
but a look at predictions from 1987 does not inspire confidence

who pounds the pavement the fastest 
new yorkers bostonians guess again 
a magazine survey claims that people in springfield walk faster 
than their counterparts in 36 other us cities 
the results of the survey in the october issue of psychology 
today were a surprise for just about everybody including the 
surprisingly fleetfooted residents of this western massachusetts 
city and the people who conducted the study 
its not the first city you would think of said robert 
levine a psychology professor at california state university at 
fresno who conducted the survey but i had a pretty good idea 
some city in the northeast would be no 1 and springfield just 
edged out boston 
in his 1987 survey levine found that springfielders covered 60 
feet of sidewalk in an average of 111 seconds they covered the 
distance 36 seconds faster than their counterparts in fresno 
calif which finished at the bottom of the list he said 
i dont know how fast they walk in other cities but some days 
it can be like a blur on this corner said sally padilla who 
operates a hot dog stand across from court square in springfield 
not everyone on the sidewalks here was willing to buy levines 
results among the doubters was stephanie stevens a parking 
enforcement officer for 19 years 
i dont see anyone running or walking fast unless they see

by returning the socialists to power with 
only a oneseat majority in parliament voters warned prime 
minister felipe gonzalez to change the way his government runs the 
country analysts said monday 
the victory was the third straight for gonzalez a 47yearold 
labor lawyer who became prime minister in 1982 and has presided 
over the fastest growing economy in europe 
el pais the nations leading daily newspaper said in an 
editorial the voters have clearly decided they want to continue 
to be governed by the socialists but they demand no less clearly 
a change in style 
it said the results of sundays election showed the public 
agreed with those who accuse the government of not meeting the 
demands of labor allowing public services to deteriorate and 
showing arrogance in its exercise of power 
defections to the left reduced the socialists to 176 members in 
the 350seat cortes the lower house of parliament where the power 
lies eight fewer than in 1986 their share of the popular vote 
fell from 434 percent to 3955 
the chief beneficiary of the 800000vote decline in socialist 
support was the united left coalition of the communists and other 
parties which doubled its 1986 tally and gained 10 seats for a 
total of 17 
conservatives of the popular party gained one seat to 106 the 
democratic social center of former prime minister adolfo suarez won 
14 seats down five from 1986 
socialist losses were most striking in cities where the 
deterioration and overloading of public services has become most 
evident 
for the first time since spain returned to democratic government 
after the death of dictator francisco franco in 1975 the 
socialists lost to the conservatives in madrid and the surrounding 
area 
julio anguita communist leader of the united left campaigned 
against economic policies that emphasize economic growth over 
government spending as the way to reduce an unemployment rate of 17 
percent highest in europe 
anguita former mayor of cordoba said a general strike that 
virtually shut down the country dec 14 demonstrated disappointment 
with gonzalez probusiness strategy 
surveys indicate however that most spaniards believe they live 
better today than in 1982 when gonzalez took office and faced a 
stagnant economy with annual inflation of 14 percent inflation is 
7 percent up two points from last year 
abc a conservative daily called the vote a tough electoral 
lesson for the socialists and the new leftofcenter el mundo 
said the socialists will have to govern in a different way 
el periodico de cataluna a barcelona paper said the socialists 
must do a better job of sharing the pie of wellbeing with those 
who are less fortunate 
on spanish national radio education minister javier solana said 
the government got the message 
we would be a politically insensitive party if we didnt learn 
the lessons taught by the election results he said will we go 
in the direction of more social spending within the possibilities 
obviously yes 
solana said spending on social programs in the past two years 
had grown 60 percent faster than the economy which has averaged 
nearly 45 percent annual growth 
since the economy can now continue to grow we expect social 
spending to follow suit he said

thenpresident reagan personally approved a plea 
bargain offered to ferdinand and imelda marcos three days before 
they were indicted in october 1988 mrs marcos attorney says in 
court papers 
the papers add detail to reported failed negotiations just 
before the deposed philippine leader and his wife were charged with 
siphoning more than 100 million out of their countrys treasury 
and into the united states 
marcos died sept 28 his wife awaits trial at us district 
court in manhattan 
mrs marcos lawyer richard a hibey said in the papers filed 
last month that government lawyers made the plea offer during a 
meeting at the justice department in washington attended briefly by 
us attorney general richard thornburgh 
the attorney general started the meeting by advising us that 
the president was aware that the meeting was taking place and what 
would be conveyed to us during the conference had the presidents 
full knowledge and approval hibey said 
while the personal attention of the president in a criminal case 
is unusual white house involvement can be expected in sensitive 
matters that carry implications for us foreign policy government 
spokesmen said 
its not usual for the white house to be involved in the 
conduct of cases its not usual for the attorney general to be 
involved in the handling of criminal cases dave runkel justice 
department spokesman said monday but there are those times when 
issues do rise to the level of the attorney general or the white 
house 
runkel and reagans spokesman mark weinberg declined to 
comment on the marcos case because it is pending in the courts 
marcos who died sept 28 and his wife were charged in a 
racketeering indictment oct 21 1988 three days after the meeting 
described by hibey 
the trial of mrs marcos and her other codefendants including 
saudi financier adnan khashoggi is scheduled to begin march 14 
hibeys account of the meeting said thornburgh left after 
telling hibey and another marcos attorney john bartko that the 
other government officials at the meeting were the sole 
representatives of the government in the matter and urging them 
to consider the offer seriously

the percentage of blacks among the nations 
military recruits has dropped since 1980 but minorities continue to 
be overrepresented in americas armed forces said a congressional 
report released monday 
other changes found by the congressional budget office which 
conducted the study of the nations allvolunteer armed services 
included an improvement in standard military test scores and 
educational background of the current recruits 
these results like those for race represent a considerable 
change from the beginning of the decade when testing problems and 
recruiting difficulties resulted in large numbers of low scorers 
and nongraduates being accepted for military service said the 
study 
the army achieved particularly impressive gains said the 
report social representation in the us military 
in 1980 less than 70 percent of activeduty recruits for the 
four services air force army navy and marine corps had high 
school diplomas only 55 percent of army recruits could lay claim 
to a secondary school degree 
but seven years later 94 percent of activeduty recruits for 
the four services had high school diplomas as did about 91 percent 
of army recruits 
about twothirds of the recruits scored above average in 
comparison to the general youth population on the standard military 
entrance exams the study said 
on the issue of minorities among the recruits the study found 
that between 1980 and 1987 the percentage of blacks among recruits 
with no prior military service fell by nearly 3 points 223 
percent to 197 percent in comparison there was an increase of 
almost 1 percentage point in enlistmentage youths who are black 
contributing to the decline was the army where the share of 
black recruits fell by more than 6 percentage points 
the study also found that black recruits come disproportionately 
from sections of the country with aboveaverage black incomes and 
bettereducated black adults in 1987 only 44 percent of the black 
male activeduty recruits came from areas in the bottom half of the 
income distribution for black families 
women accounted for less than 13 percent of activeduty recruits 
in 1987 a slight drop from the 142 percent in 1980 the cbo 
attributed the somewhat steady total to the limited number of 
military jobs for women 
the cbo said the purpose of the study was to provide an 
objective analysis and not reach any conclusions about current 
patterns of representation and ways to change them 
however the study did say that instituting a draft would not 
change the social composition of the military unless enlisted 
strengths were significantly increased 
the allvolunteer force is doing a good job of attracting a 
broad crosssection of american youth said sen john glenn 
dohio the chairman of the senate armed services subcommittee on 
manpower and personnel and the lawmaker who requested the study 
the study glenn said fills a major gap in our knowledge 
about who is attracted to the volunteer military

parliament on monday approved 
legislation granting amnesty to many people convicted of crimes 
punishable by less than three years in prison and it created an 
office to control government and party finances 
the laws to take effect in november were among several items 
on the agenda on the opening day of the legislatures first session 
since it rewrote the communist constitution to reflect democratic 
ideals 
hungarys rapidly evolving reform course has put it in the 
vanguard of democratic change within the soviet bloc along with 
poland the first warsaw pact nation with a government not 
dominated by the communists 
at its last sitting which ended oct 20 hungarys parliament 
adopted a series of laws and constitutional amendements 
establishing the legal framework for the first multiparty elections 
since the now defunct communist party consolidated power in 1948 
the communist party formally known as the hungarian socialist 
workers party dissolved itself oct 7 at a historic congress 
that gave birth to its successor the socialist party the new 
party which professes democratic ideals retains political 
control but its leaders have promised to hand over power if 
defeated at the polls next year 
in another major move to break with the communist past acting 
president matyas szueroes proclaimed the existence of the republic 
of hungary oct 23 the 33rd anniversary of the 1956 antistalinist 
revolt 
the proclamation which formally terminated the 
communistcreated peoples republic of hungary was cheered by more 
than 100000 hungarians 
the amnesty law applies to those serving terms of three years or 
less who are in the following categories pregnant women women 
with children under 14 living with them women over 55 and men over 
60 and those suffering from terminal illness the terms are halved 
for those in these categories serving sentences exceding three 
years 
the amnesty does not apply to those facing or serving sentences 
for violent or sexual crimes 
creation of an auditors office was meant to reestablish 
impartial control over government and party spending which was 
effectively abolished after the communists took over the office 
which also has jurisdiction over the finances of state enterprises 
is responsible to parliament 
the number of legislators present to vote on the two bills 
differed accounting for the different totals 
tuesdays agenda included a decision on when and how to chose a 
president whose responsibilities include command of the armed 
forces and other major tasks 
the newly created post was originally to be filled nov 26 by 
popular vote but two opposition groups have collected more than 
100000 opposing signatures enough to force a plebiscite on the 
issue 
the groups the league of free democrats and the league of 
young democrats say the early date favors socialist party 
candidate imre pozsgay because it doesnt give the opposition 
enough time to organize and make their candidates well known 
in addition legislators planned tuesday to discuss and vote on 
government proposals on a suspended danube river hydroelectric 
project with czechoslovakia a warsaw pact ally increasingly at 
odds with hungary over its reforms 
in declaring a moratorium in may on the gabcikovonagymaros dam 
project hungary expressed concern about potential enviromental 
damage czechoslovakia has said it will continue construction and 
will demand compensation if work is permanently suspended by the 
hungarians

act which was passed by congress 
voters in mindanao and other southern islands go to the polls 
nov 19 to decide whether their provinces will join an autonomous 
regional government 
the move is aimed at satisfying demands for selfrule for the 4 
millionmember moslem minority christians form the majority in the 
provinces of mindanao and other southern islands

public opposition even from moslem secessionist groups 
i understand that some groups are organizing a boycott of the 
plebiscite mrs aquino told hundreds of people at a rally i 
think this would be a serious mistake a boycott position is 
meaningless

a state board is caught in a political 
ruckus over its decision to clear an optometrist who had some women 
patients strip to the waist during eye exams 
the iowa board of optometry examiners once voted to exonerate 
optometrist gary fisher of monticello but is reconsidering that 
decision in the face of intense public pressure 
the case has angered some women pitted health professionals 
against each other and raised questions about closed meetings of 
medical regulators 
the sevenmember board scheduled a telephone conference call 
tuesday morning to decide if it wants to review fishers case the 
board met privately for more than five hours saturday 
fisher was hauled before the state licensing board on ethics 
charges after some women patients complained that he had them 
partially disrobe 
fisher argued he did so for legitimate reasons to check for 
curvature of the spine associated with some eye disorders because 
much of the professional discipline review is private the issue 
first came to light last month when the board cleared him 
in its ruling the panel said fisher was honestly attempting 
to provide the best care 
that decision prompted an uproar from lawmakers and others 
it was kind of like a foot doctor looking at the brain said 
state sen jack nystrom ranking member of the state government 
committee 
the issue heated up when the attorney generals office joined 
with the board that regulates physicians in urging a new hearing 
the medical board threatened a lawsuit saying fisher strayed into 
the practice of medicine for which he isnt licensed 
fisher complained about being hounded by reporters then he and 
everyone else involved in the matter stopped commenting on the 
advice of lawyers who expect the issue eventually will land in 
court 
fisher did say he no longer performs topless eye exams

the united states left unesco in 1984 followed by britain and 
singapore on the grounds that the parisbased un agency was 
politicized antiwestern mismanaged and too expensive 
science education culture and communications are not 
confined by national boundaries the un chief said 
international organizations which deal with questions of global 
concern such as these should be truly universal 
unesco is holding its general conference meeting in paris 
considering a reform program by its directorgeneral federico 
mayor zaragoza and a more thirdworld oriented agenda proposed by 
the agencys executive board 
one of the key factors that drove the united states out of 
unesco was its consideration of a new world information order 
third world nations saw the adoption of the policy as a way of 
reducing the dominance of news agencies from the developed world in 
international communications 
the united states and britain however feared third world 
nations would use the mandate to license journalists enforce an 
ethics code among them and urge reporters to adopt ideological 
goals such as opposing racism and war 
us and british publishers and communications companies were 
outraged at the suggestions and supported president ronald

a 475foot ship hauling fertilizer phosphate ran 
aground monday in the westernmost florida keys but the coast guard 
said it appeared no cargo or fuel had spilled 
the grounding was the second in five days by a ship sailing 
along the 200mile chain of islands at the southernmost tip of 
florida 
gov bob martinez who flew over to inspect the 
yugoslavianregistered mavro vetranic said the ship apparently 
was well embedded on a coral reef 
it appears it has hit a crown jewel he said the reefs of 
florida are crown jewels in the underwater environment 
the ship was carrying 14300 tons of phosphate for use in 
fertilizer 120000 gallons of heavy fuel oil and 23000 gallons of 
diesel fuel the coast guard said 
there is no visible pollution theres no injuries at the 
moment and the ship is hard aground petty officer alastair 
worden said after a coast guard helicopter flew over the 
16yearold ship 
an owners representative was arranging for tugs barges to 
lighten the ships load and a salvage surveyor to determine what 
can be done to move the ship stranded about 7 miles northeast of 
garden key in the dry tortugas 
the island cluster 70 miles west of key west is the site of fort 
jefferson national monument and is marked by a tall lighthouse as 
well as the massive fort 
the governor earlier proposed a 10mile buffer zone for shipping 
off florida to reduce the danger of groundings and spills but 
international agreement would be required for any such change no 
formal shipping lanes exist off the florida keys 
weve had two of these groundings in less than a week 
martinez said this will clearly show that we were not crying 
wolf when we first brought this up 
the cargo ship ran aground at 145 am but the coast guard 
wasnt informed until it received a message from another vessel at 
750 am said petty officer james wentworth 
a coast guard marine inspector a representative of lloyds of 
london the ships insurer and federal and state divers were among 
those sent to inspect the grounded ship 
the ship built in 1973 is owned by atlanska plovidba of 
dubrovnik yugoslavia a port on the adriatic sea 
the grounding came five days after a much smaller cargo ship 
the 155foot alec owen maitland tore a 200yard swath through 
coral in key largo national marine sanctuary about 50 miles 
southeast of miami 
a coast guard inquiry into that grounding resumed monday in 
miami with one crew member saying the ships owner had a 
nonalcoholic policy but beer was in the ships refrigerator 
the first mate who was at the helm failed two breath tests 
after the grounding but both he and the captain said he didnt 
start drinking until after the accident 
the unlicensed first mate michael anthony bishop 43 has been 
charged with negligence and the ships captain duane godwin 37 
with allowing an improperly licensed sailor to operate the ship 
ship repairs should be completed by wednesday said coast guard 
petty officer luis diaz

states have had only modest success in 
classroom reforms although there was a greater effort at improving 
public education in the 1980s than ever before a consortium of 
universities said monday 
state legislators introduced an unsurpassed number of 
educationrelated bills increased state aid and examined the 
findings of hundreds of statelevel task forces and commission 
said the center for policy research in education 
local initiatives had the most progress on restructuring 
schools said the report the progress of reform an appraisal of 
state education initiatives 
the report was based on research conducted in arizona 
california florida georgia minnesota and pennsylvania and used 
as its benchmark goals set forth in a nation at risk the 1983 
landmark government report that prompted efforts to improve 
learning in america 
it is true that high school curricula are more academically 
oriented standards for entering the teaching profession are more 
selective teachers salaries are higher and state and local 
governments have boosted educational funding said the report 
but the reforms met with only modest success in achieving 
their goals the report continued doubts still linger about 
the rigor and challenge of some of the new courses in academic 
subjects the impact of reform on atrisk students the quality of 
teachers and teaching and the equitable funding of schools 
the report said states tended to reject complicated reform 
recommendations in favor of more manageable ones the most popular 
reform of the last five years was increasing graduation 
requirements a relatively uncomplicated procedure the report said 
at least 45 states have modified high school graduation 
requirements since 1980 primarily by increasing the number of 
credits and academic courses needed to earn a diploma it said 
the easy reforms that were adopted have stayed in place the 
report said but more complicated reforms such as teacher 
assessments career ladders and mentor teacher programs have been 
modified or diluted it found 
reforms adopted by most states lacked coherence sending a 
barrage of signals to schools and districts without setting clear 
priorities the study said 
the report said most of the progress resulted from initiatives 
at the local school district level during the 1980s several 
states encouraged school restructuring by providing seed money for 
local experiments but some districts were developing changes 
without state support it said 
the federally funded center for policy research in education is 
a consortium of rutgers michigan state and stanford universities 
and the university of wisconsin at madison

a critic of the proposed partial merger of 
detroits two daily newspapers told the supreme court monday that 
permitting the move would be a terrific incentive for monopoly 
conduct 
but a lawyer for the bush administration defending former 
attorney general edwin meeses approval of the joint operating 
agreement said such mergers are needed to protect the dwindling 
number of twonewspaper cities in america 
elsewhere an investor group offered to buy the detroit free 
press for 68 million from knightridder inc which has said it 
will sell or shut down the paper if the joint operating agreement 
with the gannettowned detroit news is overturned 
the high court heard 60 minutes of arguments over the partial 
merger and is expected to announce a decision by july justice 
byron r white has removed himself from consideration of the case 
creating the possibility of a 44 tie that would uphold the joint 
operating agreement 
william b schultz representing a group of michigan readers and 
advertisers who oppose the joint agreement said both newspapers 
are competitive equals and could survive if they raised 
newstand prices and advertising rates 
but he said the papers have been engaged in a pricecutting 
war for years designed to drive each other out of business or force 
a partial merger highly profitable to both 
their prices are too low and their advertisement rates are the 
lowest in the country he said 
if the supreme court permits the detroit papers to operate 
jointly it will result in artificial generation of other such 
arrangements schultz said the profit possibilities are 
enormous 
but thomas w merrill of the justice department said the partial 
mergers are aimed at preserving two or more editorial voices in 
cities that otherwise might become onenewspaper towns there are 
competing newspapers now in only 25 cities 
merrill said there are enough potential readers in detroit to 
support two newspapers if there were a pricing czar to prevent 
pricecutting unfortunately there is no czar he said 
the federal newspaper preservation act of 1970 authorizes the 
attorney general to give financially failing newspapers an 
exemption from federal antitrust laws 
the free press and news have agreed to combine their business 
advertising and production departments but maintain separate news 
and editorial staffs 
they put off the partial merger pending the high courts ruling 
on whether meese improperly approved the deal in august 1988 
the free press lost 10 million a year between 1981 and 1986 
the news lost 50 million in the same period 
gannett co is the nations largest newspaper publishing group 
and knightridder is second 
schultz stressed that the two companies essentially have agreed 
to split profits down the middle if the joint agreement takes 
effect that suggests they regard the newspapers as competitive 
equals and casts doubt on claims the free press is failing he said 
justice john paul stevens aggressively questioned merrills 
arguments that approving the joint operating agreement will not 
sanction predatory pricing forbidden by antitrust law 
is this lawful or unlawful pricing stevens asked merrill 
id like an answer 
merrill said the record in this case does not suggest 
predatory pricing he said it would be unfair to overturn the 
agreement and order further examination of that issue 
the investor group that wants to buy the free press for 68 
million is headed by william d mcmaster he said he wanted to 
convert the newspapers format to a statewide community 
newspaper 
the case is michigan citizens for an independent press vs 
thornburgh 881640

an amateur astronomer using a homemade telescope 
said monday he has discovered three new asteroids and the editor 
of astronomer magazine said hes the first briton to make such a 
find in 80 years 
brian manning said he spotted the asteroids between the orbits 
of jupiter and mars using a 10inch reflector telescope set up in 
his back yard in kidderminster 95 miles northwest of london 
editor guy hurst who keeps track of all european astronomical 
discoveries said mannings sightings were run through the 
international astronomical union computer in cambridge mass and 
found to be previously unknown 
to go for 80 years with no discovery it is very important for 
british astronomy hurst said mannings work although he is 
an amateur is rated as high as professional 
manning 63 said astronomy has been his hobby since he was a 
boy 
im delighted and did not expect it really he said you 
always hope you might find something but its a surprise since 
the chance of discovery is rather remote 
mannings discovery was his first attempt to identify an 
asteroid and was sparked by the september issue of astronomer 
which challenged british amateurs to find an asteroid hurst said 
manning a retired technician from birmingham universitys 
department of metrology which is the science of accurate 
measurements said he made a 20minute photographic exposure of the 
sky on oct 4 
he didnt discover the asteroids until oct 5 when he developed 
the telescopic image and scanned it with a binocular microscope 
my garden is not a very good spot its down in a hollow with 
trees all around he said the night of the fourth was quite 
good despite the millions of street lamps everywhere which are a 
big problem to amateur astronomers 
although manning discovered the asteroids they will be named by 
the international astronomical union the international society 
voted last year to name asteroid 3698 discovered by another 
scientist after manning for his contribution to astronomy 
hurst said 
asteroids are thought to be the remnants of planets that were 
partly formed or destroyed in the early days of the solar system 
the first asteroid named ceres was discovered in 1801 at 621 
miles in diameter it is still the largest ever found 
manning said he believes his asteroids are about 10 miles wide

a lawsuit filed monday alleges that the 
environmental protection agency has failed to develop national 
standards for discharging toxic pollution into public waterways as 
required by law 
as a result according to the lawsuit filed in us district 
court by the natural resources defense council and public citizen 
millions of pounds of toxic wastes are unregulated 
the lawsuit asks the federal courts to direct the epa to develop 
a plan for limiting a broader range of toxic pollution than is 
covered by federal regulations 
over twothirds of the industrial facilities that release 
toxics into our waterways are not covered by nationwide epa 
regulations but by a weak system of sitespecific permits said 
robert adler an attorney for the nrdc a washingtonbased 
environmental organization 
epa spokeswoman alicia tenuta said the agency had no immediate 
comment on the lawsuit because officials have not seen it 
the suit using data filed by industry to the epa on 1987 toxic 
emissions said an estimated 70 million pounds of unregulated toxic 
wastes are released annually into surface waters and sewers from a 
variety of industries ranging from parmaceutical companies to 
mining iron and steel and texile operations 
eric glitzenstein an attorney for public citizen said many of 
those toxic releases come from companies that are in business to 
treat hazardous wastes 
the hazardous waste treatment industry is perhaps the most 
astonishing example of an industry that escapes nationwide toxic 
pollution controls giltzenstein said 
ironically these facilities are cleaning up polluted land and 
groundwater at hazardous waste sites only to release equally 
dangerous wastes into our waters 
the lawsuit alleges that the epa has failed to live up to 
requirements under the clean water act and the resource 
conservation and recovery act to establish in a timely fashion a 
regulatory plan for controlling the discharge of hazardous waste 
into public waterways

half of cubas 50000 soldiers in angola 
have left for home slightly ahead of a schedule set in peace 
agreements signed last year by angola cuba and south africa 
officials said monday 
in a ceremony at the capitals airport the last 150 of the 
first 25000 cubans to leave the southwest african nation paraded 
past angolan cuban and un officials to board sovietbuilt 
transport planes 
according to the accords signed dec 22 1988 in new york 
3000 cubans were to have left angola by april 1 and 25000 by nov 
1 all 50000 are to be out by july 1 1991 
brazilian gen pericles ferreria gomes said he thought the 
actual number of repatriated cubans could be even higher than 
25000 due to differences in un and cuban counting methods 
a un monitoring force will leave luanda on wednesday to 
inspect former cuban bases below the 13th parallel that runs along 
angolas central highlands close to the benguela railroad gomes 
said 
gomes as leader of the force said he would also travel south 
of the parallel friday to check the bases 
following the new york accords the pullout began in january 
when the first 3000 troops left luanda 
us officials repeatedly have reported the cuban withdrawal 
proceeding on or slightly ahead of schedule they verified the 
cubans pulled back to north of the 15th parallel aug 1 
cuba and angola agreed to the pullout in exchange for south 
africas pledge to cease aid to the rebels of the national union 
for the total independence of angola and allow namibia to gain 
independence 
south african aid to unita as the rebels are known was 
replaced by a boost in us assistance to 40 million a year 
unita has been fighting to force the marxist angolan government 
backed by cuba to share power since shortly after angola gained 
independence from portugal in 1975

governmentrun broadcasting 
said tuesday that peaceful demonstrations such as the huge 
antiapartheid rally over the weekend have helped ease political 
tensions and assisted reforms 
we thank the people for behaving within the norms of 
democratic society maj gen herman stadler the police public 
relations chief said of the 70000member rally sunday at a soccer 
stadium on the edge of johannesburg 
it was the largest ever antigovernment event and virtually 
every aspect violated security laws 
but authorities approved the event in advance and police 
maintained a low profile as african national congress leaders 
released from prison oct 15 endorsed the organizations guerrilla 
campaign and called for increased economic sanctions against the 
whiterun government 
there is no doubt this event will go down in history as the 
most dramatic most poignant and perhaps the most politically 
significant since the start of the struggle for liberation said 
the sowetan the nations largest blackoriented daily newspaper 
the anc has been outlawed since 1960 but sundays rally was the 
clearest signal yet that the government is willing to allow 
peaceful public activities by the organization 
the citizen a progovernment newspaper said it would be better 
to lift laws restricting political freedom than to enforce them 
selectively 
the best thing for the government to do if it is not going 
to apply the laws is to do away with them the editorial said 
law and order minister adriaan vlok told governmentrun tv 
sunday night that peaceful protest offers a needed outlet for those 
with political grievances 
i dont think we need to be afraid that these protests which 
are monitored will break into violence vlok said 
but andries treurnicht head of the proapartheid conservative 
party called for an urgent session of parliament to debate the 
governments relaxed stance toward protests 
the anc under its own flag and that of the communist party 
alongside is enjoying complete freedom to propagate its aims and 
ambitions and issues one ultimatum after the other to the 
government treurnicht said 
the governments authority to maintain law and order and to 
enforce the laws of the land is being blatantly challenged he 
added 
police spokesman col vic haynes said police were studying 
sundays rally to determine whether anyone should be prosecuted 
however police have made similar statements after several 
recent demonstrations and have not taken any action 
when a magistrate approved sundays rally he warned organizers 
not to promote the aims of the anc 
we refused said cyril ramaphosa a union leader and one of 
the main organizers the anc lives it is amongst us 
the seven anc leaders freed unconditionally oct 15 appeared on 
a podium beneath huge banners of the anc and the south african 
communist party six of the seven had spent at least 25 years in 
prison 
deafening cheers erupted when the men led by walter sisulu 
slowly circled the playing field behind an honor guard of 20 young 
militants clad in khaki uniforms and marching in military style 
anc anc shouted the crowd many dressed in the movements 
colors of green black and gold 
sisulu said his movement would never abandon its guerrilla 
campaign unilaterally but would consider suspending violence and 
entering talks if the government freed all political prisoners 
legalized the anc and lifted the state of emergency 
de klerk who assumed power in august has offered to negotiate 
a new constitution within five years that would extend political 
rights to blacks but protect white interests the anc wants a 
constitution that would establish a oneperson onevote system

president bush broke ground monday for a 
memorial to slain police officers and said cop killers should pay 
the ultimate price for committing the ultimate crime 
bush drew loud applause from a large crowd that included 
hundreds of police officers widows and other relatives of some of 
the 30000 officers whose names will eventually be carved on 
granite walls at the memorial site 
bush prodded congress to act quickly on the 12 billion 
anticrime package he unveiled last may including stiffer 
penalties for gunrelated crimes limits on semiautomatic weapons 
and no plea bargaining with those who used guns in violent crimes 
it is time to act because these improvements are a vital part 
of our national drug strategy said bush adding before any 
more names are added to that wall the protection you deserve 
should be added to the books 
for cop killers for those who commit the ultimate crime i 
feel strongly that they should pay the ultimate price said the 
president 
the senate is expected to vote later this year on bushs crime 
package the house is awaiting senate action before it takes up the 
measure 
bush who keeps in his desk the shield of a new york city rookie 
policeman eddie byrne murdered last year while protecting a drug 
witness said the toll from police killings rivals those of 
americas overseas wars 
bush made the speech behind bulletproof glass on a stage 
erected at the judiciary square site where the national law 
enforcement officers memorial will be erected 
it will consist of an oval treelined pathway of 
remembrance on a threeacre site with the names of the slain 
police officers on a threefoothigh wall last year alone 161 
federal state and local officers were killed in the line of duty 
bush said it will be a tribute to the thin blue line that 
protects our nation from the evil within 
he singled out several slain officers from the first robert 
marshall a us marshal killed in 1794 serving routine court 
papers in augusta ga to chicago police officer irma ruiz 
killed in september 1988 by a drugcrazed gunman who invaded 
the school where she stood guard to philadelphia officer albert 
valentino shot down last week while investigating a burglary 
ruiz partner gregory jaglowski despite his own wounds 
managed to kill ruiz slayer who had taken three other lives that 
day 
jaglowski joined bush attorney general dick thornburgh and 
craig floyd chairman of the memorial in turning over four shovels 
of dirt for the actual groundbreaking 
the 5 million memorial authorized by a 1984 law unanimously 
passed by congress and signed by president reagan is being built 
with private contributions so far the nonprofit group 
spearheading the drive has raised 4 million including 
contributions from 400000 individuals 
in front row seats at the ceremony were jim brady the former 
white house press secretary wounded in the 1981 attack on reagan 
and his wife sarah now a crusader for gun control 
among the vips on stage were former attorney gen edwin meese 
iii whom bush said had stood strong and tall for law 
enforcement

to you said as manager tony la russa nobody likes the reason 
we had to wait so long to be the world champions but i know it 
means a great deal to all of us 
each of the players standing in front of a banner that read 
oaklands world serious spoke briefly to the crowd

president bush on monday signed legislation 
that gives a break to farmers who are growing substitute crops on 
land where drought destroyed or damaged earlier plantings 
the measure eases restrictions that were part of a previous 
federal farmdisaster aid package 
the revision protects winter wheat and cotton farmers who 
otherwise might have been denied disaster payments for their lost 
crops under an agriculture department plan even though the 
producers expect to earn little or no profit on replacement crops 
such as grain sorghum or soybeans 
the agriculture department trying to prevent farmers from 
reaping double benefits has been planning to deduct 75 percent of 
the gross value of any replacement crop from the disaster payment a 
farmer would have otherwise received for losses on his first crop 
under the bill approved by congress last week that system 
would be modified 
farmers would have no payment deductions if the replacement 
crops failed to produce more than 50 percent of the county average 
yield for the second crop 
but if the yield exceeded 50 percent of average yield the 
agriculture departments formula for deductions would kick in and 
be applied only to the portion of the crop that exceeded the 50 
percent mark 
under the agriculture departments initial plan even farmers 
who had replanted only a few acres would have to wait until 
harvesting their second crop before obtaining disaster benefits for 
damage to the first crop 
that provision was canceled by the new legislation

unlikely anyone escaped said sherri cadeaux a department

it could be a paperwork thing it could be that theyre hiding 
in the utility tunnels at this point we dont have any reason to 
believe that were going to find bodies we just dont know she 
added

double ring of fences which have been under heavy security since 
violence erupted wednesday at the capitol gov robert p casey 
named a threemember commission to review the prison siege and the 
effectiveness of the states response

most of the nations hospitals have pulled the plug on offers to 
xray halloween goodies saying the once popular way to detect pins 
and needles is too costly and is ineffective in preventing 
poisoning 
it cost a fortune said rose ann soloway of the national 
capital poison center at georgetown university hospital in 
washington dc 
someone calculated the cost in health care dollars and its 
an enormous amount of money nationwide ms soloway said its 
money thats probably not well spent 
if candy is going to be tampered with theres any number of 
ways of doing it she said xrays can only detect foreign 
objects especially metallic objects xrays cant detect chemicals 
or anything that could be put on or into foods 
donna siegfried technical safety specialist for the national 
safety council in chicago said hospitals began using xray 
machines to examine halloween treats in the mid1970s when reports 
of glass and pins lodged in goods became more frequent 
but some officials said hospitals are just providing parents 
with a false sense of security 
we were concerned that parents who brought candy in to the 
emergency room to have it xrayed and were told that there was 
nothing in it were led to believe it was safe said janet 
ferguson cabell huntington hospital spokeswoman in huntington 
wva 
not all hospitals are taking the advice of the nations poison 
centers bob blackburn chief technician for logan general hospital 
in logan wva said the hospital has xrayed candy for the past 
several years and will do so again this year 
there is no way to detect poisons but we try to detect a 
metallic foreign body at least were giving the child a chance 
blackburn said 
in the past we have found different things pins stuck into 
fruit and candy he said we caution the people when we do the 
candy for the kids we caution them that we cant detect any 
poison 
cabell huntington hospital examined youngsters treats until two 
years ago when the american association of poison control centers 
suggested hospitals no longer xray candy 
john baldwin head nurse of cabell huntingtons emergency 
department said experts can detect foreign bodies by xrays only 
14 percent of the time which means most of the time they 
couldnt detect it even if it were there 
ms soloway said its important that parents inspect each piece 
of candy themselves rather than depending on xrays at hospitals 
while the xraying process often disrupted hospital routines it 
was offered with good intentions and an eye on public relations 
said west virginia poison control center spokeswoman pam harvit 
but by last year concerns about liability outstripped the 
benefits she said 
the problem we saw is that parents would take the candy to get 
it xrayed and then give the kids the candy and assume it was 
safe she said 
while parents still have concerns about tampered candy the 
national safety councils siegfried said the number of reported 
incidents is low 
its not a big problem rumors start and the media gets hold 
of it and its usually just some individual that wanted 
attention she said 
falls are the number one cause of injury because of masks 
running up and down stairs tripping over their costumes she 
said

the house on monday authorized 2313 million 
for the federal communications commission over the next two years 
while ordering the agency to adopt a global perspective in 
regulating the telecommunications industry 
on a voice vote the chamber gave the fcc 1098 million in 
spending authority for fiscal 1990 which began oct 1 and 1215 
million for fiscal 1991 that was an increase from 996 million in 
1989 
the senate commerce science and transportation committee 
earlier this month authorized 1098 million for the fcc in 1990 
but only 1198 million for 1991 
the house on friday approved a fiscal 1990 appropriations 
measure containing the 1098 million which is the amount the 
white house had sought the senate was expected to act on a 
companion appropriation tuesday 
rep edward j markey dmass said the fcc needed the extra 
money to cover costs of moving and consolidating agency offices in 
1991 and to hire more people and facilities 
rep carlos j moorhead rcalif said it is money the agency 
sorely needs 
the house on monday also authorized 293 million for the 
commerce departments national telecommunications and information 
administration for 1990 and 1991 
the fcc authorization was amended last week by the house energy 
and commerce committee to require the agency to consider what 
impacts its rulings may have on us trade 
the amendment by rep bill richardson dnm was spurred by a 
european common market decision last month to urge its 12 member 
nations to broadcast television programs made in the market at 
least 51 percent of the time where practicable 
richardson said that without giving the fcc increased authority 
in matters of international trade the amendment was a strong 
signal that until foreign telecommunications markets are 
completely open to us companies the united states will be 
watching its own interests carefully 
markey said the measure gives the fcc no new authority in trade 
matters but it will tell the agency and the rest of the world 
that were serious about this international telecommunications 
competition

azem vlasi the exparty leader and 14 other ethnic albanians 
are accused of counterrevolutionary activities and opposing 
constitutional changes that limited the provinces autonomy 
death is the maximum penalty on conviction of the charges which 
include inciting ethnic albanians to riot and strike vlasis 
codefendants are officials and workers at a zinc and lead mine 
where a strike occurred in march 
kosovo with a predominantly ethnic albanian population is a 
province in the republic of serbia for generations the serbs and 
ethnic albanians have accused each other of discrimination 
the trial was adjourned soon after it opened monday as defense 
lawyers asked for a change of venue the lawyers said a fair trial 
is impossible in serbia because none of its courts could be 
considered impartial 
police fired tear gas from armored vehicles and wielded 
truncheons to disperse stonethrowing demonstrators in podujevo 20 
miles from pristina the provincial capital of kosovo there also 
were antiserb protests in pristina 
before the confrontation in podujevo demonstrators marched 
through the town chanting we want freedom and azem azem 
and trying to break through police lines azem is former party 
leader vlasis first name 
many demonstrators were students and some wore scarves over 
their faces to hide their identities 
small groups of protesters continued to roam the streets 
following the main clash with police hurling stones breaking shop 
windows and driving away yugoslav and foreign journalists some 
used cars and trash cans to erect street barricades 
there were no reports of injuries but police were seen taking 
away several people 
in pristina police battled groups of protesters throughout the 
city including hundreds of students gathered around their school 
dormitories police used tear gas in the pedestrian zone in the 
downtown area driving people screaming in panic down side streets 
at the start of mondays session in the titova mitrovica 
courthouse defense lawyers demanded that presiding judge ismet 
emra and prosecutor spasone zamfirovic be removed on grounds of 
bias 
vlasi 42 described the proceedings as a show trial staged 
with clear political goals and claimed he was the victim of a 
plot by archrival slobodan milosevic president of serbia 
until his arrest in march vlasi publicly opposed milosevics 
efforts to increase control over kosovo an autonomous province in 
which 85 percent of the 19 million people are ethnic albanians at 
least 24 people were killed in the march violence 
milosevic and the serbian leadership argued the changes were 
necessary because of alleged harassment of the serbian minority in 
kosovo the heartland of ancient serbia 
some analysts call the vlasi case yugoslaviaqs most important 
political trial since that of milovan djilas in the 1950s djilas 
once heir apparent to the late president tito spent nine years in 
jail for publicly criticizing the communist system and titos rule 
vlasi declared to the court monday the campaign to liquidate 
me has lasted a long time and was conducted by milosevic and 
rahman morina the current kosovo party chief 
police cordoned off the courthouse and only 80 people most of 
them journalists or relatives of the accused were allowed inside 
several western diplomats acting as human rights monitors were 
among those denied access 
the trial has been denounced in the liberal yugoslav republics 
of slovenia and in croatia as a serbian bid to intimidate ethnic 
albanian dissent in kosovo 
slovenian and croatian members of the national collective 
presidency and the communist partys ruling presidium have urged 
both bodies to demand the charges be dropped

transportation secretary samuel skinner said 
monday he doesnt want the power over airline takeovers that a bill 
pending in congress would give him 
this is a piece of expansive legislation that no person like 
myself who favors deregulation could support skinner said in an 
interview 
the house has scheduled to take up tuesday the air carrier 
securities act which would require the transportation department 
to block purchase of 15 percent or more of an airline if the sale 
threatened to hinder safety reduce competition break up the 
carrier or put it under foreign control 
on a related matter skinner said he and financial experts had 
serious reservations about the proposed takeover of united 
airlines parent company ual corp before the deal fell through 
but he denied any role in collapse of the buyout plan which wall 
street analysts say triggered the oct 13 drop in the stock market 
the united airlines transaction fell for one reason and one 
reason only it was not sound financially skinner said 
collapse of the ual takeover bid by its unions and management 
with backing from several banks and british airways followed 
announcement of an agreement skinner reached with alfred checchi to 
scale down foreign participation in checchis takeover of northwest 
airlines parent company nwa inc the department concluded that 
the original deal put klm royal dutch airlines in a position to 
control northwest 
skinner said his decision to modify the nwa takeover was 
thoroughly coordinated with senior officials of the white house 
responding to reports that he had been criticized for the nwa 
action by others in the administration skinner said anybody who 
says that i did not keep the white house informed fully as to what 
was going on prior to making those decisions just isnt informed 
skinner declined however to describe any conversations he had 
with other administration officials over his nwa action 
the airline takeover bill pending in the house has had strong 
bipartisan support passing the public works and transportation 
committee 235 a similar measure passed the senate commerce 
science and transportation committee but has not yet come up on the 
senate floor 
the bills were prompted by a series of takeover moves in the 
airline industry including the united and northwest deals and the 
aborted attempt by developer donald trump to buy amr corp parent 
company of american airlines the decline in the stock market led 
trump to withdraw his 75 billion plan which was opposed by amr 
management 
skinner and his deputy elaine chao both have sent letters to 
congress opposing the takeover bill although skinner had indicated 
in earlier committee testimony that there may be advantages to 
giving him power to approve takeovers rather than merely review 
them after they are consummated 
a preapproval process of existing law might be cleaner than 
trying to unwrap a transaction one can argue that skinner said 
monday adding that when he made a similar statement before 
congress he may have been misinterpreted as supporting takeover 
legislation 
but he said the bills before congress go too far 
it goes far beyond the factors that under existing law im to 
take into consideration he said current law requires the 
department to review airline aquisitions after they take place to 
ensure that carriers are financially fit to operate safely and that 
a foreign entity does not control them 
skinner said the proposed legislation would require him to 
assess the impact of the deal on competition and to look at labor 
provisions 
that smacks of reregulation it probably is reregulation and 
is inappropriate in a deregulated environment he said 
the point is i dont think i need it skinner said i 
think there are other ways i can do it

hundreds of thousands of east germans marched for 
democracy monday night the eve of a trip to moscow by new leader 
egon krenz for talks with the soviet blocs champion of reform 
mikhail s gorbachev 
official media said about 300000 people rallied in leipzig a 
city of 650000 at least 50000 in halle 40000 in schwerin more 
than 20000 in karl marx stadt and 5000 in poessneck 
lutheran church sources in east berlin said 3000 proreform 
activists demonstrated in the capital 
leipzig activists told the associated press by telephone many of 
the marchers there demanded that the communist party give up its 
monopoly on power 
they said the protesters wanted free elections freedom to 
travel and legalization of opposition groups political parties now 
are recognized only if they align themselves with the communist 
party 
the official news agency adn said people in all the cities spoke 
out for a free press and those in karl marx stadt carried banners 
reading democracy now 
krenz reaffirmed the communist partys preeminence monday 
telling military academy graduates it was at the head of 
qualitative changes going on in society 
adn reported he would leave for the soviet union on tuesday 
krenz has said east germany can learn much from reforms promoted by 
gorbachev the soviet president 
that is a major departure from the contention of his 77yearold 
predecessor erich honecker that no changes in east germanys 
orthodox regime were necessary krenz replaced honecker his 
mentor as communist party chief oct 18 
weeks of demonstrations for reform have accompanied the flight 
to the west of tens of thousands of east germans the largest 
protests in the nations 40year history have taken place in 
leipzig another one last week involving 300000 people 
in his speech at the academy krenz said the most decisive 
factor in east germany was the unity and cohesiveness of the 
party without which the unity of our people cannot be achieved 
opposition groups say the partys leading role must be open to 
debate 
democratic reform said it had joined others in demanding the 
development of a democratic consensus the organization said it 
would become an active opposition political party by next may 
krenz appears more open to change than honecker but many 
activists are skeptical feeling party leaders will block any 
reform that challenges their monopoly on power 
he has set what he calls a new course for the country 
promising freer travel abroad and declaring amnesty for 
demonstrators people who have fled the country illegally and those 
who were caught while trying to do so 
a leader of the officially recognized liberal democratic party 
said the political structure no longer corresponds to the will of 
the people or they wouldnt be taking to the streets and there 
wouldnt be movements like neues forum new forum and demokratie 
jetzt democracy now 
manfred bogisch suggested in a commentary in his party 
newspaper der morgen that the communist partys leading role 
should to be earned not dictated 
bogisch said communism was not an issue but the communist party 
leaderships policies were now a matter of debate 
those who were responsible for the stagnation will have to 
take responsibility for it he declared 
the liberal democrats have been at the forefront of efforts to 
create more political pluralism within the system 
under east germanys constitution all recognized political 
parties are aligned with the communist party the liberal democrats 
have said parties should have more independence 
leaders of the nations governmentaligned trade union 
federation met jon monday to discuss a confidence vote called for 
by its leader harry tisch he requested the vote on his leadership 
after young members accused the union of serving only government 
interests 
no decision was announced monday and the union meeting was 
continued until tuesday adn reported 
a mass rally sunday in east berlin organized by local communist 
party officials to discuss reform attracted 20000 people 
it became an emotional forum with speakers demanding that party 
leaders account for to account for a host of alleged mistakes and 
misdeeds the crowd often booed and jeered officials

bush administration officials said monday that 
candidates for top medical jobs will not be rejected because of 
their views on abortion or other political issues 
medical and scientific experts have been concerned recently that 
an ideological litmus test centering on abortion and related 
issues was prompting qualified candidates to withdraw from 
consideration for top federal jobs including the directorship of 
the national institutes of health 
in a speech sunday health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan said he took these concerns to the white house last week 
the administration has agreed he said that people being 
considered for jobs below the level of assistant secretary do not 
have to pass an ideological test 
it has been our policy that standards of scientific and 
administrative excellence and leadership prevail in the selection 
process for scientific jobs including heads of nih and the 
centers for disease control he said 
however he said it was necessary and proper for bush to 
use the litmus test to fill positions at the level of assistant 
secretary and above to select people who share his views 
conservative righttolife groups have pressed the bush 
administration to appoint to positions at hhs people who share the 
presidents opposition to abortion 
douglas johnson of the national right to life committee said it 
was particularly important that the head of nih back the 
presidents abortion stance because a director who is inclined to 
do so can undermine the administrations policy on such things 
as research using fetal tissue 
if the white house doesnt look into this im sure some 
senators will at the appropriate time he said referring to 
senate confirmation hearings on a nominee for nih director 
medical and scientific experts have been concerned over reports 
that at least one candidate for the nih post withdrew after he got 
a call from white house officials asking his position on abortion 
and fetal tissue research 
william danforth chancellor of washington university in st 
louis reportedly told the caller that if that was all they wanted 
to know about him he was not interested in the job 
danforth has declined to answer questions on the subject in a 
statement he has said he is not interested in leaving washington 
university and any conjecture about my candidacy possible 
conversations with white house representatives and others are 
simply irrelevant 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush will 
continue exploring the political views of candidates for 
policymaking jobs in the health field 
well still certainly ask them for their position on abortion 
fetal tissue research aids the whole range of issues that they 
would have to be directing federal policy on he said but for 
those jobs that essentially technical below the assistant 
secretary level the answer is no 
he said the surgeon generals job would be a policymaking 
job we certainly would want to know that they support the 
presidents position 
bushs candidate for surgeon general antonia novello deputy 
director of the national institute of child health and human 
development was asked her views on abortion before being selected 
by the president officials have said 
earlier this month when the reports about danforth surfaced and 
it became clear that novello was in line to be nominated 
administration officials said the abortion question was being asked 
of candidates for most jobs at hhs though that was not necessarily 
the deciding factor 
scientists and medical experts said they feared that the 
volatile issue would further politicize top government medical jobs 
like the nih post which remains unfilled

a walkout persisted for a sixth day at vargashor 
coal mine monday and activists at eight other mines in the soviet 
far north said they would initiate support strikes on nov 1 the 
official tass news agency said 
strikers at vargashor put down their tools last wednesday to 
protest what they called government failure to make good on 
promises of improved economic and social conditions that ended a 
walkout in july 
other strike leaders said they would start holding twohour 
preemptive strikes wednesday to pressure the government into 
granting promised benefits 
about 18000 miners work in the vorkuta region above the arctic 
circle workers at the eight other mines also struck on wednesday 
but returned to work 1 days later 
a regional court ruled saturday that the strikes violated a law 
passed by the national supreme soviet on oct 9 but no indication 
emerged as to what penalties might be imposed 
tass said the vorkuta city strike committee plans to appeal the 
decision to the supreme court of the russian federation 
it also quoted v gobrusev a spokesman for the regional strike 
committee as saying his committee supported the miners demands 
and the tactics of pressure by preemptive strikes offered by the 
miners strike committees 
however tass said the committee did not approve of the full 
strike at vargashor and said extended walkouts should be avoided

former hud secretary samuel r pierce jrs 
lawyer accused the justice department monday of giving an 
offthewall reason for not paying pierces legal expenses from 
a congressional investigation 
a justice department spokesman said it was just an 
interpretation of law 
pierce twice refused to answer questions when he appeared before 
the house employment and housing subcommittee which has been 
investigating allegations of political favoritism at the department 
of housing and urban development which he headed during the reagan 
administration 
he contended that because the hearings related to his tenure at 
the department hud should pay his fees 
the department forwarded pierces request to the justice 
department for a ruling on whether the former secretary qualified 
for reimbursement under the regulations 
two weeks later the justice department replied that it had no 
responsibility to represent pierce and therefore would not rule on 
whether he qualified for reimbursement the department said it was 
up to hud whether to represent pierce or pay his fees 
its a hot potato said pierce attorney robert plotkin 
hud hands off to justice justice hands off back to hud 
plotkin said the justice department defied a plain reading of 
government regulations when it determined it wasnt responsible for 
expenses pierce incurred during the subcommittee investigation 
i couldnt believe that of several potential grounds that 
perhaps they might have used to justify not paying it the one they 
used seemed so offthewall plotkin said 
justice department spokesman david runkel said our decision 
was based on the civil divisions interpretation of the law the 
lawyers took a look at it and thats their decision 
plotkin said the justice department stretched hard to formulate 
an interpretation of the regulations that allowed it to avoid 
making a politically difficult decision on pierces request 
the regulation states that current and former federal officials 
may be provided representation in civil and congressional 
proceedings and in state criminal proceedings when the actions 
for which representation is requested reasonably appear to have 
been performed within the scope of the employees employment and 
providing representation would otherwise be in the interest of the 
united states 
one would think that clearly on its face we are eligible 
plotkin said and then they have to exercise their discretion as 
to whether or not they want to pay it 
but in an oct 25 letter to hud deputy assistant attorney 
general stephen c bransdorfer said that legal representation by 
the justice department is available only in situations where the 
employee is subject to civil or state criminal proceedings as a 
result of actions taken within the normal scope of that employees 
authority 
if there are no such underlying proceedings then 
representation is not available bransdorfer said 
there are no civil or state criminal proceedings against pierce 
according to bransdorfers determination hud said it was 
recommending that pierces request be denied

house republicans frustrated by a lack of 
guidance from the white house searched monday for a compromise on 
raising the minimum wage in the hope of avoiding a partisan fight 
as an election year looms 
the white house didnt publicly rule out a compromise but said 
that for now it stood by its offer to raise the hourly minimum wage 
from 335 to 425 by january 1992 a year later than the 
democratic proposal due for a vote wednesday 
we are not changing our position at this point white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said chief of staff john sununu is 
discussing the issue with congressional leaders fitzwater said 
but even republicans said the white house was doing little more 
than listening and it appeared the administration was losing the 
support of some conservative democrats and moderate republicans who 
helped bush win a veto battle on the issue earlier this year 
one of those conservative democrats rep timothy penny of 
minnesota said it appeared the white house had abandoned thoughts 
of striking a deal 
it sounds like theyre digging in their heals again he 
said picking another fight like this is causing a lot of us to 
question their sincerity because a deal is within reach 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said the discussions 
were continuing but added i dont know how fruitful they are 
even an administration official close to the negotations 
complained of a lack of focus from the white house that had 
left dangling the gop leadership the republicans had hoped to 
strike a compromise to avoid another veto fight a potential issue 
in 1990 congressional elections 
because of the white house position the republican leadership 
was mulling a number of proposals of its own with a whip count 
planned for tuesday likely to determine the final shape of the 
measure it will offer as an alternative to the democrats plan 
the democrats also planned a head count and were mulling 
changes designed to win back enough conservative democrats to 
override a second bush veto 
even the administration official said the democratic leadership 
was within reach of winning a vetoproof majority in the house 
some of the votes we got last time we got with the message 
very clear that it was this time and this time only said the 
official speaking on the condition of anonymity right now its 
probably five or six votes either way 
the current bill would increase the minimum wage to 380 on 
jan 1 and to 425 on jan 1 1991 it also would allow workers 
with fewer than two months job experience to be paid a subminimum 
wage 
penny and other conservative democrats want the two 45cent 
increases pushed back to april 1 1990 and april 1 1991 and the 
subminimum period extended to three or four months 
that would make a big difference to several members he said 
bush has insisted that to get his signature a minimum wage bill 
also would have to allow employers to pay all new workers a 
subminimum for up to six months regardless or prior job experience 
democrats have said they would never accept such language 
in addition to next years elections two other factors have 
strengthened the democrats hand 
the 425anhour target is more acceptable to many conservative 
democrats than the 455 level in the measure bush vetoed also 
the fight over bushs attempt to cut the capital gains tax has 
allowed the democratic leadership to shape the issue as one of rich 
vs poor

lead a flotilla protesting french nuclear testing in the south 
pacific french agents mined the ship july 10 1985 the rainbow 
warrior sank and a portugueseborn dutch photographer who was 
aboard was killed 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar by letting two french 
agents convicted in the bombing leave detention before their terms 
ended 
uruguayan law professor eduardo jiminez de arechaga heads the 
panel which also consists of french appointee jeandenis bredin 
and new zealand appointee sir kenneth keith 
attorneygeneral david lange the former prime minister will 
lead new zealands legal team 
the two french secret agents who sank the ship alain mafart and 
dominique prieur pleaded guilty to arson and manslaughter in 
november 1985 and were sentenced to 10year prison terms by a new 
zealand court 
perez de cuellar later mediated a settlement under which france 
paid new zealand 7 million in compensation and new zealand agreed 
to commute the prison terms if the two agents were detained on a 
french atoll until the end of 1989 
in 1987 however mafart returned to france complaining of a 
stomach ailment in 1988 ms prieur went home because she was 
pregnant france flew both agents home and both received promotions 
on their return 
new zealand protested and wants the two returned to custody

conservation programs at the agriculture department 
reids request that the nomination be put on hold prevents full 
senate debate until majority leader george mitchell dmaine

knew watt

the earl of balfour whose granduncle wrote 
a declaration supporting establishment of a jewish national home in 
palestine said monday that israel must keep its present 
protectable boundaries 
balfour is in this northern port for a symposium on the 1917 
balfour declaration which opens tuesday the declaration is a 
major document in the history of the zionist movement and in the 
history of israels establishment 
lawrence of arabia promised to the arabs that every country 
will keep what she fought for but i did not find any evidence that 
there was any arab country that fought on the jordan valley he 
told a reporter 
therefore when it comes to the present boundaries of israel 
including whats inside israel has to keep and protect and develop 
her boundaries because these boundaries are protectable 
balfour said 
you fought for this country and it belongs to you 
his reference was to te lawrence who rallied arabs to fight 
on the side of britain in world war i 
israels former prime minister menachem begin was invited to 
attend the symposium but instead sent a letter saying israel would 
remember the balfour declaration as a turning point in the 
history of the jewish people 
however he accused britain of changing the documents meaning 
over the years focusing on the land of israel instead of the 
land of israel as home for the jewish people when millions of 
jews cried for a homeland 
israel was created in 1948 after more than a halfcentury of 
efforts by zionist leaders to establish a sovereign nation as a 
homeland for jews 
begin 76 referred to the zionist draft of the document that 
called for reconstituting palestine as the national home of the 
jewish people 
the nov 2 1917 declaration written in the form of a letter to 
the president of the british zionist federation stated that his 
majestys government view with favour the establishment in 
palestine of a national home for the jewish people 
begin became prime minister in 1977 and resigned abruptly in 
august 1983 aides said then that he was depressed over the death 
of his wife and over israels protracted involvement in lebanon 
following its june 1982 invasion 
he has lived mostly in seclusion since then

nicaraguas leader daniel ortega 
asked president carlos menem to organize political support to 
demobilize the nicaraguan rebels foreign minister domingo cavallo 
said monday 
menem responded that he is going to do everything possible to 
help achieve peace in that region cavallo added right away 
im going to begin talks with hemispheric foreign ministers to 
see what we can do 
but menem speaking with reporters about his talks sunday with 
the nicaraguan leader in managua said argentina would not mediate 
the dispute 
we just talked dont take this as a kind of mediation or 
anything like that it was simply a gesture of good faith he said 
menem and cavallo made their comments in separate meetings with 
reporters and it was unclear what role argentina might play in the 
nicaraguan conflict 
both returned monday from san jose costa rica where they and 
leaders from more than a dozen nations including president bush 
attended costa ricas weekend celebration of its 100th anniversary 
of independence 
the argentine delegation made a stopover in nicaragua and menem 
spoke for 90 minutes with president ortega 
in managua menem indicated he might intervene on ortegas 
behalf with central american governments and president bush to seek 
a us commitment to demobilize the nicaraguan rebels known as 
contras 
menem was quoted as saying i have taken upon myself the task 
of making those gestures 
we have appealed to the good will of the nicaraguan 
government but we are going to work so that the presidential 
accords of tela honduras are fulfilled by the demobilization of 
the contras and by this arrive at peace in central america 
ortega was quoted as saying menems offer is the first 
concrete action to save the critical situation in which nicaragua 
is living we are going to take very much into account the decision 
of president menem 
back in buenos aires menem was asked if his comments meant he 
would try to mediate the nicaraguan dispute 
i dont see that because it should be the us government 
directly he said referring to washingtons support of the rebels 
ortega stunned the other leaders at the costa rican celebrations 
when he announced his sandinista government may end a unilateral 
ceasefire in the war with the contras he accused the rebels of 
violating the accord signed in tela honduras on aug 7 by himself 
and four other central american presidents 
the accords call for free elections in nicaragua which ortegas 
government says will be held in february and demobilization of the 
contras by dec 5 
most of the estimated 11000 rebels operate out of bases in 
honduras near the border with nicaragua

japan which buys more ivory than any other 
country said monday it would join a ban on the ivory trade that is 
intended to protect african elephants 
the ban was adopted oct 17 at a meeting of the 91nation 
convention on trade in endangered species and is to remain in 
effect at least until 1992 
japan had until jan 18 to decide whether to file an appeal 
which would allow it to continue trading ivory with other countries 
that did the same or with the more than 60 nations outside the 
accord 
hajime tsujimoto of the foreign ministrys un office 
acknowledged that international attention on japan as the worlds 
main ivory consumer had played a role in the decision 
he also told reporters the decision did not necessarily mean 
japan was out of the market permanently and that it may import 
if the circumstances in the world change 
if the elephant is removed from the endangered species list he 
said the story will be different 
zimbabwe botswana malawi and mozambique have objected to the 
ban on grounds their elephant herds are not endangered and they 
depend on ivory sales to finance successful conservation by filing 
for exemptions they may continue trade in ivory with other 
countries that do not accept the ban 
a recent census estimated africa now has about 600000 
elephants fewer than half the total of a decade ago 
about 30000 people in japan are employed in the ivory industry 
which carves elephant tusks into ornaments jewelry and personal 
signature seals 
tsujimoto said some might have to find other jobs eventually 
but japan has enough ivory in stock to last about two years 
japan regularly has taken about 40 percent of the worlds ivory 
exports imports totaled 106 tons in 1988 and 143 tons in 1987 
it is to be host of the next meeting of the convention in april 
1992 
tsujimoto said japan would like to study aid to african 
countries for better management of elephant populations 
we are deeply concerned about the rapid decline in the number 
of elephants over the last 10 years he said we believe 
drastic measures should be taken to prevent further decline in the 
number and seek proper protection of the animals 
in hong kong up to 400 ivory traders and carvers marched 
through downtown streets monday to protest the ban adeline li of 
the hong kong and kowloon ivory manufacturers association said 
about 4000 people worked in the industry in hong kong

the gorbachev confidant who is now pravdas editor 
met the foreign press monday and made himself the target a 
definite change at a paper that has bashed imperialists mercilessly 
for generations 
asked how he will stop a sharp decline in readership in 
president mikhail s gorbachevs era of glasnost or openness ivan 
frolov said we shall not seek to increase circulation at all 
costs 
although he offered some ideas for enlivening the gray columns 
interviews with members of the ruling politburo for instance the 
60yearold editor seemed to hold weak commitment by todays 
communists as responsible as the party dailys content for its 
flagging fortunes 
i can ask the question even more directly do we need more 
genuine communists members of the cpsu than the already known 
number of pravda subscribers frolov said implying that the real 
communist today is one who dutifully reads the paper 
only one week into his new job the whitehaired former 
gorbachev adviser already has done something that would have been a 
surprise coming from his remote predecessor viktor afanasyev who 
ran the paper for 13 years 
frolov opened pravdas 8th floor conference room to foreign 
correspondents and sought their questions 
it was a unique opportunity to hear the views of a member of the 
policymaking party central committee now in charge of the most 
authoritative if no longer most widely read soviet newspaper 
as is the custom in such confrontations frolov occasionally 
avoided straight answers on pravdas circulation for example 
we dont have definitive information the circulation was once 
10700000 it will probably be less he said from the head of a 
rectangle of wooden tables pushed together to make room for more 
than 100 journalists all but a few of them foreigners 
pravda officially the organ of the party central committee now 
has tough competition from other dailies that have taken advantage 
of glasnost to publish more daring or spicier stories 
also soviet citizens no longer are required to take pravda to 
get another publication they really want such as a literary 
monthly or a magazine about movies 
a pravda official told a westerner who visited the paper last 
month that only 3 million to 4 million people had subscribed for 
next year 
frolov said research would be used to determine why pravdas 
readership has dropped he said there would be some innovations 
to tempt readers among them exclusive publication of some central 
committee documents 
after politburo meetings we shall publish interviews with the 
leaders of the party on what they personally think of the subjects 
raised there he said 
it would be a departure if politburo members were persuaded to 
give their personal views on its decisions customarily made in 
secret and always presented as unanimous 
frolov made clear pravda will not become the pugnacious 
westernstyle newspaper some soviets say is needed to safeguard the 
public interest 
i must say the decision about coverage of central committee 
or politburo events is made by the appropriate bodies and you will 
agree that it is quite proper and that they ought to have the 
authority to do it he said defending the partys right to do 
business behind closed doors 
that was his response when asked why pravda and other papers had 
not printed an account of the meeting earlier this month with 
ranking editors in which gorbachev was said to have accused some 
of excesses or ideological errors 
western reporters found that many soviet journalists who 
attended the technically secret meeting were ready to talk about it 
how does frolov see the future of the newspaper founded by lenin 
in 1912 as a tool to whip up hostility to the czar among workers 
we shall not become a nonserious light paper he said 
we shall not chase hot news publish nonverified facts or poorly 
analyzed materials we shall not seek to increase circulation at 
all costs 
pravda he said will try to express the very essence of 
presentday party policies 
that does not mean frolov shuns making the paper more attractive 
as far as i am concerned there can be nothing more attractive 
than good analysis said the editor a graduate in philosopy from 
moscow state university

police said they had some leads monday 
in the deaths of two elderly women whose blooddrenched bodies were 
found in homes 500 yards apart 12 hours after they returned from 
the same church service 
the two women were beaten stabbed and apparently robbed over 
the weekend authorities said 
weve got leads and we hope to make an arrest or arrests 
said cpl ra miller of the boone county sheriffs department 
the slayings stunned people in the small community about 25 
miles south of madison 
this has tore everybody all to pieces said beth kinder of 
charleston who was in bald knob on monday visiting her mother 
now people are panicking weve never had anything like this 
happen 
the body of faye jarrell 83 was found sunday morning after a 
neighbor knocked on her door and got no answer a short time later 
another person spotted an open door next door and notified police 
who found the body of dorothy daniels 68 
both had last been seen saturday night at the bald knob 
methodist church where they attended a wake for a neighbor 
both victims homes had been ransacked and were missing small 
items miller said but he said more valuable items usually taken 
during a robbery such as televisions and prescription drugs had 
not been touched 
the motive were looking at right now is robbery miller 
said we cant substantiate any other motive at this time 
miller said an autopsy showed that both victims had been stabbed 
repeatedly and beaten 
there is no evidence of gunshot wounds miller said 
there was a considerable amount of blood 
the victims apparently lived modestly and there was no 
indication of what prompted the attack miller said 
they didnt appear wealthy he said they were elderly and 
lived alone nothing extravagant they were neat in their houses 
it looked like one lady had done some quilting 
rose belcher who lives a halfmile from the two houses said 
she had known the victims all her life 
they were well thoughtof in the community she said its 
a big shock to all of us my only thought is someone must have 
thought they had some money its so sick

former president richard nixon said monday that 
china and the united states must overcome their huge and 
unbridgeable differences over chinas harsh crackdown on dissent 
and resume cooperation 
nixon speaking at a banquet hosted by premier li peng also 
called for a humanely governed china that wont turn away 
from greatness and consign itself to the backwater of oppression 
and stagnation 
li responded by reiterating the chinese position that the united 
states not china is responsible for the deterioration in 
relations and must take the first steps toward reconciliation 
if the united states takes any positive action the chinese 
side will welcome and respond to it the official news agency 
xinhua quoted the premier as saying 
nixon on the third day of a private visit is the most 
prominent american to come to china since the military assault on 
studentheld tiananmen square in june 
he is expected to brief president bush on his visit which 
includes a scheduled meeting with senior leader deng xiaoping on 
tuesday 
his message to chinese officials was clear conflict over the 
june killings may never be reconciled but washington and beijing 
must forge ahead with their relations 
addressing li who ordered martial law troops into beijing 
nixon said differences between you a chinese communist who 
believes in leninist rule and i an american conservative who 
believes in capitalism and democracy are too great to permit a 
common understanding 
but he added let us not become mired in endless and fruitless 
recriminations over the seeming impasse that has now developed 
between our two countries both of our nations must now deal 
realistically with the aftermath 
the united states and china have indicated they want to resolve 
one of their deepest rifts since nixons historic 1972 visit ended 
their long freeze in official contacts both however have called 
on the other to act first 
when asked about nixons statement that it was time to normalize 
relations white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we have 
always said that we want to resume good relations with china at 
some point the question really is when and under what conditions 
i would say that at this point we have not reached that time and we 
have not seen the right conditions 
asked if nixon was carrying a letter from bush to the chinese 
leadership fitzwater said im not aware of a letter he added 
that nixon talked to bush and national security adviser brent 
scowcroft before he left so maybe he interpreted that 
conversation as some kind of message 
the bush administration responded to the june crackdown by 
suspending highlevel meetings and cutting off arms sales china 
says it was justified in putting down a counterrevolutionary 
rebellion and has accused the united states of trying to 
undermine its socialist system and interfering in its internal 
affairs by citing human rights abuses 
we still have common concerns that make cooperation between 
china and the united states an indispensable element in ensuring 
the welfare of our two peoples and serving the cause of peace and 
prosperity in the world nixon said 
it is neither in chinas nor americas interest for your 
nation of over 1 billion people to return to its isolation the 
certain result would be an angry and impoverished nation 
china has a clear choice he said shall china turn away from 
greatness and consign itself to the backwater of oppression and 
stagnation or does it continue to venture forth on the open seas 
on a journey which may at times be rough but which leads to 
progress and peace and justice for its people 
the two nations he said must rise above the acrimony of the 
moment and resume the progress and cooperation that are worthy of 
two great peoples 
at a dinner after nixons arrival saturday foreign minister 
qian qichen praised chinas old friend for his foresight and 
sagacity 
qians speech was generally conciliatory although he said it is 
up to the united states to weigh the pros and cons and take a 
forwardlooking apporach so that chineseus relations may return 
to the track of normal development at an early date 
nixon also met with li ruihuan mayor of the northeastern 
industrial city of tianjin and one of chinas rising political 
stars 
li who was appointed to the partys decisionmaking politburo 
standing committee after the fall of reformist party chief zhao 
ziyang in june said socialism is chinas historical choice 
the official xinhua news agency quoted him as saying it is 
impossible for china to carry out reforms without adhering to 
socialism and it is hard to stick to the socialist system without 
implementing reforms

most americans favor rapprochement with iran in 
exchange for the release of the us hostages in lebanon even 
though they see the islamic republic as a sponsor of world 
terrorism a national poll has found 
ten years after the iran hostage crisis poisoned usiran 
relations 61 percent in the media generalassociated press poll 
said washington should offer to resume normal ties if iran got the 
americans in lebanon freed 
support was somewhat lower for releasing iranian assets locked 
in us banks in trade for the hostages freedom with 50 percent 
in favor and respondents overwhelmingly rejected paying ransom 
directly to the captors with 85 percent opposed 
respondents divided evenly on the idea of direct negotiations 
with the hostage takers while most favored indirect negotiations 
a majority favored military action but that fell to a minority if 
the hostages might be killed in the effort 
eighteen westerners including eight americans are held in 
lebanon most by groups believed loyal to iran iran has offered to 
help free the captives if its assets held in us banks were 
released 
it is unclear to what extent iran controls the captors if at 
all in the poll though 72 percent said they believed iran does 
control the hostage takers and 79 percent said iran supports 
international terrorism 
iran and the united states have been estranged since nov 4 
1979 when iranian students apparently with official support 
seized the us embassy in tehran and took 52 americans hostage 
they were held for 444 days crippling president carters 
administration and contributing to his defeat in the 1980 election 
a rescue attempt failed killing eight servicemen and the 
prisoners were freed only on jan 20 1981 the day of ronald 
reagans inauguration 
reagan and now president bush have labored with another hostage 
crisis the americans captive in lebanon longest held is terry a 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
kidnapped in march 1985 
washingtons official position has been that negotiating for the 
captives release would encourage more hostage taking fortyseven 
percent in the poll nonetheless favored direct negotiations while 
45 percent opposed the idea the rest were unsure 
a majority 55 percent favored indirect negotiations through a 
third party such as the red cross 
respondents at first blush supported military action with 62 
percent favoring the use of us forces to try to free the 
hostages but if the hostages might be killed in a rescue attempt 
something strategists have been unable to rule out just 43 
percent supported it 
military action was more popular with men and with people who 
described themselves as conservatives while liberals and women 
were more apt to favor some form of negotiation fiftyfour percent 
of the women supported direct talks with the hostage takers 
compared with 40 percent of the men 
the poll found some dismay at the length of the crisis with 54 
percent saying the united states has not done enough to try to free 
the hostages yet there was a split in expectations of whether they 
ever will be freed fortytwo percent thought they would 37 
percent thought not and 21 percent were unsure 
the survey was conducted by telephone sept 1424 among a random 
sample of 1071 adults in the continental united states and had a 
margin of error of 3 percentage points

the city fire chief is stepping aside 
while officials look into allegations he had links to arsonists 
mayor george latimer announced monday 
reports about fire chief stephen conroy are shocking and 
disturbing latimer said 
if there was wrongdoing it will be prosecuted and 
penalized the mayor said in announcing conroy would take paid 
administrative leave 
latimer also said firefighters have been barred from 
moonlighting for fire adjusting companies a practice criticized by 
fire experts quoted in sundays report in the star tribune of 
minneapolis 
the star tribune reported that properties owned by conroy or his 
brother patrick have had 11 fires in the past 25 years it also 
noted that two associates of patrick conroy were convicted of arson 
in 1986 
stephen conroy told the newspaper that he has no connections 
with any fire industry in st paul and said his department 
is looked on as one of the better fire departments in the 
country his brother denied any involvement in arson 
we are confident that after a thorough investigation we will 
be totally exonerated from any wrongdoing of any nature said 
earl p gray an attorney representing stephen conroy 
latimer said conroy requested an examination by outside 
investigators so he could clear his name he added that the chief 
agreed to cooperate fully with the investigators and volunteered 
to take the administrative leave 
i did not have to urge him he made the offer the mayor 
said he obviously is in a lot of pain and is very sad today 
latimer said ramsey county attorney tom foley has agreed that 
the investigation into the allegations should be handled by an 
outside agency 
the newspaper report said the fire chief has allowed 
firefighters to moonlight for an adjusting company that has 
represented alleged arsonists in fire insurance claims it also 
said shoddy investigations by the department have helped arson 
thrive 
the newspaper said its report focused on more than 200 fires in 
st paul over the past 25 years that in some way involved stephen 
or patrick conroy public adjuster william whelan or their friends 
and associates 
the newspaper said stephen conroy gave 10000 to set whelan up 
in business as a public adjuster before becoming chief it also 
said that whelans most frequent contractor has been patrick 
conroy and that companies owned by whelan and patrick conroy have 
received millions of dollars in insurance money from st paul fires 
asked why many of his cases involved arson fires whelan said 
i have no idea he said arsonists who have worked on his staff 
were not known arsonists at the time 
the star tribune said its reporters examined more than 10000 
pages of documents and interviewed hundreds of people 
city police and the state bureau of criminal apprehension raised 
questions about stephen conroy 10 years ago but their 
investigation died amid political squabbles the newspaper said 
latimer said deputy fire chief john colonna 43 who has been 
with the department for 18 years will serve as acting chief while 
conroy is on leave 
colonna said he hopes the latest allegations can be cleared up 
quickly 
its easy for anyone to see that these kinds of articles would 
affect the morale of the fire department he said thats why 
its so important that this be brought to a public conclusion 
latimer who has served as mayor since 1976 is not seeking 
reelection in next tuesdays general election

amnesty international said tuesday that anyone 
detained in turkey for suspected political offenses is in danger of 
being tortured 
the worldwide human rights organization said use of torture to 
obtain information or confessions from political prisoners 
continued unabated on a wide scale in violation of international 
treaties signed and ratified by turkey last year 
londonbased amnesty said in a new report that more than 500 
political prisoners alleged they were tortured in turkey so far 
this year and 10 such prisoners were said to have died in custody 
as a result of being tortured 
amnesty said most of the allegations relate to initial 
interrogations in police custody while detainees were routinely 
denied access to lawyers or relatives 
it said that while its report does not discuss torture of 
criminal prisoners they too are frequently reported to have 
been illtreated and tortured 
amnesty reported the government has consistently denied 
that torture is systematic in turkey and has described those 
instances of torture which it admits as the isolated actions of 
individuals 
the organization welcomed as a step in the right direction draft 
amendments to the turkish criminal procedure code announced in 
september but it said they fall short of international standards 
that require all detainees be brought before a judge soon after 
detention and have prompt access to lawyers doctors and relatives 
the proposals which still must be approved by the turkish grand 
national assembly would shorten the maximum detention period to 
four to 10 days and grant lawyers access to detainees the maximum 
detention period permitted before a detainee is either formally 
charged or released now is 24 hours in political cases it may be 
extended to 15 days however and under emergency legislation up to 
30 days 
specific cases cited by amnesty include 21 students held 
incommunicado at ankara police headquarters on the day the 
government announced the draft amendments the students later said 
they were tortured while being interrogated 
one 20yearold yusuf ali yildiz said that during six days in 
custody he was stripped naked hosed down with pressurized cold 
water beaten and given electric shocks 
the report also cited the death of seyhmus orhan from yoncali 
village in southeastern turkey it said he died on july 18 after 24 
hours of interrogation at the command of the 118th gendarmerie 
regiment officials said he was shot trying to escape other 
detainees and relatives said he was killed under torture and shot 
afterward 
amnesty winner of the 1977 nobel peace prize said statements 
extracted under torture are used as evidence against political 
prisoners

the government imposed steep increases on 
energy prices effective wednesday in conjunction with a revised 
budget passed by parliament that slashes coal subsidies 
the price increases and spending cuts were the latest exercise 
in fiscal toughness from the 2monthold government led by prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki of solidarity in its effort to control 
the economic crisis 
a finance ministry statement monday said electricity would go up 
150 percent natural gas 100 percent and bills for heat and hot 
water 50 percent 
low retail prices of electricity heat and gas fuels in 
relation to the cost of production and to other fuels make it 
necessary to increase retail prices it said this increase is 
a logical result of the recent increase in the price of coal 
similar price increases have brought down communist governments 
and led to the birth of solidarity in 1980s as the soviet blocs 
first independent trade union but public forbearance toward 
mazowiecki continues 
an official announcement monday said donations to help support 
his government had reached 138000 most of it from individuals 
foreign governments also have offered tens of millions of 
dollars help in polands move toward democracy and a market 
economy 
the first grain shipment donated by the united states arrived 
off the baltic port of gdynia on monday washington said three 
cabinet members would lead a delegation arriving in late november 
to determine how us aid can be used most effectively 
parliament approved the amended budget monday by a vote of 
3014 with 35 abstentions it reduces the projected deficit from 
92 trillion zlotys 38 billion to 47 trillion 196 billion 
and trims subsidies for the coal industry by 12 trillion zlotys 
500 million 
it puts expenditures at 344 trillion zlotys 143 billion in 
1989 and income at 297 trillion zlotys 124 billion 
the government hopes partially closing the budget gap will 
reduce the amount of money in circulation and slow inflation now 
at about 600 percent annually 
many food subsidies also have been trimmed along with 
governmentfinanced projects and spending on social services 
on oct 16 parliament restricted an indexation plan that 
provides automatic pay increases to counteract inflation

the leader of a soviet research station in 
antarctica has ordered his personnel to ship their garbage out of 
the area a spokesman for the greenpeace environmental organization 
said monday 
a message from the greenpeace vessel gondwana at king george 
island said the soviet official had at first refused to do anything 
about the accumulation of waste at the bellingshausen base on the 
island about 600 miles from the southern tip of south america 
the result of this action is a small but significant step 
forward for the protection of the antarctic said maj depoorter 
the belgian leader of the greenpeace mission in a message to the 
organization headquarters in britain 
martin leeburn greenpeaces spokesman in london said the 
soviets reversed their stand after more than 20 greenpeace members 
collected rubbish from around the soviet station and sent a protest 
to the soviet arctic and antarctic institute in leningrad 
he said the protest reported 40 bags of garbage had been 
collected and returned to the leader of the soviet station with a 
demand that the rubbish be removed and disposed of properly 
ms depoorter in her report said that on sunday the greenpeace 
members began to demonstrate as the soviet resupply ship akademik 
fyodorov anchored offshore greenpeace said the soviet vessel has 
a cargo capacity of more than 5000 tons and was scheduled to leave 
the station empty 
leeburn said that after a brief confrontation the soviet 
official who was not identified ordered his personnel to load the 
garbage aboard the ship for removal from antarctica 
ms depoorter said in her message that the greenpeace expedition 
was told by the soviet station leader on friday that none of the 
rubbish accumulated around the base over many years would be 
removed 
she said the rubbish consisted of food scraps empty bottles 
all sorts of glass receptacles cans old radio equipment doors 
windows beds drums with rotten food rusty propellers engines 
and piles of plastic all scattered over about 200 meters 
yards and half covered by snow 
leeburn said the gondwana went to king george island to check on 
the operations of the various stations garbage and other debris 
does not decay in the cold and becomes a threat to the purity of 
the wilderness and its wildlife he said 
he said the greenpeace group reported the bellingshausen 
station established in 1968 has a normal complement of about 29 
people and twice as many in summer which is now 
the soviet station has no waste treatment plant it burns 
rubbish in open pits and sends nothing back to the soviet union 
he said 
greenpeace said eight countries are active on king george island 
argentina brazil chile china poland the soviet union south 
korea and uruguay

a us warplane accidentally dropped a 
500pound bomb on the guidedmissile cruiser uss reeves during 
maneuvers in the indian ocean on monday slightly injuring five 
sailors and leaving a fivefoot hole in the deck the navy said 
the bomb which detonated upon impact set off a small fire in 
the ships forecastle that was quickly extinguished said lt bruce 
cole a navy spokesman at the pentagon 
the fighter a singleseat fa18 hornet had just taken off 
from the aircraft carrier uss midway when the incident occurred 
we dont know yet why it happened said another spokesman 
cmdr mark baker the pilot has been returned to the midway and 
he is being asked that question now 
cole said the five sailors received minor injuries as a result 
of flying glass and concussion from the exploding bomb the 
sailors were treated on board their ship and the navy does not 
plan to release their names until their families are told 
the carrier and cruiser were conducting routine weapons 
training about 32 miles from diego garcia in the indian ocean 
cole and baker said 
cole said the fa18s pilot inadvertently dropped the bomb 
apparently as it passed over the nearby cruiser the spokesmen said 
they did not know the altitude of the plane or how far apart the 
two ships were 
although the bomb left a fivefoot hole in the deck near the 
cruisers bow it did no damage to the outer hull cole said 
such a ship is nuclear capable but as they always do the 
spokesmen refused to confirm whether nuclear weapons were aboard 
such weapons antisubmarine rockets that are being phased out 
would be carried in a forward compartment of the ship 
the cruiser was returning to the us base at diego garcia under 
its own power baker said 
the bomb a mark 82 model is four feet long and 14 inches in 
diameter it is a freefall weapon that can be used against ships 
or land targets and can be adapted for use as a shrapnel weapon 
against humans one navy source said 
the plane is a jet made by mcdonnell douglas corp and first 
put into service in 1982 which can serve as either a fighter or an 
attack bomber 
the incident occurred at 906 pm local time cole said 
standard time charts give that as the equivalent of 1106 am 
est but the navy gave the eastern time equivalent as 706 am 
there was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy 
both the midway which is one of the navys oldest aircraft 
carriers and the reeves are based in yokosuka japan 
the 533foot reeves is a leahy class guided missile cruiser 
displacing 7800 tons fully loaded and carrying a complement of 450 
officers and enlisted men it was commissioned in 1964 
the 980footlong midway displacing 64000 tons at full load 
was commissioned in 1945 and has undergone a number of overhauls 
it carries a crew of approximately 2500 officers and enlisted men 
the accident was at least the sixth aboard a navy ship not 
counting sailors lost overboard since the april 19 turret 
explosion aboard the battleship uss iowa that killed 47 sailors 
only sunday a landing accident aboard the training carrier uss 
lexington off florida killed a navy student pilot and four members 
of the deck crew and injured 19 others 
the others 
may 9 six sailors are killed and five injured in a fire aboard 
the uss white plains a supply ship in the atlantic 
may 13 two sailors die in a pump room fire aboard the aircraft 
carrier uss america in the atlantic 
may 19 a marine is drowned when a landing craft from the 
amphibious landing ship uss duluth overturns during exercises off 
australia

valve sprays visitors with hydraulic fluid and water and panic

the bush administration voiced opposition 
monday to proposed sanctions on countries that are helping spread 
ballistic missile technology around the world saying it can 
accomplish more through diplomacy 
representatives from the pentagon state department commerce 
department and arms control and disarmament agency were unanimous 
in opposing the proposed sanctions legislation at a house foreign 
affairs committee hearing despite prospects that the number of 
countries with such technology will double within a decade 
richard clarke assistant secretary of state for 
politicomilitary affairs said the united states is seeking to 
curb the spread of missile technology through the twoyearold 
missile technology control regime the agreement which now has 
seven member nations is likely to grow to include more countries 
after a meeting set for the first week in december clarke said 
mandating sanctions would threaten the regimes 
effectiveness because it would inhibit exchanges of information 
between signatory countries said clarke the sanctions are 
almost certain to have a chilling effect 
the sponsor of the legislation rep howard berman dcalif 
said he was not persuaded by the testimony in the end a regime 
that has no penalties will not be as successful he said there 
will be companies and countries that will see the lure of economic 
benefit as overriding proliferation concerns you have to hit 
them in their economies 
conspicuously absent from the mondays hearing was any detailed 
discussion of recent revelations that israel has been aiding south 
africa in developing its own intermediaterange missile 
answering questions from reporters after the hearing clarke 
acknowledged that the united states had learned through 
intelligence channels in january of the israelsouth africa 
cooperation and objected to israeli officials at that time we 
are still having a dipolomatic dialogue with israel on the 
subject he said 
bermans bill would bar companies from doing business with the 
us government or from receiving advanced technology which 
requires a us export license if they are found to be violating 
the nonproliferation regime 
clarke acknowledged that the legislation could have the 
potential for cutting us aid to israel which has tremendous 
political sensitivity if there were continued transfers 
if there were a government or corporate relationship with 
south africa that might mandate that we terminate a variety of 
programs with israel he said 
henry sokolski an international security official at the 
pentagon said the defense department is seriously considering 
making compliance with export controls a condition of doing 
business with the government for suppliers involved in the missile 
technology a decision in the departments upper echelons is 
expected soon he said 
the transfer of missile technology has become an increasing 
concern in the past three years particularly in light of its 
potential for providing destabilizing delivery mechanisms for 
chemical and nuclear weapons 
the control regime now includes seven countries the united 
states canada france germany italy japan and great britain it 
seeks to control export of technology for missiles carrying 
payloads of more than 1100 pounds more than 190 miles the soviet 
union china iran israel north korea and south korea are among 
other nations that have ballistic missile technology

officials broke ground monday for 
the nations first chemical weapons disposal plant calling it a 
step toward worldwide elimination of the lethal agents 
ambassador ronald lehman ii the bush administrations chief 
arms negotiator said the tooele army depot facility dubbed 
chemical disposal system no1 represents the leading edge of 
negotiations between the united states and the soviet union to 
eliminate their chemical arsenals 
the ceremony took place on a desolate sagebrushstrewn plain 
less than a quarter mile from concrete dirtcovered igloos housing 
more than 40 percent of the nations aging chemical agent stockpile 
the 212 million cds1 48 miles southwest of salt lake city 
will be the first of eight such us facilities slated to dismantle 
and incinerate old mustard and nerve gas weapons many of which 
date to world war ii 
the tooele plant is scheduled for completion in 1992 
lehman and others said renewed negotiations with the soviet 
union in geneva have bolstered hopes for limiting and ultimately 
destroying chemical weaponry 
rep james v hansen rutah read a statement from president 
bush who reiterated his commitment to a joint ussoviet effort 
to eliminate both nations chemical arsenals within the next decade 
today we take another step along that path hansen quoted 
bush as saying the chemical weapons destruction facility to be 
built at tooele says to all the world that the united states is 
determined to fulfill its promises that our people and our 
government are committed to halting the spread of chemical weapons 
and eliminating their very existence 
bush has promised to reduce stockpiles to 20 percent of existing 
weapons even before any treaty is signed hansen added 
much of that will be accomplished through destruction of the 
rockets canisters artillery projectiles and other weaponry 
containing chemical agents congress mandated destruction of the 
weapons for safety reasons in 1985 
besides tooele other us chemical stockpiles are at the pine 
bluff arsenal ark anniston army depot ala umatilla depot 
activity ore newport army ammunition plant ind aberdeen 
proving ground md pueblo depot activity colo and 
lexingtonblue grass army depot ky 
the eightbuilding cds1 complex will be adjacent to igloos where 
nearly 800 chemical weapons many of them leaking are stored 
construction of the facility will employ about 300 people and is 
expected to begin later this year 
from february 1992 until january 1993 the 350 people needed to 
operate the plant will be trained and simulated tests will be 
conducted destruction of the weapons will begin in february 1993 
and take about four years the army said

leftist rebels fired at least 
16 shells from homemade mortars at the defense ministry monday but 
most exploded in nearby streets killing a gas station attendant 
and wounding 15 other people 
president alfredo cristiani accused nicaraguas sandinistas of 
either supplying the weapons or parts and technical skill for their 
construction to the rebels 
the farabundo marti national liberation front fmln an 
umbrella organization of guerrilla groups had announced in 
february it was suspending the use of homemade mortars in populated 
areas because their inaccuracy caused civilian casualties 
cristiani told a news conference the attack was an attempt by 
the fmln to give the impression it is strong 
but they the rebels have only the capacity to stage 
terrorist actions 
col rene emilio ponce head of the joint chiefs of staff said 
eight shells struck the grounds of the armed forces social club 
adjacent to the ministry compound but no one was wounded there 
authorities said the other shells exploded in adjoining civilian 
neighborhoods 
ponce reported 30 unfired shells were found on two trucks from 
which the other shells had been launched the trucks were in a 
shopping mall about 300 yards from the military compound 
the shells on one truck were covered with garlands of paper 
flowers the kind used in ceremonies marking the day of the dead 
holiday on nov 2 those on the other truck were covered with boxes 
painted as speakers for a musical band 
ponce called the shelling indiscriminate terrorism and also 
accused nicaraguas leftist government of providing the weapons for 
the rebels 
the fmln lies when it talks about peace while at the same time 
waging war ponce said referring to recent efforts to negotiate 
an end to the decadeold civil war 
representatives of cristianis rightist government and the fmln 
have met twice since september but they are far apart on terms for 
a ceasefire and have only agreed to continue the talks 
two shells exploded at a gasoline station about 800 yards away 
killing ernesto vasquez 72 as he pumped gas the blasts wounded 
two attendants 
i felt i was on a battlefield said francisco morales 27 a 
mechanic about 15 minutes after the attack 
this is very bad said morales who was shaken by the 
deafening blasts and the carnage they the guerrillas dont let 
the humble people work and we have to work 
the gas station was heavily damaged but there was no fire 
another bomb fell at a nearby fried chicken restaurant slightly 
wounding a boy and causing extensive damage 
two mortar shells fell at the entrance to the military compound 
and three landed beyond the compound on a sidewalk bordering a 
parking lot next to the national baseball stadium at least one 
soldier and one civilian were wounded by those blasts witnesses 
said 
maj mauricio chavez caceres chief of the armed forces press 
committee said no bombs fell inside the ministry compound 
a soldier on duty at the gate said two bombs fell inside the 
compound but this could not be confirmed witnesses said they saw 
one injured soldier being evacuated from the compound 
the rebels staged a similar attack on dec 23 killing three 
people and wounding 38 only one of those casualties was a soldier 
the rebels issued a communique feb 28 announcing they would 
suspend such attacks because of faults and deficiencies that 
were causing high risk to the civilian population without us at 
any time having intended to harm innocent civilians 
according to human rights organizations most of the more than 
70000 people killed in el salvadors civil war have been civilians

shows dont improve 
sullivan spoke while on the syndicated donahue show with her

abcs good morning america and jane pauley who is leaving 
today at the end of this year 
i cant lie about that i know the ax is right there 
sullivan said when asked by host phil donahue if she was feeling 
the pressure of being on a program that is third in the ratings 
the cbs news program which sullivan coanchors with harry 
smith premiered on nov 30 1987 it succeeded a shortlived 
lowrated entertainment show and was the latest in cbs long 
effort to compete in the morning 
although sullivan said her programs ratings have risen 50 per 
cent since it began she also said that if more viewers dont watch 
and we dont improve from where we are in ratings my days are 
numbered 
and i dont think theres a question about that thats the 
business i know that im a grownup 
sullivan who joined cbs from abc didnt elaborate there was 
no immediate comment from cbs

today audience that she is leaving after 13 years and will be

wouldnt be leaving as soon as she is had not norville whom she 
has called a friend been hired for the program norville became 
its news anchor on sept5 
no i would not be leaving at this time because the shift in 
attitude would have come along much more slowly she said 
referring to her own attitude about leaving the toprated program 
it took some kind of an external jolt if you will to propel 
me out of a course i had very happily travelled for 13 years she 
said 
pauley whose current nbc news contract has been extended to 
1992 will coanchor a prime time news series that will premiere in

rebel rocketing closed kabuls 
international airport monday for the second time in three days the 
government acknowledged that usbacked guerrillas surround khost 
a strategic town near the pakistan border 
other rocket attacks around kabul wounded five people the 
government said 
a government source and two witnesses said rebels captured sore 
kalli the hometown of afghanistans first marxist ruler noor 
mohammad taraki 
the guerrillas also maintained their 10day blockade of kabuls 
four major highways causing food and fuel prices to rise 
military officers of the sovietbacked government fear the 
fractious rebel front has begun to unite a government source said 
quoting military officials 
lack of unity hurt the rebels in their attempt to oust the kabul 
government after soviet forces withdrew from their decadelong 
military intervention in afghanistan the soviet withdrawal was 
completed last february 
the source speaking with the condition he not be identified 
said moslem rebels loyal to moderate ahmad shah massoud and others 
led by fundamentalist gulbuddin hekmatyar were coordinating the 
10day blockade of salang highway the northern route out of kabul 
diplomats quoted government officials as saying massouds men 
and the government were negotiating massoud was said to be 
offering to open the road in exchange for food 
several united guerrillas forces reportedly were fighting 
government troops around khost 25 miles from the pakistan border 
government spokesman mohammed nabi amani said rebels were 
shelling kabul from all sides 
government sources and diplomats have reported that a 
khostbound convoy carrying weapons and food turned back toward 
kabul after fierce fighting outside of gardez which lies between 
khost and kabul 
khost has relied on air shipments since january 1988 
soldiers at kabuls airport reported it was closed after being 
hit by at least 12 rockets 
they said air shipments from the soviet union had dwindled to 
about 10 a day from about 30 
in kabul the prices for flour mutton and rice continued to go 
up and sugar could not be found 
more than 2000 trucks carrying suppies for kabul were said to 
be blocked on the highway private truckers entering kabul from 
other roads said those routes too were closed to government 
traffic 
government officials have estimated that kabuls food and fuel 
stocks would last about a month if land and air routes were cut 
silos holding 50000 tons of flour were said to be full and the 
government has also stockpiled gasoline 
but most of the flour would go to government employees and their 
families comprising about 800000 of kabuls estimated 22 million 
people 
a goverment source said rebels seized sore kalli the hometown 
of taraki founder of the democratic peoples party of afghanistan 
last week thousands of rebels attacked the city in ghazni 
province south of kabul a government source and two truck drivers 
who said they witnessed the battle reported that by friday the 
guerrillas had routed the 3000strong garrison the truck drivers 
reported 10 rebels killed and 80 wounded they had no information 
on government casualties 
taraki set up the garrison after he seized power in a coup in 
april 1978 althoug he was ousted and killed in another coup in 
september 1979 the garrison remained one of the most powerful in 
the province the government source said

state department by going to beirut said monday he showed people 
there america cares and gave a prominent lebanese leader some 
downhome political advice 
rahall and rep mary rose oakar who are of lebanese descent 
returned sunday from unsanctioned meetings with christian leader 
gen michel aoun whose forces control east beirut and acting 
prime minister salim hoss in moslem west beirut 
both us lawmakers described the two meetings as friendly and 
respectful 
conversations with aoun whos pivotal in determining whether 
lebanon ratifies a new peace plan also were frank rahall said in 
an interview 
we advised him that he ought to cool his antiamerican 
rhetoric said rahall who predicted aoun would become i think 
more toneddown 
rahall whos been in congress for 13 years said he also passed 
along to the military leader this political advice bite your 
tongue and just hope that the follies of your enemies will catch up 
with them 
in response he said i hear you rahall recounted 
the two democrats private diplomatic mission was not approved 
by the state department which blocked an august attempt by oakar 
and rahall to go to beirut

in amateur diplomacy or hostage negotiation 
we werent there as administration spokesmen he said 
theres never any good time according to the state department 
to visit that country 
rahall said he and oakar accomplished their primary goal i 
think we showed that despite the withdrawal of our ambassador the 
us is still committed to achieving peace in lebanon he said 
that had i think a very positive impact on the lebanese people 
in an interview sunday night and again monday at a news 
conference in her cleveland district oakar said the trip was 
within her rights and duties as a congresswoman 
oakar and rahall visited lebanon in 1982 at the height of the

israeli invasion of lebanon rahall returned a year later and said 
he intends to go back

secretary of state james a baker iii 
expressed concern monday that nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
may try to use alleged attacks by the nicaraguan contras as an 
excuse to scuttle elections set for next february 
i worry that they the sandinistas may be trying to lay a 
predicate to walk away from their commitment to hold elections 
baker said in an interview with the associated press 
however ortega on monday said that the elections would be held 
as planned regardless of the resolution of the dispute over the 
contras 
the elections are taking place in nicaragua period ortega 
said speaking through an interpreter in an interview with nbc 
news with contra or without contra they are going to take place 
definitely with war or no war that is elections are taking 
place 
ortega has said that under certain conditions he may not renew 
a ceasefire that the sandinistas and the contras agreed to in 
march 1988 ortega has contended that the rebels have 
systematically violated the agreement 
baker said ortega may be worried that opposition candidate 
violeta chamorro could have a real chance of winning if the 
elections are halfway free and fair 
if there is a chance for democracy to win an election maybe 
the approach hasnt been all wrong baker said answering 
skeptics who contend the administration has not applied enough 
pressure on nicaragua 
the administration was waiting and watching to see if ortega 
will call off a 19month truce with usbacked rebels 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said ortega was a 
target of mounting pressure from his latin american neighbors not 
to follow through on his threat 
the issue pretty much goes back to president ortega and the 
sandinistas in the sense of hes changed his position a little 
bit fitzwater said we obviously are urging that the 
ceasefire be maintained 
after startling a hemispheric conference on democracy in costa 
rica by announcing friday that he would cancel the ceasefire 
ortega modified his position to say he would decide the matter 
tuesday 
a senior state department official briefing reporters on the 
condition of anonymity agreed with baker that a decision by ortega 
to abrogate the ceasefire would be merely a pretext to end the 
election process recent polls show ortega to be trailing the 
usbacked presidential candidate violeta chamorro in 
campaigning for next februarys elections 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash called ortegas threat 
regrettable i hope it will be reconsidered 
by all reports both nicaragua and ortega are suffering 
because of a blunder on his part foley said 
for his part bush said at least four latin american presidents 
had chastised ortega and that costa rican president oscar arias 
who won a nobel prize for his efforts to bring peace to the region 
was furious 
chatting with several reporters he invited for a midday jog 
bush said he had been misunderstood in calling ortega a little man 
and that he had meant to say smallminded he conceded that the 
nicaraguan leader who is fivefootten is not small of stature 
bush said he would not speculate on whether he might seek 
renewed military aid for the contras if ortega carries through on 
his threat 
his spokesman fitzwater said our purpose is still to get a 
free and fair election and to pursue the peace process 
administration officials privately said a request for military 
aid was extremely unlikely given strong bipartisan congressional 
opposition to rearming the contras 
under an agreement reached last spring between the white house 
and congress humanitarian aid is to be continued to the contras 
through the feb 25 elections in nicaragua 
congressional leaders have vowed to adhere to that agreement 
which also envisions the disbanding of the rebel group once free 
and fair elections have been assured 
we have an agreement with the administration foley said on 
monday 
with ortega to announce on tuesday whether he will continue the 
ceasefire its pretty much a case of waiting and watching to 
see what he does and to make sure that our views are clear 
fitzwater said 
he also said us officials do not buy for one minute 
ortegas rationale for threatening to end the truce violations of 
the ceasefire by the contras 
fitzwater said that sandinista violations including breaking a 
treaty banning shipping arms to leftist rebels in el salvador 
dwarf any violations by the contras 
the state department official said that latin leaders were 
shocked and disappointed by ortegas behavior at the costa rica 
i would note that this contras is an army without 
ammunition by and large they have not received any us military 
supplies since february 1988 while the sandinista is a 
wellequipped wellsupplied military force the official 
saidso the idea that the resistance would routinely attack the 
sandinista army is an unlikely event

palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip and

clash near his home in the gaza strips nusseirat refugee camp 
the attack prompted several days of revenge attacks by jews on 
arabs in jerusalem and other cities

disputing the existence of serious differences 
among key officials secretary of state james a baker iii said 
monday the bush administration is trying to seize what we think 
is an opportunity for significant reform in the soviet union and 
eastern europe 
in an interview with the associated press baker said there 
are only nuances of differences over whether soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev can succeed in his program of transforming the 
country politically and economically 
calling that a question of durability baker said i dont 
think there is any policy difference in the administration on the 
question of the desirability of the soviet leaders perestroika 
policy 
bakers comments were designed to put to rest the notion that 
differences among top officials were slowing a us response to 
gorbachevs bold approaches particularly in eastern europe 
just last week baker acted to quash a speech by robert m 
gates the deputy national security adviser that took a 
pessimistic view of gorbachevs chances after baker in two speeches 
had set forth the administrations position welcoming the changes 
in the soviet union defense secretary dick cheney has voiced 
reservations similar to those in gates speech 
on the other hand senate democratic leader george mitchell of 
maine has accused the administration of being timid in response to 
soviet initiatives 
weve made up our mind baker said that there is an 
opportunity there we should try and seize that it would be a 
mistake not to try regardless of what we think about his 
gorbachevs chances of success and quite clearly he faces some 
very major problems 
but baker said we ought to talk about that in the right way 
and at the right time 
on another subject baker said he did not expect definitive 
answers on prospects for mideast negotiations during an eightday 
trip to australia beginning tuesday night 
baker will meet with prime minister bob hawke and attend a 
12nation planning session for a new economic grouping among asian 
nations 
we may continue to talk even while i am on the trip baker 
said but i would guide you off looking for either a 
makeorbreak on this thing before the trip is over 
baker has been conducting much of his middle east diplomacy by 
telephone with foreign ministers moshe arens of israel and esmat 
abdel meguid of egypt his goal is to set up a meeting between 
israelis and palestinians leading to elections on the west bank and 
in gaza 
i have not put any deadline on this and we will continue to 
try and work on the problem baker said 
turning to nicaragua during a 20minute session in his seventh 
floor office in the state department baker reaffirmed his view 
that president daniel ortega may be using reported attacks by 
contra insurgents as an excuse to try to scuttle elections set for 
next february 
ortega has said that under certain conditions he may not renew 
a ceasefire that the sandinistas and the contras agreed to in 
march 1988 ortega has contended that the rebels have 
systematically violated the agreement 
i worry that they the sandinistas may be trying to lay a 
predicate to walk away justify a walking away from their 
commitment to hold elections baker said 
but ortega for his part insisted in an interview with nbc 
television that he was not walking away from the elections 
the elections are taking place in nicaragua period ortega 
said 
ortega may be worried that opposition candidate violeta chamorro 
could have a real chance of winning if the elections are halfway 
free and fair baker said 
if there is a chance for democracy to win an election maybe 
the approach hasnt been all wrong he concluded

a homeless man with a history of mental problems 
was convicted monday of raping and murdering a pregnant doctor in 
her hospital office 
steven smith 23 had admitted killing dr kathryn hinnant at 
bellevue hospital last jan 7 but his lawyer said he was insane 
and therefore not responsible for the crimes 
the jury however accepted a prosecutors assertion that smith 
was aware of his actions and that his insanity defense was a ruse 
to escape punishment the jury deliberated for only two hours 
the manhattan jury convicted smith of all counts he faced 
murder rape robbery and sodomy smith who faces a maximum of 50 
years to life in prison showed no emotion 
state supreme court justice james leff set sentencing for nov 
21 supreme court is the name of the regular trial court in new 
york 
the defendants mother marian smith said he didnt have a 
ghost of a chance with the ghosts in that courtroom 
hinnant 33 was five months pregnant when she was attacked in 
her fourthfloor officelaboratory at the massive 1200bed 
hospital her husband eric johnson and a hospital administrator 
found her body the next day 
according to trial testimony smith told police he sometimes 
slept in a storeroom on the hospitals 22nd floor and walked around 
unnoticed in surgical garb and carrying a stethoscope he claimed 
he watched operations slept in the doctors quarters and visited 
patients roomms 
smiths lawyer marvyn kornberg argued that smith deliberately 
left clues at the scene so police could find and hospitalize him 
as proof of smiths insanity kornberg cited medical records 
dating back to when his client was 14 almost all of them say smith 
has low intelligence and is delusional that he hallucinates and 
hears voices 
a psychiatrist who testified for the defense said smith appeared 
to have a psychosis related to schizophrenia 
smith initially told police he had an accomplice named john 
kornberg said john was a delusion that the defendant really 
thought this person had punched and raped hinnant and then helped 
him kill her 
the man is mentally sick kornberg told jurors the man is 
not criminally responsible for what he does 
but assistant district attorney james kindler argued that smith 
is sane he was aware of what murder was and he was aware that 
kathryn hinnant was murdered kindler said so why is insanity 
a defense 
kindler said smith invented stories about hearing voices 
compulsive behavior and john because he was trying to escape 
responsibility for what he did as for fingerprints and other clues 
at the scene kindler said they show smith was sloppy careless 
and unlucky but they dont show that he was crazy

prime minister margaret thatcher her government 
rocked by the resignation of her top treasury official sank monday 
to the worst ratings of her decade in power 
one sounding showed her the most unpopular leader since polling 
began here 
she cannot afford many more mishaps said norman tebbit 
former chairman of the governing conservative party who helped 
mastermind mrs thatchers third successive election victory in 
1987 
in a national opinion poll sounding mrs thatcher hit the 
lowest popularity rating for any prime minister since polling 
started in britain 50 years ago 
only 24 percent of a sample of 935 voters questioned said they 
were satisfied with her performance and 61 percent blamed her for 
thursdays sudden resignation of chancellor of the exchequer nigel 
lawson 
he said he could not continue in the 22member cabinet so long 
as mrs thatcher retained a personal economic adviser sir alan 
walters who opposes britain joining fully the european monetary 
system which links key european currencies walters then also 
resigned 
mrs thatcher is lukewarm toward membership of the systems 
currencystabilizing exchange rate mechanism while both lawson and 
the deputy prime minister sir geoffrey howe favor it she fired 
howe as foreign secretary last june 
tebbit one of mrs thatchers closest political associates 
described the latest forced cabinet shuffle as an appalling 
political muddle 
she should remember it is dangerous for a captain to appear 
semidetached from the team tebitt wrote in londons evening 
standard 
the furor has heightened criticisms of mrs thatchers style as 
bossy hectoring and intolerant of opposing views in the cabinet 
britains new foreign secretary douglas hurd said monday that 
some cabinet ministers shrivel up before mrs thatcher 
she likes an argument hurd said in a television interview 
some people find it difficult to argue with a woman prime 
minister so they rather tend to shrivel up and feel resentful 
the answer is actually to argue back the former home 
secretary said youll find yourself being contradicted and 
sometimes told you dont know what you are talking about but if 
you persevere you gain ground 
the national opinion poll published in a london newspaper the 
independent was taken by telephone in the three days after lawson 
quit and the british media reported the government in crisis 
mrs thatcher already held the unpopularity record when she 
scored a 25 percent satisfied rating in gallup and market opinion 
and research international polls in 1981 when the effects of her 
tightmoney policies sent unemployment soaring 
labor party prime minister harold wilson held the previous 
unpopularity record of 27 percent satisfied in a 1968 gallup 
sounding 
the national opinion poll which gave no margin of error showed 
62 percent of those questioned said they were dissatisfied with 
mrs thatcher fourteen percent had no opinion 
a harris poll for the bbctv current affairs program 
panorama being screened monday night showed the conservatives 
13 points behind the socialist labor party fiftytwo percent of 
those questioned said mrs thatcher should resign now 
mrs thatcher meanwhile called senior leaders of her troubled 
party to discuss strategy at her no 10 downing st residence 
party chairman kenneth baker acknowledged afterward the 
government has appeared from time to time to be disunited 
the harris poll taken over the weekend among 925 voters gave 
labor 50 percent of the vote enough for a landslide election 
victory and the conservatives 37 percent the rest split among two 
small centrist parties and the greens 
in an ominous sign for mrs thatcher who had been credited 
relatively widely with pulling the british economy around 61 
percent said the government was handling the economy badly 
sixtyseven percent said they had little or no confidence in her 
handling of the government 
since the furor over lawsons resignation the conservatives 
have slumped to an average 10 points behind labor in polls 
compared with around 7 points behind during the previous month 
the conservatives have trailed labor consistently since early 
summer

a navy pilot making his first landing 
attempt on an aircraft carrier was low and slow before his 
training jet crashed on the uss lexington killing him and four 
others the ships captain said monday 
the t2 buckeye slammed into the ships island the towerlike 
part of the ship which also was hit by a kamikaze plane in world 
war ii before cartwheeling across the deck and exploding in flames 
sunday afternoon said capt c flack logan 
it looked like a battle zone there were pieces of aircraft 
and of metal all over the place bodies were spread throughout 
different areas lt bruce adams a physician and the ships 
medical officer said after the lexington returned to its dock late 
monday morning 
in addition to the five dead 19 people were injured logan said 
the pilot ensign steven e pontell 23 of columbia md was 
the only one aboard the twoseat trainer a normal situation when 
aviators make their first carrier landings logan said pontell a 
1988 graduate of the us naval academy in annapolis md was a 
member of training squadron 19 at meridian miss naval air 
station 
the navy identified the other dead as petty officer 3rd class 
burnett kilgore jr 19 of holly springs miss petty officer 3rd 
class timmy l garroutte 30 of memphis tenn and airman lisa l 
mayo 25 of oklahoma city all lexington crew members and byron 
gervis courvelle 32 of meridian miss a civilian employee of 
dyncorp which has a contract to maintain navy aircraft the four 
were on the flight deck officials said 
in another accident involving a navy vessel a us warplane 
accidentally dropped a 500pound bomb on the guidedmissile crusier 
uss reeves during maneuvers monday in the indian ocean the bomb 
left a 5foot hole in the ships main deck and five sailors were 
slightly injured the navy said 
the lexington was steaming in the gulf of mexico in clear 
weather about 30 miles south of its home port here when the jet 
crashed 
as i see it logan said he ended up in a position which 
in naval aviation is known as being low and slow which is a very 
terrible place to be when you are coming aboard a ship 
landing signal officers radioed the pilot to add power and waved 
him off but he did not comply logan said he said an 
investigation would try to explain why 
the nose pitched up and he lost control of his ability to fly 
the aircraft and it went up and came into the island the 
captain said 
the plane flipped upside down before a wing tip hit the island 
just below the control tower the captain said the wing tip broke 
off and remained embedded in the superstructure when the lexington 
docked monday 
the jets fuselage then smashed into the side of the island but 
the ship showed little evidence of the accident other than the 
wreckage of the plane still upside down covered with orange and 
white parachutes 
it hit at the feet of airman dee votolato 21 of houma la 
who was inside a glassedin area operating a video camera used to 
tape all landings 
the lexington is the navys oldest carrier its only one used 
exclusively for training and the only one with women aboard 
the impact knocked votolato to the floor but she got back up 
and pointed her camera at the flight deck in time to capture the 
plane bursting into flames 
airman darrell gurley of indianapolis was directing crew members 
on the deck where to park planes as they landed 
he was headed straight for us gurley said i turned and 
there was just a great boom it shook me and i buckled down but i 
knew i had to get out the door because the flames were coming right 
for my station i knew i would be wiped out so i took off running 
gurley his arm in a sling said a piece of metal had hit him in 
the back he made it inside the island only to discover his shirt 
was on fire he took it off put out the flames put it back on and 
joined firefighting efforts 
pieces of the plane struck three other parked jets but logan 
said it appeared all three can be repaired 
pilots in the other three planes jettisoned their canopies and 
clambered out logan said 
airplanes normally land on the lexingtons 910foot blacktop 
flight deck at about 110 to 120 knots or up to 138 mph said cmdr 
denny major the ships air officer they stop by catching their 
tailhooks on cables stretched across the 192footwide deck 
aircraft land on the stern of the ship 
the crash occurred six days before the 45th anniversary of the 
kamikaze attack that killed 47 crew members and injured 127 on nov

entertainer bette midler should get 400000 
from an advertising agency that imitated the grammywinning 
singers voice in a tv commercial a federal jury ruled monday 
the us district court jury which began deliberating friday 
decided that young amp rubicam violated miss midlers rights by 
imitating her voice 
in a statement given reporters the agency called the award 
unfortunate but bearable 
i hope my victory will in a small way contribute to higher 
ethical standards in the advertising field miss midler said in a 
statement i also hope it will cause companies to pause before 
they knowingly and willfully trod on the property rights of 
others 
the actress and singer said she was considering appealing a 
court ruling that barred the jury from awarding punitive damages 
because young amp rubicam had a goodfaith belief it was acting 
within the law 
at the trial miss midler testified i dont do commercials 
and said one of her former backup singers was hired to perform the 
song do you wanna dance for a 1986 mercury sable car 
commercial after she turned down a request from ford motor co 
miss midler who has appeared in such films as beaches and 
outrageous fortune filed the lawsuit against young amp rubicam 
inc in 1987 seeking 25 million in damages 
miss midler also filed a 10 million lawsuit against ford but 
us district judge a wallace tashima ruled thursday there was 
insufficient evidence to proceed against the car company 
miss midlers attorney peter laird said he hoped national 
advertisers and advertising agencies will think twice in the future 
before they disregard the rights of artists 
laird told the jury his client never agreed to sing in the 
commercial and she never would have the agency took what they 
couldnt buy from midler he said 
she had the right to say no that right was taken away from 
her laird said 
defense attorney robert callagy claimed young amp rubicam never 
intended to imitate miss midlers voice but instead tried to do 
credible renditions of the original recording of her 1971 hit song 
he said the agency bought a license to use the song 
the mere imitations of a performance is not a violation of 
copyright law we imitated the record we did not imitate the 
voice said callagy 
two years ago a judge threw out miss midlers case ruling the 
agency acted like the average thief but had broken no laws an 
appeals court overturned that decision 
prior to the start of deliberations tashima instructed jurors 
when a professional singers voice is widely known and is 
deliberately imitated in order to sell a product the singers 
rights have been violated

security council ambassadors agreed monday 
on a mild resolution that criticizes south africas administration 
in namibia but does not claim that free and fair elections are 
impossible in the territory 
unanimous adoption was likely tuesday after the 15 ambassadors 
consult their capitals said western and third world diplomats on 
the council speaking on condition of anonymity 
black african and nonaligned nations began circulating draft 
resolutions two weeks ago that castigated south africa for alleged 
abuses and prepared to follow up with strong speeches before the 
nov 711 namibian election 
british diplomats said those resolutions invited vetoes from 
more than one of the five permanent security council members the 
united states britain france china and the soviet union 
western diplomats said third world nations were trying to mount 
an 11thhour campaign to boost the electoral chances of the 
southwest africa peoples organization known as swapo 
intense consultations resulted in language agreeable to all 
council members 
this is a watereddown version that causes us no problems 
said aubrey dwyer spokesman for south africa which is not on the 
council theres nothing in there that they can use to declare 
the elections null and void 
the final draft welcomes secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellars report on namibia which outlined areas of concern but 
concluded that the territory is headed for a free and fair election 
it demands immediate full and strict compliance by all 
parties concerned in particular south africa in implementing 
council resolutions calling for namibias independence 
it demands that all paramilitary and ethnic forces and commando 
units be disbanded particularly the southwest africa territorial 
force and koevoet a dreaded counterinsurgency unit 
swapo has accused its main competitor the democratic turnhalle 
alliance of hiring koevoet veterans to intimidate proswapo voters 
and break up campaign rallies 
the resolution calls for decommissioning the 1500 south african 
defense force soldiers still in namibia now confined to base under 
un supervision 
it demands repeal of such remaining restrictive and 
discriminatory laws and regulations as inhibit the holding of free 
and fair elections without specifying any 
the resolution endorses perez de cuellars opinion that law ag8 
which establishes a racially segregated society in namibia should 
be repealed 
namibians will vote for a constituent assembly to draft a 
constitution and organize the first independent black 
majorityruled government in the territory of 13 million 
if swapo wins twothirds of the votes it will be able to 
unilaterally write the constitution and organize any form of 
government it chooses 
the former german colony has been governed by south africa since 
1915 
last december south africa signed accords with angola and cuba 
agreeing to cooperate with a un plan for namibias transition to 
independence as cuba withdraws its 50000 troops from angola

state tv showed extensive film on 
monday of police beating demonstrators with clubs in prague and 
broadcast an interview with top dissident vaclav havel raking 
czechoslovakias hardline communist leadership 
society is slowly waking in protest against repression 
banned playwright havel told the panorama public affairs show 
his comments were part of a 20minute segment dealing with 
demonstrations on the 71st anniversary of czechoslovak 
independence more than 10000 people defied a police ban and 
rallied for democracy in prague last saturday despite hundreds of 
arrests and beatings by riot police 
havel was interviewed in a hospital on friday he has been there 
for treatment of a bronchial inflammation since shortly after his 
arrest thursday two days before mass protests broke out 
alluding to promises of change in east germany forced by mass 
demonstrations and to reforms in hungary and poland havel said 
the czechoslovak authorities are very nervous and are acting 
accordingly 
the present czechoslovak leadership is increasingly isolated 
at home as well as abroad 
formal alliance in the warsaw pact has been unable to paper over 
increasing tensions between czechoslovakia one of the most 
orthodox soviet bloc countries and hungary which is rapidly 
evolving into a multiparty democracy 
political differences were heightened by hungarys decision to 
unilaterally declare a moratorium on its part of a danube river dam 
and canal project with czechoslovakia it says completion of the 
project would cause irreversible ecological havoc 
czechoslovakia plans to finish construction of its part and 
demands compensation from hungary if it pulls out permanently 
in a separate panorama interview movie director jiri menzel 
bestknown abroad for his oscarwinning film closely watched 
trains described czechoslovakia as split between those who 
rule and those who obediently accept everything that 
happens 
panorama also showed an interview made months ago with 
czechoslovakias former communist party leader alexander dubcek 
whose 1968 political reforms were crushed by a warsaw pact invasion 
you can write in the constitution that the communist party 
is the leading power but that doesnt mean anything by itself 
dubcek asserted 
dubcek who has compared his attempts at reform with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs policies urged the czechoslovak 
leadership to follow moscows example 
months before it disbanded and was replaced by the newly created 
socialist party on oct 7 hungarys communist party directly 
criticized the 1968 warsaw pact invasion the only soviet bloc 
communist party to do so 
that move along with a spate of newspaper articles and radio 
and television programs siding with the 1968 reformers on occasion 
of the aug 21 anniversary of the invasion drew a formal 
czechoslovak protest 
the national federation of hungarian journalists on monday 
assailed the detention of a hungarian reporter by czechoslovak 
police over the weekend and the ousting of other hungarian 
journalists trying to cover the aug 21 anniversary in prague 
in a statement carried by the official mti news agency the 
federation urged czechoslovak authorities to observe international 
norms on human rights and on freedom of information it also 
scolded east germany for recently expelling some hungarian 
reporters

the head of boeing cos military aircraft 
division signed an agreement monday requiring the company to pay 
the federal government 11 million in connection with allegations 
of overcharges on air force contracts officials said 
the signing by boeing military airplanes president robert l 
dryden was announced by the us attorneys office in wichita and 
the justice department in washington 
boeing has denied any wrongdoing in the case characterizing the 
dispute as a goodfaith disagreement over pricing procedures in 
the settlement the company did not acknowledge the validity of the 
governments claims 
however a document reportedly presented to federal grand jurors 
contained a boeing officials calculations of how much money would 
be generated by the overcharges 
under the settlement boeing must pay the 11 million within 
five days the agreement says boeing wont face civil or criminal 
prosecution in the case except possible internal revenue service 
claims 
were certainly pleased that an amicable settlement could be 
reached said company spokesman richhard l ziegler 
ziegler refused to discuss the companys potential irs liability 
in the case or how the alleged overcharges occurred 
the case involved contracts for new aluminum skins or outer 
coverings on kc135 refueling tankers and transports from 1974 to 
1986 government investigators alleged that boeing overcharged for 
aluminum raw materials by quoting supplier catalog prices instead 
of their actual costs which were 12 percent to 13 percent less 
during air force contract negotiations boeing is required to 
certify the raw materials prices it quotes are current accurate 
and complete 
an investigation into the case began in 1985 
a federal grand jury in wichita where the division is based 
heard hundreds of hours of testimony and inspected thousands of 
documents for more than nine months before the case was withdrawn 
by prosecutors late last month 
in addition to the other terms of the settlement the agreement 
prohibits boeing from charging any of its costs or legal fees in 
the settlement to government accounts or on future government 
contrcats 
the divisons parent company is based in seattle

prospective jurors in the trial of a miami police 
officer who shot a black motorcyclist to death were asked monday 
whether the threat of racial violence would influence their verdict 
people were called into the courtroom one at a time from a jury 
pool created last week and questioned closely by attorneys about 
their knowledge of the jan 16 shooting that sparked three days of 
rioting 
the trial of colombianborn william lozano 30 has raised 
concern among local officials about another violent reaction in the 
community which has seen several racial eruptions this decade 
after the slayings of blacks by police and the acquittals of police 
officers after trials 
lozano is charged with two counts of manslaughter in the deaths 
of clement anthony lloyd 23 who was shot in the head while being 
chased by police and allan blanchard 24 who suffered fatal 
injuries when the bike crashed 
as the trials second week began monday lead prosecutor john 
hogan estimated that seating a sixmember jury and four alternates 
would take at least two weeks but mondays relatively brisk pace 
could mean a jury will be seated more quickly 
i assumed wed have a lot more trouble than this hogan said 
when the session ended for the day nine people were retained as 
prospective jurors and five were excused among those excused were 
three people who said they had formed strong opinions on the case 
most of the people questioned said they knew very little about the 
case 
attorneys for both sides questioned prospective jurors on the 
past riots and asked if they could remain impartial despite the 
threat of violence looming over this trial 
a white woman in her 50s who said she followed the case in 
newspapers and on television said she couldnt put aside her fears 
of possible violence 
its frightening she said youre afraid that if you were 
on the jury and brought in a verdict the black community didnt 
want to hear thered be rioting 
she was dismissed 
a black woman who works as a busmaintenance clerk said she 
had not formed an opinion about the lozano case asked about past 
riots she said i dont believe in violence we all suffer from 
it 
but she indicated that the threat of violence would not affect 
her verdict if she were on the jury 
whatever happens happens she said 
she was told to remain as the juryselection process continued 
the shooting which occurred on the birthday of the rev martin 
luther king jr during the week leading up to the super bowl left 
one person dead and caused millions in property damage 
the defense says lozano shot in selfdefense 
his attorney roy black won the acquittal of thenmiami officer 
luis alvarez in the 1982 shooting of a young black man at a video 
arcade in overtown just blocks from where lloyd and blanchard were 
killed 
that slaying and the innocent verdict in 1984 triggered racial 
violence as did the acquittal of five metrodade officers tried in 
1980 in the beating death of a black motorcyclist after a chase

got i had already been studying piano 
when i joined a rock band nobody was playing keyboard then so 
i got my dad to loan me money for a magnus chord organ on our gigs 
id stick a microphone next to it to amplify the sound it worked

two decades after it set out to measure things by 
the millimeter liter and kilogram britain is part way there but 
still not very enthusiastic about it 
shillings and sixpences are gone and the liter spelled litre 
here is showing up at gasoline stations 
but miles are still the measure of the highways and pounds and 
kilograms depend on where you shop 
every retailer is afraid to change said andre gabor an 
economist who has advised the government on going metric no one 
will go out on a limb for metric because they fear people might go 
to the next shop 
i havent personally gone metric said sir thomas padmore a 
former member of the metrication board founded in 1969 to oversee 
the transition 
my principal hobby is gardening and i still use a gallon can 
there is total confusion in buying things like pesticides which 
are marked half in metric half in imperial measure and some 
people are extremely tiresome about it 
padmore who is 80 added older citizens my age think its a 
damn nuisance 
as a member of the european economic community britain is part 
of the tarifffree 12nation trading bloc that will come into 
existence at the end of 1992 and the resulting economic harmony 
will put the british imperial system of weights and measures all 
the more out of step 
thus by order of the eec gills gallons feet fathoms pounds 
and ounces are to be phased out by the turn of the century 
the idea is to use the metric system for everything that is 
negotiated across borders thus acres stay as does the mile the 
cost of replacing every road sign in britain and ireland would be 
enormous 
also saved are the furlong a measure of horseracing distance 
the troy ounce in which gold bullion is traded and the pint for 
milk or a beer at the pub the british also will still be able to 
weigh themselves in stones units of 14 pounds 
loose goods such as vegetables will stay imperial until 1999 
but packaged goods must come by the kilogram by 1995 
the countrys mistrust of the metric system dates to at least 
1791 when it declined frances invitation to join in establishing 
an international system devised by the paris academy of sciences 
not until 1897 did parliament legalize the use of metric 
measures in trade and commerce 
in 1965 prime minister harold wilson pledged britain would go 
metric but he foresaw the problems when he remarked that the 
british dont like foursyllable words like metrication 
indeed popping down to the pub for a 0568 of a liter never 
seemed likely to catch on which is why the pint stays 
a public opinion poll in 1970 indicated that most people 
preferred the imperial measures fiftyseven percent opposed going 
metric and only onethird said they understood the system even 
though it should be a lot simpler since it works in multiples of 
10 as opposed to the 12inch foot eightpint gallon and 5280foot 
mile 
a government pinup attempted the metricisbeautiful approach 
by showing bikiniclad della freeman with vital statistics in 
millimeters 914610914 
think metric the poster exhorted but ms freeman didnt help 
things by confessing a preference for inches 
millimeters sound so enormous that it is rather 
unflattering the model said 
in inches shes a 362436 
the currency was changed in the early 1970s out went shillings 
sixpences and halfcrowns in favor of a decimal system whereby the 
240penny pound became the 100pence pound 
despite intense grumbling from traditionalists decimalization 
worked schoolchildren began learning the metric system in 1974 
and it looked as though the 1979 deadline for full metrication 
would be met 
but in 1979 a poll found 46 percent still opposing metrication 
and today says the national consumer council british consumers 
have the worst of both worlds 
consumers find that comparison of goods is made much more 
difficult by the fact that products are often measured in different 
ways in different shops the council said conversion from one 
system to the other is neither quick nor simple 
the confederation of british industry cbi favors metrication 
to increase foreign trade and is confident its members will be 
ready by 1992 
in principle we should do all we can to extend our trading 
markets said john scates of the cbis international affairs 
directorate british industry must give the customers what they 
want or youre asking for trouble because the next guy will please 
the customer

affluent young executives flocking 
to west german cities like this scenic rhine river metropolis have 
a problem in common with the poor immigrants crowding in from the 
east 
hundreds of thousands of them can find no place to live 
west germany one of the worlds wealthiest nations has been 
plunged into a housing crisis by its own prosperity 
demographic and economic warps have coincided to flood the 
market with homeseekers at a time when the supply of new public and 
private housing is virtually nil due to a construction lag five 
years ago 
our postwar baby boom came along a little later than in the 
united states and we are now seeing hordes of young people with 
good educations and good incomes flooding the housing market 
said stefan kampmann director of the german tenants association 
which monitors rental conditions nationwide 
they can afford better housing and they want it but it just 
isnt there 
the housing shortage loomed long before a wave of east european 
refugees hit this year but that influx expected to reach 500000 
by years end has greatly aggravated the problem 
the nation is now short about 800000 homes a million other 
households are in need of major renovation 
thousands of recent arrivals from east germany the soviet union 
and poland sleep on cots in converted concert halls or in makeshift 
metal housing erected on sports fields 
the hundreds of thousands of upmarket homeless usually crowd in 
with relatives or friends during the hunt for housing which can 
take years 
west berlin munich hamburg and frankfurt suffer the most acute 
shortages but officials concede the problem has reached crisis 
proportions in virtually every city 
chancellor helmut kohl has declared housing the no 1 budget 
priority for next year and has promised special funds for new 
construction this year and a review of tax and rentcontrol laws 
paradoxically hundreds of thousands of potential apartments are 
kept off the market by landlords in west germany because of tax 
consequences or building restrictions that prevent conversion of 
attics and lofts 
pressure from all income brackets is mounting and tales of 
apartmenthunting woes abound 
desperate homeseekers advertise any way they can a man in west 
berlin painted an appeal on the back of his leather jacket many 
put up notices on trees and light standards 
desperate wellpaid twoincome couple with small child will 
pay 800 marks 420 for information leading to obtaining a 
threeroom or larger apartment said one of hundreds of such 
notices posted in the suedstadt neighborhood in bonn the capital 
nonsmoking medical student seeks any room for 198990 study 
year a heidelberg man rainer schimpf has likewise announced 
heike schneider a 29yearold journalist in bonn said the 
apartment shortage allows landlords to pick and choose tenants to 
the point of discrimination 
landlords wont rent to students and single people because 
they think youre going to wreck the place said ms schneider 
who shares an apartment with two roommates 
while west germans have more money to invest as their economy 
booms housing construction is a longterm investment with lots of 
risks 
crowded with industry and covered with a spiders web of 
freeways from the north sea to the bavarian alps little open land 
is available for new suburban housing 
environmental codes strictly limit construction in urban areas 
and building and labor costs have risen so sharply that rents 
double the going rate would have to be charged to recover 
construction costs 
a rentcontrol law has kept prices relatively stable at the 
equivalent of about 600 to 725 a month for a 1000 square feet of 
living space 
about 60 percent of west german households are renters 
the german home apartment and land owners association in 
duesseldorf contends the government will have to loosen regulations 
to encourage owners to rent second homes and spare rooms 
its president theodor paul says 225000 more dwellings could 
be brought into the market if owners could see a profit in it

it is still a crime to insult the 
royal family in the netherlands as a 24yearold dutchman recently 
learned when he was fined 500 guilders 230 for displaying a 
poster depicting queen beatrix as a pig 
most dutch frown on insults to the house of orange whose fate 
and fortunes have been entwined with the low countries for 400 
years 
periodic polls indicate the public overwhelmingly favors 
retaining its constitutional monarchy 
the orange family belongs to the antique furniture that weve 
inherited and it would be unwise to do away with it they might 
be very valuable said historian coenraad tamse of groningen 
university they offer a simple icon of the continuity of dutch 
national identity 
since 1898 the dutch have been led by three queens the dour 
wilhelmina a symbol of hope during the fiveyear nazi occupation 
the motherly juliana and now the practical beatrix who has a 
strong sense of her role in dutch life 
beatrix has a very strong notion of historic continuity even 
though nothing could be further apart than the role of 16thcentury 
william and hers said royalty writer fred lammers referring to 
prince william of orange who led the dutch fight for independence 
from spain in the 16th century 
although the 51yearold beatrix is far from a figurehead her 
official statements are closely tailored to fit the policy of the 
elected government 
an attractive woman with the characteristic ruddy cheeks of her 
countrymen beatrix is unpretentious in public and dresses like a 
prosperous middleclass matron 
she and her husband claus a former west german diplomat mix 
easily with the public and eschew extravagance 
but beatrix reportedly is concerned with maintaining respect for 
the monarchy and insists on being called majesty rather than 
maam which her mother juliana preferred 
over the centuries the house of orange has survived financial 
and romantic scandal as well as occupation by napoleons forces in 
17951812 and by hitlers in 194045 both times its members fled 
to england 
its current hallowed image dates from wilhelmina beatrixs 
grandmother who was groomed to fit the mold formed by the 
supposed dutch national traits virtuousness diligence charity 
religiosity and aversion to violence professor tamse said 
wilhelminas bond with her people was irrevocably forged by her 
frequent moraleboosting radio speeches from london during world 
war ii 
periodic scandals have failed to tarnish the orange image 
during the 1950s there was queen julianas reported dependence 
on a faith healer which the media attributed to her depression 
over the nearblindness of her daughter princess christina born 
in 1947 
in 1964 daughter princess irene enraged hardline protestant 
factions by rejecting the royal familys dutch reformed protestant 
faith for roman catholicism to marry prince carlos hugo de 
bourbonparma who now is king juan carlos of spain 
julianas husband prince bernhard was dutch industrys 
unofficial ambassador until his implication in the lockheed bribery 
scandal in 1975 
he was stripped of his rank as inspectorgeneral of the dutch 
armed forces but is still highly popular and active in conservation 
issues 
even the royal familys wealth reported to range from 80 
million to 44 billion has failed to incite popular resentment 
beatrix and her family live in huis ten bosch house in the 
woods an estate in the hague visible from the public highway 
except for state occasions beatrix is driven around in a ford 
their three sons study in the staterun university system and 
room with friends 
the heaviest public insult to the monarchy came in 1980 when 
juliana abdicated in favor of beatrix during the inauguration 
dutch monarchs are not crowned stonethrowing squatters rioted 
outside 
in hindsight the inauguration riots had less to do with the 
monarchy than with anything else the housing situation 
unemployment and the like writer lammers said but as 
national symbols the royals bore the brunt of the unrest 
despite her circumscribed role beatrixs interest in government 
is keen according to sources close to the royal family 
she meets every monday morning with premier ruud lubbers and has 
at least one extensive policy discussion a week with other cabinet 
ministers 
the royals draw a line at exploitation of their private life by 
the popular press 
four years ago claus obtained a courtordered retraction from a 
dutch magazine for an unsubstantiated story alleging that their 
eldest son crown prince willemalexander spent the night with a 
mysterious blonde in an amsterdam hotel

dirty decayed haunted by hoodlums 
prostitutes and drug addicts this fogbound seaport is not much 
different from any other latin american port of call except here 
the shopkeepers speak russian 
more than 200 ships of the soviet fishing fleet operating in the 
pacific off peru use callao as a resupply point under a contract 
signed by the two countries in 1971 
for the soviet union callao represents an important but 
controversial foothold in a region where soviet influence has been 
limited 
about 30000 soviet crewmen a year on sixmonth stints shuttle 
in and out on aeroflot flights to nearby lima perus capital 
the sailors the most visible sign of the soviet presence in 
peru have become prominent targets for leftist terrorists however 
on july 5 a terrorist bomb tossed beneath a tour bus wounded 20 
sailors from the fleet on a shopping and sightseeing trip many of 
the wounded were badly maimed and burned 
six soviet fishermen also were wounded in 1986 when a bomb 
hidden under a pile of sweaters went off in a clothing shop 
frequented by the sailors in callao 
police attributed the attacks to the shining path a leftist 
insurgent group fighting since 1980 to topple perus government and 
install a workers and peasants state patterned on the ideas of 
the late chairman mao tsetung of china 
the group also has attacked the aeroflot office in downtown lima 
and a perusoviet cultural center 
on oct 25 rebels in a passing car hurled dynamite at the soviet 
embassy damaging a diplomats car but causing no injuries 
it was the second attack on the embassy in three years in 1986 
the maoist guerrillas assaulted it with explosives and submachine 
guns one rebel penetrated the embassy compound but was blown up 
when a bomb exploded in his hands 
the shining path views the current soviet and chinese 
governments as traitors to true marxism and regards the soviets as 
enemies because they have been a major supplier of arms to the 
peruvian armed forces for the past two decades 
just before the july 5 bus bombing the government announced it 
had purchased four soviet helicopter gunships for its fight against 
the insurgents 
close relations between peru and the soviet union go back to the 
late 1960s when the leftist military dictatorship of gen juan 
velasco realigned peruvian foreign relations toward the east bloc 
velasco outfitted his army and air force with soviet arms and 
aircraft and despite subsequent changes in government peru remains 
dependant on the soviets for training and spare parts 
today the country is the third largest purchaser of soviet 
military hardware in the western hemisphere after cuba and 
nicaragua 
they are inhibited from turning away from the soviet influence 
because of decisions made 20 years ago said a western diplomat 
theyre hooked onto the chain 
although staggered by a huge budget deficit and a 17 billion 
foreign debt the government is planning to buy 14 more helicopters 
for use by its counterinsurgency forces 
the government uses the fishing contract to help pay its debts 
with the soviets almost all of which is for arms purchases 
the agreement allows soviet trawlers to harvest 400000 tons of 
fish a year inside perus 200mile territorialwater limit peru 
takes 175 percent of the catch 
critics complain the soviets take as much as 15 billion worth 
of fish each year without paying taxes and accuse the government of 
doing little to control the take 
they can fish where when and as much as they want said 
sen felipe osterling who submitted a formal complaint to the 
government in april charging the fishing contract was 
unconstitutional 
the leftleaning government of president alan garcia has not 
responded to the complaint 
but businesses in blighted callao welcome the tall blond 
fishermen 
sweaters the cheapest blue jeans imported watches and 
they carry away lots of brown leather jackets said angelica 
casana owner of a store that sells peruvian handicrafts they 
take special sizes because they are very big 
the terrorist threat however has caused business to drop off 
in callao as the sailors try to maintain a low profile she added 
its affected them the fear she said 
they dont come like they used to and some shops have closed 
up and left

by now in the fifth year of terry andersons 
captivity there are rituals in the hostage impasse tormenting 
routines played over and over again 
at home there are prayers and pleas abroad there are demands 
in the government there is a litany no deals but every avenue 
that might lead to freedom for eight captive americans is being 
pursued 
except that there are no known avenues at this point 
all of it came together at andersons 42nd birthday his fifth 
as a hostage observed friday at mass in a georgetown university 
chapel sponsored by a volunteer organization called no greater 
love 
it was the 20th event that group had sponsored in behalf of the 
hostages in lebanon it was the 1686th day in captivity for 
anderson chief of middle east services for the associated press 
it was national hostage awareness day by act of congress although 
not a lot of people seemed to be aware of it 
in the senate there is a daily reminder of andersons long 
ordeal sen daniel patrick moynihan dny issues it at each 
days session placing in the congressional record a speech an 
article or a count of the number of days anderson has been held 
the state department repeated its familiar call for release of 
the hostages on friday urging those who hold them to immediately 
and unconditionally free all the hostages no political cause can 
justify these criminal acts the department said in words used 
over and over again during two administrations 
earlier in the week the shiite moslem extremists who seized and 
hold anderson played out their part in the ritual frustrating 
evidence of the sameness and futility in it all 
they repeated in the autumn of 1989 the demand with which they 
began in the spring of 1985 for the release of 15 moslem 
terrorists imprisoned in kuwait 
with the demand once again came an instant photograph of 
anderson captive and incommunicado somewhere in the beirut area 
since he was seized by gunmen on march 16 1985 the photo was 
similar to one released by the captors nearly a year ago 
american officials have said all along that they do not control 
the kuwaiti prisoners convicted in 1983 in embassy bombings that 
killed five people and that they would not make deals with 
hostagetakers anyhow 
the demand from islamic jihad which also holds hostage thomas 
sutherland 57 came a day after the new president of iran 
suggested there might be another way out for the captive americans 
and was read by some diplomats as a militant answer to the message 
from tehran 
hashemi rafsanjani said iran would try to help get the hostages 
freed if the united states agrees to release iranian assets frozen 
in the teheran embassy hostage crisis of 1979 he said the united 
states also should help determine what happened to three iranian 
diplomats kidnapped in southern lebanon in 1982 and believed to be 
dead 
those too are familiar demands and they drew a familiar 
response officials at the state department and the white house 
said no deals for hostages and that the united states has no new 
information about the three iranians the dispute over frozen 
assets money and military equipment is in the hands of a special 
tribunal in the hague which periodically releases funds it 
determines are owed iran 
our position has not changed that we do not link the iranian 
assets to the hostages and we do not make deals for hostages 
said marlin fitzwater the white house press secretary 
eight americans and 10 other westerners are held hostage in 
lebanon by militant shiite groups aligned with iran but the 
iranian government always has disclaimed direct knowledge or 
control of the captives and rafsanjani did so again 
administration officials now believe that the hostage situation 
will be resolved only as part of a broader settlement including 
some normalization of relations with iran president bush came to 
office saying he looked to a day of improved us relations with 
iran and inviting teheran to move toward it by helping gain 
freedom for the captives 
the policy is unchanged so is the plight of the hostages 
year after frustrating year as peggy say andersons sister 
said at the birthday mass 
it is hope that motivates us to approach every ceremony as if 
it would be the last said mrs say a leader among the hostage 
families 
but there was no one to suggest anything more than hope no new 
policy no promise no sign of movement only the ritual farewells 
spoken with the suggestion that the next hostage ceremony must at 
last celebrate freedom instead of marking bondage

the sound of classical music drifts from a large 
upstairs dressing room at the luntfontanne theatre one hour before 
an evening dress rehearsal gordon matthew sumner is playing mozart 
i think it helps to concentrate on something else for a minute 
or two says sumner better known as rock superstar sting as he 
gets up from the piano otherwise you end up worrying 
what occupies most of his time these days is 3 penny opera 
a revival of the bertolt brechtkurt weill musical about the 
underworld of victorian england in it sting plays macheath a 
rakish brigand nicknamed mack the knife macheath is a cutthroat 
criminal not to mention a devilishly handsome bounder and a ladies 
man 
the 38yearold former bass player and singer for the police 
certainly looks the part the golden locks have been cut and 
slicked back a mustache slashes the upper lip but the eyes are as 
blue and as mesmerizing as when he first filled stadiums and arenas 
across the country singing such hits as roxanne and every 
breath you take 
3 penny opera opens nov 5 on broadway after a bumpy 
outoftown tryout 
reviews in washington were unfavorable especially for its star 
if youre going to see sting prepare to be stung sniffed one 
critic slow and turgid stuff said another cast members 
reportedly were seen in new york auditioning for jobs in other 
upcoming musicals but director john dexter and his company have 
worked furiously on the show and word of mouth particularly 
during the new york previews has improved 
ive learned an awful lot sting says i know the 
character is more convincing now than he was when i started 
rehearsals in august theres more of me in mackie you start with 
a mask and you inject it with bits of yourself im not saying you 
become a murderer or a particularly bad person but there are 
moments in your life when you could be that person 
what has surprised the man who is making his broadway debut in 
the musical 
i thought i would be less involved creatively i thought i 
would learn the lines learn the blocking and just do it the same 
way every night it doesnt happen that way the show is different 
every night everybodys changing slightly so the changes you do 
have a domino effect 
dexter who won a tony award in 1988 for directing m 
butterfly has a reputation as a tough taskmaster 
hes very demanding but i find working with him very 
refreshing because he is very honest sting says if youre 
being rotten hell tell you a good director holds a mirror up to 
you and says this is good or bad and its your fault so i know 
hes telling the truth 
3 penny opera is not stings first venture into the music of 
kurt weill three years ago he recorded the ballad of mack the 
knife and later performed weills music with the hamburg state 
orchestra in west germany 
its very strange music to sing sting says weill was a 
student of schoenberg a very serious music man and yet he 
basically wrote pop music at the end of his career he moved toward 
pop music 
thats an interesting point for me because im a pop musician 
and im going the other way his music is demanding it has its 
roots in european music but it also is very influenced by jazz 
3 penny opera was a quick flop when it was first done on 
broadway in 1933 but an offbroadway revival in the mid1950s 
starring weills widow lotte lenya ran for more than 2600 
performances 
the odd spelling of the title instead of the more traditional 
threepenny opera was done to signify that this is a new 
translation done by michael feingold 
the new stage production was the brainchild of producer jerome 
hellman best known as the man behind such movies as midnight 
cowboy and coming home hellman and sting are neighbors in 
malibu calif and he persuaded the rock star to try the stage 
sting whose father was a milkman in the workingclass town of 
newcastle england studied english in college where he prepared to 
be teacher but he left teaching behind when he moved to london 
i wanted to be a musician he says and he did primarily in 
jazz before the police was formed in 1977 hes had the name 
sting since he was 18 when he wore black and yellow sweaters 
that made him look according to a friend like a bee 
sting has been seriously studying singing for the last 10 years 
to try and get out of my bad habits 
3 penny opera wasnt miked in washington but complaints 
about the sound or lack of it brought out the microphones 
but its very subtle sting says they dont make your ears 
bleed like ours do when we play concerts 
the rock star has worked on his speaking voice too trying to 
make it as resonant as his singing voice and even has taken 
tapdancing lessons 
not because theres any tap dancing in the show he says 
i thought if i was going to learn dancing i would try to learn 
some of the most demanding dancing there is its brainwork more 
than anything else trying to remember to tap so many steps to the 
left and so many to right 
stings commitment to 3 penny opera is for nine months the 
longest he has been in one place in 15 years a new album a 
concert tour and a new movie will have to wait until the show 
closes 
its demanding because of the process of adding subtracting 
and changing he said ill probably go crazy but i wont be 
bored definitely not bored 
but thats the reason he did the show in the first place 
i dont know what the fallout from this thing will be 
positive or negative he says i have no way of predicting it 
thats one of the exciting things about it the important thing is 
that im learning something i think thats how i genuinely value 
success or failure now

szilard went to england to introduce himself to wells with the 
idea unavailing of licensing his books in central europe the 
young scientist felt a personal calling to rescue the world from 
itself through a brotherhood of its best and brightest while 
failing with wells szilard filed away in the drawers of his memory 
an apocalyptic preview from wells 1914 book the world set 
free which forecast catastrophic destruction by atomic bombs 
cp snow the reverse of wells as a physicist who wrote novels 
said szilard possessed an invulnerable egocentricity but he 
also said a french biologist was as generous with his ideas as 
a maori chief with his wives he was given to long reflective 
walks but felt there is no place as good to think as the 
bathtub he would towel off after several hours of immersion and 
apply for patents on his soapborn ideas 
when the american ernest o lawrence invented the cyclotron in 
1930 which permitted firing subatomic particles at rutherfords 
nuclei szilard had already applied for a patent on a similar 
device a year before in any case it was a new tool something the 
americans were particularly good at inventing to look more deeply 
into the atom 
in 1932 rutherfords lab in england identified the uncharged 
atomic particle the neutron science now had a bullet to fire at 
the nucleus of the atom without electrical interference from its 
satellites 
as science edged closer to the heart of the matter and the 
immense power einstein had postulated that lay there its 
practitioners were motivated by scientific venturing with slight 
thought of other consequences an atomic bomb 
frederick alexander lindemann a british physicist who as lord 
cherwell was to become winston churchills wartime science adviser 
said in the 1930s he could scarcely believe that the universe was 
constructed in this way as to make the atom a weapon in 
september 1933 rutherford reiterated moonshine at a public 
seminar and was quoted in a report of the times privately 
rutherford cautioned the war office to keep an eye on the 
matter 
also in that paper had been a review of wells latest book as 
it happened one of the newspapers readers was leo szilard with 
his usual prescience he had seen where the antisemitism of mein 
kampf was leading germany and left the day before emigration fell 
under aryan restrictions 
on a dank lugubrious day in that september of 1933 szilard 
went for a walk at one point he stopped for a red light near the 
british museum but his mind kept on motoring wells atomic bombs 
rutherfords moonshine flipped through his mind as did thoughts on 
chemistry 
there were such things in chemistry as chain reactions but they 
curtailed themselves eventually but what if a rutherfordian atomic 
nucleus could be split by one of his neutrons such as shot by one 
of lawrences cyclotrons would the nucleus release other neutrons 
to hit other nuclei and so on in a chain reaction to release 
einsteins postulated energy 
thus the chain reaction of a scientific mind while waiting for a 
light to turn green 
in time szilard would apply for a patent on an atomic chain 
reaction not for the money no the purpose was to ensure a safer 
and better world he was concerned about disasters that might 
occur if certain powers might attack this country 
he had learned from lindemann that only the military could keep 
a patent classified in britain szilard applied to the war office 
it turned him down he tried the admiralty with an accompanying 
letter from lindemann it was hardly alarmist or wholehearted 
even if the chances were a hundred to one against it 
lindemann wroteit seems to me it might be worth keeping the 
thing secret as it is not going to cost the government anything 
secrecy was alien to science where newfound knowledge is a 
torch passed from one lab experiment to another for the greater 
good of all as isaac newton said of the process he had been able 
to see so far only because i have stood on the shoulders of 
giants 
one such giant of physics between the world wars was enrico 
fermi an italian physicist of magnetic charm and such 
infallibility he was nicknamed the pope born in 1901 he had 
been engrossed in physics since adolescence when he bought two old 
books on the subject and read them through at once in latin an 
experimenter known for exquisite precision he could also adlib 
with what was on hand at one point using a goldfish pond to 
moderate neutrons he bombarded all the elements with 
uranium responded exotically resulting in a new element for 
which fermi won the 1938 nobel prize but he had seen so far and no 
further 
fermi took his family with him to stockholm to receive the 
prize they kept right on going to the united states laura fermi 
was jewish 
unwittingly the sinister antisemitism of mein kampf made 
an incalculable contribution to the development of the atomic bomb 
at a stroke hitlers aryan laws barring universities to jews 
reduced germanys physicists by a quarter szilard had fled germany 
and so had his countrymen edward teller and eugene wigner as the 
hungarian conspiracy they would be an instrumental trio in the 
crucial year of 1939

an austrian jew had forecast the diaspora the french would 
pray for the victims the british would organize their rescue and 
the americans would pay for it in the end the axis paid for the 
flight of jewish science from europe 
in denmark niels bohr a rugged theoretician who excelled at 
soccer and transcended in physics to become a national hero was a 
clearinghouse of atomic information as well as a haven for emigre 
jewish researchers 
one of those who escaped to copenhagen was a young physicist 
otto frisch his aunt lise meitner a chemist continued working 
at the kaiser wilhelm institute in berlin as an austrian she was 
not subject to hitlers aryan laws she was born in vienna in 1886 
and became only the second woman there to earn a doctorate she was 
accepted for further study at kwi on the proviso that as a woman 
she never show her face above her lab in the woodshop in the 
basement a pretty but shy young woman whose love in her life was 
science she accepted such exile 
she formed a long and close partnership with otto hahn also a 
chemist he was a handsome gregarious outdoorsman during world 
war i he had worked on the dark side of chemistry helping with 
germanys poison gas detachments he justified it as a means 
however murderous of saving more lives by shortening the war the 
thought was not original with wartime scientists then or later 
although they never even lunched together hahn and meitner were 
a close team talking over their work on the atoms mysteries on 
long walks walking having played an inordinate role in the atoms 
deciphering 
when hitlers troops marched into austria in 1938 meitner lost 
her immunity she hurriedly packed to leave for the netherlands in 
farewell hahn gave her a treasured diamond ring that had been his 
mothers i wanted her to be provided for in an emergency 
heinrich himmler head of the ss had closed the border to 
fleeing scholastics meitner tried to look composed as soldiers 
examined her passport 
i knew that the nazis had just declared open season on the 
jews that the hunt was on for 10 minutes i sat there and waited 
10 minutes that seemed like so many hours 
then the soldiers passed her over the border unaware they had 
let a genie out of a bottle 
back in berlin hahn continued bombarding uranium now with 
fritz strassmann in early december of 1938 hahn wrote meitner now 
in sweden that something most unusual had happened he and 
strassmann had found after one experiment that the uranium seemed 
to have divided into two isotopes of barium whose weight did not 
quite duplicate the weight of the original target although hahn 
had a good idea of what had happened he asked meitner for her 
thoughts and wished her a bearable christmas 
meitner was spending the holiday with friends near goteborg 
there she was joined by frisch whose father was still interned in 
the concentration camp at dachau following the antijewish pogrom 
of kristallnacht 
on christmas eve frisch wanted to go crosscountry skiing 
meitner said she would walk along frish feared she couldnt keep 
up oh yes she could meitner insisted she wanted to talk with 
frisch about hahns news frisch wanted to talk about a magnet he 
had designed 
finally we became absorbed in my problem she recalled 
they sat down on a log and began sketching with a piece of paper 
and a pencil meitner had in her purse she vividly remembered years 
ago hearing einstein lecture on his theory of relativity and how 
the e equals mc2 evolved 
she made the calculation of what the loss of weight in hahns 
two barium isotopes had been compared to the uranium in terms of 
einsteins formula the weight loss corresponded perfectly with the 
energy that would been produced 
hahn and strassmann had split an atom energy was released a 
new door had opened on the possibility of a chain reaction 
ironically only a few days before szilard now in the united 
states at the university of rochester had written the british 
admiralty asking it to withdraw his patent on a chain reaction the 
odds of it happening he explained had just about reached the 
vanishing point 
just after the new year meitner cautiously wrote hahn that 
perhaps such a heavy nucleus bursts 
on jan 3 1939 frisch back in copenhagen began outlining 
what the news from germany had been and his discussion about it 
with his aunt 
bohrs rapid mind raced ahead of his words 
oh what idiots we have been he said slapping his forehead 
this is just as it must be 
bohr was due to leave in four days for a stint at the institute 
for advanced study in princeton nj he asked that a blackboard be 
installed in his stateroom aboard the ship 
he had some noodling to do about atoms as he crossed the

move over machiavelli 
the current bible of playtowin strategists is no longer that 
16th century italian authors the prince but the much older 
writings of the chinese military tactician sun tzu assembled as 
the art of war 
sun tzus writings finally reached the western world in the late 
18th century and were reputedly followed by the soviet red army 
the japanese military vietnamese guerrilla leader ho chi minh and 
chinese revolutionary leader mao tsetung the works drew little 
attention in the united states until recent years but have been 
become increasingly popular for example 
republican party chairman lee atwater perhaps the most 
hardnosed political strategist of this decade is a devotee who 
reads the art of war before every campaign 
eastern airlines machinists union leader charles e bryan one 
of the airline industrys most powerful and most controversial 
labor heads this decade hands out copies of the sun tzu text to 
all his organizations general chairmen 
and in director oliver stones movie wall street 
oscarwinning actor michael douglas greed is good character 
gordon gekko advises his protege read sun tzu the art of 
war every battle is won before its fought think about it 
stone in los angeles finishing born on the fourth of july 
about the life of vietnam war doubleamputee ron kovic and his 
antiwar crusade said that while the art of war isnt yet 
widely read on wall street it was appropriate to the thinking of 
gekko ruthless yet accurate as did sun tzu gekko emphasized 
the importance of information and use of spies 
atwater who recently read the art of war for the 20thplus 
time on a flight from washington to san francisco calls the book 
the most succinct strategy document ever written 
everything in it you can relate to my profession you can 
relate to the campaign atwater says every time i read it i 
am reminded of something very important 
some scholars consider the art of war common sense put on 
paper and dont quite understand its current popularity 
it was always around and i personally find it to be a 
collection of little aphorisms says june dreyer a university of 
miami professor of political science and a student of chinese 
military history for example he says know your enemy and know 
yourself i think every ghetto kid in chicago is thinking that 
before he gets into a fight 
dreyer suspects that one of the reasons the book is so popular 
is that theres a certain panache to quoting an ancient chinese 
author 
sun tzus emphasis on the aspects of psychology 
informationgathering deception planning and limiting casualties 
are applied to many cases by his students history they point out 
is full of examples of how leaders failed to follow the basic rules 
of sun tzu 
james clavell the author and screenplay writer who has studied 
chinese and japanese military thought wrote in a foreword to one 
of the english translations 
i truly believe that if our military and political leaders in 
recent times had studied this work of genius vietnam could not 
have happened as it happened 
we would not have lost the war in korea we lost because we 
did not achieve victory the bay ofpigs could not have occurred 
the hostage fiasco in iran would not have come to pass the british 
empire would not have been dismembered and in all probability 
world wars i and ii would have been avoided certainly they would 
not have been waged as they were waged and the millions of youths 
obliterated unnecessarily and stupidly by monsters calling 
themselves generals would have lived out their lives 
little is known about the personal background of sun tzu an 
adviser and general for chinese warlords scholars have differed on 
when he wrote his guide to warfare with some saying the seventh 
century bc and others saying the third century and some have 
argued that he never existed at all and that the art of war is 
a compilation 
sun tzu wrote that moral law belief in the cause and in the 
leaders is crucial to victory as is command discipline the 
object is not to devastate the enemy but to win with as little 
actual engagement as possible he wrote 
among his teachings 
to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme 
excellence supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemys 
resistance without fighting

all warfare is based on deception 
in war numbers alone confer no advantage do not advance 
relying on sheer military power 
while we have heard of blundering swiftness in war we have 
not yet seen a clever operation that was prolonged 
war is a matter of vital importance to the state it is 
mandatory that it be thoroughly studied 
if you know your enemy and know yourself you need not fear 
the result of a hundred battles 
a desire to know his foe led bryan the union leader to the 
art of war some 10 years ago 
there was a rumor that management was using that book said 
bryan who bought copies for himself and his union leadership 
its mostly lessons more on understanding and anticipating 
the strategy of an adversary and being prepared to deal with it 
said bryan who in 1983 took his union to the brink of a strike 
before management gave in with a favorable contract in 1986 he was 
blamed by eastern officials for forcing the sale of eastern to 
texas air corp and this year he led the strike against eastern 
that began march 4 
bryan emphasizes gathering information about the company and 
management and usually keeps his strategy as secret as possible 
both sun tzutype attributes the strategies of bryan also based 
on personal philosophical and religious beliefs have come under 
fire as texas air chairman frank lorenzo follows a plan to rebuild 
eastern without its unions 
atwater who first read the art of war while a university of 
south carolina graduate student read it again this summer and 
savored how sun tzus guidelines had been followed in the 1988 
presidential campaign 
he talks in there repeatedly about keeping your own group 
united atwater says one of the driving things of the bush 
campaign was keeping united 
atwater says the importance of laying out a strategy and 
sticking to it as taught by sun tzu was demonstrated in the super 
tuesday strategy in which bush effectively locked up the republican 
nomination with his domination of the south the plan to use the 
south to defeat bushs opponents had been planned for three years 
atwater says 
one of atwaters favorite sun tzuisms is when you get into 
the mind of your opponent you can move it 
asked about deception and other sun tzu tactics atwater 
chuckles youll have to get someone else to make observations on 
that 
atwater also read and was influenced by machiavelli best known 
for advising the powerful that the end justifies the means in 
gaining and maintaining power 
i think sun tzu is a highly refined version of the prince 
atwater says 
the art of war can be found these days in us military 
study libraries and is on a suggested reading list the us marine 
corps compiled this year 
marine lt col fred peck says sun tzus writings contrast in 
approach to another highly recommended war strategy work on 
war by the 19th century prussian military author karl von 
clausewitz clausewitzs teachings contained in 10 to 12 volumes 
also combine social political and personal factors with military 
strategy 
clausewitz presents his theories at extreme length and in 
excruciating detail peck says 
sun tzu wrote his book as a primer for warlords its got a 
lot of pithy little advice a lot lighter reading 
samuel b griffith a retired marine brigadier general who 
translated and published sun tzu three decades ago after writing 
about chinas civil war wrote that the art of war should be 
required reading for those who hope to gain a further 
understanding of the grand strategy of both the soviet and the 
chinese leadership 
however ms dreyer says the current chinese leadership 
apparently doesnt follow sun tzu their bloody quelling of the 
summers student protests goes against the art of war 
philosophy that says the government must serve the peoples 
interest and maintain national unity 
the chinese militarys handling of the students she says was 
not sun tzu

music is mere vibration in the air and 
difficult to get your hands on but there are a lot of dollars in 
music and a special kind of private cop is out there to make sure 
the artists and composers get their share 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
no sirens no flashing lights no guns 
or billy clubs just a notebook and a pen and an ear for popular 
music these are the jukebox police 
they are undercover spies actually private citizens backed by 
civil law their duty is to find people who make money from music 
without paying rights fees to the artists and composers some 
people dont take them seriously until they find themselves in 
court being sued for thousands of dollars 
they think youre kidding says andy kropelak an 
exschoolteacher who patrols west virginia and western pennsylvania 
for broadcast music inc its not a joke its not a scam 
bmi and the american society of composers artists and 
publishers are the principal enforcers of music copyright laws the 
organizations collect license fees from establishments that use 
music in nearly every form whether it be a bar a bank or a 
brothel 
they are not only the jukebox police they are the licensers 
of music throughout an area says jonathan zavin a private 
lawyer for bmi 
if it werent for bmi or ascap every bar and restaurant would 
have to contact each songwriter individually to get permission to 
play his music kropelak says 
for jukeboxes the us copyright office collects 63 for 
registrations and splits the money among the composers and 
publishers agencies in addition to its field representatives bmi 
uses a network of people who log the songs they hear played on the 
ubiquitous jukeboxes 
with 50 or so field men whatever they can do is a drop in the 
bucket says ted chapin a lawyer for bmi in new york every 
city town and street corner has somebody using music its a 
question of having enough hands and feet to get there 
one logger hit joeys bar and grill in charleston wva last 
year after a steppenwolf fan dropped a few quarters in the jukebox 
and played born to be wild and magic carpet ride a 
countryandwestern fan punched divorce and rocky top 
and a nostalgic soul played heartbreak hotel and wipeout 
unknown to owner joseph minardi the bmi logger made a playlist 
that became the basis for a federal court lawsuit minardi settled 
out of court for 12000 in damages and attorneys fees even though 
he only leased the machine from a man who kept half the profits 
i didnt have any idea that a license was supposed to be on 
it minardi says he made no mention that there had to be a 
license on it 
minardi now has a current license for a new machine he purchased 
himself a fully authorized version of she drives me crazy by 
fine young cannibals was playing 
when i bought my own jukebox they sent me information saying 
this machine had to be registered with bmi and all that he says 
that was the first id heard of it 
the suit was based on songs played before minardi obtained his 
license he says he forwarded ceaseanddesist requests to the 
owner of the jukebox who has since died 
bmi files up to 200 suits a year against bars restaurants and 
nightclubs generally seeking between 500 and 1000 for each song 
title heard 
four years ago ric ocasek from the cars bruce springsteen and 
prince took matters into their own hands filing suit together to 
stop a southern west virginia bar from playing their music 
illegally 
we try to call and write and see them chapin says the 
suit is only the last resort were not in the business of filing 
suit were in the business of licensing music 
like minardi most violators succumb quietly agreeing to pay 
bmi a few thousand dollars for past violations and agreeing to 
purchase the 63 jukebox license 
kropelak says he has often had trouble in west virginia and his 
boss bmi general licensing vice president tom annastas says its 
because many people resent being asked to pay for what they already 
consider theirs 
weve had our field representatives roughed up whenever you 
go in some place and tell someone they have to pay for something 
they dont feel they should have to pay for they resent that 
annastas says 
theyve bought the disc jockey theyve bought the record or 
bought the tape and you go in there and tell them they have to pay 
something else 
for that reason bmi loggers ask to remain anonymous for fear 
bar owners will retaliate 
if they would just take care of business i wouldnt have to 
worry about it says the logger who busted joeys it should 
never reach that point 
the joeys logger was a local musician who was upset that some 
people would use music for free bmi officials say they look for 
other musicians to make the job as easy as possible 
the first criteria is their knowledge of music and their 
ability to recognize music whether it be in a drugstore a 
nightclub or a skating rink siebel says its one thing tohe issue 
the issue is is industry willing to invest to make 
it a good neighbor 
lusk cited columbia falls aluminum co as a business that has 
done just that by installing new equipment to reduce emissions that 
were blamed for killing trees and slowing tree growth in the area 
but others believe a balance of development cannot or should 
not be struck 
this area is not appropriate for many reasons for 
aesthetics for wildlife for destroying the qualities of why 
people want to come here or live here says john frederick of the 
north fork preservation assocation which filed legal challenges to 
both cenex wells proposed in the area 
frederick lives in polebridge a tiny community five miles north 
of the well site the preservation group he heads also has opposed 
the british columbia coal mine some subdivision efforts and 
proposals to pave the dirt road that leads to polebridge 
people dont come up here to see oil wells frederick said 
another environmental group has targeted development in an area 
just southeast of the park where two companies have proposed 
drilling test wells for oil and gas 
the proposals by chevron and american petrofina have been 
delayed however while the lewis and clark national forest 
prepares an environmental impact statement 
the wells are proposed in the badgertwo medicine region a 
110000acre roadless area located just south of the park and near 
two wilderness areas 
the badgertwo medicine alliance seeking wilderness designation 
for the area has fought the drilling proposals alliance president 
lou bruno feels development would damage the area severely 
but oil and gas industry officials maintain that development can 
occur with little effect on the environment 
keating noted that cenex planned a number of precautions at its 
well site including measures to keep wildlife away from the site 
and to protect the quality of surface water drilling also would be 
limited to certain times of the year to avoid periods of eagle 
nesting and animal migration 
historically there are producing wells on college campuses 
downtown business districts in back yards he says they can 
be made almost totally compatible with almost any environment

the poles of prolife and prochoice in the 
abortion debate seem ever farther apart here is a group of women 
who have based a womens help center on the biblical quotation from 
jeremiah rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be 
comforted because her children are no more 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the aftermath of the florida legislatures 
defeat of efforts to tighten abortion regulations the battle 
continues 
in this city for instance there is a volunteer group called 
the sisters of rachel that seeks to help women out of the trauma of 
abortion and there are experts who deny abortion produces 
longterm emotional pain 
the sisters of rachel have a counseling center where they teach 
women to cry to blame and to forgive especially themselves 
theres so many women out there hurting like we were says 
linda gardner a cofounder of the sisters this is a place they 
can come and let all that grief come out 
gardner says she didnt begin to deal emotionally with her 
abortion until nearly 10 years later 
judy rivenbark who operates the tampa womens health center 
doesnt think women suffer guilt pains after abortion 
i have worked in abortion for many many years rivenbark 
says most women have come to terms with their decision by the 
time its made i do not believe in this postabortion syndrome 
afterward i dont see a lot of depression tears or guilt i see a 
lot of relief 
the health center performs abortions twice a week in 
hillsborough county where there were 5577 abortions last year 
there were 62539 in florida 
elaine tennant of the sisters of rachel says she had to overcome 
the guilt of her own abortions it catches up sooner or later 
i wouldnt let anybody get close to me says tennant 28 
i didnt tell anybody about my pregnancies i began to feel it 
was my closet secret i was a bitter person not once but twice 
she had abortions when she was 17 and 21 it wasnt until four 
years after her second abortion that she first saw pictures of 
fetal development 
a baby at 1112 weeks was fully formed with everything 
functioning a heartbeat a nervous system i freaked out it was 
the first time i really sobbed over what i had done 
gardner tennant and pat layton founded the sisters of rachel 
four years ago and since have counseled more than 170 women it has 
no relationship to the roman catholic rachel society which also 
counsels women and tries to persuade them to carry their 
pregnancies to term 
the reasons women decide to abort are as varied as the women 
says rivenbark of the tampa womens health center they come here 
for financial reasons too many children alcohol or drugs spousal 
abuse illness fetal abnormalities and lack of education about 
birth control 
ninety percent of the abortions are performed in the first 
trimester rivenbark says at eight weeks theres nothing there 
it looks like a cloud she says 
in january the founders of the sisters of rachel also started 
the north tampa crisis pregnancy center where they offer free 
pregnancy tests and information on alternatives to abortion clinics 
in this program we want to tell women what it is all about 
give them the facts the options and let them make an informed 
decision says the 35yearold layton 
we try to sway them not to abort says gardner 29 
for seven months they went to seminars read took counseling 
courses drew on their own experiences then devised a format 
what developed was a postabortion syndrome support group that 
meets once a week for six to eight weeks today they get referrals 
from psychologists the womens center a hot line area 
universities and others who have been through the program

the first night in small groups of five or six the women sit 
around and talk about their abortions a lot of them come in 
terrified because theyve never told anyone some come because they 
cant handle the pressure anymore were their last resort says 
tennant 
usually its a night of crying adds layton they admit 
their secret 
gardner was probably past three months in her pregnancy when she 
had an abortion at age 17 my selfworth was zero she says 
there were six of us in a group at the clinic i remember 
thinking we were like cows 
everyone was crying i sobbed uncontrollably when they asked 
me afterward how i felt i said i think i just killed my baby 
but i was so relieved it was over that i wasnt pregnant anymore 
i went on with life 
i became real promiscuous married six months later had a 
child right away to make up for it then i divorced went back to 
promiscuity and got into alcohol and drugs 
she went on for four years before deciding as a single parent 
she had to do something else she got a real estate license and 
sold houses figuring it would make her happy and rich and put her 
around people who didnt do drugs 
this wasnt it either gardner said then she met her 
husband he was a christian i told him about the abortion and he 
accepted me 
when she was three months pregnant with their child she had a 
sonogram i couldnt believe it i had never looked at fetal 
development this was the same point at which i had had my 
abortion it was a good negative it was clear this was a baby 
even after she delivered her second child gardner said the 
abortion still troubled her she talked to a woman at church 
i unleashed everything that had happened over the past 10 
years i had been running from this bad person says gardner now 
a mother of three 
the first night at the center is informal and flexible 
were just there to lead them through it sometimes when the 
hurt is so deep it takes longer says tennant it takes a lot 
out of you to deal with people in such a state some are suicidal 
weve had some who had abortions three weeks earlier and their 
bodies havent even healed yet once we had a woman who had a 
backalley abortion 30 years ago and was still carrying around the 
guilt 
finally there is a night for grieving and making peace 
if problems remain the women are referred to outside counseling 
out of the sisters of rachel grew the crisis pregnancy program 
where they have counseled 70 women this year 
three women who visited thinking of having abortions changed 
their minds even if one ends positively its worth it says 
gardner 
if they want to look into adoptions we hook them up with an 
attorney if they want to keep the baby but cant afford it we 
help them find help says tennant 
while abortions at the tampa health clinic run between 280 and 
850 they can run up to 1500 for more advanced pregnancies 
rivenbark says 
the tampa center does abortions up to 179 weeks of pregnancy 
after that women are referred to the st petersburg center for 
twoday procedures rivenbark says doctors wont accept women 
further along than 205 weeks 
a woman is asked if she has considered options and told of the 
surgical risk from infection to an emergency surgery 
if a girl is unsure or doesnt want the abortion and is being 
pushed by a boyfriend or parents we give referrals rivenbark 
says 
outside her clinic a lone picket parades silently on the 
sidewalk wearing a fourfoot sign it reads lord jesus forgive 
our nation

in the early decades of the century it was the 
gathering place of artists and writers bon vivants and aspiring 
models american expatriates and russian political exiles 
montparnasse on the left bank of the seine river in paris was a 
neighborhood of remarkable creativity and unflagging revelry today 
it is the site a cult art form in france 
but it is paris lone skyscraper the sleek montparnasse tower 
that is perhaps the clearest symbol of a new age 
now there are just one or two painters its not like 
before says aime duhauvel a house painter who for 51 years 
lived at 8 rue de la grande chaumiere where modigliani had his 
atelier 
duhauvel forced out of his apartment by high prices in 1984 
returns daily to chat with his friend the local shoemaker 
ms goddard who has lived on the isle of wight since 1935 says 
she ran away to escape what was becoming the incestuous 
smallness of the quarter 
the gentrification of montparnasse was inevitable says billy 
kluver the artists create the community and the real estate 
people move in 
for kluver who spent 10 years gathering documentation for his 
book the spirit of montparnasse is dead 
not everyone agrees 
this neighborhood inspires me says alice mouradian a 
clothes designer who lives two doors from hemingways former paris 
abode each building here possesses a soul 
mrs kowalezyk says her clients at wadja are the same as before 
just younger for us things havent changed she says its 
difficult with our prices but people still need to eat 
to make a long story short kluver quotes kikis memoirs 
montparnasse is a village thats as round as a circus you get 
into it and you dont know just how but getting out again is not 
so easy 
kiki simply burned herself out says kluver collapsing and 
dying at age 52 not far from the boulevard

before taking the role as a teenage doctor 
on abcs doogie howser md neil patrick harris talked to 
some real physicians they laughed at the premise but still gave 
him advice 
i didnt find any teenage doctors when i did some research 
he says most prodigies are in the arts but its possible that a 
young person could become a doctor there are no age limits 
harris sees doogie howser as a normal kid who just happens to be 
a doctor 
the roles purposely written to have all the qualities any kid 
would have he says 
doogie is a prodigy who graduated from princeton at the age of 
10 from medical school at 14 and now at 16 is a hospital 
resident he can perform surgery but hes just old enough to get a 
drivers license 
the contrast is between him being a normal kid and being a 
doctor says harris most of the humor comes from his age 
women say they dont want a 16yearold kid examining them in the 
pilot an adult attorney whined when i sewed up his rear and 
threatened to sue me but doogie with his intellect and savvy gets 
out of it 
doogies an only child and his parents try to treat him as 
much like a normal teenager as possible they realize hes a 
genius and a doctor and that makes it more complicated he told his 
mother the facts of life when he was 3 years old 
doogie howser md is the first show from steven bochco in 
his multiseries deal with abc bochco whose past cocreations 
were hill street blues and la law wrote the comedy with 
david e kelley the show has been successful in the ratings 
although not a major hit 
the series also stars james b sikking and belinda montgomery as 
doogies parents lawrence pressman as the hospital chief of 
services and max casella as his teenage buddy 
taking time away from the set harris is interviewed in the 
building 20th century fox has built for bochco sitting on a bench 
in an open atriumlike area 
like his character harris is 16 and attempts to lead a normal 
life while showing his own genius for acting before beginning the 
series he lived in albuquerque nm and attended school there 
between movies his parents who are both attorneys have moved 
temporarily to los angeles 
most recently harris starred with faye dunaway and richard 
widmark in cold sassy tree a turnofthecentury drama on 
turner network television last season he was in the hall of fame 
production home fires burning and leave her to heaven he 
was in the feature film claras heart with whoopi goldberg 
hes also had several guest roles in series including a role as a 
child evangelist who was beginning to stray toward evil on bl 
stryker with burt reynolds 
harris auditioned for the role of doogie howser about the time 
he was doing home fires burning 
there were four of us up for the role he says they 
narrowed it down to three before it worked out that i got it i 
talked to steven before he wrote the script 
i thought it was a great concept its neat to have a series 
based on a child with the wonder years adults can look back and 
say yes i remember when that happened to me here were in the 
present and people can say yes i remember my first kiss but it 
suddenly changes hes a doctor still there are things you can 
relate to 
the shows a mixture of comedy and serious subjects lots of 
times doogie wants to lash out at adults who treat him as a child 
when hes smarter than they are 
harris is a junior in high school this year and hopes to go on 
to yale or new york university or the university of southern 
california but not to study medicine which he says is too hard 
and takes too many hours 
i want to make the transition to adult actor he says 
thats a real barrier i dont want to be typecast as a certain 
character i think some child actors get typecast with their hair 
slicked back or as a nerd or like the fonz 
harris began acting at the age of 6 when he accompanied his 
brother brian to a school audition for the wizard of oz he 
played toto 
i was doing magic even before that he says sleight of 
hand illusions producing things out of nowhere you name it i 
want to take magic as far as i can its a great hobby i dont 
think ill do it professionally there are no schools the best way 
to get into magic is to study with someone as an apprentice 
but dont be surprised if doogie puts on a magic show for sick 
kids at the hospital

it requires a special talent to take an obscure 
wedding dance by edvard grieg and turn it into a hit parade smash 
like strange music or transform the exotic themes of borodin 
into songs like stranger in paradise and baubles bangles and 
beads 
for much of their careers george forrest and robert wright have 
used that talent adapting someone elses music usually a 
classical composer and spinning it into something new 
they did it in hollywood working on dozens of films like 
maytime sweethearts and i married an angel and on 
broadway with shows like song of norway magdalena and 
kismet 
writing original music is 10 or 20 times easier than the 
things for which we are best known wright was saying the other 
day the first thing you have to do as an adapter is learn 
everything a composer ever wrote then you have to assemble and 
assimilate the music and finally think the way he did 
at 75 wright is the talkative member of the songwriting team 
forrest one year younger nods in agreement their partnership has 
lasted some 60 years it began at miami senior high school where 
they wrote their first song hail to miami high and has 
continued into the present their latest musical grand hotel 
currently is on view at the martin beck theater 
grand hotel directed and choreographed by tommy tune 
focuses on the guests at a large luxury hotel in berlin its based 
on the 1920s bestselling vicki baum novel that later became a 
successful movie starring greta garbo and john barrymore 
the musical using an original wright and forrest score takes 
place in 1928 a year its composer and lyricist remember very well 
we were both working musicians by that time wright says 
i had won an amateur contest playing the rachmaninoff c sharp 
minor prelude when i was 9 and went into vaudeville i found out 
very young that there was money in music so i never touched the 
piano unless i was paid 
i played for helen morgan leonard rose and sally rand all in 
the same year i think it was 1933 
two years later at ages 21 and 20 wright and forrest went to 
hollywood and found work at metrogoldwynmayer inc the studio 
associated with the classiest of the movie musicals they were 
signed to write original music and lyrics but the team found 
little work until a disaster nearly derailed a film version of 
sigmund rombergs maytime starring nelson eddy and jeanette 
macdonald 
irving thalberg the legendary producer died with only half the 
film musical completed a new director started over and wright and 
forrest were assigned to come up with new musical material much of 
it was taken from music already in the public domain pieces like 
tchaikovskys fifth symphony and pieces of operas the movie 
was a big success and wright and forrest stayed in hollywood for 
seven years participating in some 50 movies often anonymously 
we worked on anything they asked wright says youre 
slaves in hollywood very happy slaves but they owned us body and 
soul we always did our very best and worked as artistically as we 
possibly could 
finally they quit herbert stothart mgms famous musical 
director and their mentor told them theyll keep you forever 
people will never know who you are 
before they left they wrote a small musical revue called thank 
you columbus that opened and closed in los angeles but 
through it they met producer edwin lester who vowed to put on 
their next show 
once you write anything for the stage and you put it in front 
of an audience and you hear them react then the movies become very 
dreary and dull wright says 
the team traveled to new york to write for cabaret nightclubs 
and radio the work included special club material for performers 
like jimmy durante ella logan sophie tucker joe e lewis jane 
froman and carmen miranda 
lester reappeared in their lives in 1944 with an idea for a 
stage musical based on the life of edvard grieg using the 
composers own melodies the idea became song of norway it was 
a big success for lester in california and he brought it to new 
york where it ran for over two years 
lester also was responsible for kismet the teams other big 
new york hit this musical a sort of broadway meets the arabian 
nights won them a tony award in 1954 besides stranger in 
paradise and baubles bangles and beads the songs included 
this is my beloved and rhymes have i 
the musical version of grand hotel has had a 20year 
history it began in 1958 with luther davis who adapted the book 
for the great yiddish comedian menasha skulnik it was called at 
the grand 
but by th time the musical went into production it starred paul 
muni and joan diener muni got sick and the musical never got 
beyond tryouts in los angeles and san francisco 
two years ago davis resurrected the idea and took it to wright 
and forrest 
he told them i would like to start all over again and really 
do vicki baums novel wright recalls our other version was 
set in rome and was about movies and opera we went back to the 
original 
wright and forrest began reworking their score and davis 
extensively revised the book 
the most important part of a musical is the book not the 
music and lyrics wright says once the book tells a story that 
is interesting then the music and lyrics have something to say up 
until then they are just songs 
the book is more important because most of the critics are 
literary critics they are not music critics forrest adds 
what they criticize is the book

president corazon aquino of the philippines 
visits the united states this week in hopes of attracting more 
trade and investment to her country and improving conditions for 
her 60 million people here is a report on the state of the nation 
she has led since 1986 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
nearly four years ago corazon aquino 
stood before television cameras and proclaimed that a dark night 
of tyranny had come to an end in the philippines 
ferdinand e marcos and his wife imelda had been driven into 
exile in hawaii by the people power revolution that brought 
mrs aquino to power 
the night of tyranny she referred to in taking her oath as 
president on feb 25 1986 may have ended but poverty 
insurgency crime and social inequities remain 
mrs aquino arrives in the united states on tuesday after 
visiting canada in search of more trade and investment in the 
philippines to cope with those problems at home from vancouver 
toronto and ottawa in canada she is scheduled to visit new york 
washington for a meeting with president bush and dallas before 
heading home via either los angeles or san francisco shell confer 
with businessmen in new york and dallas 
but the struggle to deal with economic problems armed 
insurgencies and coup attempts has sapped the euphoria and 
political vitality that in 1986 drove marcos to hawaii where he 
died sept 22 at the age of 72 and vaulted mrs aquino to the 
office that many thought should have been her husbands 
it was the assassination of the husband sen benigno aquino 
jr on aug 21 1983 that set off the chain of events that led to 
the people power revolution in the philippines 
aquino who had been imprisoned by marcos for seven years before 
being allowed to leave for exile in the united states was 
returning home that august day to challenge marcos he was shot to 
death as he stepped off a plane at manilas airport 
but today in corazon aquinos philippines a feeling persists 
that nothing has changed since the marcos years 
recently the social weather stations polling service said only 
35 percent of 300 manilans surveyed were satisfied with mrs 
aquino down from a high of 77 percent two years ago 
there is a growing number of people who are dissatisfied with 
her said rev joaquin bernas president of ateneo university and 
an aquino supporter satisfaction is going down steadily halfway 
in her fourth year she has not rebounded 
inflation today is 12 percent allegations of corruption abound 
cardinal jaime l sin the roman catholic archbishop and the 
nations leading churchman often comments that filipinos rid 
themselves of ali baba but the 40 thieves remain by ali baba 
he means marcos 
because of poverty and lack of education people end up being 
victims of injustice said luis villafuerte chairman of the 
governors league of the philippines if you cannot improve that 
situation you can say you have a democracy you have elections 
you have a congress but it means nothing to people who are poor 
and suffering 
human rights abuses continue as do killings by communist 
insurgents the killings include the assassination in april of col 
james rowe of the us army and the slayings of two other americans 
in september 
ordinary filipinos are threatened by rising crime much of it 
committed by police and soldiers including car thefts murders and 
bank robberies police say the crime rate has increased by 65 
percent since mrs aquino took office 
for the first six months of this year the monthly crime index 
stood at 2017 incidents per 100000 people more than 15 percent 
of the nations 72730 recorded crimes occurred in greater manila 
the social weather stations survey said 25 percent of the 300 
manila residents polled reported they had been victims of crime 
but no groundswell of opposition appears to be building against 
mrs aquino known affectionately as cory 
attempts by the left and right to organize huge street 
demonstrations have largely fizzled filipinos appear more 
concerned with the struggle for a decent living 
but there is a feeling mrs aquino might be missing a historic 
opportunity to transform the philippines into a model of 
progressive asian democracy 
mrs aquino can point to significant accomplishments she has 
restored democratic institutions unshackled the press and held 
back communist and moslem insurgents 
the economy has grown steadily and is expected to increase by 
about 6 percent this year but economic gains have mostly 
benefitted upper middle class entrepreneurs with little filtering 
down to the masses 
government figures indicate the lowest third of society controls 
only 9 percent of the national income virtually the same as under 
marcos millions subsist on incomes barely adequate for food and 
lodging

among those millions is aurora mendoza who supports an 
unemployed husband and two children on a monthly salary of 1543 
pesos 7350 as a clerk in the education department 
her expenses average about 2925 pesos 13930 a month she 
said she makes up the difference by borrowing money from 
colleagues others like her supplement their salaries by selling 
homegrown foods or other items to fellow office workers 
in manila wealthy filipinos live in spacious homes in plush 
wellguarded villages but government figures indicate that 
filipinos in 25 of the 73 provinces receive few state services 
in sulu a largely moslem province 600 miles south of manila 
133 of every 1000 infants die before their first birthday life 
expectancy for males in basilan province is 529 years 10 years 
years below the national average 
there is always the expectation of better things mrs 
aquino said in a recent interview with the associated press and 
there have been better things but i suppose what people would like 
is for all these good things to happen yesterday 
mrs aquino who is americaneducated and a member of a wealthy 
family did not set out to recast philippine society but to restore 
the institutions that the marcos years had destroyed or corrupted 
hers was to be an institutional revolution the success or 
failure of which would show whether usstyle democracy can work 
in a poor country 
but those values were imposed on an asian society in which 
family ties paternalism and respect for authority sometimes lead 
to nepotism corruption and entrenched warlord families 
longtime colonial domination first by spaniards then by 
americans established a tradition of armed struggle such as the 
20yearold communist insurgency and the moslem revolt that flares 
and subsides 
colonialism also produced a class of landed elite which 
prospered through war revolution dictatorship and democracy many 
of the old families the laurels the lopezes the cojuangcos the 
aquinos were at the forefront of the antimarcos campaign 
early in her administration mrs aquino tried to pursue 
reformist goals her fledgling steps faltered with the rise of 
military influence and the reemergence of powerful political clans 
mrs aquino freed 300 political prisoners and offered peace 
talks to communist and moslem rebels her first human rights 
commissioner the late jose diokno promised to prosecute soldiers 
for human rights abuses committed under marcos 
the peace talks with the rebels failed but the overtures and 
the threat of prosecution alarmed the military setting the stage 
for the six coup attempts against mrs aquino 
the coups failed because of the loyalty of gen fidel ramos the 
chief of staff and now the defense secretary but military 
influence increased and most liberals were dropped from mrs 
aquinos cabinet talk of human rights trials and reconciliation 
with rebels ended 
early in her administration mrs aquino fired all officials 
elected under marcos and appointed officersincharge that led 
to turmoil in local administrations and a rift in the ruling 
coalition after factions claimed they were shortchanged in 
appointments 
to end the turmoil mrs aquinos allies struck agreements with 
many former marcos supporters in the may 1987 congressional 
elections and the regional balloting in january 1988 
that enabled representatives of more than 30 warlord 
families to regain power 
the influence of traditional politicians in congress slowed 
reform land reform languished in congress nearly a year before 
emerging with so many prolandlord loopholes that the agrarian 
reform secretary miriam defensor santiago fears it will be 
unworkable

after winning a battle to ban ivory 
conservationists now face allout war rescuing a vast range of 
animal and plant species far less imposing than the elephant 
at stake are fastrising wildlife exports worth more than 130 
billion a year on the worlds retail markets according to 
specialists 
twothirds of the trade is legal defended by wellorganized 
associations and by governments the rest is contraband via 
networks of poachers and smugglers often involved in drugs or arms 
as well 
while sympathy can be whipped up over rhinos and leopards less 
noble life forms suffer unnoticed environmentalists say 
at a recent united nations meeting in which elephants dominated 
discussions lonely lobbyists pleaded for a delicate flower the 
turkish snowdrop which is exported by the millions with unknown 
implications 
scientists warn that unless they can assemble more data and 
muster public opinion valuable species will plummet toward 
extinction during the coming decade 
we have very little idea of the size of many populations 
said david western a kenyan biologist who is the director of 
research for wildlife conservation international in new york it 
is a critical problem 
when guyanas caimans came up at the un meeting guyanese 
authorities had to admit they had no idea how many of the scarce 
crocodilians still lived along their rivers 
the beautiful brilliant green manus tree snail prized among 
mollusk fans is earning badly needed revenue for papuanew guinea 
but no one knows how many can be safely sold 
most countries just dont have the resources to find out what 
they have said western 
the 103nation convention on international trade in endangered 
species which adopted the ivory ban regulates trade but its 
small staff relies on outside data and enforcement 
if experts cannot agree that a species belongs on the 
endangered list it is regarded as threatened and may be 
traded under license 
when a species is listed as threatened prices soar said 
craig van note of monitor consortium a washingtonbased network of 
us and international environmental groups 
everything that starts on the threatened list ends up 
endangered he said vested interests push trade for all its 
worth this is big money and we are finding the same mafias that 
handle drugs also dealing in wildlife 
until enough scientific evidence is gathered species are not on 
either list and trade is determined mainly by the open market 
about 350 million tropical fish were sold last year causing 
unknown depletions in 14 years france alone imported 1 billion 
frog legs from south asia 
we desperately need more data said ginette hemley us 
head of traffic a monitoring agency supported by the world 
wildlife fund we have to raise major money the onus is on us 
she noted burgeoning demands for wildlife products in newly 
affluent nations 
its booming in asia and consumption is increasing 
everywhere she said the trend is just beginning 
one asian nation thailand has been branded by wildlife groups 
as one of the worlds worst exploiters of wildlife 
unless ways can be found to bring exports into line with species 
populations conservationists will have to push for a total ban on 
trade within five years ms hemley said 
traffic focuses on 30 species mostly reptiles and birds which 
are particularly endangered smugglers are increasingly cunning 
with substantial resources for bribery and subterfuge 
in the united states fish and wildlife service agents found 
35 million worth of narcotics last year during searches that 
included heroin in condoms stuffed into banned snakes and cocaine 
stashed in polar bear hides 
the international union for the conservation of nature and 
specialist teams keep tabs on wildlife but arguments can be heated 
when export earnings are at risk 
counting small fish in big ponds or rare birds in remote 
forests involves substantial guesswork in some countries local 
authorities accept bribes to skew data wildlife experts say 
even with the obtrusive african elephant tracked from the air 
and on the ground by experienced scientists wide discord persists 
over census estimates 
the accepted figure is 625000 the findings of a recent 
extensive survey iain douglashamilton of kenya an experienced 
counter who took part in the survey prefers 609000 
some specialists in zimbabwe and south africa who fought hard 
against an ivory ban to allow culling from their controlled herds 
put the number near a million 
but pierre pfeffer of the museum of natural history in paris 
who has surveyed central african forests puts the total at 
400000 he says east african experts overestimate forest herds 
conservationists acknowledge the ivory victory was easier 
because the elephant falls into what they call the spottedcat 
category most vulnerable species are in the rhino category 
ivory like spotted cat fur is valued for its visibility and 
can be driven out of fashion with negative publicity rhino horn 
however is valuable when ground up into unrecognizable powder 
only experts recognize many rare birds reptiles and fish and 
consumers continue to buy them primates sold for research are not 
vulnerable to fashion trends 
scientists say curbing harmful trade is especially important now 
because wildlife is under serious threat from habitat destruction 
in most of parts of the world 
the world resources institute along with the un environment 
program and the world conservation union launched a major campaign 
to preserve biodiversity the vital interplay of species in nature 
onefourth of the worlds plants and animals face extinction 
within 25 to 50 years if losses continue at the present rate the 
institute said 
the impact of such losses on human wellbeing is potentially 
devastating said the institutes president james gustave speth 
no longer is it acceptable to merely slow the rate of 
destruction 
but conservationists contend international mechanisms are far 
too lax to control trade 
in one recent case british police arrested a notorious smuggler 
known as the raider of the orchid he served six weeks in jail 
and paid a fine of 4200 
new scientist magazine said of the case dealers in rare 
plants must be laughing all the way back to the jungle and the 
cause of conservation has been set back decades 
at the recent endangered species meeting environmentalist 
groups accused secretarygeneral eugene lapointe of conflict of 
interest for financing cites ivory unit with contributions from 
ivory traders 
earlier van note testified in the us congress that cites was 
failing in its mission because of underfunding inadequate 
staffing and poor management 
lapointe denied any wrongdoing but agreed cites was hamstrung by 
scant resources and faulty data from some member governments 
infraction reports catalog widespread flouting of international 
guidelines 
opening the cites session oct 9 prince bernhard of the 
netherlands a founder of the world wildlife fund criticized 
global efforts to control trade 
he won applause by declaring if there is any doubt on any 
issue you must give the benefit of the doubt to the survival of 
the species dont forget once a species has gone it has gone 
forever

wildlife groups say thailand is 
decimating its own once teeming species and those of other nations 
through bearfeast tours for koreans caiman skin smuggling and the 
polish connection 
the swissbased world wildlife fund for nature and other 
environmental groups cite numerous examples of wanton destruction 
south koreans fly to thailand on organized tours to feast on 
bear meat which they believe enhances vigor and strength 
according to phisit na phattlung the wildlife funds head in 
thailand 
thailand was the major link in an operation to illegally 
smuggle about 120000 skins of south american caiman alligators to 
japan last year 
the international primate protection league charges that thai 
traders fake permits to send whitehanded gibbons and other 
protected species to zoos in poland lacking funds the poles 
obtain the animals on credit keep about a third of them and sell 
the rest to western zoos 
the wildlife fund has recently singled out thailand and three 
other nations indonesia spain and argentina as blatant 
violators of the convention on international trade in endangered 
species of wild fauna and flora thailand is a party to the 1975 
convention which seeks to halt an illegal worldwide trade valued 
at some 5 billion each year 
frequently cited as reasons for thailands poor conservation 
record are its wildly capitalist economy widespread corruption 
poverty in rural areas and inadequate wildlife legislation 
a yawning legal loophole allows the export of even endangered 
animals from other than domestic sources phisit notes thus thai 
traders obtain wild animals from nearby laos burma and cambodia or 
produce fake documents to show that animals captured in thailand 
came from these countries this loophole facilitates smuggling 
connections from south america africa australia and other parts 
of asia 
once a tropical wonderland thailand has ravaged its own forests 
and their once richly varied inhabitants 
everything is for sale said phisit who has monitored 
wildlife exploitation for two decades 
elephants tigers wild cattle and deer are poached in national 
parks rare wild orchids are plucked for unregulated export cobras 
are slaughtered by the thousands for their skins meat and the 
purported medicinal power of their gall bladders eagles hawks and 
other birds of prey are sold to visiting arab falconers 
stress poor food and lack of knowledge about animal care take 
their toll during and after capture in snaring baby gibbons and 
other primates for example the mothers are normally shot by 
hunters 
further loss of life occurs during overseas shipment when the 
animals are often drugged and smuggled in airless boxes false 
bottoms of containers and empty oil drums 
this year only seven of 114 slow lorises small largeeyed 
lemurs survived a journey via forged export documents from 
thailand to japan 
people have been buying and selling animals for centuries 
phisit told a group of journalists recently its the cruelty and 
loss of life along the way that we are against 
phisit and other conservationists also assail what they call the 
lackluster performance of thai authorities who in turn complain of 
inadequate resources and little legal power to move against the 
traffickers 
vendors in areas frequented by foreign tourists try to sell slow 
lorises sometimes drugged with paint thinner to render them 
submissive or gibbons whose teeth have been chipped to prevent 
possible bites 
a local newspaper recently interviewed a dealer who explained 
how some gibbons are decapitated while still alive and their heads 
preserved for sale as souvenirs at bangkoks weekend market where 
wildlife is frequently on display on saturdays and sundays 
there are posters at the market asking people to telephone the 
wildlife department if they see wildlife traded phisit said 
but you can call until you drop dead because its sunday and 
nobody works in the office

events in china which roused the world to a 
frenzy of outrage in june seem more recently to have lulled it to 
sleep 
what was once high drama on television has dwindled to a daily 
grind of repression and arrests since the bold democracy 
movement in beijings tiananmen square was snuffed out in blood 
but what happened to the horror that swept the world in june 
where are the tens of thousands of expatriate chinese students and 
sympathizers who joined in strident protest and beyond the mild 
sanctions announced months ago where are the threatened boycotts 
the embargoes 
on oct 1 only about 3500 people joined fugitives from the 
chinese democracy movement for a demonstration in washington to 
counter the regimes 40th anniversary celebration organizers had 
hoped to draw nearly 10 times that many 
other disturbances of global impact such as the 1979 soviet 
invasion of afghanistan or the 76 soweto massacre in south africa 
provoked lasting reaction from the west either by arousing cold 
war passions or prompting endless demonstrations on college 
campuses 
yet the world seems to do little more than frown at china while 
its hardline communist government zealously smothers human rights 
all the great intentions about making china realize the cost 
of oppression have faded said sidney jones executive director 
of asia watch a human rights committee in new york 
the western european governments the us and japan none 
has said china has to lift martial law in beijing before well lift 
the freeze on world bank loans no one has said anyone involved in 
the violence must resign before we resume high level contacts 
china watchers point to several reasons for the muted response 
foreign governments do not want to disturb chinas tentative 
orientation toward the west so carefully nurtured since the nixon 
years 
the cold war has faded and with it fears of communist excesses 
china activists suffered a sharp emotional letdown after seeing 
their hopes crushed so abruptly they recognize bleakly the 
current regime is just continuing that countrys ageold habit of 
dictatorial repression 
the number of americans and other westerners involved with 
china whether economically or politically is still small only 
since us diplomatic relations were resumed in 1979 have firm ties 
been established after years of alienation 
but the simplest reason may be out of sight out of mind with 
dozens of arrests and at least 12 executions over the summer the 
chinese government apparently has succeeded in extinguishing the 
democracy movement or at least driving it underground 
theres no one to carry the torch said jonathan d spence 
a china scholar at yale university if there was some kind of 
opposition in china like the unions or the church in eastern 
europe they could carry the story 
foreign news media getting scant information from frightened 
chinese sources have largely dropped china to the back pages in 
its place are more exciting and visible developments in eastern 
europe and latin america 
the chinese government has really done a very good job of 
managing the story said barry naughton a china expert at the 
school of international relations and pacific studies at the 
university of california san diego 
in particular they have carefully avoided any sensational 
event that could be a rallying cry there is an ambiguity about it 
they have begun to carry out a policy of systematic limitation 
on intellectual freedom thats a major story but they do it in a 
way that is incremental theyre nickle and diming it 
that strategy suffered a minor setback oct 5 when the 1989 
nobel peace prize was awarded to the dalai lama the exiled leader 
of tibet for his nonviolent struggle to free his country from 
chinas occupation it was a glancing commentary on tiananmen 
square 
but there may be deeper reasons why the emotions stirred by the 
deaths of hundreds perhaps thousands of chinese on june 34 now 
seem stilled 
in some ways the times are not ripe for outrage the cold war 
has ebbed some say ended with it has gone the fear of communism 
that aroused the rightwing china lobby of the 1950s and 
lingered long enough to prompt president carters grain embargo and 
boycott of the 1980 moscow olympics 
instead todays news is filled with smiling soviet leaders and 
widening gaps in the iron curtain a poll published by business 
week magazine in august found that by a 3to1 margin americans 
are more concerned by the economic threat from japan than the 
military threat from the soviet union 
economics indeed seems to be replacing ideology as the driving 
force behind eastwest relations blurring distinctions president 
mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union has staked his future on 
it so apparently have chinas leaders despite the lurch back into 
totalitarianism 
the burden of china relations has to some extent fallen on 
businessmen who are not exactly altruists commented robert f 
dernberger a china specialist at the university of michigan 
for the record chinese communist party leader jiang zemin 
opened celebrations marking the regimes 40th anniversary with a 
blast of cold war rhetoric he condemned the wests rotten 
lifestyles and predicted the triumph of socialism over capitalism

but in other forums chinese officials have quietly mollified the 
west harking back to the pretiananmen square line that china 
needs many years of capitalisttype development before it can 
succeed at socialism 
the governor of the peoples bank of china li guixian told the 
annual meeting of the world bank and international monetary fund in 
washington on sept 27 that despite setbacks its policy of 
economic reform and opening to the outside world shall never be 
altered 
in corporate boardrooms worldwide executives still tantalized 
by chinas 1 billion consumers have been quick to respond 
restaffing longestablished joint ventures there 
virtually all representatives from foreign businesses have 
been back from aug 15 onsaid chuck conroy who directs asian 
practices for baker amp mckenzie the worlds largest law firm and 
one of the first to establish a presence in china 
widespread speculation of a drop in agricultural trade has 
proved unfounded helped by strong business since tiananmen square 
commodity sales to china mostly cotton and wheat are expected to 
be around 15 billion in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 more 
than double the previous year 
in addition world bank president barber conable said recently 
he hoped to resume lending to china soon seven loans totaling 
nearly 800 million were suspended after the tiananmen square 
confrontation 
most foreign companies are still quietly tabling proposals to 
send new capital and personnel into china but like conable they 
have only economic not moral qualms they are looking for more 
signs of stability 
even that and the loss of more than 1 billion in tourism may 
do little to upset relations analysts point out that chinas 
economy was overheated anyway and the crackdown gives chinas 
leaders an opportunity to check inflation and excessive growth 
in washington and most major foreign capitals a chill has 
settled over relations with china many western governments did not 
send representatives to the carefully orchestrated anniversary 
celebration 
mostly however caution reigns 
if the premise is that george bush hasnt been going out of 
his way to make headlines thats true said a us government 
official in washington who asked not to be identified earlier this 
fall the president deflected a reporters question about china 
with a terse its not time for normalcy 
the bush administration barred highlevel contacts with chinese 
officials and sales of military equipment after the crackdown then 
fell silent 
japan chinas no 1 trading partner and no 1 lender also has 
kept most official contacts at a low level and has not opened 
negotiations on new developmental loans few japanese businesses 
are launching new projects 
we are also very cautious in dealing with alreadyagreed 
loans to china because we do not want to give the impression 
that we condone now what we criticized before said taizo 
watanabe a spokesman for japans foreign ministry 
yet in the hotels in beijing all you see are japanese 
businessmen said dernberger who recently visited china 
theyve already changed and gone back to business as usual 
for most westerners however business as usual means having 
little to do with china and this may be another reason for the 
tepid response to tiananmen square 
i think theres less concern for human rights in china than in 
south africa or in latin america said spence 
it might be due to the racial consciousness in the united 
states we can identify with south africa it might be due to a 
longstanding historical condition that the chinese are not 
permitted such freedom by their governments what was exciting 
was the struggle to be free 
those who recognize that most poignantly perhaps are the 
thousands of expatriate chinese students who protested on college 
campuses in june today many of them are silent as well fearful 
of retaliation against family and friends in china and of their 
own futures 
in june students were furious about that kind of massacre it 
was very emotional they had to speak out said lian chao han 
vice president of the independent federation of chinese students 
and scholars in washington 
after they cooled down they really thought that they dont 
want to harm their families he said right now they dont 
know what theyre going to do

the home of a witnesss mother is firebombed 
an informant is shot after being accidentally exposed by the 
prosecution a judge worries about jurors safety so much he 
debates having them wear masks in court 
small wonder this trial is being conducted behind bulletproof 
plastic 1 inches thick 
the chief actor in this reallife script is 24yearold rayful 
edmond iii who according to prosecutors was president and chief 
executive officer of one of the largest business enterprises in 
the washington dc area 
edmond is alleged by the government to have run the largest 
cocaine ring in the history of the district of columbia 2 million 
a week 70 pounds of cocaine a month 30 killings along the way 
the supporting cast includes edmonds mother several brothers 
brothersinlaw and his grandmother whose home allegedly was 
headquarters for the enterprise and who has become a fixture on 
evening news shows with remarks as flamboyant as the trademark hats 
she wears 
edmond borrowed techniques from fortune 500 companies according 
to prosecutors he offered good pay 500 a week minimum 
expensive cars a company attorney help in purchasing real estate 
lavish trips and clothes and jewelry there were allexpenses paid 
trips to the super bowl and to heavyweight championship fights in

he operated the government says the hottest drug market in the 
city on two narrow treelined blocks in northeast washington known 
as the strip at peak hours cars would be bumpertobumper 
waiting for young street sellers to bring plastic bags of cocaine 
for 50 apiece 
the trial which began sept 11 has become something of a 
sensation in washington much like the oliver north case that 
unfolded two floors down earlier in the year and the john hinckley 
trial that took place two floors above 
security was tight for those cases but nothing like the edmond 
trial the jurors are anonymous even to the judge and lawyers 
and are identified only by number wouldbe spectators are held 
down the hall and summoned onebyone to go through metal detectors 
us district judge charles r richey declared in a memorandum 
that there was a substantial likelihood of imminent danger to the 
safety of the parties witnesses and other persons suspecting 
the gang was trying to identify individual jurors he tried to 
close the trial to the public leaving only reporters but was 
thwarted by an appeals court 
in court edmond and his 10 codefendants are matched oneonone 
by us marshals add to that a dozen defense lawyers four or five 
for the government the 12 jurors and three alternates court 
clerks and stenographer and the court takes on the appearance of a 
roman forum there are too many lawyers to crowd at the bench for 
conferences instead they listen through wireless headphones 
the 11 are charged variously with cocaine distribution 
conspiracy and racketeering for edmond there is an additional 
charge punishable by life in prison without parole carrying on a 
continuing criminal enterprise 
edmond also is scheduled for trial along with three other 
alleged gang members on three firstdegree murder charges and 
there will be a third proceeding for others charged with 
conspiracy swelling the number of defendants to 24 
despite the security precautions richeys court had to be 
emptied once because of a bomb threat remotecontrol video cameras 
scan the well of the court and the spectator seats the judge often 
has armed escorts from home to court 
the chief defense lawyer william h murphy jr wrangles 
constantly with the judge and the governments lead lawyer 
assistant us attorney betty ann soiefer 
during a shouting match ms soiefer elbowed murphy away from 
the lectern he in turn likened her to football player william 
the refrigerator perry and demanded an apology the judge said 
he had not seen anything wrong with the prosecutors conduct 
the trial began with six alternate jurors it now has only 
three one was dismissed earlier this month after it became clear 
his identity had become known to defense attorneys another because 
of family hardship and the third after she allegedly told other 
jurors she believed all of the defendants are innocent 
there have been violent incidents in march prosecutors by 
mistake mailed a letter to the home of a key informant detailing 
her cooperation and warning her life might be in danger the 
witness was sharing her home with edmonds brother emanuel sutton 
a defendant in the trial 
a week later the informant deborah y phillips was shot in 
the leg a month later she was found by her mother with her mouth 
taped shut and suffering from an apparent drug overdose since then 
she has refused to testify citing her rights against 
selfincrimination 
in her grand jury testimony she had described counting money 
for the organization paying salaries to the workers and preparing 
drugs for street sale she said she regularly turned over shoeboxes 
of money to edmond often as much as 60000 a box 
the trial was three weeks old when a molotov cocktail was thrown 
into the home of the mother of kathy sellers a government witness 
on the stand at that time nobody was hurt but us attorney jay 
b stephens said all witnesses would be offered police protection 
testimony has proved no less sensational than the theatrics 
surrounding the trial 
ms sellers testified she once watched constance perry 
edmonds mother use a moneycounting machine on thousands of 
dollars at the home of one of edmonds sisters both mother and 
sister are under indictment 
drug agent john cornille was surrounded on the stand by so many 
stacks of cocaine seized during the arrest of one defendant that he 
was almost blocked from view 
alta rae zanville told of visiting the apartment of defendant 
tony lewis and finding so much money stacked on the floor that it 
did not fit into three pieces of luggage i would venture to say 
it was about 3 million she said 
stevenson mcarthur a 20yearold serving a prison term for 
dealing testified he owned seven cars when he was 17 
he became acquainted with edmond outside a convenience store 
when he asked about the black mercedesbenz that edmond was 
driving asked how he knew the car was worth 80000 mcarthur 
replied i had one of my own

featured in a new exhibit icons ideals and power in the art of 
africa at the smithsonians national museum of african art in

and banners explores the various ways in which various african 
societies and civilizations have viewed the icons of mother and 
child male and female the male the rider and the stranger 
unlike european religious icons that focused on christian 
imagery these five african symbols represent powerful shared 
cultural ideals and values central to the lives of african 
peoples said andrea nicholls assistant curator the ideals 
are embodied in the images as attributes of physical beauty power 
or accomplishment in the social political religious or economic 
realm

in the metropolitan operas new production of 
rigoletto the title role is sung by leo nucci the duke is 
luciano pavarotti and soprano june anderson makes a much 
anticipated met debut as gilda 
but nuccis not worried about being upstaged when you have a 
great cast and a great conductor we perform much better he says 
the italian baritone was one of the top stars of the met last 
season acclaimed as figaro in the barber of seville and in 
rigoletto madama butterfly and the elixir of love 
he gave the met four months which he says with a smile he 
probably wont do again nucci is in demand in opera houses all 
over the world he started this season singing in vienna and 
hamburg hell be at the met for only rigoletto the first 
seven performances of nine during november and two in february in 
january hell sing the role in houston 
during nuccis fall engagement here hell sing the 1000th 
performance of his career and his 100th rigoletto 
five recordings on london records will come out this season 
the barber of seville rigoletto simon boccanegra 
aida and a solo record of italian songs a masked ball the 
last recording conducted by herbert von karajan was released by 
deutsche grammaphon in august while nucci was singing in that opera 
at the salzburg festival 
nucci interviewed in his managers office said his early 
career progressed in an unusual way his opera debut was in 1967 in 
the title role of the barber of seville in spoleto italy 
after three years i am stopping the career i was then in the 
chorus at la scala five years why i dont know dont ask me why 
because of life many things things werent going so well 
thinking about the voice technique he said 
when i did my audition for the chorus the chorus maestro 
said youre sure you come to the chorus i said im sure i 
need the money for eating i never lost the habit of eating this 
is a big problem 
i started again to study i find in milano a teacher he was 
85 at the time i was with this old man until he died at 90 years 
old in 1973 i made another debut in lonigo a very small city 
at the same time i was in the chorus at la scala in 1975 i take 
another important decision with my wife and family i left the 
chorus 
he dates his career from that time im glad and im very 
lucky to stop the career and try again is not so easy 
another good thing happened during nuccis stint in the chorus 
i find my wife she is a soloist soprano she listened to me 
sing a song a very romantic song she fell in love i was already 
in love to sing the song we married in 1972 
nucci sang his first rigoletto with his wife adriana who was 
six months pregnant in lonigo she also sang in san francisco 
and covent garden she is retired now 
my daughter cinzia cynthia in english is 16 she tries to 
be a soprano but its too early to know about this 
nuccis big break came in 1978 singing in luisa miller at 
covent garden with pavarotti and katia ricciarelli the baritone 
canceled in a new very important production conducted by lorin 
maazel katia said my name for replacing him she called is it 
possible you can come to london we have tomorrow the final dress 
rehearsal you can sing very well this role what you say my 
answer was yes i can it was the best thing in my life as a 
singer 
he had sung in italy debuting at la scala in 1977 and in small 
houses once with ricciarelli and in spain but wasnt known on 
the international scene this was the dream of everyone starting 
a career 
getting the costume altered wasnt difficult nucci says 
performing after only one rehearsal was 
was it a success nucci smiles 
the day after i received in my hotel 10 or more telegrams 
from the met chicago washington vienna paris it is incredible 
this is a miracle he said after my first act aria and 
cabaletta all i remember is the curtain coming down i remember 
im crying 
luciano after the first act i cant forget patted my 
shoulder and said my young boy you did tonight in one night what 
we did in five years after that luciano calls me champion 
instead of leo he still says it 
and what does nucci call pavarotti maestro he is the no 
1 
nucci made his debut in vienna in 1979 in washington and the 
met in 1980 chicago and paris in 1981 san francisco in 1984 now 
hes being booked into 1994 
he wont be at the met next season in 1991 hell do a masked 
ball and luisa miller in 1992 hell sing rigoletto 
nucci described the character rigoletto 
he does insults because they entertain the duke he said 
it is just a job he doesnt like this job he does it because 
hes a hunchback in that time dwarfs were entertainment for the 
rich 
three years ago there was a big scandal in hamburg the 
director wanted rigoletto to be a clown he is not a clown he 
is like a piece of wood he does what he must do nothing more in 
my idea gilda was in a cage the court was dressed like fascists 
this is nothing to do with rigoletto its not like music of this 
century the time is different you cannot do rigoletto and 
change everything

when paula abdul was a child she dreamed of 
following in the footsteps of such singing and dancing legends as 
gene kelly fred astaire and judy garland 
today it looks as if the diminutive 26yearold vocalist and 
choreographer could be well on her way 
abduls debut album forever your girl has sold more than 2 
million copies with three no 1 singles straight up forever 
your girl and cold hearted a fourth single the way you 
love me is also burning up the charts 
to top it off she recently won three mtv awards for her music 
and videos and even more recently won an emmy for her choreography 
of the tracey ullman show 
she is understandably overwhelmed 
i feel redundant when i keep saying im overwhelmed or im 
excited but its really something you cant explain she said 
its just an inner feeling that you have you smile and you laugh 
and you think im a real lucky girl 
abdul has come a long way from her days cheerleading for the los 
angeles lakers considering it was an opportunity she almost missed 
she heard about the audition and went with her girlfriends but 
became discouraged when she saw hundreds of laker girl hopefuls 
milling about waiting for their chance to perform 
i drove the girls that were auditioning with me so i had to 
wait for them and at the very last second after hours i said 
what the heck im just gonna go ahead 
i was a big basketball fan she said i was a huge laker 
fan and we each would get two season seats what more could you 
want the lakers were really hot 
soon after being selected as one of the 12 cheerleaders in 1981 
the choreographer left to get married she asked a very young abdul 
to take over the job 
like everything she commits herself to abdul devoted herself to 
getting the laker girls noticed she incorporated traditional 
cheerleading with jazzy dance steps and savvy street moves 
the fans did notice and the offers started pouring in for 
abdul to choreograph she helped smooth out dance steps for a music 
video by the jacksons and did some commercial work then she 
choreographed the videos for janet jacksons what have you done 
for me lately and when i think of you among others 
i wasnt looking to become a choreographer really abdul 
said these were little jobs that came my way and it was 
something that was good money and it was fun 
besides choreographing videos for jackson zz top and the 
pointer sisters abdul arranged dance steps for aretha franklin 
kool and the gang and george michael concert tours 
she also choreographed two films the running man and 
coming to america she became so busy she had to say goodbye to 
the laker girls 
but with the looming examples of kelly garland and astaire 
abdul still was drawn to song 
abdul laughed as she talked recently about her break into the 
recording business she said the record company executives who 
worked with her on music videos kept asking so what do you want 
to do when you grow up paula 
she would respond i want to be an artist on your label 
finally two executives took her seriously and signed her to a 
recording deal forever your girl was the result 
i remember thinking when i was making the album look im 
having a good time doing this but it would be really wonderful if i 
really sold albums it would be wonderful if i had hit songs 
she said 
the album has since produced the three hits and probably will 
generate a few more 
you feel like well gosh i have a no 1 single thats 
really great then you have another single that comes out and it 
goes no 1 and you freak out she said i freaked out i 
couldnt believe it then you have a third one that goes no 1 and 
you go oh my god im dreaming 
abdul never expected such quick success when she was a young 
girl taking hours and hours of dancing lessons and dreaming of 
hollywood in her san fernando valley neighborhood 
her dark good looks come from a brazilian and syrian father and 
a french canadian mother she said when she was little her mother 
warned her about the perils of show business and urged her to have 
another dream 
abdul seriously took the advice and went to california state 
university northridge where she entered the radiotvfilm program 
i still had a strong love of song and dance and acting but i 
knew in case it never worked for me then i would maybe have a 
career as a sports commentator 
unfortunately for the sports world she never took that career 
track and now juggles choreography and singing while trying to 
find time for herself after a recent early morning photo shoot 
abdul admitted she was pressed for time because she had to catch a 
plane to paris 
it gets draining she said when it gets to be a little 
bit too much thats when i have to back off at least for a day 
because i dont want it ever to be tedious i want to always feel 
the way im feeling now 
she had been scheduled to choreograph the film version of the 
musical evita but got a reprieve of the fourmonth project in 
spain when meryl streep dropped out as lead with that shelved 
abdul wants to take a week off then immerse herself in a second 
album which may include some surprises 
musically im more involved now and i have different ideas of 
where i want to go she said im not going to deviate too much 
from what ive done with whats been successful for me but i plan 
on stretching a lot 
her success has not stifled her ambition she eventually wants 
to break into acting much like her hollywood idols and is 
currently considering several prospects 
i definitely want to act she said but i definitely want 
to continue making music and ill never give up choreography

vladimir nabokov liked to write standing up 
waking in the early morning and starting work at a blue lectern by 
the afternoon the author would be seated in an armchair a wooden 
board across his lap he usually wrote until bedtime 
with books taking up most of his day letters were written only 
for specific reasons business a line to his publisher or a legal 
matter that required his signature 
there were also notes to his family passionate letters to his 
wife vera when they were apart for a time messages slipped under 
the hotel room door of his son dmitri in montreaux switzerland 
words of encouragement to his brother kirill an aspiring poet 
not every writer could be creative at all times but as dmitri 
nabokov said in a recent interview even the most casual memo by 
his father was something special graced by the touch that produced 
lolita the gift ada and many others 
it was a thrill i loved it recalled nabokov 55 who 
helped compile the letters of vladimir nabokov 19401977 
harcourt brace jovanovich 2995 
i knew that as in his fiction around the corner of every 
sentence there would be a nice little surprise a linguistic 
surprise he said 
whether he was writing to a publisher writing to a son 
making up a grocery list there was always something original in 
how he phrased it the receptors of my spinal cord were always 
ready for his language 
nabokov admits that a certain settling of accounts was in mind 
upon issuing his late fathers letters vladimir nabakovs stern 
precise image represented just one side his son insists consider 
what the author wrote to vera in may 1937 after his recovery from a 
recent illness 
you know now i can tell you frankly the indescribable 
torments in february before these treatments drove me to the 
border of suicide a border i was not authorized to cross because 
i had you in my luggage my love is it really true that i shall 
soon see you if fate does not let me down 
try not to worry too much my love we shall be together soon 
anyway tell mother i embrace her and am not writing her only 
because i am spending all my epistolary energy on you 
lolita of course touched off dozens of letters ranging 
from amusement to anger as frightened publishers suggested changes 
or backed away and governments attempted censorship 
nabokov knew his story of a middleaged mans passionate affair 
with a 12yearold girl would create controversy and this 1950s 
best seller became the usually apolitical authors most passionate 
cause 
on march 6 1956 he wrote to morris bishop chairman of the 
department of romance literature at cornell university where 
nabokov also taught 
i know that lolita is my best book so far i calmly lean on 
my conviction that it is a serious work of art and that no court 
could prove it to be lewd and libertine 
all categories raid of course into one another a comedy of 
manners written by a fine poet may have its lewd side but lolita 
is a tragedy pornography is not an image plucked out of context 
pornography is an attitude and an intention the tragic and the 
obscene exclude each other 
those writers nabokov found inferior are spared nothing poet 
ts eliot and author thomas mann are dismissed as big fakes 
nobelist saul bellow is a mediocrity poet ezra pound is 
disgusting and entirely secondrate 
critic edmund wilson a onetime supporter feuded openly with 
nabokov in the 1950s after many years of a warm friendship these 
two great literary figures drifted apart 
it started on a professional level with nabokov attacking 
wilsons attempts at russian translation and ended with bitter 
personal attacks in the early 1970s shortly before the critics 
death 
as you perhaps know the warm friendship between ew and vn 
which began in 1941 was later obliterated by minor and major 
clashes nabokov would sadly note 
he preferred the russian poet alexander pushkin spending years 
on the english translation of his novel in verse eugene onegin 
nabokov also admired james joyce whose ulysses was labeled 
pornographic as well and marcel proust author of the classic 
remembrance of things past whose gift for intricate detail had 
a powerful influence 
proust was very visual and chromatic in his approach and so 
was father dmitri nabokov said father in his youth wanted to 
a painter at the age of 15 he received lessons in the house he 
had talent but his teacher read the first of my fathers attempts 
at poetry and prose and said you have to a writer or a poet 
vladimir nabokov the son of a prominent liberal in 
prerevolutionary russia was born 1899 in st petersburg now 
leningrad he read tolstoy and turgenev as a child played chess 
and collected butterflies a lifelong fascination 
unhappy with the bolshevik government he emigrated in 1919 and 
lived in several countries before settling in the united states in 
1940 twenty years later the author and vera moved to switzerland 
where they remained until his death in 1977 vera nabokov still 
lives in montreaux 
he was a wonderfully warm guy said dmitri nabokov who 
translated several of his fathers books he was my best friend 
as is mother but he was intransigent with bad art and secondhand 
ideas intransigent with those who mutilated his art and very 
very jealous with his time 
his time and strength were finite he felt he had a gift that 
he had to utilize to the fullest and he wanted to write he did not 
go on bookstore tours and was very parsimonious in giving 
interviews 
in 1964 nabokov did agree to a rare interview and conducted it 
in even rarer style the reporter filled a stack of paper with 
questions and handed them to nabokov who walked to his lectern and 
composed the answers always his son observed the author knew how 
he best communicated 
in his own words i think like a genius i write like a 
distinguished author i speak like a child he also said that he 
was a wretched public speaker which wasnt true he was a 
wonderful speaker he did a lot of offthenabokovuffing as he 
called it 
he was such a precisionist with language he felt that 
everything he published should be up to the best level or the right 
thought

some groups start as garage bands bar 
bands or studio bands but grammywinning take 6 began as a 
bathroom band 
the original group of six young students began harmonizing in a 
bathroom at oakwood college a seventhday adventist school in 
huntsville ala nine years ago 
you always have good acoustics in a bathroom said claude v 
mcknight iii the groups leader it was a large bathroom and you 
have sounds reverberating off the wall the sound is better as long 
as there isnt anyone doing anything that might upset you 
from those bathroom rehearsals and several personnel changes 
came a jazzstyled a cappella gospel group that scored a hit with 
its first single spread love 
the single and selftitled debut album earned the group three 
grammy nominations and two grammys for best soul gospel performance 
by a group and best jazz vocal performance by a duo or group 
mcknight mark kibble mervyn warren cedric dent david thomas 
and alvin vinnie chea have just finished a national tour and 
are working on their second album in nashville 
the first lp which was declared gold for selling 500000 
copies consists of traditional gospel and contemporary christian 
songs such as gold mine mary and a quiet place but 
the sound is a mixture of manhattan transfer the beach boys and 
earth wind and fire mcknight regards the groups sound as a means 
of conveying a message as much as music 
in the christian world there is room for entertainment he 
said you have to wrap the message up in a package that is 
appealing to people most people wont come out and listen to 
somebody who is going to thump a bible over their head but i will 
come out and listen to some nice jazz sounds 
our message simply is that the love of jesus christ will apply 
toward everyone 
mcknight acknowledges that some listeners might be turned off by 
the message but he points out the album has reached gold status 
and is still selling well after its march 1988 release 
the group tries not only to present its message during 
performances but is also noted for adhering to a seventhday 
adventist lifestyle off stage mcknight says none of the members 
drinks alcoholic beverages or smokes and several are vegetarians 
being seventhday adventist first off means we observe the 
sabbath from sundown friday to sundown saturday it has been a 
little difficult to allow us to have that time in the record 
industry a lot of times it happens that we have to turn things 
down or say can we do it on sunday morning or saturday evening 
people are slowly but surely coming around to realize that we 
are different 
just as take 6s lifestyle is different so will be the next 
album mcknight said while the groups a cappella sound was 
praised by industry figures such as producer quincy jones and 
stevie wonder whose answering machine played one of the groups 
tunes mcknight said the new album probably wont be entirely a 
cappella 
everybody plays an instrument and we will probably do some 
things with instruments we may do some things with just keyboards 
or we may do a fullblown big band arrangement with horns and 
everything he said 
of course there will be gospel music but we may do some bossa 
nova types of things some funkier types of things and of course 
jazz we want to show that we are versatile and can do other types 
of music 
mcknight says the change might upset some fans 
i think there will be some purists who will say aw theyve 
defiled it theyve added instruments but at the same time when 
you do something and you do it well then you will gain new fans 
and you will preserve the old ones 
like take 6 mcknight urges other artists especially aspiring 
ones to put their best work forward much of the music produced 
these days is poorly crafted fluff that has no lasting value he 
said 
theres a lot of things that just arent done well strive for 
excellence mcknight said there is a market out there for 
quality that is why a lot of people have longevity

susanne barstad didnt know a modem 
from a disk drive but she and other residents of sheyenne care 
center have learned that computers can be as easy to use as a horse 
and buggy 
i figured youre never too old to learn if you want to try 
the cheery 90yearold said ive always had a curiosity about 
trying new things 
barstad is among 19 residents of the nursing home who use a 
computer to write to pen pals around the country through a network 
called seniornet 
the nonprofit organization has trained more than 3500 people on 
personal computers at 30 sites in 13 states and canada since 1986 
sites include doctors offices senior centers and colleges but 
sheyenne care center is the only nursing home said cindy schwehr 
the centers seniornet coordinator 
schwehr believes the program keeps the residents minds alert 
and helps ward off institutional depression i think it boosts 
their selfesteem their confidence and its an easy way for them 
to establish friendships with people in other parts of the 
country 
while some of the residents balked at using the computer 
barstad jumped at the chance i knew computers are going to be 
the wave of the future i was happy when they asked me to come 
down and try it 
barstad a retired nurse corresponds with three other seniors 
including an author in florida and a former journalist in virginia 
barb svenningsen a volunteer who helps the residents operate 
the computer said some still hesitate to use it their first 
question is how much is it going to cost but those that get on 
it and realize they can do it they really seem to like it 
seniornet evolved from a computer class and user manual 
computers for kids over 60 by mary furlong an associate 
professor of education at the university of san francisco and now 
executive director of seniornet 
furlong started it because she felt senior citizens had been 
left out of the computer revolution of the 80s what ive 
learned in the past six years is that older adults have a great 
deal of wisdom to share if we give them access to these tools 
we as a society stand to learn a great deal 
recognizing a relatively untapped market for computers and 
information services industry has been eager to help seniornet get 
off the ground 
apple computer corp donated 200000 worth of computers to 
equip 11 training sites including sheyenne care center which 
received a keyboard disk drive monitor and printer 
users are billed only for the time something is sent over 
transmission lines furlong said that averages about three or four 
hours a month at 1260 an hour for most users 
sheyenne care centers bills are paid for by the markle 
foundation of new york which has donated 700000 to seniornet 
the center joined after former administrator jim tourville heard 
about it at a national conference 
tourville and former marketing director tim hager contacted 
furlong and in 1987 the nursing home was selected to join eight 
other sites in the country 
we had absolutely nothing to lose by doing this because 
everything was donated and hundreds of things to gain schwehr 
said 
this has given them a link with some of their younger family 
members because the children are learning about computers in 
school she said it gives them something to talk about and 
that can mean so much to an elderly person

the rev marshall d moran has talked 
with mahatma ghandi and drove indias first prime minister 
jawaharlal nehru around in a jeep but to most of those who know 
him hes simply mickey mouse 
i want to continue as long as i find people wanting to talk to 
me said the 83yearold chicagoborn jesuit ham license 9n1mm 
the only private radio operator in this tiny himalayan kingdom 
sandwiched between china and india 
since he started out on the radio he built himself moran 
estimates hes talked to more than 80000 ham operators i used 
to talk to captains of ships at sea they used to respond saying 
your signal is not good 
in 1961 the maritime radio club of houston sent him the radio 
hes used since 
moran learned to make receivers from a friend in school when 
i was 13 i used to sell them to my friends the parts would cost 
me 90 i would sell it for 100 in those days 10 was good 
money 
those were also the days when broadcasting was young and no one 
had heard of television i saw the development of radio and 
television from the very beginning i was lucky to see the 
beginning 
moran set sail from the united states in 1929 in search of a 
new homeland in asia he settled first in india and became 
principal of st xaviers school in patna in the eastern indian 
province of bihar 
it was there in 1939 while i was in the middle of putting a 
high school in patna i met gandhi the great man after a half 
hour talk with him i agreed to work for him moran recalls 
in 1946 just before the end of the second world war i was 
going to shillong to give a retreat lecture before christmas he 
said and jawaharlal nehru who a year later would become prime 
minister was on the train 
nehru was then president of the congress party large crowds 
would come to see and hear him when the train stopped at railway 
stations and when his microphone did not work his voice stopped 
and i went up to the speakers and connected the wires moran 
said nehru asked me what is the name of your company which 
takes so good care of loudspeakers 
i said i am sorry i am a jesuit priest and an american 
missionary 
moran met nehru again in 1947 and drove him around bihar in his 
jeep during hindumuslim rioting before the partition of india 
two years later as principal of st xaviers in patna moran 
made his first trip to nepal to conduct examinations for patna 
university he moved to the mountain kingdom in 1951 so settle 
intent on starting a boarding school 
at the time there was no airport so he took a train to raxaul 
the last indian township on the border and made his way to 
bhimphedi at the base of the himalayan foothills there were 
eight porters waiting for me with an ulinkath an open palanquin 
four of them carried me on it and four others followed running 
behind them changing turns every 10 minutes he said 
this was the only means of transportation system in those days 
to enter into the nepalese capital i saw even cars being 
carried by men on their shoulder along the trail at bhimphedi 
people took off the wheels of a car and they put the car on top of 
two long logs with nine planks strapped sideways and 36 people in 
rows of four men carried it on the trail to thankot 
when moran brought his own car into nepal that in 1951 however 
he did it by air even so he said it was a herculean effort 
the door of the dc3 was so narrow that i had to take off the 
back and front bumpers first the car was pushed into the plane 
with barely an inch to spare to fit it in some of the planes 
hinges had to be removed and when i asked the pilot for his 
permission he said i cant give permission to do so but if i go 
and take a cup of tea i might not see it hurry up 
that year moran met nehru a third time the prime minister was 
visiting as a state guest saw me at a civic reception standing 
among the huge crowd and told king tribhuvan pointing at me this 
is my most favourite driver 
it was also the year that moran established st xaviers in an 
old maharajas summer palace 5000 feet up in the himalayan 
foothills where he still teaches five days a week when he 
doesnt have his ears on

the old adage an ounce of prevention is 
worth a pound of cure holds true for the flu 
each winter millions of americans suffer the fever aches and 
pains of influenza most recover from the effects in a week or so 
but for many older people the flu and its complications are 
extremely serious 
while the bodys immune system is busy fighting the flu a 
person is less capable of resisting another lifethreatening 
infection like pneumonia older people and those with chronic 
diseases such as heart disese emphysema asthma and diabetes have 
the greatest risk of developing pneumonia along with the flu 
and older people are more likely to require hospitalization flu 
and pneumonia combined are the sixth leading cause of death in the 
united states and 80 to 90 percent of the deaths are in people 65 
and older 
but flu and its complications need not be deadly and can be 
prevented by vaccinating highrisk individuals six to eight weeks 
before the season begins 
influenza is caused by a virus that infects the nose throat and 
lungs flu travels quickly especially during winter in crowded 
indoor places like malls grocery stores theaters and hospitals 
when someone with the flu coughs or sneezes droplets containing 
particles of the virus spread to other people 
after infection symptoms usually appear in two to four days 
the disease continues to be contagious for another three to four 
days 
once the virus enters the body it multiplies and causes a 
variety of wellknown complaints including chills and fever 
headache runny nose sore throat and a dry cough extreme weakness 
and muscle aches and pains often last for several days if the 
virus invades the lungs viral pneumonia can develop 
to prevent the flu people 65 and older and residents of nursing 
homes and other chroniccare facilities should be vaccinated also 
health professionals nursing home workers and family members who 
live with someone over 65 should get a flu shot to avoid spreading 
the disease to those at risk 
unlike other viruses the flu virus changes from time to time 
because different strains of the virus tend to spread flu each 
season a new vaccine is prepared every year it contains strains 
of the flu virus recently circulating worldwide and believed likely 
to hit during the coming winter nicknames such as the spanish 
flu and hong kong flu refer to places where large outbreaks 
of new flu strains have first appeared 
the vaccine is made from highly purified killed viruses 
because the flu shot does not contain infectious viruses it does 
not cause the flu the most common side effect is a sore arm which 
occurs in less than onethird of those vaccinated and usually lasts 
only a day or so a few people also may develop a brief lowgrade 
fever and some minor aches and pains which begin six to 12 hours 
after vaccination and can persist for one or two days 
if a person has no special reason not to take aspirin low doses 
such as one tablet every three to four hours usually will relieve 
these symptoms 
immediate allergic reactions such as hives rarely occur after 
influenza vaccination anyone allergic to eggs which are used to 
grow the virus for the vaccine should not receive the vaccine 
since some egg protein may be present 
since the flu vaccine takes several weeks to work the best time 
to be vaccinated is in november a vaccine also is available 
against the most common types of bacteria which cause pneumonia 
the flu shot can be given at the same time as the pneumonia vaccine 
without increasing the side effects the flu shot must be given 
every year but the pneumonia vaccine should be given only once 
in addition to the flu shot an antiviral drug amantadine 
can prevent infection by certain strains the drug is useful for 
people who have not had the vaccine or as extra protection for 
those who have been immunized 
when taken soon after the early signs are felt amantadine 
reduces the duration of fever and other symptoms it also can 
prevent infection if taken during the entire four to sixweek 
course of a flu epidemic 
after people stop taking the drug they become susceptible to 
the virus again it occasionally causes difficulty sleeping 
impaired concentration and dizziness and has been associated with 
falls in older people as with all medication patients should take 
it only with a doctors recommendation

for 40 years when bill warriner saw a rose he 
ticked off its development possibilities now he grows them mainly 
for pleasure in fact pleasure his 1990 allamerican is the best 
in mass plantings 
one of the main reasons people dont grow roses is they dont 
want to take care of them so if you remove that reason you get 
more customers said warriner 67 who retired from jackson amp 
perkins co i do think its a shame more people especially 
retirees dont enjoy the pleasure of gardening 
there are about 60 rose bushes growing in the 90by90foot 
landscape of his home in tustin calif a los angeles suburb where 
hes lived the past 20 years theres also a small vegetable garden 
and a couple each of avocado orange lemon lime and persimmon 
trees its all pretty lowkey 
of his roses warriner says now i just like to look at them 
smell them enjoy them what im looking for is beauty in the 
landscape 
pinkblooming pleasure was propagated before his 1987 retirement 
as vice president of research at jackson amp perkins the 
roseselling giant so were his 1989 allamericans tournament of 
roses and class act it can be eight years from propagation to 
possible designation by allamerica selection inc a nonprofit 
organization of most us rose producers so there may be more 
warriner winners he has 15 more than anyone in the 50yearold 
competition 
announcements arent made for two years after the selection to 
give growers time to produce plants for sale pleasure will be 
available this spring 
i planted two test plants in march the desert climate is a 
severe test but pleasure a floribunda produced numerous flowers 
and good foliage compared to others however the flowers dropped 
their petals quickly after being cut 
sometimes a rose that holds too long makes a poor landscape 
subject because the flowers dry and stay on the bush said 
warriner 
warriner who grew up in michigan has never been sure why hes 
always had a keen interest in flowers he went to michigan state 
university because of its horticuture reputation he also made the 
boxing team as a middleweight which probably cut off a lot of 
joking about my love of flowers he still can make the weight 
although the pounds are distributed a lot differently 
as a hybridizer he patented about 110 rose varieties jackson amp 
perkins estimates 41 million of his roses have been sold besides 
the 1989 and 1990 allamericans they include such standbys as 
simplicity cherish love honor intrigue impatient sun flare 
medallion french lace and color magic 
warriner never developed a personal favorite and says its a 
thrill to see any of his growing somewhere because it means you 
did something right 
i look on each variety in a different way the variety that 
more people have grown than anything else is simplicity but its 
certainly not the most beautiful variety ive created and so its 
hard to say what the favorite is it would change every year 
depending on my goals in hybridizing at the time 
the most difficult part of hybridizing he feels is deciding 
which roses to use for the crosses one parent of pleasure is 
intrigue but warriner said he never used it in hybridizing because 
it doesnt really bloom enough to be a good parent although its 
a very clean plant and fragrant 
but when he saw a certain seedling he recalled intrigues strong 
points and thought the combination had possibilities he doesnt 
recall now what it was that grabbed his attention we rarely had 
less than 150000 seedlings 
you go through them in the spring and summer on almost a daily 
basis and pick out those that look like they might have potential 
and discard those with none the first year wed select perhaps 
1000 seedling varieties for further propagation the next year 
more would be eliminated after going through the procedure about 
three times whats left are just a few varieties 
how possible is it that the perfect rose is growing 
somewhere but the owner doesnt realize it and no one else sees it 
i certainly wouldnt go looking for it roses have to be 
developed i dont see how the natural process can produce a 
winning specimen

the nations nursing homes need new ways to watch 
over wanderers the thousands of patients especially 
alzheimers victims who are prone to walking around says a 
researcher seeking a hightech solution 
in three months of study at an atlanta nursing home david 
martinosaltzman identified two patterns meandering in which 
patients wander aimlessly and circuiting in which they walk 
laps around a defined area 
the challenge for researchers is to find a way for nursing homes 
to deal with the problem without physical restraints or drugs said 
martinosaltzman a behavior specialist at the veterans 
administration medical center here 
his study involved pressuresensitive floor mats that would 
detect electronic tags worn by patients the computerized system 
allowed the patients to wander but alerted workers when the 
patients were where they shouldnt be 
such systems can be prohibitively expensive for small nursing 
homes he said small nursing homes cant afford a 100000 
system it behooves us to come up with something thats 
affordable

a depressionera law that cuts social security 
benefits for older people who work faces growing opposition from 
congressional critics who say it pushes seniors out of the labor 
force when the nation needs them 
benefit reductions from the socalled earnings test can 
combine with federal state and local taxes to produce such high 
marginal tax rates that many older workers do just as well staying 
home foes say 
it is a tremendous disincentive to work and a tremendous 
incentive to just give up and throw in the towel said sen 
william armstrong rcolo the marginal tax rate on some people 
is easily 80 percent and in some cases more 
workers aged 6569 this year lose 1 in social security benefits 
for every 2 earned over 8880 and beneficiaries under 65 face a 
similar reduction for earnings in excess of 6480 a 50 percent 
effective marginal tax rate by itself there is no limit for those 
70 and older 
in 1990 the threshold is scheduled to rise to 9360 for those 
6569 and 6840 for those under 65 and the penalty will be less 
severe for those 65 and above a 1 reduction in benefits for every 
3 in excess earnings 
but several proposals in congress would relax the limits 
further and calls for repeal are gaining new allies 
each year almost 1 million social security beneficiaries aged 
6569 lose some or all of their benefits because of the earnings 
test and another 100000 dont file for benefits because of it 
others stop working deliberately hold their earnings to just under 
the threshold or hide excess wages from the government to avoid the 
loss of benefits 
a 67yearold woman who works at a county courthouse in illinois 
recently wrote to her congressman that because of the earnings 
limit it just doesnt pay to work beyond the 8880 limit 
a haeworth robinson chief actuary for the social security 
administration from 197578 once had a maid who quit because he 
insisted on paying social security taxes on her wages which would 
have alerted the government to her earnings robinson believes the 
earnings test is justified but predicted its days are numbered 
because of mounting opposition 
those seeking to relax the limits include rep tom tauke 
riowa who recalled that the woman who took care of his son faced 
such a big tax bite on her wages due to the earnings test that she 
wouldve been better off if we had simply given her big 
presents at christmas and other holidays 
it certainly made it clear to us that the system needed to be 
changed tauke said this will be around for a while but 
certainly the trend and the momentum is toward elimination 
critics say the earnings test created along with social 
security in the depression when older americans were being 
encouraged to retire to free up jobs for young workers is an 
anachronism at a time when policymakers are trying to keep older 
people working longer and labor markets are tight 
they also argue that it discriminates against workingclass 
americans because the benefit reductions are linked only to 
earnings and are unaffected by unearned income such as pensions 
rent and dividends 
supporters meanwhile maintain it is only fair to limit the 
retirement benefits paid to those still pulling in a paycheck 
robert ball who headed the social security administration from 
196273 said there is merit to the original concept of paying 
social security benefits to make up for earnings lost because of 
retirement weve already departed from that a long way and i 
dont see any reason to go further in the direction of making the 
program a straight annuity he said 
that view is shared by robinson who said too many people 
believe social security benefits are an earned right they bought 
and paid for 
most workers get back far more in benefits than they paid in 
taxes government figures show a typical worker who retired at 65 
in 1988 had paid about 12000 in social security taxes which will 
be recovered in benefits in two years the average retiree goes on 
to collect benefits for 15 to 20 years 
if you repeal it youre giving in to this propaganda that 
this is a pension that it bears some relationship to what you paid 
in taxes and that is just not true robinson said 
after years of unsuccessful legislative jostling on the earnings 
test congress appears ready to relax the restrictions over the 
next two years the house this fall passed a proposal to boost the 
earnings threshold to 9720 next year and 10440 in 1991 the 
senate finance committee passed a more generous plan to up the 
limits to 11700 next year and then to 14520 
social security commissioner gwendolyn king voiced support for 
both proposals saying they would encourage seniors to remain in 
the workforce and contribute their knowledge and experience to the 
nations economy 
there also is growing support in congress for outright repeal 
about 150 house members are cosponsoring a bill introduced by rep 
dennis hastert rill that would eliminate the test for those 65 
and above 
many republicans in congress long have favored repeal of the 
earnings test but the idea now is gaining support among democrats 
said carolyn weaver a scholar at the american enterprise 
institute it is far more likely that itll be repealed or at 
least loosened 
the social security administration supports the concept of 
scrapping the earnings test but isnt pushing for action because 
it says repeal would cost too much 253 billion over five years 
the idea of eliminating the earnings test is the right way to 
go said spokesman phil gambino all the belief and the logic 
behind it still exists its just the costs that are the problem 
some advocates for repeal however believe that scrapping the 
test would actually save money by returning thousands of retirees 
to the workforce 
two conservative research groups the institute for policy 
innovation and the national center for policy analysis this fall 
issued a study predicting that at least 700000 retirees would 
enter the labor market if the earnings limit were repealed 
generating 140 million more in new workrelated taxes than the 
cost of the additional social security benefits that would be paid

our star recently turned 50 is waking up 
smelling the coffee and starting to give up that infatuation with 
young love but memories linger 
sound like the plot for a tv movie 
its actually the plot for television itself advertising and tv 
executives say as shows like the golden girls draw big 
audiences and stars like bob newhart andy griffith angela 
lansbury and carroll oconnor shine 
the audience is getting older said david poltrack cbs 
senior vice president for planning and research the major 
population shift is the aging of the baby boomers when they were 
young television was very youthoriented 
gradually the television networks are recognizing that the 
advantage is to go with this aging baby boomer generation 
johnny carson at 64 is still the most popular talk show host 
and when cbs lonesome dove bowled over the competition last 
spring with aging texas plainsmen robert duvall and tommy lee 
jones perry mason took the case and saved nbc from disaster 
the raymond burr role appeals mainly to older viewers 
while the population is aging and older people have more 
disposable income advertisers are slow to recognize the changes 
we dont go as far as cbs would like us to go said betsy 
frank a vice president of saatchi amp saatchi the worlds largest 
ad agency cbs has always been more successful when it programs 
for a more mature audience even abc is making some concessions 
toward older audiences its abc mystery movie has older stars and 
should do well with older viewers on saturday night but fox 
broadcasting has succeeded by targeting a very young audience 
nonetheless frank sees a shift to buying demographics of age 
2554 
brandon tartikoff president of nbc entertainment agrees the 
audience is aging and has more money but you also have to look 
at consumer habits 
is the person who is 61 years old whos bought maxwell house 
coffee for 40 years really a good target for your new vienna roast 
i recognize that they have more income but i would be careful about 
their buying habits 
our standard approach is to come up with a good show that has 
as widespread an appeal as possible golden girls is a show that 
recognizes the graying of america but its universal in its appeal 
it attracts teenagers and young people as well it defies 
advertisers who thought it would be a show that would appeal to 
only people over 50 
tartikoff believes older viewers will be more of a factor in the 
1990s 
the phenomenon of shows about older people is quite new to 
television said michael dann a consultant who formerly headed 
programming at cbs and nbc we always had older people in family 
shows but the shows were always about kids and their problems 
what you have now are shows built around the problems that older 
people face the remarkable thing about the golden girls is that 
its audience cuts through all age groups one show is a hit two is 
a trend you clearly have that taking place today 
the problems older characters face arent geriatric theyre the 
usual mix of romance sex appearance divorce and the conflicts 
of human nature 
although favorable demographics is still the preferred method of 
advertiser selection audience size is important and becoming more 
so dann said years ago i personally canceled jackie gleason 
with a 37 share and red skelton with a 36 share you wont find a 
television executive doing that today 
things are so competitive today with new delivery systems and 
a fourth network that its difficult to get a large rating for a 
new show i dont know of anybody today who would cancel a show 
with a 30 share 
poltrack said fred silverman has become adept at producing hit 
shows that appeal to older viewers in the heat of the night 
matlock jake and the fatman and the perry mason 
movies all have older stars the father dowling mysteries was 
dropped by nbc but has been picked up by abc 
in the new season cbs island son snoops wolf 
major dad and peaceable kingdom are aimed at older viewers 
so are abcs chicken soup and nbcs the nutt house 
hardball and mancuso fbi 
movies and miniseries also lean heavily toward the older 
audience 
the networks are sticking with stars and shows that have 
worked in the past said frank its not that were seeing the 
graying of television what were seeing is each network 
concentrate more on the things they do best because older viewers 
do watch more television you may be seeing more older stars that 
appeal to that audience 
poltrack contends that the network trend toward more news and 
reality shows is based on more than just the fact that such shows 
are less expensive 
when people pass 40 they become more interested in news and 
informationbased shows the networks are losing audience to 
competitors but the news and information shows are stable youll 
see more of these shows in the 1990s 
a dissenter is paul schulman media buyer for 14 big companies 
representing 175 million in network ads i think the golden 
girls was a phenomenon in itself and all the imitations will bite 
the dust quickly when you buy time on shows that appeal to older 
people you pay for an enormous waste of circulation young people 
are still the key to high prices on a network the most expensive 
show on tv today is cheers because of its enormous appeal to the 
1849 audience the cosby show has a higher rating but it 
attracts a large number of kids the aim of every network 
programmer is to get another cheers or roseanne at cbs 
wiseguy doesnt get a big rating but thats the show all the 
advertisers ask for because of its young demographics

older golden said the pilot movie for our series baywatch 
which features mostly young actors had a lifeguard in his 60s he 
died in the movie but tested so well were going to add an older 
lifeguard to the series 
were developing a comedy series that focuses on a man in his 
70s 
deborah barylski an independent talent agent who has cast many 
comedy series is placing more older performers than ever before 
the scripts im getting are paying a lot more attention to that 
kind of character 
when i cast franks place we used so many elderly people 
that i really had to do a lot of digging to find new actors in that 
age range 
nbcs the golden girls starring bea arthur 63 betty 
white 67 estelle getty 66 and rue mcclanahan 53 set the stage 
for shows focusing on older characters others include cbs

aging is characterized by abrupt 
declines in mental ability often caused by personal experiences 
like forced retirement or a heart attack according to a longterm 
study that suggests some precautions 
the 33year seattle longitudinal study has tracked the 
intellectual ability of more than 4000 people ranging in age from 
their 20s to their 90s 
what we have to do now is document scientifically what 
anecdotally we have seen all along said k warner shaie head of 
penn state universitys gerontology center that people dont age 
the same way 
most aging studies have looked at group averages for different 
age groups rather than tracking changes in individuals over time 
shaie said every seven years the seattle study researchers test 
five areas verbal meaning spatial orientation inductive 
reasoning and number and word fluency 
people maintain their mental abilities on average into their 
60s shaie said from then on on average you can find some 
decline 
by 67 more than half the participants showed declines in 
reasoning ability though verbal ability didnt decline for most 
until their late 70s 
inductive reasoning tends to decline sooner because it 
involves speed of response shaie said between age 20 and 60 
reaction time approximately doubles so any skill requiring high 
levels of speed is vulnerable 
researchers recently looked at 838 participants who had suffered 
a significant drop in one or more of the five abilities over the 
previous seven years and found a link to jarring events in their 
lives such as the death of a spouse and mental decline shaie 
said people who are open to change active and continue to learn 
either formally or informally tend to age more slowly 
its more of a use it or lose it proposition he said 
some of the major risk factors are an unstimulating or sedentary 
life low education level with no effort to continue learning and 
heart disease he said 
as part of his research shaie also studied 120 people age 60 or 
older who had shown significant declines in mental ability 
their abilities in many cases could be improved by five hours of 
cognitive training sessions in which trainers led subjects in a 
series of increasingly difficult mental exercises for example to 
improve spatial orientation the subjects were told to mentally 
rotate increasingly abstract objects 
can you teach an old dog new tricks the answer to that is of 
course you can teach an old dog new tricks shaie said it may 
take a little longer as long as you are alive usually you are 
capable of learning 
several of those who failed to improve have been diagnosed with 
alzheimers disease the mysterious affliction that robs people of 
intellectual ability 
shaie began his research at the university of washington 
the argument is you gain with experience by that token the 
older you are the smarter you ought to be he said but on 
the other hand when we compare young and old people we find that 
at some point older people seem not to do as well as younger 
people i got intrigued by this paradox

about 500 schools with nearly 345000 students 
have signed up for the launch of the advertisersupported channel 
one daily news show for the classroom set to debut this spring the 
project sponsor said 
whittle communications a knoxville tennbased media company 
said sunday the subscriptions during the first eight weeks of 
active recruitment of schools puts the project halfway toward its 
goal of having 1000 schools equipped to receive the show at launch 
in march 1990 
it now expects to have 1000 schools signed up by the end of 
this year 
the channel one project has come under fierce attack by national 
educational groups state officials in california and new york and 
others who object to giving advertisers a platform for pitching 
products to students in the classroom 
channel one plans to send a 12minute news show geared toward 
students to participating schools every weekday each show will 
contain two minutes of paid advertising in exchange for the 
running the show schools get about 50000 each in television 
monitors videocassette recorders and satellite dishes 
christopher whittle chairman of whittle communications said 
his salesmen have approached about 1290 school districts 
representing 3855 schools in 24 states so far he said 10 percent 
of the districts have rejected the offer schools in 238 districts 
have signed up and talks continue in the rest 
he said he expects to have no trouble meeting the longerterm 
goal of having 7000 to 8000 schools participating in the program 
by the end of 1990 
this documents what we thought that local educators would 
view this very differently than national ones he said some 
critics are going to be very surprised 
installation of equipment is expected to begin in january 
whittle has previously said it had signed contracts with 
advertisers who have bought 56 percent of the available commercial 
time on channel one for the first year of programming

the average fee banks charge for 
bouncing a check has increased in the past two years and it varies 
widely from city to city according to a survey by an industry 
newsletter 
todays edition of bank rate monitor says the average fee for 
writing a check on insufficient funds in a checking account was 
1613 on oct 25 thats up from 1530 in april 1987 when it 
last did the survey 
the highest fees were found in philadelphia where some banks 
charge as much as 30 for a bounced check while the lowest were 
reported in new york where some charge customers less than 10 
according to the palm beachbased newsletters survey of 110 
institutions in major markets 
the publication said it found much the same variance in 1987 
cynthia mcgeever a vice president of atlantic financial federal 
in bala cynwyd pa gave competition as the reason 
philadelphiaarea banks charge more atlantic financial raised its 
fee from from 25 to 30 on oct 1 
we perceived the whole market was moving upward she told 
the newsletter people who had been at 20 were going to 25 
people at 25 were going to 30 i think it was a competitively 
driven decision 
but she thought 30 would be the upper limit at least for 
awhile 
you may see some people below 30 coming up to 30 but i 
dont think youll see a lot who will go higher than that 
the newsletter also reported that the number of banks and 
thrifts charging more than 15 per bounced check increased to 44 
from 34 
david allen a vice president of first city texas in dallas 
which raised its bouncedcheck fee from 1750 to 20 last year 
said banks need to consider the fact that bouncing a check is 
against the law not just what it costs to reprocess the check 
if you write checks in excess of the amount in the account 
you are attempting to get an interestfree loan from the bank he 
told the publication 
he suggested customers have an account with overdraft 
protection perhaps covered by a credit card 
bank rate monitor tracks average interest rates fees and 
charges by major banks thrifts and credit unions nationwide on a

a skittish junk bond market forced buyers of cnw 
corp to make significant lastminute changes in the financing of 
their 16 billion buyout of the railroad company officials 
involved in the plan said 
the group planned to issue 475 million in highyield or junk 
bonds as the final financing of the leveraged buyout to take the 
company private but in a twoweek trip to nearly two dozen cities 
officials of donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp the 
underwriters of the bond offering discovered buyer resistance 
the buyout group consists of dlj railroad company union pacific 
corp cnw and blackstone capital partners lp of new york 
chicagobased cnw is the parent of chicago and north western 
transportation co a 6000mile railroad with 8500 employees that 
operates in nine states most of them in the midwest 
garrett moran head of dljs highyield securities operations 
said friday that potential buyers of the railroad companys 
securities indicated they wanted equity as well as better terms for 
the junk bonds 
its a skittish market moran said 
the result is that cnws buyers will make a public equity 
offering amounting to 10 percent of the ownership 
blackstone which holds 72 percent of the stock and dlj which 
took 22 percent each will give up a portion of their holdings on a 
prorata basis for the initial public offering the remaining 6 
percent is held by management led by chairman robert schmiege 
in five years union pacific is expected to convert 100 million 
in preferred shares into 25 percent ownership 
the buyers also agreed to raise the yield on the junk bonds by 
one quarter of 1 percent to 1475 percent cnw spokesman james 
foote said dlj estimates the added interest will amount to 2 
million a year 
in addition the buyers have agreed to reset the interest rate 
12 months from now to a level that will allow the bonds to trade at 
101 percent of face value that lowers the risk for buyers who are 
leery of the value of junk bonds in the current market 
trouble in the junk bond market erupted last month when canadian 
retail company campeau corp said it would have trouble making 
payments on its highyield debt since then other junk bond issues 
have plunged in price

airlines carried a record number of 
passengers last year boosting worldwide profits to 16 billion 
the international air transport association said in a report for 
release today 
iatas annual report released on the eve of its general 
assembly in the polish capital predicted another bumper year in 
1989 but warned that air congestion would limit future expansion 
especially in europe 
in a bid to improve security and safety measures iata said it 
planned to step up checks on airport security and review the 
problem of human error in air crashes 
air congestion and security are expected to be the main themes 
at iatas annual meeting 
the report said iatas 187 member airlines carried 632 million 
passengers last year a 2 percent rise over the record set in 1987 
of these 190 million flew on international scheduled flights more 
than 6 percent more than in 1987 
a further 22 million people flew on domestic and international 
charter flights 
it predicted international scheduled passenger traffic would 
grow 8 percent in 1989 and 1990 although it should drop back to 
about 7 percent in the following three years 
the report said the most rapid expansion should be in asia and 
the pacific air traffic in europe and north america is expected to 
grow at a rate of about 6 percent a year 
insufficient airport capacity could limit growth in europe 
where congestion problems are most acute it said 
the lack of adequate airport and air space capacity to meet 
current and future demand continues to be the major problem facing 
the air transport industry today the report commented 
iata has identified 35 airports in west europe as congested 
and has said that sydney bombay hong kong and the japanese cities 
of tokyo and osaka also are suffering from lack of airport space 
the report said that the bomb explosion aboard pan am flight 103 
over lockerbie scotland showed flaws in the implementation of 
security measures 
it said that iata planned to increase the number and frequency 
of airport surveys around the world under its intensified aviation 
security program 
there were 20 plane crashes in 1988 five more than the previous 
year human error was the main cause of 16 of the crashes the 
statistics did not list losses caused by terrorism or sabotage 
iata is to hold a conference within the next two years to overhaul 
the industrys approach to the problem of the human factor it 
said 
it said recent accidents have led to growing concern about the 
structural safety of older aircraft but excess demand for new 
planes was forcing many airlines to modify rather than replace 
older aircraft this would add to costs and impose yet another 
constraint on the industrys growth it added 
the increase in demand for air travel boosted total profits of 
airlines belonging to the genevabased association to 16 billion 
last year up from 900 million in 1987 and compared with a loss of 
300 million in 1986

foreign business executives who attended an 
international forum here found chinese managers preoccupied with 
the governments current ideological campaign and imbued with a 
waitandsee coveryourback attitude 
foreign executives who attended the 9th symposium in china of 
the genevabased world economic forum also said it was clear during 
the threeday session last week that chinese leaders were willing 
to let many private and collective business enterprises go down 
the drain 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
chinese also said they were studying devaluation of the yuan and 
for the first time in 1990 may roll over some the nations foreign 
debt 
they said that in meetings with communist party general 
secretary jiang zemin and other officials the chinese emphasized 
that the nations economic reforms and opendoor policy were 
unaffected by the june crackdown on prodemocracy dissent and the 
subsequent conservative backlash against western liberalism 
they said the chinese urged the delegates from 65 foreign 
companies to see for themselves that china remains eager to do 
business with the outside world 
but they said that during the meetings which ended friday 
there was constant reference to upholding the socialist line and 
that everyone was quite careful to put themselves in an 
ideological framework they said this was quite different from 
past meetings when politics was never mentioned 
the sources said the more than 100 chinese managers who attended 
the forum were preoccupied with the question of increased communist 
party interference in the workplace one aspect of the campaign to 
assure the party a leading role in all areas of society 
the relationship of party and manager was clearly foremost in 
their minds one of the sources said 
they said they received conflicting signals on whether increased 
party authority would apply to joint chineseforeign ventures and 
whether employees of joint ventures would be subject to government 
plans to have recent college graduates work at the grassroots 
level for several years 
the sources said the chinese were generally more subdued than in 
previous years and were cautious in their statements they are 
very scared to say anything that might backlash on them one said 
they said the central role of state companies was repeatedly 
emphasized and that in contrast to previous years only one 
private entrepreneur participated in the forum 
chinas conservative leaders in stressing that china must 
remain a socialist state have relegated the nations thriving 
nongovernment companies to a minor role in the economy higher 
taxes and the inability to obtain credit have driven many smaller 
enterprises out of business 
the sources said party chief jiang was convincing in his pledges 
that china will remain open although he was blunt in stating that 
the nations opendoor policy will always have a socialist 
framework 
chinese officials said the government might resort to taking out 
new loans to repay loans due next year they said china which has 
a foreign debt of more than 40 billion owes somewhere between 4 
and 9 billion next year 
officials also said the current austerity program designed to 
curb economic growth and slow inflation could last two to five 
years more the squeeze on credit and cutback on building projects 
has affected many joint ventures and the business executives were 
told foreign investors will have to bring their own money

it appears to be another step in a growing militancy among the 
20000 members of the national automobile dealers association since 
ron tonkin took over earlier this year as the organizations 
president 
weeks ago as automakers prepared for the oct 1 beginning of 
the 1990 model year dealers said they would cut their orders 
perhaps by as much as 30 percent of last years 
tonkin through an advertisement in automotive trade magazines 
is turning up the heat 
he is urging dealers to take costcutting action especially in 
flooring flooring is the money paid mostly in interest to 
hold unsold automobiles on dealership lots it is one of the 
biggest expenses for dealers tonkin said 
cutting inventory will cut stockcarrying costs he said 
before the advertisement appeared dealers had begun cutting 
their orders on thursday when the companies reported sharply 
lower thirdquarter earnings officials with each of the big three 
automakers confirmed that recent dealer orders were lower than a 
year ago they declined to say by how much 
wards automotive reports a weekly industry newsletter said 
domestic automakers dealers had a 59day supply of cars on hand at 
the end of september 
the fast track news a salesoriented newsletter published every 
10 days by integrated automotive resources inc of wayne pa said 
dealers had a 66day car supply on hand as of oct 20 
tonkin suggested that a dealer who had considered a normal 
supply to be about 60 days slash that to 15 to 30 days 
lets face it he said if every dealer in this country 
decided that they had 50 percent too much inventory if it all 
happened at once its going to impact production 
while helping dealers cut their costs and improve their profits 
such a move could further hurt manufacturers who already have taken 
these hits 
the companies have said that incentive programs which gnawed 
away at profits during the first three quarters of this year 
probably will continue into the fourth quarter and 1990 but at 
lower levels 
vehicle sales this year are predicted to be somewhere between 
145 million and 15 million cars and light trucks that would be 
down significantly from the 156 million sold in 1988 
the sales downturn likely will result in more production cuts 
analysts have said mostly coming in shortterm downtime for 
inventory adjustment 
thirdquarter profits for the nations big three automakers 
reported last week were 273 percent below last years earnings 
and executives with each company have said the pressure on profits 
wont let up for at least a year 
the outgrowth of this tonkin said has been a flexing of 
strength a feeling on the part of dealers that they no longer have 
to fear stating their real feelings directly to the automakers and 
their sales representatives 
maybe its time that they joined us he said of the 
automakers we have been in the red for some time

general motors corp is planning to build a new 
engine plant in europe which might encompass plans for a joint 
components venture with jaguar plc sources said monday 
alternatively a separate engine plant might be built as part of 
general motors planned tieup with the british luxury car maker 
the sources said 
gm has 31 manufacturing centers in europe 
jaguar which has spurned advances from ford motor co because 
it wants to remain independent has been negotiating a cooperation 
agreement with gm for several weeks 
a gm spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping 
with british practice said the us auto maker was committed to 
guaranteeing jaguars independence and described recent talks as 
welladvanced 
a complex and detailed announcement of a joint agreement 
between general motors and jaguar is to be made by jaguar some 
time in the next two and a half weeks a source said 
the deal is expected to include plans for a jointly developed 
new auto model between general motors and jaguar and a number of 
agreements for joint component production sources close to the 
talks said 
general motors which eventually is expected to take a minority 
stake of up to 30 percent in jaguar would inject cash into the 
british company and make available its technology in return 
general motors hopes to benefit from the jaguar name and thwart 
ford from either linking up with or taking over jaguar 
sources close to general motors said it hasnt decided yet 
whether the new european engine plant would be built either in 
britain west germany or austria 
a key factor deciding if the plant will be built in britain is 
whether the group can reach an agreement with unions at vauxhall 
that they will speak with one voice a source said 
four unions represent workers at vauxhall a general motors unit 
though the company isnt necessarily calling for a single union 
deal it is looking for a new approach a source said 
general motors announced friday that it had received early us 
regulatory clearance to begin buying up to 15 percent of jaguar 
ford which previously obtained the same clearance has raised 
its stake in the british company to 132 percent it has said it is 
prepared to launch a full bid after takeover restrictions are 
dropped 
both companies are prevented from raising their share in jaguar 
to over 15 percent by a golden share the british government 
holds in jaguar until the end of 1990

an investor group has offered to buy the 
detroit free press for 68 million as lawyers prepared for oral 
arguments in the us supreme court in a case involving a joint 
operating agreement with the detroit news 
william d mcmaster head of the michigan investor group made 
the bid to buy the free press in a letter sunday to james k 
batten president of knightridder inc which owns the newspaper 
the michigan investor group if successful in purchasing the 
free press will continue the 158yearold detroit free press as an 
ongoing enterprise and will convert the editorial format to a 
statewide community newspaper mcmaster said in a news release 
the owners of the two newspapers gannett co inc and 
knightridder have said the joa would force the layoffs and a 
price increase knightridder has said it will sell the free press 
or close it if the joa is denied 
officials at knightridders miami headquarters were reviewing 
mcmasters letter this morning and could not immediately comment on 
it corporation spokeswoman heidi etzold said 
oral arguments were scheduled for today in the joa case 
its the time when all the elements of the case will converge 
all the people involved will be together for the last time said 
william schultz an attorney for joa opponents 
the supreme court justices may vote on the joa this week but 
their decision isnt likely to be made public until next summer 
eight of the nine justices will vote justice byron r white 
withdrew from the case citing personal reasons a 44 tie would 
uphold the joa 
the court may uphold two lowercourt approvals of the joa 
reject the merger or instruct attorney general richard thornburgh 
to reconsider the decision 
schultz represents michigan citizens for an independent press a 
group of readers advertisers weekly newspaper publisher w edward 
wendover former news columnist matt beer and state sen john 
kelly ddetroit 
the detroit free press which declared itself a failing 
newspaper in may 1986 filed under the newspaper preservation act 
of 1970 for permission to merge with the detroit news a joa allows 
newspapers to combine business operations but maintain editorial 
independence 
mcmaster said he hoped to complete the purchase of the free 
press by the end of the year provided the newspaper supplied the 
group with statements on its operations and assets 
opponents say the merger is prompted by greed and would hurt 
smaller area newspapers some question the independence of the two 
papers under a joa 
if this joa is upheld we will see the end of competitive 
journalism in this country by the end of the century said louis 
mleczko a news reporter and president of local 22 of the newspaper 
guild

petroleum producers arent doing enough to 
protect the environment from potentially hazardous oil field wastes 
and in some cases arent using common sense an environmental 
protection agency official said 
the oil and natural gas industry is way behind in waste 
management both in the volume and the toxicity of wastes 
generated robert tonetti acting deputy director for the epas 
waste management division said sunday 
tonetti also said the industry needs more regulation at all 
government levels especially in the area of commercialized waste 
management facilities 
he spoke to the independent petroleum association of america 
the conference in san antonio lasts through tuesday 
oil producers in some cases are not using common sense 
when disposing of exploration and production wastes allowing 
nonhazardous materials to be mixed with toxic chemicals tonetti 
said 
if not disposed of properly oil field wastes threaten public 
health and safety because wastes generated during oil exploration 
and production can wipe out groundwater supplies and contaminate 
soil tonetti said 
under the epas resource conservation and recovery act those 
wastes are exempt from hazardous waste regulations 
but the act applies the exemption only to drilling fluids 
produced waters and other wastes associated with crude oil or 
natural gas production 
the exemption does not include unused chemicals spent solvents 
empty drums used lubrication oils or acidic cleaners these 
chemicals sometimes get mixed with nonhazardous wastes and create 
a hazardous substance and a health risk tonetti said 
a lot of misunderstanding exists among producers about what is 
exempt and what is not he said

corn and soybean futures prices were mostly lower 
in early trading today on the chicago board of trade while wheat 
futures were narrowly mixed 
the slight drop in corn and soybean values partly reflected 
ideas that mild dry weather allowed harvesting of those crops to 
continue at a rapid pace over the weekend 
rain forecast for later this week in the corn belt could hamper 
harvest activity but with most of the crop already in traders are 
focusing more on foreign demand and on the south american soybean 
crop which is now being planted said victor lespinasse a trader 
with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
theyre behind normal and they need rain he said of soybean 
producers in brazil and argentina 
the soybean market also was pressured by expectations that a 
large number of deliveries will be posted against the november 
soybean contract on tuesday the first day for traders to declare 
their intentions to deliver soybeans against the contract 
wheat futures were supported by expectations that the soviet 
union will soon make a major purchase of us wheat lespinasse 
said 
in early trading wheat futures were 1 cents lower to 1 cent 
higher with the contract for delivery in december at 399 a 
bushel corn was cent lower to 1 cent higher with december at 
241 a bushel oat futures were cent lower to cent higher 
with december at 143 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent to 2 cents 
lower with november at 560 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 10 cent lower to 15 cent higher with december 
at 7410 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 23 cent 
higher with november at 8245 cents a pound live hogs were 
unchanged to 27 cent lower with december at 4590 cents a pound

rascality and privilege are bad seed in the 
stock market surviving repeated scandals and reforms and sprouting 
spontaneously again and again under the allure of easy or quick 
profits 
some important players think they see signs of the weed again 
as in the past there are many who see nothing wrong in this 
instance with socalled program trading some of the most esteemed 
names in the industry defend the practice the new york stock 
exchange accommodates program traders 
but there are others brokers big investors mutual funds 
listed companies among them who are determined to uproot the 
practice saying it caters to privilege and in doing so destroys 
public confidence 
these are individuals and institutions with real clout and they 
arent likely to back off they are angry and determined 
program trading takes various forms but the most controversial 
is stockindex arbitrage trading or shortterm computertriggered 
buying or selling to exploit brief inconsistencies between prices 
in spot and futures markets 
because it is based on market mechanics rather than underlying 
stock values the strategy is called mindless mindless or not 
some brokers play the game for their own accounts regardless of 
the impact on their own customers and because the formula is 
shared that impact can be explosive in either direction 
one of the latest to vent outrage is the investment management 
firm of neuberger amp berman which took fullpage newspaper 
advertisements to demand an end to the numbers racket 
program trading it said serves no economic purpose except to 
line the pockets of a handful of institutions and individuals 
in addition it said it causes mindless volatility drives 
individual investors from the market reduces stock values and 
mocks the fundamental truth that the price of a stock should be 
based on its value 
it is a type of insider trading the company says in which big 
players hooked up directly to the new york stock exchange 
computers buy and sell on 5 percent margin while other investors 
stand in line and must put up 50 percent 
in short program trading is nothing more than a numbers 
racket in which those running the numbers win while individual 
investors corporations and the american economy lose 
for those who follow stock market history this is an old theme 
an echo of similar instances in which it was alleged and sometimes 
shown that stock trading held special advantages for the powerful 
making it in effect a club 
the club is forever being broken up most memorably following 
the crash of 1929 but again in the late 1960s and early 1970s when 
some of the oldline brokers collapsed under an avalanche of paper 
and had to be dissolved 
the shenanigans of the 1920s culminating in the big collapse 
had scared individuals from the market in the 1960s the new york 
stock exchange sought to regain them urging investors to own 
your share of american business 
millions of small investors were lured into a market unprepared 
for them accounts were mishandled client money was misused some 
brokers made easy profits others lost on every sale individuals 
and institutions fell together 
after that government and the industry sought to reassure 
investors a form of insurance was introduced and to some extent 
it succeeded individuals remained a force but a shrinking one in 
relation to mutual and pension funds 
in recent years however there is evidence of a further retreat 
from the market in part because of marketmanipulation scandals 
over the five years 19841988 individual investors cashed in a 
halftrillion dollars of shares last year the decline amounted to 
105 billion the selling continues in 1989 
once again therefore the issue is public confidence in the 
market a market so volatile that even some of the biggest players 
are concerned 
a sound market they say is a nonvolatile one in which buying 
and selling is matched in an orderly fashion a volatile market 
they say is prima facie evidence of one that is failing its 
customers

will be back to work by wednesday union spokesman steve kovalaske

negotiators for striking machinists and boeing 
co resumed facetoface negotiations today in an attempt to end 
the unions 27day walkout 
federal mediator doug hammond brought both sides together after 
talking separately sunday with negotiators for the company and the 
international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
hammond said he wants to keep both sides talking until an 
agreement is reached but well see once they get here 
neither side however has changed its stance with the union 
saying it wants more money out of the prosperous aerospace company 
and boeing saying its offered all it will 
hammond said he could not talk about issues in the strike he 
said sundays talks simply involved negotiators redefining their 
positions to him and setting up terms of todays discussions 
the negotiations are the first since an effort by hammond to 
restart the talks failed oct 18 
hammond said there was no specific item that got the two sides 
talking again other than his decision it was time for negotiations 
to resume 
doug hammond is a professional he knows how to read the 
climate and when its time to get the two sides together said 
boeing spokesman paul binder 
some 57800 members of the machinists union are on strike 
against boeing nationwide in the walkout that began oct 4 
it is appropriate for boeing and the union to resume 
negotiations at this point to hear each others position across the 
bargaining table chief boeing negotiator larry mckean said late 
sunday in a statement beyond that i cannot speculate on the 
direction timing or ultimate outcome of the negotiations 
this round of bargaining will hopefully lead to a settlement 
but you have to be at the table to discuss the issues before you 
agree on them tom baker president of iam district lodge 751 
said sunday night 
of the money issue baker said succinctly they got it we 
want it 
boeing said today that its net earnings for the quarter ending 
sept 30 were 242 million or 105 a share on revenue of 636 
billion compared with profits of 144 million or 63 cents a 
share on revenue of 372 billion a year earlier 
for the first nine months of 1989 boeing had net earnings of 
598 million or 260 a share on revenue of 1543 billion 
compared with earnings of 440 million or 192 a share on 
revenue of 1209 billion 
the thirdquarter figures dont show effects from the strike 
but boeing warned today that the walkout would seriously hurt sales 
and earnings the rest of the year 
the strike began after machinists overwhelmingly rejected 
boeings threeyear contract offer that included annual pay raises 
of 4 percent 3 percent and 3 percent and bonuses of 8 percent in 
the first year and 3 percent in the second the offer also had 
costofliving increases to virtually cover inflation a reduction 
in mandatory overtime from 200 to 160 hours per quarter and higher 
benefits 
machinists represent 43300 boeing workers in the seattle area 
12000 in wichita kan 1700 in portland ore and a few hundred 
others in california hawaii utah montana wyoming and other 
states 
boeing which employs 164000 workers worldwide and about 
106000 in the seattle area has kept its plants open and delivered 
15 commercial jets since the strike began 
machinists last week collected the first of their 100aweek 
strike payments health insurance for strikers expires this 
wednesday though employees can extend the coverage by paying 
premiums themselves 
last friday boeing announced plans to reorganize its military 
and aerospace business to reduce losses and cut overhead the 
changes primarily involve redrawing managment assignments with 
little change in job assignments or employment level at any plants 
boeing spokesmen said the decision was unrelated to the strike 
the jets boeing has delivered during the strike were all 
virtually completed before the walkout began so far this year 
boeing has received orders for 807 commercial jets valued at 43 
billion

slightly lower monday on the chicago board of trade as the corn and 
soybean markets succumbed to harvest pressure and pulled wheat 
prices down as well 
the selling mainly reflected a perception that mild dry weather 
allowed harvesting of corn and soybeans to continue at a rapid pace 
over the weekend analysts said 
rain forecast for later this week could hamper harvest activity 
in the eastern corn belt and the southeast but most of the 
midwestern crops have already been gathered and traders are 
increasingly turning their attention to export demand which 
remained slack on monday 
the soybean market also was pressured lower by expectations that 
a large number of delivery notices will be posted against the 
november soybean contract on tuesday the first day for traders to 
declare their intentions to deliver soybeans against the contract 
at the close of trading wheat futures were cent to 2 cents 
lower with the contract for delivery in december at 396 a 
bushel corn was cent to 2 cents lower with december at 241 a 
bushel oats were cent to cent lower with december at 142 a 
bushel soybeans were 1 cents lower to 1 cent higher with november 
at 561 a bushel

two more wall street brokerages said monday they 
would limit their program trading joining other major firms that 
have backed away from the strategy under pressure following the 
recent stock market volatility 
merrill lynch amp co said that effective immediately it would not 
execute index arbitrage for its clients kidder peabody amp co said 
it had ceased index arbitrage for its own accounts but would 
continue using the strategy for its customers 
the announcements followed similar moves by large brokerages 
last week on friday morgan stanley group inc and bear stearns amp 
co two of the biggest users of program trading said they would 
stop using index arbitrage to trade for their own accounts 
painewebber group inc stopped using all forms of the strategy 
index arbitrage is a computerized trading strategy aimed at 
profiting on brief and minute differences between prices of stocks 
and stockindex futures which are traded on chicago futures 
exchanges 
the trading tactic in which millions of shares can be bought or 
sold in seconds often is geared to make shortterm profits during 
excitable markets critics say it can accentuate market movements 
leading to sharp price swings such as the 190point drop in the dow 
jones industrial average on oct 13 
merrill lynch halted index arbitrage for its own account nearly 
two years ago following the black monday stock market crash which 
critics said was worsened by program trading 
in mondays statement merrill chairman william a schreyer and 
president daniel p tully said the causes of excess market 
volatility are far more complex than any particular computer 
trading strategy 
but they conceded that index arbitrage has been clearly 
identified in the investing publics mind as a contributing factor 
to excess market volatilty 
merrill would stop executing such trades until the firm is 
satisfied that effective controls are in place the statement 
read 
kidder was the third most active index arbitrage firm during 
september trading 346 million shares with the strategy during the 
month while merrill lynch ranked seventh with 128 million shares 
according to the new york stock exchange morgan stanley led all 
firms with volume of 531 million shares 
the brokerage houses have come under considerable pressure to 
eliminate the strategy last week kemper financial services inc 
and keystone group inc two major institutional investors said 
they would no longer buy or sell stock through brokerages that 
conduct index arbitrage phoenix mutual life insurance co of 
hartford conn followed suit friday 
on monday the investment management firm neuberger amp berman 
took out a fullpage new york times advertisement imploring stop 
the numbers racket on wall street the ad urged investors to 
voice their concerns in writing to securities and exchange 
commission chairman richard breeden and federal reserve chairman 
alan greenspan 
according to new york stock exchange figures program trading of 
all kinds accounted for a record 138 percent of average daily 
volume in september the most since the exchange began keeping such 
figures in july 1988

miller brewing co on monday introduced its 
first nonalcoholic brew a product it said was spurred by growing 
antidrinking sentiment in the united states 
miller also announced plans for a 12week super bowl advertising 
campaign featuring two celebritycoached teams battling on a 
football field over rival taste great and less filling 
claims for miller lite beer 
millers sharps brand nonalcohol brew will be introduced for 
sale nationwide jan 1 and will be backed by a national marketing 
effort but no testmarketing miller officials said 
nonalcoholic beers have been popular in europe for some time 
and other us brewers including anheuserbusch cos inc pabst 
and g heileman already sell nonalcohol or lowalcohol brands 
miller touts sharps as having a taste like real beer due to a 
new brewing process the company developed 
miller experimented in 1984 with a lowalcohol beer also called 
sharps but the brew did not advance beyond test marketing 
annual us production of nonalcoholic beers is about a million 
barrels a year compared with the national beer market of more than 
182 million barrels but the nonalcoholic segment is growing at 
the rate of 10 percent to 15 percent a year while the overall beer 
market has been stable analysts said 
david krishock new products category director for miller said 
growth in the nonalcoholic beer market prompted miller to bring 
sharps out nationwide without test marketing 
the new brew will have 74 calories per 12ounce serving about 
half the calories of regular beer and will be sold in bottles 
cans and kegs 
jerry steinman publisher of the industry newsletter beer 
marketers insights said millers introduction of a nonalcohol 
beer was not surprising in view of an antialcohol atmosphere he 
said prevailed in the united states 
steinman said nonalcoholic beers had not proven widely popular 
in the united states largely because they lacked the taste of 
regular beer and because brewers had found it difficult to brew a 
nonalcohol beer with real beer taste 
krishock said most brewers produced a nonalcoholic product by 
using a normal brewing cycle and then removing the alcohol along 
with the real beer taste 
under millers new brewing process when the yeast is added to 
the wort the end product of the barleycooking process the 
temperature is kept low so that fermentation is slow and produces 
minimal alcohol at the same time that the yeast contributes its 
taste to the brew 
miller said its super bowl ad campaign which will begin nov 5 
will feature 12 weeks of television radio and print advertising 
and a consumer sweepstakes offering expensepaid trips to super 
bowl xxiv in new orleans 
the celebrity teams will be coached by pro football hall of 
famer larry csonka and actor george wendt of televisions 
cheers while actor richard moll of televisions night 
court will referee 
last year anheuserbusch ran a super bowl ad campaign featuring 
battling teams of animated helmetclad beer bottles pitting its 
budweiser and bud light brands against each other

oil futures prices drifted lower in moderate 
trading monday led by weakness in the wholesale gasoline market 
on the new york mercantile exchange the november contract for 
unleaded regular gasoline fell 121 cents to 5341 cents a gallon 
the contract gained nearly a penny on friday amid reports about 
possible problems at a chevron corp refinery in el segundo calif 
chevron confirmed late in the day that a catalytic cracking unit 
with an output of 60000 barrels a day of gasoline had been closed 
for repairs the company said however that the closure would not 
seriously affect output 
gasoline gained friday on news about the chevron refinery 
it shouldnt have gained and today it came back off said bob 
baker an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
weakness in the gasoline market dragged other oil prices lower 
traders said 
the december contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil closed at 1972 a barrel down 5 cents 
january wti fell 10 cents to 1947 a barrel 
no 2 heating oil for november delivery settled 004 cent lower 
at 5764 cents a gallon while december heating oil rose 007 cent 
to end at 5803 cents a gallon 
analysts said crude prices which have weakened in recent days 
could drift lower in advance of the nov 25 meeting of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries in vienna austria 
traders have attributed the decline to concern about higher opec 
production in the face of slackening us demand 
various estimates have put the cartels total output at around 
23 million barrels a day well in excess of its official quota of 
205 million barrels a day and while various opec members have 
suggested that increasing worldwide demand supports the higher 
output some analysts argue that world oil prices could weaken if 
the united states the largest consumer of oil cannot absorb some 
of the excess

copper futures prices fell sharply monday on new yorks 
commodity exchange extending the markets twoweekold slide amid 
new selling prompted by a continued easing of supply fears 
on other futures markets monday precious metals retreated pork 
bellies surged while livestock futures were mixed oil futures 
fell grains and soybeans slipped and stockindex futures were 
narrowly mixed 
copper settled 30 cent to 335 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in december at 1128 a pound its lowest price since 
aug 10 
copper traders began selling at the opening bell in reaction to 
the london metal exchanges report of a smallerthanexpected 550 
metric ton decline in warehouse stocks of copper last week the 
market had expected a drawdown of as much as 4000 tons 
the report reinforced perceptions that pressure on copper 
supplies is easing following the recent settlement of a twomonth 
canadian mine strike and the expected reopening of mexicos largest 
copper mine after a twomonth shutdown 
twothirds of the nearterm production problems seem to have 
been resolved said metals economist fred demler of drexel 
burnham lambert inc referring to the canadian and mexican mines 
a third major copper mine in papua new guinea has been shut down 
since midjuly due to terrorism in the area 
the market appeared to ignore news of a potential new supply 
threat in chile where workers at two mines two mills and a 
smelter operated by an exxon corp affiliate took a strike vote 
friday that could result in a strike as early as next thursday 
when their contract expires 
the chilean operation known as exxon disputada produces about 
115000 metric tons of copper annually less than any of the 
aforementioned three mines said tom torget a spokesman for exxon 
coal and minerals co in houston 
under chilean law a strike would be required next monday if no 
agreement is reached by then torget said but he said we think 
both sides are interested in an agreement 
gold and silver futures fell modestly on the comex but 
sustained most of the gains made last thursday and friday when 
gold rose more than 9 an ounce 
demler said the gold markets refusal to sell off sharply could 
be construed as a bullish signal 
but analyst stephen platt of dean witter reynolds inc predicted 
gold would encounter some formidable resistance at about 383 a 
troy ounce in the december contract 
gold settled 40 cents to 120 lower with december at 38080 a 
troy ounce silver was 37 cents to 38 cents lower with december 
at 5283 a troy ounce 
frozen porkbelly futures rallied strongly on the chicago 
mercantile exchange on reports that yugoslavia had bought 200 
metric tons of us bellies for november delivery and was 
considering buying up to 800 tons more a pork belly is the part of 
a hog from which bacon is made 
pork bellies settled 125 cents to 175 cents higher with 
february at 5360 cents a pound live cattle finished 25 cent 
lower to 13 cent higher with december at 7415 cents a pound 
feeder cattle were 40 cent lower to 15 cent higher with november 
at 8255 cents a pound live hogs were 42 cent lower to 05 cent 
higher with december at 4575 cents a pound 
oil futures retreated on the new york mercantile exchange paced 
by the november gasoline contract which expires on tuesday 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 26 cents 
lower with november at 1834 a barrel heating oil was 16 cent 
lower to 07 cent higher with november at 5764 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 117 cents lower to 35 cent higher with 
november at 5345 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures prices closed slightly lower on the 
chicago board of trade as the corn and soybean markets succumbed to 
harvest pressure pulling wheat down as well 
wheat futures settled cent to 1 cents lower with december at 
396 a bushel corn was cent to 2 cents lower with december at 
241 a bushel oats were cent to cent lower with december at 
142 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents lower to 1 cent higher with 
november at 560 a bushel 
stockindex futures were narrowly mixed on the chicago merc 
where the contract for december delivery of the stocks in the 
standard amp poors 500 index settled unchanged at 33720 points

federal protection for 30 million us 
workers pensions could be at stake in a dispute the supreme court 
agreed to resolve monday 
the justices said they will decide what authority the pension 
benefit guaranty corp a federal agency has to order employers to 
revive scraped pension plans 
a federal appeals court limited such authority by setting aside 
the agencys order that ltv corp and its subsidiary ltv steel 
co restore three pension plans with unfunded liabilities of 23 
billion 
james b lockhart executive director of the pbgc told 
reporters monday that the lower courts misunderstood and 
misapplied the agencys arguments in finding for ltv by pursuing 
the matter he said pbgc is trying to prevent future losses from 
companies that might want to copycat the ltvtype approach 
government lawyers say the ruling if not overturned could make 
the agency an openended source of industry bailouts and spark 
a financial crisis similar to the one facing the governments 
insurance program for the savings and loan industry 
the justices decision is expected by next july 
in other matters monday the court 
heard arguments over a challenge to the partial merger of 
detroits two daily newspapers 
let stand rulings that blocked a nebraska agency from imposing 
mandatory blood testing for aids of employees who come into direct 
contact with the mentally retarded people the agency serves 
left intact rulings that may let urbana ohio ban as obscene 
five nationally distributed adult magazines generally not 
considered hardcore pornography 
was urged during an oral argument session to strike down as 
taxation without representation a federal judges order that 
doubled local property taxes to pay for racially desegregating 
kansas city mo public schools 
the pensions case focuses on the power of the pension benefit 
guaranty corp the agency that protects the pension benefits of 
the 30 million americans who participate in singleemployer defined 
benefit pension plans 
when a pension plan is ended with insufficient money to satisfy 
promised benefits the federal agency becomes the pension plans 
trustee taking over its assets and liabilities the agency then 
pays all benefits workers had earned as of the date the pension 
plan ended 
in fiscal year 1988 the pbgc paid 3247 million in insured 
benefits to 113000 retirees who participated in 1476 terminated 
pension plans 
dallasbased ltv corp and ltv steel after filing for 
reorganization under federal bankruptcy law in 1986 advised the 
pbgc that they could not and would not fund the three pension plans 
they sponsored the plans which have about 100000 participants 
were terminated in 1987 
in a deal with the united steelworkers of america union 
however ltv steel agreed to what government lawyers contend is a 
followon arrangement under it ltv agreed to make up any 
benefits lost to employees because of the pension plans 
termination those benefits not covered by the federal pension 
insurance program 
the result was employees continued to receive the same benefits 
they did before the plans were terminated and payment of unfunded 
pension liabilities shifted to the pbgc 
the pbgc contends such arrangements are abusive and the agency 
ordered ltv to reassume responsibility for the three pension plans 
when ltv refused the agency sought to enforce its order in 
federal court a judge ruled that the pbgc lacked the authority to 
issue such an order and the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
upheld that ruling last may 12 
the pbgc then sought supreme court review contending that the 
appeals court ruling places the pension insurance program in 
serious financial jeopardy 
justice department lawyers sided with the pbgc telling the high 
court that last mays ruling threatens to undermine a program 
already seriously in debt 
but lawyers for ltv said congress specifically rejected 
proposed prohibitions on followon plans when substantially 
amending the employee retirement income security act erisa in 
1987

a state judge spared the united mine workers 
from another hefty fine monday to give negotiations mediated by 
former labor secretary bill usery a chance to progress 
russell county circuit judge donald mcglothlin said the union 
violated his strike restrictions 84 times in august and september 
and said nearly half of the acts were violent the most blatant act 
of defiance he cited occurred last month when 98 union members 
invaded pittston coal groups main preparation plant and occupied 
the building for four days 
however mcglothlin who previously issued fines totaling 31 
million for illegal strike activities directed at pittston said he 
wanted to avoid any action that could impede progress at the 
bargaining table 
the judge said he would wait until dec 8 to decide whether to 
impose additional fines 
the court feels there seems to be high hope for progress in 
contract talks mcglothlin said in a courtroom filled with striking 
miners and supporters its important to the parties that mr 
usery and the negotiators for both sides have the best possible 
circumstances to work with 
labor secretary elizabeth dole last week appointed usery as a 
super mediator in the strike the walkout involving pittstons 
1695 union workers in virginia west virginia and kentucky began 
april 5 
previous talks conducted under the auspices of the federal 
mediation and conciliation service produced virtually no progress 
mcglothlin also said he wanted his postponement to encourage 
striking miners to put an end to violent acts undertaken to disrupt 
coal shipments and intimidate replacement workers the judge said 
that for three weeks after the preparation plant takeover 
virtually no violations of strike restrictions were reported 
bruce bratten a member of the unions negotiating team said he 
was surprised and pleased by mcglothlins decision i think hes 
given the process a chance to work 
pittston attorney stephen hodges said if it helps end the 
violence who can complain about that not me 
bratten said mcglothlins previous fines stretching back to 
june allowed pittston to stall in contract talks they had a 
direct impact on pittstons desire to negotiate in good faith the 
state court placed economic pressure on the union 
mcglothlin heard two days of testimony in a contempt of court 
hearing last week and said he wanted to wait until monday to rule 
in order to review the evidence

unocal corp said monday its thirdquarter 
profits fell 19 percent due to escalating costs to produce oil and 
gas and lower refining and marketing results

and coal company earned 79 million or 67 cents a share down from 
97 million or 84 cents a share in the comparable 1988 quarter 
revenue rose 8 percent to 28 billion from 26 billion 
unocal chairman richard j stegemeier said the quarters 
negative results were partially offset by higher crude oil prices 
and improved domestic natural gas production a 6 million 
aftertax gain from the sale of land in canada and a 14 million

at least one of chrysler corps 12 north 
american assembly plants will have to close by the end of next year 
and some projects may be delayed as the automaker wrestles with a 
smaller market chrysler chairman lee iacocca says 
iacocca in an interview published in mondays automotive news 
didnt say which plants would be closed but speculation centers on 
the companys st louis car plant as being the most likely 
that plant makes the dodge daytona and the chrysler lebaron 
coupe and convertible last year when the company renovated its 
newark del plant for dodge spirit and plymouth acclaim 
production it modified tooling to enable it to make the two 
lebarons as well 
you have got too much capacity chasing too few customers in 
the richest market in the world iacocca said it will only be 
solved one of two ways the way we will probably have to do it is 
that general motors ford and chrysler will have to close some 
plants period 
or there would be a trade bill and we would shut our 
borders he said but we wont do that and i dont advocate 
that 
gm plans to idle its lakewood assembly plant in georgia in 
march the company already has closed plants in framingham mass 
and pontiac mich ford officials have said they will deal with 
overcapacity by trimming overtime which has been high in some ford 
factories 
we definitely will have to close more than we have closed to 
date which is a 100yearold plant called kenosha iacocca said 
there is a plant or two that probably will be closed 
chrysler inherited the plant in kenosha wis when it bought 
american motors corp 
besides the plant closing iacocca said some projects may be 
delayed but that the companys new lh and lx car programs will 
continue cars derived from the two platforms will be introduced in 
the early 1990s 
that one is not going to be deferred because it is in the 
heart of the market he said and we would like some 
strengthening there

boeing co enjoyed record thirdquarter profits 
68 percent higher than in the same period in 1988 but the jet 
builder warned monday that a lingering strike by machinists will 
hurt badly the rest of the year 
the company also said it is having substantial losses on 
some government and defense programs 
boeing released its earnings statement as its negotiators met 
with those of the machinists union in an attempt to end the 
fourweekold strike six hours of talks produced only an agreement 
to meet again tuesday 
federal mediator douglas hammond who called mondays session 
said he hoped to keep the two sides at the table until a new 
contract offer can be worked out 
boeing chairman frank shrontz said the higher profits for the 
quarter and first nine months were due mostly to higher sales 
volume and lower research development and other new business costs 
for commercial aircraft and computing 
but he said that performance was partially offset by losses and 
higher research and development costs for defense programs and a 
higher effective federal tax rate 
net earnings for the quarter ending sept 30 were 242 million 
or 105 a share on revenue of 636 billion compared with 
profits of 144 million or 63 cents a share on revenue of 372 
billion a year earlier 
boeing spokesman paul binder said both profits and sales for the 
most recent quarter were records for the company 
for the first nine months of 1989 boeings profits were 598 
million or 260 a share on revenue of 1543 billion compared 
with net earnings of 440 million or 192 a share on revenue of 
1209 billion 
while that looks good at first glance closer inspection 
indicates our net profit was only 39 percent for the first nine 
months binder said 
our profit margin is approximately 1 percent less than the 
average of all us manufacturing companies and we simply must do 
better to remain competitive 
union spokesman jack daniels read it differently that falls 
into line with our contention that their profits indicate they 
should make a better offer to the machinists union 
stock analysts said boeings performance was about what they 
anticipated although they took special note of the downbeat 
forecasts for defense work and strike effects 
thats the first time ive seen any indication they feel there 
will be a severe impact on the fourth quarter said paul nisbet 
of prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
at the end of the second quarter they mentioned matter of 
factly that the companys defense and space programs would not be 
profitable at the end of 1989 said william deatherage analyst 
at dean witter reynolds inc in new york now theyre saying its 
a significant loss 
boeing announced on friday a major reorganization of its defense 
division 
the thirdquarter figures dont show effects of the strike by 
about 57800 union machinists who walked out oct 4 after rejecting 
a 3year contract offer 
the strike by the machinists union will have a serious adverse 
impact on fourthquarter sales and earnings and on the companys 
cash and shortterm investment position shrontz said in the 
earnings statement 
that was one of the strongest acknowledgments from boeing about 
damages from the strike which has severely slowed aircraft 
deliveries 
when the strike began boeing had hoped to deliver another 94 
aircraft by the end of the year so far it has delivered only 15

committee considered other options such as a recapitalization 
funded by debt before they decided on the sale
