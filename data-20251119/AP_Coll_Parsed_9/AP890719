armed soldiers scattered hundreds of 
students and beat and herded some into trucks as the military 
government thwarted a planned mass opposition rally in rangoon 
wednesday witnesses said 
it was not immediately known whether anyone was injured 
opposition leaders canceled the rally after the government put up 
barricades throughout the capital and sent large numbers of troops 
into the streets with harsh new martial law powers sources said 
opposition leader aung san suu kyi had said she would lead 
thousands in a rally to mark martyrs day which commemorates the 
1947 assassination of her father and other independence leaders 
she said in a telephone interview from bangkok that she canceled 
it to avoid bloodshed 
the soldiers blocked off all the roads and prepared literally a 
killing field for the people said ms suu kyi general secretary 
of the national league for democracy 
word of the cancelation apparently did not reach students who 
marched toward the martyrs mausoleum carrying wreaths they intended 
to lay there 
ms suu kyi said soldiers used sticks to beat some of about 3000 
students in the capitals swegondine district 
a western diplomat said he saw an army patrol scatter two groups 
of students one of several hundred and another of more than 1000 
near the shwedagon pagoda the citys buddhist temple 
about 25 to 30 soldiers advanced in line across the road some 
had bayonets leveled at the crowd others had grenade 
launchers he said by telephone 
soldiers pursued students down a side street dragged some of 
them out and hit them a few times with batons he said 
i saw about 15 or 20 picked up and put in a truck he said 
the others fled littering the streets with wreaths he said 
there also were reports of clashes between soldiers and students 
near the school of fine arts in the bahan district about half a 
mile from the mausoleum 
a heavilyguarded ceremony sponsored by the government was held 
at the mausoleum in the morning although it was boycotted by most 
opposition parties 
downtown streets were largely empty in the afternoon as many 
people stayed indoors apparently fearing a clash between the 
opposition and the military 
troops toting automatic rifles patrolled most intersections 
where there was little traffic and people ran to hide when military 
vehicles passed 
all day the state radio repeated new regulations issued tuesday 
that include death penalties for those violating martial law 
unauthorized gatherings of more than five people have been banned 
under martial law 
martyrs day a public holiday commemorates burmese leaders who 
were assassinated the year before burma gained independence from 
britain most prominent of the martyrs was suu kyis father aung 
san 
ms suu kyi said martial law is in full swing now it is what 
they have always wanted 
they knew perfectly well that people wanted this to be a 
perfectly peaceful ceremony but they have used this day as an 
excuse to impose martial law she said their rule is based on 
intimidation they dont have any other way of running the 
country 
ms suu kyi is the most strident critic of military rule since 
she emerged at the head of last years uprising for democracy 
the army killed thousands of unarmed demonstrators over several 
months before army commander gen saw maung seized power killing 
hundreds more demonstrators to reestablish control in september 
the pace of dissent has quickened in the past month with ms suu 
kyi drawing large crowds to her rallies

britains top law officer pledged wednesday to 
press ahead with reforms of the legal system despite fierce 
opposition from most judges barristers and even the attorney 
general 
lord mackay lord high chancellor presented his final propoals 
in a policy document called a white paper which parliament will 
debate 
prime minister margaret thatcher appointed mackay to the cabinet 
post in 1987 and told him to propose reforms to do away with 
restrictive legal practices britains legal system has been 
criticized for years as expensive and inaccessible to those who 
cannot afford high fees 
mackays proposals probably will become law since mrs thatchers 
government has a 100seat majority in the 650seat house of commons 
mackay made some concessions in the white paper but kept most of 
his original proposals including ending the monopoly that 
barristers have on arguing cases in court he would open that 
practice to solicitors who now are confined to consulting with 
clients 
solicitors and barristers charge for their cases even if they 
lose mackay has proposed that lawyers in civil cases be paid only 
if they win a case 
as a concession he said a proposed committee on conduct would 
not be empowered to decide the rules governing the legal profession 
but would have an advisory role instead mackay proposed that he 
and senior judges decide any changes in the rules 
the governments aim in all these changes is to make the legal 
system of this country more straightforward more flexible and 
above all more responsive to the citizens choices and needs whilst 
at the same time maintaining the standards necessary to achieve 
justice he wrote in the white paper 
in the past six months of debate over the proposals judges 
threatened to halt court work although they eventually backed down 
and barristers launched a national campaign of denunciation 
attorney general sir patrick mayhew said he would consider 
resigning although he didnt 
david tench legal chief of the consumers association said lord 
mackays proposals would be a fundamental step in the right 
direction toward a better more responsive legal profession

here are daytoday highlights of 
events on the apollo 11 moon flight 20 years ago this week 
 
saturday july 19 1969 
apollo 11 raced into the shadow of the moon and the astronauts 
reported a spectacular first sighting of their destination 
armstrong described a brilliant solar corona as the moon eclipsed 
all but the halo of gases surrounding the sun it looks like an 
eerie sight he reported 
the spaceship slipped behind the backside of the moon and 
collins fired the main engine for 5 minutes 57 seconds to slow 
their speed from 5465 mph to 3726 mph settling into an orbit 
ranging from 70 to 196 miles above the surface later they 
triggered the engine again to achieve a more circular path with a 
low point of 62 miles and high point of 75 miles

sunday july 20 1969 
armstrong and aldrin entered the lunar module eagle and after 
checking its systems they cast off from columbia they fired the 
crafts engine to start the descent to the moon as they neared the 
surface they had to overcome computer alarms and had to fly around 
a boulder field with fuel running low but armstrong found a 
relatively smooth spot and touched down on the sea of tranquillity 
with just enough fuel for seven more seconds of flying 
houston tranquillity base here the eagle has landed 
commander armstrong reported the time was 41742 pm edt 
at 1056 pm armstrong stepped off a landing leg ladder and 
planted the first human footprint on the moon aldrin followed 18 
minutes later and for about two hours with more than 500 million 
people watching on earth they explored the surface planted the 
american flag gathered 50 pounds of lunar rocks and soil and spoke 
with president nixon through a radiotelephone hookup

monday july 21 1969 
precisely 69 seconds after collins and columbia passed over 
tranquillity base armstrong fired eagles ascent engine and it rose 
swiftly off the moon after a stay of 21 hours 37 minutes the 
eagle is back in orbit armstrong radioed 
for more than 3 hours armstrong and aldrin flew a series of 
tricky rendezvous maneuvers closing in on columbia the two ships 
linked up and armstrong and aldrin rejoined collins in the command 
ship transferring their lunar booty eagle no longer needed was 
jettisoned to orbit the moon for several weeks before lunar gravity 
tugged it down to a crash landing

tuesday july 22 1969 
collins fired columbias main engine for 2 minutes 29 seconds to 
propel the ship out of lunar orbit and start a 60hour trip back to 
earth weve got you coming home mission control radioed 
within hours they left the influence of lunar gravity and were 
firmly in the grip of earths gravity accelerating toward home a 
short burst of the main engine set them on a precise course to land 
two days later in the pacific ocean southwest of hawaii where the 
recovery carrier uss hornet waited

wednesday july 23 1969 
a final television show from columbia highlighted an otherwise 
quiet day as columbia sped closer to earth and the three astronauts 
relaxed and monitored spacecraft systems armstrong showed viewers 
two sealed boxes in which were packed precious bits of soil and rock 
that he and aldrin had collected on the moon he explained the 
samples were placed in containers in the vacuum of the moon and were 
sealed to prevent possible contamination of the earth 
as the earth got nearer the astronauts yearned for home no 
matter where you travel its nice to get home aldrin said

thursday july 24 1969 
columbia flashed into earths atmosphere at 24500 mph gradually 
slowing until three main parachutes opened and dropped the craft 
into warm polynesian waters southwest of hawaii at 1250 pm edt 8 
days 3 hours 18 minutes after the historic moon journey began the 
astronauts landed nine miles from the recovery carrier uss hornet 
president nixon was on the deck of the carrier to greet the 
astronauts even though he could not shake their hands 
the moon travelers immediately went into an elaborate quarantine 
routine in which they would remain for 16 days to protect the earth 
from any possible contamination from moon germs the president faced 
the three men through a glass window in their isolation van below 
decks flanked by a marine honor guard as a result of what you 
have done the world has never been closer together nixon said

hawaii island beach parks were closed tuesday in 
anticipation of heavy surf from hurricane dalilia and residents 
were urged to stock up on emergency supplies although the storm 
appeared to turn away 
at 2 pm hst tuesday the hurricane was 450 miles southeast of 
hilo on hawaii island moving slightly north of a westerly course 
at 12 mph the national weather service said its maximum sustained 
wind speed was 75 mph a storm is classified a hurricane when that 
speed reaches 74 mph wind gusted to 90 mph 
the weather service said it was too early to tell whether the 
slight shift north portended a significant change in course or 
whether it meant dalilia had a wobbling eye a fairly common 
phenomenon among hurricanes 
if the hurricane took a more northwesterly course it would pass 
closer to the southern coasts of the islands the service said in a 
statement 
earlier in the day data provided by the crew of an air force 
hurricanehunting airplane indicated the hurricanes center was 
slightly farther south than it was monday said clarence lee head 
of the central pacific hurricane center here 
if it continued on the track determined by the airplane dalilia 
would pass 250 miles south of hawaii island southernmost in the 
hawaiian chain wednesday morning lee said 
dalilias rapid westerly movement had slowed by nearly half from 
20 mph during a 24hour period he added 
dalilias current location and apparent movement is a favorable 
sign for hawaii lee said if the trend continues the hurricane 
may pass far south of the island chain and the only effect would 
be an increase in surf along the southern coasts of the islands 
a tropical storm watch remained in effect for hawaii island 
meaning wind up to 73 mph and heavy rain were possible if dalilia 
moved farther north than expected 
hawaii island residents were urged to stock up on batteries 
canned goods and other emergency supplies in case the storm veered 
northward 
a high surf advisory was issued for beaches along the south shore 
of hawaii island southernmost in the hawaiian chain in 
anticipation of waves as high as 15 feet 
were going to be keeping these beaches closed as a 
precautionary measure said bruce butts a spokesman for hawaii 
county civil defense the tides are pretty high that will make 
surf especially dangerous

a lawmaker says the state known to some detractors 
as taxachusetts needs an official shrub befitting its budget 
woes the taxus yew 
republican rep peter forman filed a bill tuesday to add the 
ornamental shrub common to the state to the list of official state 
symbols 
the name of this humble fir echoes the calls from the governor 
democrat michael s dukakis and many elected democrats taxes on 
you taxes for you more taxes at every turn said the house 
minority whip 
the legislatures democratic majority recently supported a 700 
million temporary income tax increase and if it agrees to formans 
bill the taxus yew could join such other symbols as the the 
official state fish cod the official state beverage cranberry 
juice and the official state dog boston terrier 
forman a plymouth representative who has a taxus yew on his 
statehouse office desk suggested the shrub might be planted at 
major intersections across the state 
in that way people would be reminded of the recent fiscal 
actions of the governor and the democrats in the house and senate 
every time they drove by or every time they checked their pay 
stubs he said 
a dukakis aide responded by referring to formans attempts to 
weaken the universal health care law 
we expect representative forman to propose next week 
legislation making the chain saw the official tool of the 
commonwealth after what he did to health care coverage for the 
working poor of this state dukakis spokesman steve crawford said 
crawford also said forman should propose making passthehat 
the official sport of the commonwealth considering the number of 
times he has come to the administration looking for money for his 
district

a computer hacker characterized as a program 
pirate obsessed with cracking secret access codes was sentenced 
tuesday to a year in federal prison and six months rehabilitation 
us district judge mariana pfaelzer issued the prison sentence 
after learning she could not place kevin mitnick in a 
hospitaloperated therapy program for what an expert witness called 
mitnicks impulse disorder 
the program is not under contract with the federal government 
said grace denton a spokeswoman for the us attorney 
a federal sentence has to be served in a federal facility 
she said 
mitnick who has been incarcerated at the federal metropolitan 
detention center downtown for seven months need only serve five 
more months in prison ms denton said 
mitnick 25 pleaded guilty in may to computer fraud and 
possessing unauthorized longdistance telephone codes he will spend 
six months in a residential therapy program after serving his prison 
term 
the charges stemmed from his use of stolen mci longdistance 
codes to tap into computers and copy valuable programs from digital 
equipment corp 
after his prison term mitnick will be under conditional release 
for three years mitnick will not be able to possess any illegal or 
unauthorized access to computers or telecommunications equipment 
and will not be allowed to associate with known hackers another 
condition states that he must complete a rehabilitation program 
during his six months in a halfway house mitnick will be allowed 
to either go to work or to treatment programs during the day but he 
must return to the halfway house at night ms denton said he can 
still have a personal computer 
at one time federal authorities considered mitnick dangerous 
enough to restrict his telephone use in jail but mitnick later 
cooperated with authorities and apologized in court for his actions 
promising never to repeat them 
harriet rossetto a licensed social worker testified that 
mitnick suffers from an impulse disorder and that his illegal 
computer activity boosted his selfesteem 
this is a new and growing addiction she said there was no 
greed involved there was no sabotage involved 
assistant us attorney james r asperger said that mitnicks 
activities were something like climbing mount everest 
he did it because its there said asperger

conner the wisecracking mom on abcs hit comedy roseanne 
the shows producers on tuesday denied rumors that the conners 
played by roseanne barr and john goodman would strike it rich in a 
lottery the rumor turned up in a supermarket tabloid 
instead producers tom werner and marcy carsey told reporters 
that roseanne would be unemployed at the beginning of the new season 
roseanne quit her job at the factory during the past seasons 
last episode 
we think its a very fertile area someone whos unemployed 
and the first few scripts were dealing with that obviously in a 
family like this you need two incomes so pretty soon roseanne 
conner is going to find a job werner said 
carsey said roseanne might possibly get a more upscale job but

there is no way thomas roots revolver 
could have discharged accidentally when his plane crashed into 
bahamian waters after his dramatic autopilot flight last week the 
guns manufacturer said tuesday 
absolutely not it cant happen dick bachmann smith amp 
wesson vice president said from springfield mass the guns safety 
mechanism would make such a firing impossible he said 
federal investigators have said the 36yearold attorneys claim 
that he doesnt remember a gunshot is the major inconsistency in his 
version of the flight of his singleengine cessna crash and rescue 
at sea thursday 
hollywood police chief richard witt said the gunmakers statement 
is only part of mounting evidence that shows roots version of 
events wasnt possible 
i knew from the beginning his story wasnt true witt told 
the associated press tuesday night 
witt said there was indisputable proof contradicting roots 
version that his gun kept in the planes glove compartment was 
accidentally cocked and went off during the crash 
the position of the glove compartment and the nature of the gun 
and its safety features make an accidental discharge on impact 
impossible witt said 
witt a veteran homicide investigator said forensic evidence 
from the hospital shows that roots wound was at least four hours 
old when he arrived at the hospital 
that supports statements by us coast guard surgeon james 
rahman who said he believed root must have been shot at least two 
hours before he was rescued 
all this would indicate that mr root is being less than 
truthful hes been saying some things that are now ludicrous 
witt said nobody is going to know what really happened until he 
starts to put away those things that are implausible and starts 
talking about whats plausible 
andrew alston national transportation safety board investigator 
said earlier that investigators would talk to smith amp wesson to see 
if the 32caliber revolver could have discharged on its own 
bachmann said smith amp wesson officials reacted with disbelief 
to the accounts suggesting the gun fired accidentally 
roots relatives said they thought the revolver may have been 
cocked accidentally before root fell unconscious when he reached 
into the glove compartment for a compact disc the gun then 
apparently fired root suggested when the outoffuel plane smacked 
into the water he has stoutly denied that the wound to his abdomen 
was selfinflicted 
whatever the circumstances of the particular situation the 
smith amp wesson doubleaction revolver will only fire a cartridge 
when that trigger is pulled back and held to the rear bachmann 
told the associated press suggestions that it could are 
absolutely false 
theres an automatic internal safety feature that is designed 
into the lockwork unless the trigger is pulled to the rear and 
held there is no way the hammer nose can impact the primer of the 
cartridge bachmann said 
officials at hollywoods memorial hospital where root remained 
in stable condition tuesday said his family declined to be 
interviewed root hasnt responded to ap requests for interviews 
the ntsb said alston will have a news conference at the hospital 
wednesday to discuss its investigation 
root was bound from washington to rocky mount nc when he told 
air traffic controllers he was having trouble breathing military 
pilots who trailed the plane reported seeing the pilot slumped over 
the controls 
hundreds of miles to the south the plane ran out of fuel and 
plunged into the sea near the bahamas and stunned rescuers pulled 
root alive from the water 
the following day it was revealed that root had been shot 
but since then he has been dogged by questions about his 
business dealings possible financial problems and past 
investigations including discovery of a miniarsenal of weapons and 
a fivegallon drum of ether in his manassas va airport locker in 
april 
root who lives in alexandria va has insisted he didnt 
attempt suicide he says he passed out apparently because of carbon 
monoxide intake and doesnt remember anything else until awakening 
to see water coming into his plane

hollywood has produced hundreds of great 
movies yet which ones are the very best 
congress has created a blueribbon panel to answer the question 
and representatives of 13 film groups are meeting today at the 
university of california los angeles to try to choose what they 
deem the best 25 movies 
the movies they select will be the first to come under the 
protection of the national film preservation act of 1988 
leading candidates are the grapes of wrath casablanca 
its a wonderful life the best years of our lives 
citizen kane and on the waterfront 
the preservation act signed into law last year was drafted in 
response to outcries about the practice of coloring old 
blackandwhite films 
it stipulates that a panel of film experts select 25 titles 
annually which will be added to a national film register labeling 
movies according to their cultural historical and aesthetic 
interest 
this will not stop the tampering but it will make public 
knowledge that a film has been tampered with said george kirgo 
president of the writers guild of america and a preservation board 
member 
congress did not forbid a movie copyright holder from editing 
movies or from using computers to add color to films 
but the film preservation act requires that such movies must be 
labeled as colored or altered without the participation of the 
principal director screenwriter and other creators of the original 
film 
all it will do is identify the films when theyre tampered 
with the 25 films that well pick must be so identified in the 
future kirgo said 
in preliminary polling 57 movies were nominated by at least two 
of 13 members of the preservation board 
the leader was the grapes of wrath with eight votes 
casablanca and its a wonderful life drew seven votes each 
the best years of our lives citizen kane and on the 
waterfront received six votes each 
aside from the writers guild members of the panel were named 
from the screen actors guild the directors guild of america the 
national society of film critics the motion picture association of 
america the ucla film department the academy of motion picture 
arts and sciences the alliance of motion picture and television 
producers the american film institute the national association of 
broadcasters the department of cinema studies at new york 
university the society of cinema studies and the university film 
and video association

a man drove his truck through a 
lorimartelepictures studios gate torched the vehicle fired 
shotgun blasts at a wall and killed himself police said 
the mans identity and the motive for the rampage at the motion 
picture and television production complex were not immediately 
known said police capt tom mahoney 
there were no other injuries said police lt jerry dalven 
the incident began shortly after 5 pm when the driver who was 
alone handed a security guard two canisters and told him you 
have five minutes to live 
the canisters later were found to contain toxic methyl bromide 
gas officer ed henneberque said 
the driver had asked for someone said witness kelly hustis 
police could not immediately confirm the report 
the guy just busted through the gates said bill mccullum a 
lorimar security guard on duty at the gate after the incident all 
i know is i could have been the one lying on the ground 
the man then parked his vehicle against the wall of a studio 
building and apparently set it afire with a can of pressurized 
lubricant henneberque said 
a los angeles county sheriffs department bomb squad was called 
to the scene after studio firefighters discovered what appeared to 
be a hand grenade lying on a seat in the truck the officer said 
the man walked onto the lot brandishing a shotgun said dave 
stapf a spokesman for the studio 10 miles west of downtown los 
angeles after firing about six shots at random he killed himself 
officials said 
stapf said the man apparently was not a former employee 
last december a man was charged with fatally shooting two 
unarmed security guards in a similar rampage at universal studios 
nathan trupp 44 of albuquerque nm had been turned away from 
a universal studios gate minutes earlier by the guards after he 
demanded to see actor michael landon he allegedly returned to open 
fire on the guards without warning 
trupp pleaded innocent july 5 to murder and attempted murder 
charges filed in the case after a judge reversed an earlier finding 
that trupp was mentally incompetent to stand trial

archaeologists using shovels and other 
garden tools found a human skull bone tuesday underneath a marker 
honoring the five men believed to be victims of 19thcentury 
cannibal alferd packer 
its definitely human said archaeologist jim ayres as the 
bone was unearthed in the apparent grave at noon 
walter birkby a physical anthropologist at arizona state museum 
in tucson said it was a left temporal bone found in the human 
skull it will be shipped to the university of arizona for analysis 
the archaeologists are participating in a dig organized by george 
washington university law professor james starrs who wants to learn 
the truth about the 1874 cannibalism case he hopes to determine how 
the five men were murdered and whether packer consumed their remains 
packer formed a party of utah men to search for gold in the san 
juan mountains but the group became snowbound on the 9000foot 
mountain ridge in 1874 
packer claimed that one of the men shannon bell killed the 
other four while packer was away from camp packer said he then 
killed bell in selfdefense and consumed the remains of the five men 
to survive 
despite his claim packer was convicted of murdering one of the 
prospectors in 1883 after that verdict was overturned by the state 
supreme court packer was retried and convicted of manslaughter he 
was sentenced to serve 40 years in prison but was paroled in 1901 
and died six years later 
the reputed gravesite of the five victims has been set off by a 
marker which honors the five men who were murdered on this spot 
early in the year 1874 while pioneering for mineral resources of the 
san juan country but researchers are uncertain whether the sign 
marks the actual spot where packer victims are buried 
working in shortsleeved shirts hiking shorts and hats ayres 
birkby and some of their graduate students dug about 6 inches under 
the marker tuesday before locating parallel rows of rock that they 
speculated marked the graves of the five men the human bone was 
found a short time later 
ayres said the group had a photograph of the rocks in formation 
that was taken in 1909 but he and birkby were cautious about what 
may lie below the rocks 
well clean it up shoot it plot it on the map and then dig 
some more birkby said we dont know how deep it is 
to this day the packer case has triggered broad human interest 
from embellished legend to jokes and the wry amusement is shared by 
scientists on the dig as well as the onlookers 
starrs has nicknamed the dig area the bone zone and is 
selling tshirts bearing a skeleton and the words gimme five the 
alferd packer expedition july 1989 to help offset the costs of the 
trip 
other tshirts for sale in the area proclaim have a friend for 
dinner and alferd packer serving his fellow man

president roh taewoo replaced six 
cabinet ministers today and fired the head of the politically 
powerful national intelligence agency 
opposition leaders immediately denounced the changes as cosmetic 
and claimed roh ignored the publics desire for a complete change to 
rid the government of officials who served under former president 
chun doohwan 
most ministers in the 23member cabinet worked in some capacity 
under the discredited and authoritarian chun government 
the changes today involved the home construction 
communications political affairs labor and health and social 
affairs ministries 
they were not expected to alter government policies and were 
widely seen as a political housekeeping move aimed at reassuring 
citizens that the governing party is concerned about social unrest 
rising crime and welfare problems 
prime minister kang younghoon and the other 16 ministers were 
retained the last cabinet shakeup was in december 1988 when kang 
and 19 ministers were appointed 
in the most noticable change former attorney general suh 
dongkwon 56 replaced park sehjik as head of the powerful agency 
for national security planning fomerly the korean central 
intelligence agency 
park was better known to foreigners as chief organizer of the 
successful 1988 summer olympic games held in seoul in september 
the intelligence agency has been widely criticized for apparently 
not knowing beforehand of secret visits to communist north korea by 
dissident clergyman rev moon ikhwan opposition lawmaker suh 
kyongwon and a radical student leader still in the north 
under south korean law unauthorized visits to the north are 
illegal 
the largest opposition group the party for peace and democracy 
said suh dongkwon was in the vanguard of the governments 
suppression of political opposition and dissent as attorney 
general under chun 
lee sangsoo a party spokesman said the cabinet change 
ignored the peoples ardent desires for further democratization 
and liquidation of human rights abuses and corruption under chun 
who left office in february 1988 
lee inche spokesman for the opposition reunification democratic 
party said the changes were not adequate to satisfy the peoples 
anticipation of renovation in government 
he said the public demanded better law enforcement and handling 
of the nations economic problems 
roh was elected president in december 1987 winning 366 percent 
of the vote as two other candidates split the opposition vote 
in other changes today national assemblyman kim taeho of the 
governing party was made home minister succeeding lee handong 
sources said lee was dismissed to hold him responsible for a surge 
in violent crime in recent months police are under the home 
ministers control 
kwon yonggack president of the staterun korea housing corp 
and a retired army general became construction minister 
former governing party lawmaker kim chongin was made health and 
social affairs minister communications minister choi youngchoul 
was reassigned as labor minister and former president lee woochae 
of the staterun korea telecommunications authority took over 
chois old post 
park chulun became the first minister of state for political 
affairs park previously was a special presidential assistant on 
policy matters

the energy department is underestimating the 
chances of a volcanic eruption near a nevada site proposed to entomb 
highlevel nuclear waste that will remain radioactive for 10000 
years a senior government geologist says 
department officials say the analysis by john trapp a staff 
geologist at the nuclear regulatory commission is flawed but they 
acknowledged tuesday that more study is needed before determining 
whether the site can be used 
trapp in what he called preliminary calculations said his 
review of the yucca mountain site and assessments by energy 
department scientists show the chances of an eruption in the area 
during the next 10000 years are about one in six not the one in 30 
odds suggested in department studies 
the proposed site is about 100 miles northwest of las vegas 
trapp made the assertion in an internal memorandum june 22 to 
philip justus head of the nrcs geology section 
copies of the memo were released tuesday by members of the nevada 
congressional delegation opposed to building the repository the 
state government also strongly opposes the project and has refused 
to grant the permits the energy department needs to begin assessing 
the sites suitability 
john j linehah a senior nrc licensing official sent a copy of 
the trapp analysis on july 11 to energy department and nevada state 
officials in a cover letter he called it a simple example of 
the kinds of issues that need to be resolved by the energy 
department before it seeks a license for the waste dump 
joseph fouchard an nrc spokesman said trapps view did not 
represent the nrcs official position but he said we agree with 
trapps conclusion that its an issue that has to be faced up to 
early 
yucca mountain is adjacent to the nevada test site where the 
energy department conducts underground nuclear explosions it would 
permanently store nuclear waste from commercial nuclear power plants 
the nrc which would be responsible for licensing the dump is 
analyzing the energy departments approach to assessing yucca 
mountains suitability 
members of the nrc and the commissions staff said last week they 
believe the energy department needs to put more emphasis on 
resolving quickly such issues that could make or break yucca 
mountain as a tomb for the nuclear waste 
congress decreed in 1987 that only yucca mountain should be 
considered as a home for the waste 
carl gertz the energy department manager of the yucca mountain 
project said in a telephone interview he agreed the volcano issue 
needed to be studied more but he called trapps method of 
calculating the odds of an eruption unrealistic 
trapp wrote that because of various flaws in assessments made by 
bm crowe a los alamos national laboratory scientist assigned to 
the yucca mountain project the numbers which were generated by 
crowe could be highly in error 
crowes work on volcanism at yucca mountain is considered the 
most complete so far 
trapp said that although his analysis was preliminary and for 
illustrative purposes only he concluded the various 
probabilities and consequences which have been used for volcanic 
disruption of a repository at yucca mountain may be in error by 
several orders of magnitude

organization of american states foreign 
ministers are meeting again with deep divisions remaining over how 
much pressure they should bring to bear on panamanian leader manuel 
antonio noriega to surrender power 
as the oas prepared to meet today the state department was 
expressing deep disappointment over the lack of enthusiasm among 
many delegates for taking decisive action against noriega 
these delegates led by mexico cite provisions protecting member 
nations against outside intervention they also see the problem 
concerning noriega as essentially a uspanamanian issue not one 
which should involve the oas 
but the bush administration has become increasingly impatient 
with what it regards as foot dragging by the 31member oas us 
officials insisting on anonymity said early drafts of a speech 
prepared for secretary of state james a baker iii for todays 
meeting were sharply worded 
baker was returning to his office today after his twoweek trip 
to europe with president bush and it was not clear beforehand 
whether he or a subordinate would represent the united states at the 
meeting 
as baker sees it the administration bowed to latin wishes by 
assuming a low profile in the panamanian situation and giving the 
oas a chance to forge a solution the us officials said 
the latin americans had contended the reagan administration too 
often had acted unilaterally in confronting hemispheric problems and 
that a multilateral approach was far preferable 
but us officials complain the oas has shown no stomach for 
acting decisively against noriega who is under indictment in 
florida on drug smuggling charges 
antinoriega sentiment in the oas grew last may after panamanian 
authorities threw out the results of the may 7 national elections 
amid widespread allegations that the candidate opposed to noriega 
was the landslide winner the opposition presidential and vice 
presidential candidate were beaten by pronoriega forces when they 
tried to stage a public rally 
the oas met in emergency session may 17 and appointed a team of 
mediators to go to panama with a mandate to achieve a democratic 
transfer of power in panama 
one deadline for achieving that objective passed on june 6 and a 
second deadline was set for today 
the oas mediators are more optimistic than the state department 
about a settlement pointing to two meetings in recent days between 
panamanian opposition and government leaders 
us officials viewed those meetings as an attempt by noriega to 
dampen still further whatever desire the oas may still have for 
involvement in the panama question 
the panamanian government hoped todays meeting would end with no 
extension of the mediators mandate 
expressions of impatience with the oas already are being heard 
from lawmakers as ideologically diverse as sen jesse helms rnc 
and sen christopher dodd dconn there is even a movement in the 
senate to leave vacant for an extended period the post of us 
ambassador to the oas 
meetings among the latin delegates were held tuesday at the 
colombian embassy and elsewhere in an attempt to reach a consensus 
on the panamanian problem 
with the results of the may 7 election nullified and with no 
announced winner it is not clear what will happen in panama on 
september 1 the date on which the panamanian constitution says a 
new president is to take office

a white house agreement giving top 
congressional leaders the power to stop contra aid later this year 
is unconstitutional four conservative gop lawmakers charge in a 
lawsuit against president bush and secretary of state james a baker 
iii 
meanwhile some lawmakers tuesday hailed bush administration 
plans to cut separate aid to the contras political operations as a 
gesture of bipartisan cooperation and a move toward getting the 
rebels to return home 
congressional leaders and contra spokesmen confirmed that funding 
for the miami office will be sharply reduced in miami jorge 
rosales a contra spokesman said it could mean the closing of the 
office 
the democraticcontrolled congress passed a 50 million package 
of nonmilitary aid for the nicaraguan rebels in april but only 
after the administration agreed to cut off aid by nov 30 if eight 
senate and house leaders do not approve its continuation through 
february 
in a lawsuit filed tuesday in us district court the procontra 
lawmakers said the bipartisan agreement sets a dangerous precedent 
and violates the constitution by circumventing the congressional 
process 
to allow one congressman or senator out of 535 to deny 
implementing a law passed by congress and supported by the president 
is clearly unconstitutional said rep robert c smith rnh he 
said the side agreement gives the six democratic and two 
republican congressional leaders super veto power 
also joining the suit were rep phil crane rill and rep 
chuck douglas rnh 
the funding for the miami contra office does not come out of the 
contra aid package approved by congress in april 
contra spokesman bosco matamoros said the miami office will be 
moved to an undisclosed location in central america and added we 
are increasing our activities the decision does not affect the 
contras office in washington 
jason isaacson spokesman for sen christopher dodd dconn 
described the cuts as good news and said it showed the bush 
administration was following up on its agreement with congress last 
spring to seek ways for the rebels to return to nicaragua 
rep robert dornan rcalif however described the proposal as 
an absolute tragedy

house republican whip newt gingrich is 
enlisting a former colleague as he prepares to defend a 
controversial book deal even before an ethics committee vote to 
formally investigate him according to gop sources 
the sources speaking only on condition they not be named said 
tuesday that gingrich has asked former rep ed bethune rark for 
assistance as he awaits for a likely ethics panel vote thursday to 
launch a preliminary inquiry 
bethune now a washington attorney would not discuss any 
conversations he had with gingrich 
gingrich who triggered the investigation that brought down 
former house speaker jim wright was accused in a complaint by rep 
bill alexander dark of possibly violating federal campaign 
finance laws and house rules on gifts and outside income 
the allegations focused on a partnership gingrich formed in 
which 21 investors gave 5000 each to promote window of 
opportunity a book written by the georgia republican his wife 
and a third author 
gingrich saw his house fortunes rise over the past year as those 
of wright dtexas fell because it was gingrich who filed the 
original ethics complaint against the texas democrat 
the gingrich investigation seemed a nearcertainty after chicago 
lawyer richard j phelan who conducted the committees probe of 
wright acknowledged hes been contacted by the panel about handling 
an investigation of gingrich 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois said gingrich 
may also be thinking of contacting other former members for help 
if the committee votes to start a preliminary inquiry gingrich 
would need a legal team quickly because he would have the right to 
give the panel a statement defending himself against the allegations 
michel also said the investigation can become a pretty 
expensive thing for the georgia republican 
gingrich wouldnt discuss the probe tuesday but when he was 
asked if expected it to cost him a of money said yes he said 
he would have more to say thursday 
wright primarily financed his legal defense out of campaign 
funds but also established a separate legal defense fund which was 
not subject to limits that apply to campaign donors 
the exspeaker had almost 500000 in legal bills supporters 
said in midmay this year and that figure would have climbed 
considerably if wright had continued to defend himself in a trial 
phase of the ethics investigation 
the panel had accused wright of 69 rules violations including 
some of the same charges that alexander leveled against gingrich 
violating outside income limits and keeping gifts from persons with 
a direct interest in legislation

twentynine years after calling for a study of 
whether red dye no 3 causes cancer the house says the government 
still needs to find out more about the substance 
but a congressman said the food and drug administration can ban 
the substance without further delay if it wants to 
the vote by the house tuesday approving the 421 billion 
agriculture appropriations bill included a provision calling for 
more study of the dye but left unresolved whether the dye that 
gives maraschino cherries their distinctive red glow would be pulled 
from the market 
in 1960 when congress called for a ban on foods that cause 
cancer in laboratory animals red dye no 3 was put on a provisional 
list that allowed it to stay on the market for additional study 
it was supposed to last for 2 years during which time the 
industries were supposed to test the dyes for safety said rep 
ted weiss dny calling for immediate removal of the chemical 
the industry has had 29 years to test these dyes he said 
fda commissioner frank young has maintained the substance does 
not pose a health threat to humans and the wall street journal 
reported tuesday that his office worked with canners and growers on 
the language to postpone action 
large doses of the additive have caused tumors in rats leading 
consumer groups to demand that it be banned 
weiss complained about the language in the appropriations 
committees report on the bill that said the fda should perform a 
longterm study on the dye although such language is not a 
formal part of the law it is used by agencies for guidance on 
congressional intentions 
the report said the study should be reviewed by the fda prior 
to making any decision relating to changes in the provisionally or 
permanently approved uses of this color 
but rep jamie whitten dmiss chairman of the house 
appropriations committee said its up to the fda commissioner to 
decide whether red dye no 3 will stay on the shelves 
weiss said the agency shouldnt wait any longer 
under the law the fda has no option but to follow through with 
its stated intentions to terminate the provisional listing of red 
dye no 3 said weiss it is high time that it do so 
weiss chairman of the house government operations subcommittee 
on human resources and intergovernmental relations asked the fda 
tuesday to provide all of its documents relating to the regulatory 
status of red dye no 3 over the past year 
the appropriations bill covers spending for all agriculture 
programs as well as rural development programs like the farmers 
home administration rural development insurance fund and rural 
electrification administration

president bush went to eastern and western 
europe with an open checkbook but not with carte blanche to 
accommodate the many countries and causes tugging at his sleeve 
in fact he left disappointed people everywhere in warsaw at 
the headquarters of the solidarity trade union in gdansk at the 
sevennation economic summit in paris and even in the dutch capital 
of the hague 
everybody wants the united states to pick up the check for 
everything bush grumbled as he returned home tuesday from the 
9000mile journey 
he said a group of dutch legislators he met with wanted us 
funding for international environmental cleanup programs they all 
assume we are rolling in money and at the same time foreign 
leaders are asking the united states to balance its budget he said 
they understand we are not rolling in money because of our 
deficit he said returning home only hours after his 
administration issued its semiannual economic prediction 
forecasting slower growth and higher interest rates than earlier 
projections 
however it said the federal budget deficit will be lower this 
year than was expected 1483 billion down sharply from the 164 
billion predicted in february 
from the start the administration sought to play down hopes of 
us munificence in europe 
this is really not a trip to bestow economic largess 
secretary of state james a baker iii said on bushs first day in 
poland 
in fact the aid package bush unveiled in the polish parliament 
was a drop in the bucket of polands urgent needs 
bush promised to ask congress for 100 million to help private 
entrepreneurs and 15 million to fight pollution in the city of 
krakow 
he also pledged to ask us allies to increase their aid to 
poland which he did later that week in paris and to encourage 
the world bank to provide 325 million in loans for polish 
agriculture and industry 
but the polish government wrote to the sevennation paris summit 
asking for 43 billion in loans and debt relief 
in the baltic sea port of gdansk solidarity chief lech walesa 
invited the bushes to his home for lunch and asked for 10 billion 
to help poland the next day the solidarity daily newspaper said 
bushs gift disappointed many people although it praised the 
warm intentions it reflected 
in hungary bush promised 25 million to encourage private 
enterprise and 60 american peace corps volunteers to teach english 
on to paris where bush encountered an embarrassing situation 
leaders of some two dozen developing nations were invited by 
leftleaning french president francois mitterrand to participate in 
the bicentennial parties of the french revolution and to mingle with 
their richer counterparts 
the third world group called for an urgent dialogue between 
developed and developing nations to discuss economic and 
environmental programs but the united states and england rebuffed 
the suggestion and mitterrand promised to support it at a later 
date 
the solution to the problems of the third world countries 
advised treasury secretary nicholas brady was on a casebycase 
basis 
based on that approach the united states sought to encourage a 
conclusion to negotiations between mexico and its commercial bankers 
for a plan to ease the 100 billion mexican debt those talks are 
going on in new york 
in fact bush and the other leaders of britain france west 
germany japan italy and canada issued a communique at the end of 
their annual gathering sternly admonishing private banks to be more 
realistic in their expectations from third world debtors and to cut 
their debts 
on the environment too the united states and its partners were 
big on words but light on cash they called for concerted efforts to 
clean up the seas and oceans and preserve the eroding ozone layer 
that protects the earth from harmful sun radiation but did not 
commit any money 
only one group of nations got relief bush promised just prior 
to leaving for europe that the united states will forgive 1 
billion in debts owed by the earths poorest lands those in 
subsaharan africa

the department of veterans affairs will have 
new rules this fall instructing its panel of scientific advisers to 
take a more generous look at studies linking agent orange exposure 
and a variety of ailments 
the new rules could make it more likely for the 35000 vietnam 
veterans who have filed claims based on exposure to the 
dioxincontaining defoliant to receive compensation 
more than 225000 veterans have received va physical examinations 
out of concern for agent orange exposure so far only five have 
received benefits 
rather than looking for proof that dioxin exposure and caused 
disease miscarriages or birth defects vas advisory committee on 
environmental hazards need only look for a significant statistical 
association between disease and exposure under the regulations 
proposed tuesday 
the committee evaluates data on radiation and dioxin exposure 
which the va uses to determine claims the new criteria will apply 
to radiation studies as well 
dioxin is recognized as one of the most toxic chemicals 
government scientists say they cannot prove troops other than the 
1200 air force personnel who directly took part in the spraying 
operation were exposed that group has yet to show any dramatic 
increase in cancers the government says 
outside studies including one commissioned by the american 
legion contend records of spraying and troop movements combined 
with questionnaires answered by veterans show a connection there 
was no conclusion on cancer in the american legion study because of 
the nature of the study 
the regulations subject to public comment and final approval 
are expected to take effect oct 1 
they were drafted after us district judge thelton e henderson 
of san francisco ruled that the va too strictly interpreted the 1984 
veterans dioxin and radiation compensation standards act 
agent orange made by seven chemical companies was contaminated 
with dioxin during manufacture the department says 
a classaction lawsuit against manufacturers has been settled 
and veterans are receiving payments as a result but the settlement 
did not assign responsibility

congressional budget writers complain that the 
pentagons decision to move its oct 1 payday up by two days is 
triggering a rash of deficitcutting gimmicks by house and senate 
committees 
the defense department payday shift would move 29 billion in 
salaries to the end of the 1989 fiscal year and allow the agency 
to claim an equal amount in savings from its fiscal 1990 budget 
objections to the idea crescendoed on tuesday even as the bush 
administration conceded that the economy is not performing as 
robustly as it expected several months ago 
in may defense secretary dick cheney ordered the militarys 
monthly payday of oct 1 a sunday moved up to friday sept 29 
saying the shift would avoid inconveniencing troops 
but since fiscal 1990 begins oct 1 the rescheduling had the 
effect of shifting 29 billion into the previous fiscal year 
freeing up 29 billion in 1990 for other purposes for the pentagon 
i think it has a budget consequence that was not intended by 
the statute house speaker thomas s foley told reporters tuesday 
lawmakers grumbled that the payday shift enabled cheney to claim 
a solution to a dispute between the administration and congress over 
the pentagons budget in which congressional budget officials were 
claiming that the military will spend too much money next year 
now congressional committees are mapping plans to achieve 
similar budget savings by shifting paydays for civilian agencies 
that they oversee 
the house appropriations committee approved a spending bill 
monday that claims 358 million in savings by bumping ahead the oct 
1 paydays for the department of veterans affairs the environmental 
protection agency and nasa 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif told a 
reporter monday that committees controlling the department of 
transportation and the postal service are planning similar shifts 
he and other congressional leaders are mapping plans to prevent the 
idea from spreading 
itll set a powerful precedent rep bill frenzel of 
minnesota ranking republican on the house budget committee said 
regarding the pentagon payday shift wed be hardpressed to say 
the others cant do it if the one could do it 
also tuesday the administration officially geared down the 
economic projections it released in february 
administration officials estimated that shortterm interest rates 
would average 8 percent this year and drop to 67 percent next year 
that the economy would grow by 27 percent this year and 26 percent 
next year and that inflation would rise by 49 percent in 1989 and 
41 percent in 1990 
each figure was more pessimistic than the administration forecast 
in february estimates that at the time were called overly rosy by 
congressional and outside economists 
the administration projected that the fiscal 1990 deficit would 
be 992 billion well within the 110 billion shortfall target for 
the year of the grammrudman deficitreduction law

american officials are stunned by the slaying 
of 30 afghan rebels and they say the massacre may prompt an 
evaluation of where us military aid goes but is unlikely to result 
in less assistance 
its kind of a mess im greatly concerned said rep 
david dreier rcalif a strong supporter of the mujahedeen as the 
antigovernment rebels call themselves 
dreier said if reports that supporters of gulbaddin hekmatyar of 
the hezbeislami group ambushed and killed their rivals are true 
we have to be very careful not to have him as a recipient of 
our arms 
he said the united states has always had problems with 
hekmatyar who dreier said holds antiwestern views 
in pakistan qaribur rehman saeed a spokesman for hekmatyars 
hardline islamic group acknowledged the group killed some 
competing fighters from the jamiateislami guerrilla organization 
saeed said his group is still investigating what happened july 9 in 
the takhar valley 
state department spokesman richard boucher said there may be 
some change in the distribution of aid but at this point we dont 
have any new details 
but he said the basic goal of supporting the mujahedeen 
urging them to unite supporting their efforts of selfdetermination 
that remains something we intend to continue pursuing 
there are seven major factions among the antigovernment rebels 
with alliances sometimes shifting and some groups deeply opposed to 
others 
boucher and others tried to play down the significance of the 
internecine struggle 
asked why the united states would continue to aid a faction it 
determined may have killed other rebels boucher responded i 
think what youre doing is taking one incident and blowing it out of 
proportion 
he said however the united states deplored the incident which 
he labeled tragic and grave 
another state department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity doubted us assistance to the mujahedeen would be 
affected by the incident that could change if such activities 
become an endemic or pervasive problem he said 
meantime published reports quoted us officials as saying they 
have decided to increase military aid to the rebels in response to a 
massive increase in soviet military supply shipments to the kabul 
government 
although the soviets withdrew their 115000 troops from 
afghanistan in february as part an accord with the united states 
moscow has been sending arms to the kabul government at the rate of 
200 million to 300 million a month since march a us official 
said 
the geneva accords called for an end to outside involvement in 
afghanistan

despite an initial defeat democratic critics 
are pressing attempts to curb president bushs nominations of large 
numbers of political supporters and republican contributors to 
diplomatic posts 
sen albert gore dtenn and other democrats said the quality 
of the nations representation abroad suffers when ambassadors and 
senior state department officials are chosen for their contributions 
to the republican party not for professional qualifications to 
handle their jobs 
up to twothirds of bushs diplomatic nominations have been based 
on political connections a far higher percentage than in any recent 
administration democrats contend 
but gores bid to restrict political nominees to no more than 15 
percent of the diplomatic corps was defeated tuesday 7920 
he readied a fallback position limiting such nominations to no 
more than 30 percent a total in keeping with administrations dating 
back to that of president john f kennedy in the early 1960s 
gore said he also will seek to rally opposition against nominees 
whose nonpolitical qualifications to represent the united states 
abroad are thin 
the bush administration has submitted 42 diplomatic nominations 
of which 28 can be classified as political democrats said 
they said many of them have few identifiable qualifications for 
the jobs 
but sen jesse helms rnc and other senators contended the 
proposed restriction would represent an unconstitutional intrusion 
on the presidents ability to conduct foreign policy 
gore said the political appointments destroy morale within the 
us foreign service and represent an abuse for which there is no 
justification 
other nations do not undermine their national interests 
overseas to grant political favors or ensure loyalty to the 
political line of the governing party gore said 
in other action on pending state department authorization bill 
the democraticcontrolled senate approved an amendment forbidding a 
president from soliciting foreign or private funds to carry out 
foreign policy activities prohibited by congress 
the amendment sponsored by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny 
reflects lingering political fallout from the irancontra affair 
it was adopted 5742 after moynihan contended it was an 
essential step to make sure a president and his staff do not move to 
circumvent the law 
but helms voting on the losing side protested the amendment 
is a clear bald effort to usurp the foreign policy prerogatives 
of the president of the united states in a manner not allowed by the 
constitution 
he predicted president bush will veto the entire state department 
authorization bill because of it 
the provision would make violators subject to fines and jail 
terms of up to five years 
testimony before the congressional irancontra committees showed 
the reagan administration solicited millions of dollars from 
american citizens and from such nations as saudi arabia and brunei 
for the nicaraguan contra rebels when us aid them was banned by 
congress 
this amendment can be summed up in three words obey the 
law said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine

house taxwriters are weighing a plan to shift 
more of the burden of the catastrophic health insurance program onto 
older americans with incomes of less than 25000 a year 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee who would prefer to leave the medicare catastrophic 
program as is offered a package tuesday that would cut the cost of 
the new insurance coverage for those with higher incomes 
but rostenkowski said the cool reception to his plan and pressure 
from highincome earners among the elderly increased the likelihood 
that catastrophic coverage will be repealed 
under current law a typical couple with income between 15000 
and 20000 would pay 59 for coverage in 1990 rostenkowski 
proposes to raise that to 101 a couple earning about 70000 now 
scheduled to pay 909 would pay 527 instead 
it was not very wellreceived rostenkowski told reporters 
after a closed committee session 
rostenkowski suggested the financing changes as part of a new 
package he wants the committee to add to a bill already approved 
designed to raise 53 billion in revenues for deficit reduction in 
the next budget year 
his proposals include 
a new tax that would cost the chemical industry and 
eventually buyers of refrigerators and air conditioners about 
85 billion over five years the tax would be imposed on 
chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals that are widely used in 
cooling and insulation but which harm the earths ozone layer 
reversing an earlier decision and allow individuals to deduct 10 
percent of their credit cards education loans and other consumer 
interest in 1990 
permanent extension of the 3 percent tax on telephone service 
a new tax of about 2 billion on mutual life insurance companies 
a significant expansion of federal tax assistance for 
lowerincome working families part of an effort to improve aid for 
child care it would expand the earnedincome credit which gives a 
working family with children and income under about 18000 a tax 
reduction or cash payment if no taxes are owed of up to 910 
the credit would rise to a maximum 1217 for one child 1504 for 
two children and 1790 for three or more 
an additional credit of up to 430 would be allowed if any child 
is under age 6 
extension of several tax benefits that have expired are due to 
expire these include a tax exclusion for tuition assistance 
provided by an employer a credit for employers who hire 
disadvantaged workers a benefit for those who invest in lowincome 
rental housing and a 20 percent credit for increased investment in 
research and experimentation 
the toughest decision facing the committee is what to do about 
the new law that insures older americans against some costs of a 
catastrophic illness many retirees object that it is financed 
principally by a surtax on the elderly 
most of the money is raised from the 40 percent of people 65 and 
older whose total income taxes exceed 150 a year they pay a surtax 
of 15 percent of taxes with a 1989 maximum surtax of 800 fewer 
than 6 percent will pay the maximum 
the remainder of the cost is financed through a 4 increase in 
the 2790 monthly premium paid for medicare part b which covers 
physicians fees 
rostenkowskis new plan would cut the surtax by about twothirds 
to a rate of 5 percent this year with a maximum of 800 and the 
rate would rise gradually to 10 percent instead of 28 percent under 
current law in 1993 
however it would increase the part b premium which is paid by 
all but the poorest beneficiaries that premium totaling 3190 for 
1989 would when currentlaw increases are included rise to 51 in 
1993

american scientists are finding rocks from the 
moon and perhaps mars in the glaciers of antarctica and one 
expert says they may have been slung into orbit by an asteroid 
collision during ancient times 
we are certain that these samples are from the moon said 
william cassidy a university of pittsburgh geologist 
the rocks deposited on ancient polar show fields hundreds of 
thousands of years ago match chemical characteristics of lunar 
samples collected by astronauts on the six apollo lunar missions he 
said matching the samples create what geologists call ground 
truth 
we dont know from where on the moon they came but we know 
they have to be from places more widespread than the four percent 
that weve sampled by apollo cassidy said tuesday at the 
international geological congress 
cassidy said it is believed that the antarctic moon rocks got to 
earth when in some ancient time an asteroid smashed into the lunar 
surface with such great violence that chunks of the moon were slung 
into orbit it would take less force to do this from the lunar 
surface because the moon has only onesixth of the earths gravity 
once in orbit the moon rocks could eventually be swept up by the 
earth the lunar material would streak through the atmosphere and 
then crash into the earths surface 
most such objects hit the oceans where they are lost or on land 
surfaces where they are weathered and eroded beyond recognition 
but in the antarctic time is frozen in gigantic sheets of ice 
that lie virtually unchanged for up to 20 million years moon rocks 
that come to rest there remain untouched and nearly pristine 
awaiting collection by cassidy and his team 
other types of rocks from space also are found on the frozen 
polar plains 
cassidy said two rare samples called shurgitites have been 
found that may have originated from mars 
we dont really know if thats the case because we dont have 
ground truth matched samples from a known source he said but 
cassidy said the fact that moon rocks hit earth support the idea 
that other samples could be from mars 
the lunar samples lend credence to the view that you really 
can hit a planet with an asteroid and knock off a meteoroid and get 
it into orbit he said this lends credence to the idea that the 
shurgitites could have come from mars and are really martian 
samples 
final proof he said will have to come from a sampling mission 
to mars 
cassidy said that about 12000 other types of meteorites have 
been gathered from the ice in antarctica he said he and his team 
find the space rocks by systematically searching using snowmobiles 
the meteorites are just lying around on the ice he said 
most are about the size of a large olive but some are as large 
as grapefruit 
the fragments are photographed collected in sealed bags and 
transported still frozen to the johnson space center in houston 
in a special laboratory there they are warmed and dried in a pure 
nitrogen atmosphere sections are cut from the samples and sent for 
study by scientists in 17 nations 
cassidy said when the study of antarctic meteorites first began 
20 years ago scientists hoped to find samples that were as old as 
the polar ice sheets where they were found 
we hoped we could look back 20 million years he said but 
the oldest one weve found is only about 900000 years old weve 
found two that are 700000 years old the bulk have fallen over just 
the last 300000 years 
and in a solar system more than four billion years old he said 
thats but a brief moment

thomas warren tried several methods 
including acupuncture and smokers anonymous to break a 20year 
nicotine addiction 
nothing worked 
now the 42yearold springfield man has had himself chained to a 
280pound sofa in his living room and rid his home of tobacco he 
intends to remain on the leash for three weeks in a drastic attempt 
to kick the habit for good 
i had my friends come over here and take a crescent wrench and 
tie me up so there was no way of getting off warren said tuesday 
his eighth day of being connected to the thin 30foot steel cable 
i admitted that i was powerless over cigarettes and that they had 
made my life unmanageable 
i had to take control of the situation 
warren describes himself as an artist dog trainer and drug 
counselor who beat a cocaine addiction 11 years ago a packaday 
cigarette habit sticks with him however 
its a crazy habit thats ruining my life he said its 
selfdestructive its unhealthy i used to run marathons but ive 
got respiratory problems now and cant run anymore i cant do a lot 
of the exercises that im used to doing 
warren who lives alone roams about his small secluded home 
with the thin cable fastened at his neck by a bolt like a dog 
collar his golden retriever rachel can roam the yard but 
warrens leash limits him from stepping much past the front porch 
warren a vietnam veteran began smoking when he was in the army 
he said its especially important to quit smoking because of his 
involvement with drug education 
im going on the druglecturing circuit in september i cant 
smoke cigarettes and sit there and tell people how to get off 
drugs he said 
he said he sought help to quit smoking from the veterans 
administration but was told va hospitals didnt offer such a 
program acupuncture smokers anonymous meditation cutting back to 
a quarterpack and trying to quit cold turkey also failed 
i felt the only way i could whip this once and for all and take 
control of my life was to chain myself up he said 
warren decided to chain himself for three weeks to guarantee a 
modification of behavior even though his body probably was free of 
nicotine after three days 
he said the urge to smoke in the first few days of confinement 
was intense adding if you offered me a cigarette right now id 
say no way 
he had to chase away friends who smoked when they stopped by 
because the temptation to ask them for a cigarette was too great 
one man who saw a news report about warren offered to sell him 
herbal cigarettes which he claimed contained no nicotine 
i didnt want anything to do with those warren said with a 
laugh id already tried them before they taste awful 
jennifer moore a spokeswoman for the american cancer society in 
springfield conceded that warrens attempt to quit is 
unconventional 
there certainly are other methods id have suggested he explore 
before resorting to that she said but i think what hes doing 
shows how really bad he wants to quit and how powerful a drug like 
nicotine is it is just as powerful as cocaine or heroin 
warren who spends his days painting keeping a journal and 
watching movies feels optimistic he will never smoke again once his 
chain comes off later this month 
i love to smoke but i love to live more he said

house and senate negotiators are bargaining 
over a savings and loan bailout measure behind closed doors after 
narrowing the major disputes between them to how to pay for the 
rescue and who will regulate the most troublesome element of the 
industry 
representatives of the two chambers agreed tuesday to meet 
informally in private the rest of this week with the aim of settling 
what were described as minor differences on other issues 
we ought to over the next couple of days get the legislative 
language worked out so that we have the basis of a single package 
said the sen donald riegle dmich the chief senate negotiator 
the biggest stumbling block is a fight largely along party 
lines on how to raise the 50 billion needed immediately to cover 
the losses of federally insured deposits in some 500 failed sampls 
mainly in texas and california 
president bush and other republicans want to raise the money 
through 30year private bonds in order to avoid swelling the federal 
deficit 
democrats want to make the administration borrow the money 
directly through the treasury saying it would reduce the bailouts 
total cost by 45 billion over 30 years but exempt the new debt 
from annual deficitreduction targets 
each side has enough votes in the senate 41 on the issue to 
stymie the other despite the little room for bargaining several 
housesenate conferees said tuesday they were looking to the white 
house and the legislative leaders for a compromise 
meanwhile riegle said he hopes the other major hurdle whether 
the treasury department or the more independent federal deposit 
insurance corp should be put in charge of some 1200 
statechartered thrifts will be resolved somewhere along the 
way 
loose regulation particularly by florida california and texas 
over statechartered but federally insured thrifts is blamed for 
losses totaling more than 50 billion to risky and often fraudulent 
loans 
bush and the senate want to regulate those institutions as well 
as more than 1700 federally chartered thrifts through a new office 
of thrift supervision in the treasury department 
house conferees insisted tuesday on giving fdic chairman l 
william seidman rather than the treasury the chief federal 
regulators role over statechartered thrifts 
however one house source speaking on condition of anonymity 
described the regulatory turf battle as a throwaway chip to be 
used to get something in the form of a senate concession on 
another issue 
riegle and chief house negotiator rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas expressed optimism that agreement on a single package 
excluding the financing issue could be reached by friday 
weve got the train moving we ought to keep the ball 
rolling gonzalez said 
the path was cleared for the informal talks after the house 
conferees agreed tentatively tuesday to retreat from their demand to 
outlaw junk bond ownership by sampls a provision the senate would 
allow to continue 
as a compromise gonzalez proposed and the senate conferees 
tentatively accepted a measure giving the fdic and other regulators 
discretion to say how many junk bonds sampls can hold in their 
portfolios

the ruling nationalist party holds its 
first primary election sunday in a sign that further democratic 
change is coming to taiwan once the exclusive political domain of 
party elders 
the primary will select candidates for general legislative 
elections in december when the nationalists will for the first time 
face a challenge from a legal opposition party 
opposition parties were forbidden under martial law which until 
two years ago had been in effect since 1949 when the nationalist 
government fled to taiwan after losing a civil war on the chinese 
mainland 
martial law was lifted as part of a political liberalization 
program begun by former president chiang chingkuo son of former 
nationalist leader chiang kaishek 
the primary is in response to complaints from many of the ruling 
partys 2 million members about the longstanding practice of 
allowing party bosses to choose candidates for national elections 
they claimed only loyalists who toed the official party line were 
selected 
president lee tenghui who also heads the party has promised 
the primary would establish a fair and open system for choosing 
qualified candidates any incumbent legislator or a person receiving 
endorsement from 02 percent of party members within a district can 
run 
party members no longer blindly accept orders from the top 
said political science professor hu fu of the national taiwan 
university we are still a long way from true democracy but the 
primary could push the nationalists to move toward that direction 
the primary will choose about 100 candidates from a field of 250 
the process so far has had its rough spots 
premier lee huans son lee chinghua was forced to withdraw 
after opponents claimed his candidacy was designed to perpetuate his 
familys influence 
the younger lee the popular secretarygeneral of taiwans 
olympic committee said he dropped out because his father was 
nearly suffocated by criticism of the candidacy 
several candidates claimed local nationalist offices with close 
links to the military told party members to vote for certain 
candidates leading to accusations of military intervening in 
politics 
candidate wang linlin showed the media a letter she claimed was 
sent by the military to party members in her district asking that 
they vote for a retired serviceman 
some party officials have not adjusted their old mentality 
she said they still want to call the shots the old tactics 
employed against the opposition are now used to hurt the partys own 
candidates 
party officials denied the allegations but political observers 
believe the nationalist officials might be backing candidates loyal 
to them to prevent losing control of the new legislature 
if many candidates win the elections on their own they may not 
support the partys policies said chu yunhan a political 
science professor at national taiwan university 
the primary also has been marred by rumors of some candidates 
giving away expensive watches foreign cigarettes or money to buy 
votes officials said they were investigating the reports 
the democratic progressive party the main opposition party also 
will hold a primary sunday for its 20000 members to elect 48 
candidates from a field of 52 
the partys populist platform attracts many native taiwanese who 
constitute 85 percent of the islands 20 million people the 
remaining 15 percent are largely mainland chinese whose families 
came to the island during the nationalist retreat 
at stake in the december elections are 101 seats in the 
legislative yuan the highest lawmaking body

high tide has a new meaning these 
days along texas gulf coast 
dozens of bundles of cocaine with an estimated street value of 5 
million have washed up along more than 200 miles of coast during the 
past three weeks attracting a new breed of beachcomber to the 
areas tiny fishing and resort towns 
everybodys talking about it and i think everybodys looking 
for it said herb knowles who works at the dirty pelican pier in 
crystal beach about 30 miles east of galveston guys on the 
weekend are out here at night on threewheeled vehicles with big 
spotlights on the beach 
you tell me what theyre looking for 
the first discovery occurred june 28 when five packages weighing 
a total of about 145 pounds were found in the sand on matagorda 
island about 100 miles southwest of houston 
a week and a half later five bundles totaling about 78 pounds 
washed ashore on the bolivar peninsula across from galveston and 19 
bundles weighing about 81 pounds were discovered by the matagorda 
county sheriffs department 
the latest find occurred thursday when six men fishing about 10 
miles off galveston found 25 bundles with 83 pounds of cocaine 
floating in the gulf of mexico 
altogether 61 packages containing 261 pounds of 98 percent pure 
uncut cocaine have been discovered by authorities or turned in to 
them 
it all has the same markings which leads us to believe its 
from the same load said james e caldwell supervisory special 
agent for the us customs service in galveston 
marine biologists have estimated the cocaine was in the water 
from three weeks to a couple of months it was bundled in watertight 
packages of five bricks each wrapped in fiberglass resin and duct 
tape and then tied together with yellow plastic rope 
each brick was marked with the word centavo and the 
designation t5 on some of the bricks also is written usa 2 
the drugs probably came from colombia caldwell said how they 
wound up in the gulf is anyones guess 
it could have been from a ship that went down it could have 
been an air drop they could have tied it off with floats he said 
officials have speculated that a drug boat may have been wrecked 
during tropical storm allison last month dumping the contraband in 
the gulf 
galveston county sheriff joe max taylor said these are the first 
instances of cocaine washing ashore in texas although bales of 
marijuana have washed up in the past 
texas isnt the only state awash in cocaine more than 150 pounds 
of cocaine has been found on and off south carolina beaches during 
the past two weeks perhaps the result of an unsuccessful air drop 
by smugglers federal officials have said 
in texas the coast guard and some sheriffs departments made 
special cocaine patrols last week along miles of desolate beach but 
most of the search now is confined to routine patrols 
were not doing anything special said petty officer bowde 
west of the coast guard station at port oconnor but this 
definitely is the talk of the town thats for sure 
people like to keep it quiet but they were wanting to comb the 
beaches to look added susie segura who can see miles of open 
beach from her perch on meacoms pier off high island northeast of 
galveston 
knowles said hes seen everything from parts of houses to 
bathtubs come ashore but no cocaine yet if he does he said hed 
leave the package on the beach and call police 
nine times out of 10 they might think it was mine to begin 
with he said 
the cocaine thats been discovered will be flown to dallas where 
federal authorities will destroy it caldwell said 
its pretty potent he said i imagine there have been some 
people sick who see this on television but some of it might still 
be in the gulf

two innkeepers are offering customers 
1 per mosquito bite to combat the notion that vermont has been 
taken over by bloodthirsty bugs 
robert lynch and thomas nunan are giving a bounty for bites 
after publicity on state funding for the town of brandons insect 
control program led to cancellations of inn reservations across the 
state 
brandon about 60 miles northwest of saxtons river has been hit 
especially hard by the bloodsucking bugs this year but most other 
parts of the state dont have mosquito problems 
lynch owner of the saxtons river inn claimed his business was 
off by 20 percent because of widespread mosquito fear with 100 
cancellations in june alone 
nunan who owns the black river inn in ludlow said two bicycle 
tours were cancelled at his inn this mnth because of the news 
reports 
he said other innkeepers have received calls from people who said 
they would only visit with a guarantee of no bites 
in response to the mosquito publicity the state will spend 
40000 to promote tourism but the ads have no mention of the bugs 
lynch likes his bounty idea better 
youve got the hit the problem directly not smooth it over

setting fire to 2500 ivory tusks worth 3 
million president daniel arap moi said he wanted to draw attention 
to a continentwide slaughter that threatens to wipe out africas 
elephant in 10 years 
hundreds of government officials diplomats journalists and 
conservationists watched tuesday as moi put a torch to the 12 tons 
ivory atop a 20foot pile of wood 
the pyre was placed on a hill in nairobi national park 
overlooking the vast athi plains that are home to gazelle rhino 
giraffe zebra lions and other wild animals 
actions speak louder than words moi said kenya cannot 
appeal to the world to stop buying ivory if at the same time we are 
selling the very same commodity 
conservationists and many nations have called for a worldwide ban 
on the ivory trade 
kenyas elephant population has fallen from 65000 in the l970s 
to about l7000 in all of africa poaching has cut the elephant 
population from an estimated 15 million in the 1970s to fewer than 
700000 today 
iain douglashamilton an elephant expert said the burn was 
immensely important and he hoped it would help make people in 
ivory consuming nations aware that if they buy wear or sell 
ivory theyre helping kill elephants 
moi said he also will destroy 270 rhino horns kenya confiscated 
from poachers but did not say when 
despite a rhino horn trading ban africas rhino population has 
dwindled from 65000 in the early 1970s to an estimated 4000 
conservationists say the ban has failed because the horn is still 
highly prized in the far east where it is sold in powdered form as 
an aphrodisiac 
moi said his government will continue to destroy all ivory 
confiscated within its borders 
i hope our action will help persuade others to appreciate the 
urgent need to take drastic steps to halt the wanton slaughter of 
elephants by declining to trade in ivory and its products both 
within africa and beyond moi said 
the ivory burned tuesday represented four years worth of tusks 
confiscated from poachers 
more than 600 gallons of gasoline fueled the fire since ivory 
only burns under intense heat the top half of the pyre was 
blackened after about an hour 
richard leakey kenyas director of wildlife said the government 
has increased the number of game patrols and he said poaching has 
fallen drastically in the past two months 
about 300 elephants were killed in the first five months of 1989 
ivory fetches 109 to 154 a pound on the world market with the 
higher prices going for the increasingly rare larger tusks an 
average tusk weighs nearly 11 pounds down from nearly 22 pounds a 
decade ago 
kenya has joined a growing list of countries that support a 
worldwide ban on the ivory trade conservationists say the ban would 
likely work because the elephant tusk is used only for decorative 
purposes 
the eec japan and the united states buy up to 75 percent of 
ivory on world markets but in june the united states japan the 
12nation european economic community switzerland and canada 
imposed bans on ivory imports 
the lausanne switzerlandbased 102nation convention on 
international trade in endangered species will meet in october to 
consider a worldwide ban 
zimbabwe south africa and botswana oppose the ban they say they 
have successfully protected their elephants while herds in other 
african nations have declined

some senators say rising prices for 
prescription drugs may hurt health care for the elderly in the near 
future 
steadily rising prescription prices have driven up the costs of 
medicaid programs and are a concern as well for the medicare program 
from 1981 through 1988 the prescription drug inflation rate of 
88 percent dwarfed the general inflation rate of 28 percent sen 
david pryor chairman of the senate special committee on aging said 
tuesday 
sen richard shelby dala agreed saying soon many elderly 
will be priced out of the market 
a report by the panels democratic staff said most of the drugs 
pharmaceutical companies put on the market are duplicates of drugs 
already being sold it said 84 percent of the 348 drugs brought to 
market by the 25 biggest companies between 1981 and 1988 were judged 
by the food and drug administration as providing little or no 
therapeutic potential to improve on existing drugs

stalin to his soontobe published autobiography according to a

yalta and so forth said isham 
yalta a soviet city was the site of a treaty signing that set 
up postworld war ii superpower relations

the new parliament voted overwhelmingly 
early today to investigate former socialist premier andreas 
papandreou and four of his senior cabinet ministers to see if they 
should be charged with corruption 
the decision to set up a 12member parliamentary committee to 
investigate the former officials alleged involvement in a 200 
million scandal involving the bank of crete came at the close of two 
days of stormy debate 
along with papandreou former cabinet ministers agamemnon 
koutsogiorgas panayiotis roumeliotis george petsos and dimitris 
tsovolas have been accused of ordering staterun companies to 
deposit the equivalent of 12 million in the troubled bank of crete 
in order to skim off the interest 
koutsogiorgas had served as deputy premier and justice minister 
roumeliotis held the national economy portfolio petsos was 
transport minister and later public order minister and tsovolas was 
finance minister 
former bank of crete chairman giorgos koskotas who has accused 
papandreou of authorizing the alleged scheme is in a salem mass 
jail fighting extradition a decision is expected later this month 
the bank of crete case was one of a series of scandals that 
contributed to defeat of the panhellenic socialist movement pasok 
in june 18 parliamentary elections 
voters failed to give any one party an absolute parliamentry 
majority prompting the conservatives and a communist alliance to 
form a coalition government 
the 300member unicameral parliament decided on each of the five 
former socialist officials by secret ballot and overwhelmingly 
favored investigating all of them 
the parliamentary proceedings were carried live by staterun 
hellenic radio and television most greeks were glued to their 
television sets or radios till the early morning hours 
the investigative committee has three weeks to complete its 
findings and decide whether there are grounds for prosecution by a 
special civil court comprised of supreme court judges 
the 70yearold papandreou on his honeymoon after marrying 
35yearold former airline hostess dimitra liani last week has 
denied any wrongdoing he had told his deputies they were free to 
vote according to their conscience 
the coalition government was formed with a threemonth mandate to 
investigate the scandals that wracked the former socialist 
administration at the end of the 90 days the governing coalition 
led by conservative premier tzannis tzannnetakis said it will call 
new elections 
in last months elections the conservative new democracy party

whether she qualified as a character witness planned to announce 
his decision today 
the new york daily news reported however that sharansky and his 
wife avital returned home tuesday night 
wallachs attorney gary naftalis pleaded with owen to allow 
mrs sharansky to take the stand tuesday 
he said the couple could stay for only one day because mrs 
sharanskys mother was dying 
im upset mrs sharansky told the daily news my mother is 
dying and i have two little children i have never left them before 
i am sorry that my testimony will not be heard 
for his part owen said he wanted to review the law before making 
a decision im not going to be rushed into this he said 
wallach a san francisco attorney and longtime friend of former 
us attorney general edwin meese is charged with two others in a 
21count racketeering indictment with illegally extracting almost 2 
million from the nowdefunct wedtech corp the charges include some 
525000 in bribes to wallach to influence meese and other 
government officials 
once a small machine shop wedtech grew into a 100 million 
government contractor through a special program that set aside 
contracts without competitive bidding for minoritycontrolled 
companies 
owen questioned mrs sharansky outside the presence of the jury 
to determine how well she knew wallach 
she said wallach whom she met in 1982 had been instrumental in 
alerting reagan administration officials about the plight of her 
husband who spent nine years in a soviet prison camp 
sharansky in court with his wife tuesday was released in march 
1986 
wallach was available to her night and day to discuss 
problems and strategy in her efforts to free her husband said mrs 
sharansky 
always if he promised something to me he did it she said 
he never asked for compensation she said 
wallach sought help for sharansky from meese former national 
security adviser robert mcfarlane and numerous members of congress 
she said he also introduced her to former secretary of state henry 
kissinger 
assistant us attorney baruch weiss opposed calling mrs 
sharansky as a character witness he said her testimony was 
designed to appeal to the sympathy of the jury in a way that a 
character witness is not allowed

jokers trying to make a fast buck with 
counterfeit batman merchandise had better think twice warner bros 
has warned 
the company said tuesday it has confiscated more than 40000 
items bearing phony batman symbols in nationwide legal actions 
against purveyors of pirated merchandise 
we dont license schlock said j joseph bainton counsel for 
warner communication cos my mother raised me to believe that 
stealings wrong 
us marshals helped seize tshirts hats shorts medallions and 
other ripoffs under a series of nationwide federal lawsuits since 
the first week in june the movie opened june 23 
the raids were ordered on the streets of new york philadelphia 
and washington dc at flea markets in new york and los angeles 
manufacturers and distributors in new york los angeles and florida 
retail stores in new york and through us customs in los angeles 
dan romanelli warners president of worldwide merchandising 
said the forgeries result in many many millions of dollars in 
losses for warner lca entertainment the licensing agent and dc 
comics 
wholesale domestic revenues for official batman items are 
projected at 250 million he said 
real batman shirts retail for 8 to 18 depending on the 
manufacturer the fakes go for about 5 
from across the street they look the same said bainton 
but he said that the ripoffs fall apart quickly 
romanelli said they are marred by shoddy artwork that is 
going to run as soon as its washed 
in one way its a nice problem to have because the fakes are a 
barometer for the market for the legitimate merchandise said 
bainton who predicted sales would explode at halloween 
warner may donate the confiscated clothing to charity 
bainton said the penalties are 500 to 20000 for someone who 
sells ripoffs unknowingly 100000 for someone who sells them 
willfully and up to five years in jail for those who refuse to obey 
a court order 
about 90 retail outlets in new york city are under court order to 
stop selling the ripoffs said bainton 
warner has hundreds of professional investigators around the 
country and its employees also report ripoffs 
their reward said romanelli will be bat points to keep the 
joker at bay

mayor coleman a young announced a bid for a 
record fifth term telling supporters aint nobody going to run me 
out 
if you cant stand the heat stay out of the kitchen because 
were cooking up something young 71 said tuesday at a community 
center were cooking up unity respect and love 
since his narrow victory in 1973 detroits first black mayor has 
won three subsequent elections easily and was expected to run again 
this year youngs campaign fund is estimated at 5 million 
eight weeks remain before a nonpartisan sept 12 mayoral 
primary when voters will select two candidates for a runoff nov 7 
challengers to young include city council president erma 
henderson unsuccessful 1985 mayoral candidate thomas barrow 
businessman charles costa and selfdescribed candidate of god 
james a williams 
youngs critics have accused him of focusing on downtown 
development in the nations sixthlargest city at the expense of 
neighborhoods 
but the mayor told a crowd of about 1500 cheering supporters 
that he has helped rebuild the city in his 15 years in office and 
has plenty more to do 
theres been a lot accomplished even ray charles could see 
that young said but theres a lot more to be done we will 
complete the rebuilding of the city of detroit 
ill leave if i want to but aint nobody going to run me out 
as mayor he succeeded in integrating the police and fire 
departments and landed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal 
and state economic development grants many of them for downtown 
projects along the detroit river 
youngs years in office also have seen a continuation of the 
white and middleclass flight from the city to the suburbs that 
began shortly after world war ii and accelerated with the 1967 riots 
that left 37 dead and devastated large sections of the city 
detroit which had a population of 2 million in 1950 now has 
about 1 million residents in a metropolitan area that has grown to 
more than 4 million about twothirds of city residents are black 
businesses and retailers have fled the city as well and its 
increasingly impoverished neighborhoods have seen violence drug 
abuse and crime steadily rise 
when young visits a neighborhood its like hes touring a 
foreign country barrow said monday at least when president 
bush went to poland he left them with a promise 
young also has drawn criticism for his delay in acknowledging he 
was the father of a 6yearold boy born to former city official 
annivory calvert now the public works director in fontana calif 
young agreed to pay support for the boy after blood tests 
confirmed he was the father

the calamitous alaskan oil spill could 
have been avoided if efforts to steer the exxon valdez back into 
shipping lanes had begun six or seven minutes earlier the exxon 
shipping co said 
exxon on tuesday released its findings on the march 24 accident 
that caused the nations worst oil spill the report has been 
submitted to the national transportation safety board 
in a separate filing with the ntsb on monday the state said poor 
management by exxon led to the spill of nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude oil into prince william sound 
in related developments tuesday 
a spokesman for gov steve cowper criticized the federal 
government for its pace in estimating environmental damage from the 
spill weve got to get this federal process of assessing damages 
off the dime so alaskans can be fairly and promptly compensated 
said spokesman david ramseur 
workers offshore san diego finished sampling seawater in the 
valdezs cargo holds and officials said it would take about a week 
to determine the toxicity of oily discharges from the damaged tanker 
two weeks ago the coast guard stopped the ship from entering san 
diego harbor for repairs after an 18mile slick was sighted near the 
tanker state officials on tuesday said the company must ensure all 
discharges have stopped and prepare a contingency plan for handling 
any pollution before docking the vessel 
in its report exxon said the grounding of the 987foot tanker 
and the resulting spill were caused by a delay in turning the ship 
back to traffic lanes after it was maneuvered to avoid ice 
the level of staffing aboard the ship did not contribute to the 
wreck the crew had adequate rest to perform its work and the role 
of alcohol in the accident cannot be established exxon said the 
company said it vigilantly told mariners they were to be sober on 
the job 
critics have said tanker crews are too small and that crew 
members work too long without rest capt joseph hazelwood who was 
not on the tankers bridge at the time of the wreck failed sobriety 
tests administered about 11 hours after the accident he is to be 
tried in october on felony and misdemeanor charges that include 
operating a vessel while intoxicated 
exxons report said the collison could have been avoided if the 
ship had been turned near a navigational light about three miles 
from bligh reef 
the company said it has not resolved a discrepancy involving 
information from a course recorder and testimony given the ntsb by 
third mate gregory cousins who was in charge on the bridge at the 
time of the accident 
cousins testified that he issued rudder orders about the time the 
ship was at the navigational light exxon said the vessel had been 
on automatic steering and there was no testimony or evidence 
suggesting any steering failure 
the company said three members of the crew consumed alcohol in 
valdez before the ship left the dock on the evening of march 23 but 
two had no navigational or watch responsibilities which even in 
the remotest sense could have contributed to this accident 
with respect to capt joseph hazelwood the third crew member 
who had consumed alcoholic beverages in valdez no conclusions can 
be drawn that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time of 
the grounding 
the tanker pilot and the crew said hazelwoods behavior appeared 
normal but a coast guard officer who later boarded the ship 
testified there was a strong odor of alcohol on hazelwoods breath 
the company said the smell of nonalcoholic beer that 
hazelwood said he drank aboard ship may have been detected

officials were emptying a 126 milliongallon 
oil storage tank today before investigating why an unsealed tunnel 
leaked nearly 300 gallons of fuel oil into a new york city area 
waterway 
coast guard spokesman matthew duesing said about 2 million 
gallons of oil had escaped from the tank by tuesday evening most of 
it was contained in surrounding dikes or pumped into barges or a 
pipeline leading to a storage system in the adjacent new york city 
borough of staten island 
the oil that leaked into the arthur kill a narrow waterway that 
separates linden and staten island was confined to a 20by80foot 
area said gary allen a spokesman for the state department of 
environmental protection workers were vacuuming the oil from the 
water and using absorbent booms 
it is free flowing oil so it should not take more then a day 
to clean up allen said 
officials said they expected to empty the tank by around midday 
today 
we wont know what caused it until the tank is totally out of 
service said john reiff general manager at the northville 
industries plant 
the oil that fouled the arthur kill came from an unsealed 
underground tunnel used to carry fuel from storage tanks to barges 
and ships coast guard capt robert c north said workers put a 
makeshift clay seal at the mouth of the tunnel to cut the seepage 
it wasnt sealed and why it wasnt sealed is something we are 
looking into north said 
theres no threat to people said north were concerned 
about the environment if the tank should rupture 
the leak of no 6 fuel oil was reported at late tuesday morning 
at the northville plant where four tanks sit near the edge of the 
arthur kill 
reiff said the damaged tank is 18 years old and was last 
inspected 7 years ago

extremists hurled grenades at a 
procession of sinhalese and tamil worshipers in a southern town 
killing at least 13 people and wounding about 85 police said today 
the attack occurred tuesday night at the end of a weeklong 
religious festival in kataragama 105 miles southeast of colombo 
said a police official speaking on condition of anonymity 
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack 
about 5000 people had gathered for the procession which 
attracts both sinhalese buddhists and tamil hindus and is considered 
a demonstration that the two communities can come together in 
harmony despite the countrys ethnic strife tamil hindus from india 
also were present 
it is a tragedy beyond comparison said ranjith madumma 
bandara a government lawmaker who participated in the procession 
there is nothing sacred in this country any more 
bandara said two women walking beside him were killed in the 
explosions but that he escaped injury 
the sri lankan government imposed press censorship july 6 amid 
escalating ethnic violence and a political dispute with india over 
the withdrawal of indian peacekeeping forces from the small island 
nation southeast of madras 
in madras india a sri lankan tamil party blamed the attack on 
sinhalese militants from the leftwing peoples liberation front 
ponnudurai ravinesan spokesman for the eelam peoples 
revolutionary liberation front said he had information from sri 
lanka that the grenades were thrown by radicals from the sinhalese 
group 
the front has usually attacked only fellow sinhalese since 
launching an uprising against the government in 1987 it has accused 
the sinhalesedominated government of selling out its own people to 
make peace with tamil rebels 
bandara said dharamadasa banda minister of state for 
rehabilitation and other parliament members were walking with the 
procession from a hindu temple to a buddhist dagoba when three 
grenades were hurled banda a sinhalese buddhist who is the 
religious chief for the two shrines was among those injured 
bandara said 
the two shrines which are about a halfmile apart are located 
in the predominantly sinhalese district of monaragala the largely 
tamil district of amparai borders monaragala to its north 
tamil guerrillas embarked on a separatist war in 1983 targeting 
the predominantly sinhalese sri lankan security forces and sinhalese 
civilians 
in 1987 india attempted to mediate peace on the island of 16 
million people by signing an accord with the sri lankan government 
that was designed to give tamils in northern and eastern sri lanka 
some autonomy 
indian troops were dispatched to the island to supervise a 
surrender of arms by tamil guerrillas but the most militant tamils 
reneged on the pact and began battling the indians 
the sri lankan government this summer opened negotiations with 
tamil militants and president ranasinghe premadasa subsequently 
demanded that india withdraw its estimated 40000 soldiers by the 
end of july 
prime minister rajiv gandhi of india has said a premature pullout 
would lead to even more bloodshed 
since 1983 about 14000 people have died in the ethnic strife 
the government blames the sinhalese extremists for about 3500 of 
the killings the others including nearly 1000 indian soldiers 
died in the tamil insurrection 
sinhalese comprise about 75 percent of sri lankas people tamils 
make up 18 percent and say they are discriminated against by 
sinhalese in education jobs and use of the sinhala language 
there also are small moslem and christian communities

to congress told the washington post after the 90minute meeting 
that the session had been about faith

two prominent dissidents were arrested and a hong 
kong newspaper reported today that about 20 people have been 
executed for joining in prodemocracy protests 
the chineselanguage newspaper ming pao said the executions took 
place about 10 days ago and that most of the group were members of 
an outlawed independent workers union set up during the protests 
the beijing peoples high court refused to comment on the report 
as did police several dozen executions are known to have taken 
place since the protests were crushed june 34 but the authorities 
have linked only 12 to the protests many chinese believe the number 
is far higher 
a man who identified himself only as the husband of leading 
journalist dai qing said tuesday that she was arrested last week he 
said plainclothes police came to their home during dinner said they 
wanted to talk to her searched the apartment briefly and led her 
away he said he had not heard from her since 
the official xinhua news agency said a shanghai man jailed for 
two years after chinas last round of student protests in 198687 
was arrested again on the same charge of conducting demagogical 
propaganda for counterrevolutionary purposes 
yang wei had been released from prison in january xinhua accused 
him of collecting information during the recent protests for a 
usbased chinese expatriate group the chinese alliance for 
democracy which seeks political reforms and which china has 
condemned as reactionary 
during yangs first jail term the us congress urged his 
release 
dais arrest was not reported in the official media 
the officially reported arrests total about 2060 nationwide but 
chinese sources say more than that number have been arrested in 
beijing alone and that more people are taken into custody each day 
the authorities may be withholding information on arrests 
especially of leading intellectuals and student protesters in order 
to avoid further international criticism of the crackdown 
in another development the japanese embassy said chinese police 
have promised to investigate an anonymous threat to kill two 
japanese in china each month the threat was made in a letter mailed 
to japan airlines beijing office and signed by a previously unknown 
group the bloodbright dare to die squad the group accused japan 
of colluding with the communist party dictatorial government and 
plotting to launch a largescale economic invasion of china 
embassy spokesman minoru kubota said japans warning to its 
citizens to be careful while visiting china issued after the army 
attacked the student protesters last month still stands he said no 
further action would be taken until police complete their 
investigation 
a public security ministry spokesman refused to acknowledge that 
the case existed and the foreign ministry did not answer telephone 
queries about it 
the chinese government has been trying to encourage foreign 
businessmen and tourists who fled during the army crackdown to 
return and has said their safety is guaranteed 
bo xicheng head of beijing tourism administration told foreign 
travel agents last week that the government would pay 100000 to 
the family of any tourist killed irregularly in beijing because 
of martial law tourism officials said they did not know what 
irregularly meant 
also today one of chinas most popular and controversial 
television programs was condemned on the front page of the peoples 
daily in an essay that set the tone for the governments new hard 
line 
the sixpart program river elegy an analysis of chinese 
culture was aired twice last summer to one of the biggest audiences 
for any show on china central television it concluded that chinese 
culture is rigid inbred suffocating and unable to adopt to the 
modern world

defense secretary dick cheney is lobbying 
congressmen behind closed doors in his uphill battle to get 
funding for the multibilliondollar b2 stealth bomber 
cheney took word of the planes first successful test flight into 
the first round of meetings tuesday with lawmakers who will debate 
the fate of the bomber and the overall 305 billion pentagon budget 
next week on the house and senate floors 
he said mondays twohour flight of the sinisterlooking dark 
flying wing boosted chances the radarevading plane will also dodge 
congressional critics who want to stop funding the program 
having gotten it this far its now flying and i think we ought 
to proceed with it cheney said before meeting with a group of 
house republicans i think it would be a serious mistake for us to 
turn our back on that system 
the plane the most expensive in history is to be dismantled and 
undergo another series of tests before it is prepared for a second 
flight 
but house speaker thomas s foley dwash says cheney faces 
an uphill battle for the weapon in the defense authorization 
bill 
the batlike bomber whose unorthodox design and materials makes 
it tough to track with radar carries a 500 million price tag that 
has prompted sticker shock in budgetconscious lawmakers 
cheney calls the plane a firstclass aircraft that represents 
a significant advancement in technology as well as a major 
investment of 22 billion so far 
later in the week cheney is slated to meet with senators and 
members of the house gop conference committee over breakfast 
according to pentagon spokesman pete williams 
the department has proposed 47 billion for the stealth bomber 
in the fiscal 1990 budget and wants about 24 billion for the 
program during a peak threeyear spending period in the mid1990s 
overall the pentagon wants to buy 132 planes for 70 billion 
the house armed services committee last month slashed 800 
million from the b2 budget on friday the senate armed services 
committee trimmed 300 million from the bush administrations 
request and included a series of testing requirements before the 
plane could go into full production 
williams told reporters the successful test flight should have 
changed some minds on capitol hill 
there were many members of congress who said they couldnt make 
a decision about the b2 until it had flown now it has flown 
that whole question of whether it could fly is gone williams 
said 
it has proven it can fly and that makes a substantial 
difference the spokesman said

in exchange for a prosecution promise not to seek maximum penalties 
the woman testified she was sexually assaulted about a dozen 
times by the five young men after they threatened to kill her and 
her husband 
the assaults started at the bar entrance which was locked for 
construction she said her husband was pushed and punched when he 
tried to pull her toward their car she said 
the assaults continued at a nearby house where she said she heard 
one person tell her husband you must not care very much about her 
if you brought her here and shes ours now 
after struggling free going outside and screaming for someone to 
call the police she said i saw these guys running up and kicking 
him her husband in the face

yelling and screaming outside and looked to see a group of 
teenagers hitting and beating on something in the middle of the 
street

un secretary general javier perez de 
cuellar today began three days of talks aimed at resolving what he 
called critical problems in a yearlong independence plan for 
namibia 
the united nations chief met with senior un officials in the 
territory he was scheduled to hold talks with all major political 
parties and namibias south african administrator louis pienaar 
i want to ensure that conditions are created that will enable 
the holding of free and fair elections in november perez de 
cuellar said upon his arrival in namibia late tuesday night 
south africa which has ruled namibia since world war i agreed 
in december to carry out the un independence plan under terms of a 
regional peace accord under the usbrokered pact south africa 
also pledged to halt aid to guerrillas battling the angolan 
government 
in exchange the agreement stipulated that the estimated 50000 
cuban troops supporting the angolan government would be withdrawn 
more than 5000 un personnel are in namibia to monitor the 
independence process in the territory 
perez de cuellar indicated the independence plan is on track but 
said critical problems remain 
he did not elaborate but the remark was interpreted as a 
reference to mutual suspicion between namibias south african 
administration and the southwest africa peoples organization or 
swapo the group favored in the elections swapo fought a 23year 
guerrilla war in an effort to drive out the south africans 
on tuesday swapo accused pienaar of creating a war hysteria 
by claiming 1900 swapo fighters were massed near the angolanamibia 
border 
swapo and un officials said they found nothing to support the 
claims during a visit to northern namibia over the weekend 
more than 1000 armed guerrillas crossed into namibia on april 1 
the day the independence plan took effect the ensuing three weeks 
of fighting left more than 300 guerrillas and 27 security force 
members dead and it jeopardized the independence plan 
perez de cuellar is also expected to look into charges of 
intimidation by the police force 
an estimated 3000 paramilitary police have been incorporated 
into the regular police force and swapo says they are harassing its 
supporters 
perez de cuellar was to visit several northern towns thursday to 
examine the security situation and observe repatriation of namibian 
refugees a total of 41000 refugees are to come home 
the un chief heads friday to south africa for talks with 
government leaders there

just as dan quayle was settling comfortably 
into the vice presidency several fellows who helped put him there 
campaign advisers borrowed from the reagan entourage have provoked 
anger in the white house by painting an unflattering portrait of his 
candidacy 
the old stories about quayle being a lightweight a footinmouth 
campaigner and a neophyte not up to the job he sought are revived 
in a new book whose broad stripes and bright stars the trivial 
pursuit of the presidency 1988 by political columnists jules 
witcover and jack germond 
derisive comments about quayles abilities come not from 
democratic critics but from the gop stable of advisers the bush 
campaign assigned to help manage quayle among them political pros 
stuart spencer joseph canzeri and james lake all former advisers 
to president reagan 
their caustic assessments of quayles capabilities and their 
problems in running his campaign paint a picture of a candidate who 
needed protection from doing himself political harm 
canzeri told the authors that quayle was like a kid ask him to 
turn off a light and by the time he gets to the switch hes 
forgotten what he went for canzeri said the handlers knew we 
were going to have to script him 
sometimes the advisers said quayle exasperated and confounded 
them by refusing to follow the script 
the book quotes spencer as saying that he let quayle scrap a 
prepared defense speech in chicago once and deliver his own rambling 
version so that the vice presidential candidate would foul up 
publicly and then well own him again 
lake told of a time when i just pushed him aside to keep 
quayle from answering questions about his vietnamera national guard 
service at a time when it would have overshadowed george bushs 
convention acceptance speech 
longtime gop consultant ed rollins a former white house 
political director said any candid group of political people in 
town would have told the bush team that quayle was a lightweight and 
should not be vice president 
president bush is not happy about the characterizations 
i find it offensive i dont like it he told reporters 
tuesday thats the ugly side of politics 
bush noted quayle has made two trips to latin america for the 
administration as well as heading the space council and 
contributing to bushs morning staff meetings 
hes a good man and he deserves something better than a 
postmortem kick in the ankles bush said 
ironically the book comes out at a time when quayle has received 
relatively favorable portrayals in several media accounts 
aside from an occasional gaffe he recently referred to 
moontraveling astronaut buzz aldrin as buz lukens the congressman 
convicted of corrupting a minor through sexual activity quayle has 
not embarrassed the administration 
one former quayle adviser who disagrees with those quoted in the 
book mitch daniels said the critical picture they paint was not 
true but even if it were he said hes gone light years beyond 
that stage as vice president 
but this image of quayle is not widely seen outside washington 
political circles while the capital may take him seriously quayle 
still provides frequent fodder for the likes of latenight comics 
jay leno and david letterman 
quayle advisers acknowledge he hasnt shaken his image problem 
across the nation and the new book no doubt will stall progress on 
that front 
quayle himself called it rather a cruel hoax that some of your 
top advisers would speak like that behind your back 
the line from the quayle camp now is some of his campaign 
problems may have stemmed from his acquiescence to that very circle 
of advisers 
i share the blame i could have told them to go to hell but i 
didnt press secretary david beckwith quoted his boss as saying

britain and vietnam have agreed secretly to force 
thousands of vietnamese refugees in hong kong to return to vietnam 
british news reports said today 
the guardian newspaper said the agreement was confirmed by 
government officials in london and in hong kong it did not identify 
the officials 
the british broadcasting corp said without attribution in a 
radio bulletin that details of the reported agreement had been 
disclosed in hong kong 
the foreign office would not confirm the report and hong kong 
officials refused comment 
the guardian said the refugees to be repatriated have been 
classified as economic migrants from vietnam rather than genuine 
refugees it said more than half the 50000 boat people in hong kong 
are likely to be sent back to vietnam 
the bbc said the reported agreement has been kept secret to avoid 
provoking possible unrest among refugees in the british colony 
the number of people fleeing vietnam has increased in recent 
years many due to the poor state of vietnams economy rather than 
political oppression many nations that have been accepting the 
refugees have called for limits 
the guardian report quoted one source as saying the repatriations 
could begin within a week it said a meeting between british foreign 
secretary sir geoffrey howe and his vietnamese counterpart nguyen 
co thach on june 28 had paved the way for the agreement 
the paper also said britain has agreed to end its embargo on 
economic aid to vietnam and will provide various forms of assistance 
a foreign office press officer who spoke on condition of 
anonymity in keeping with british custom said talks between british 
and vietnamese officials were still going on and that the granting 
of british development aid to vietnam was dependent on the 
withdrawal of vietnamese troops from cambodia 
the press officer added we have nothing to announce on the 
outcome of those talks yet 
robert van leeuwen head of the un high commissioner for 
refugees in the colony said he has not been informed of an 
agreement between britain and vietnam 
van leeuwen also said a group of vietnamese officials would 
arrive in hong kong on wednesday night to interview 300 boat people 
who have volunteered to return to their homeland instead of 
remaining in detention centers in the british colony 
so far 143 boat people have returned to their country under a 
program of voluntary repatriation another group is expected to fly 
back in about one month the un official said 
he added that there were indications the number of boat people 
volunteering to return home is increasing

experts seeking victims of 19th century 
cannibal alferd packer dug up eleven bones probably all from the 
same man but couldnt immediately tell how the person died or if he 
was eaten 
we havent found anything to date to indicate sharp implement 
marks said walter birkby a physical anthropologist from the 
arizona state museum in tucson 
the first bone the left temporal bone from the side of a human 
skull was found tuesday by an expedition organized by washington 
university law professor james starrs others came from a foot leg 
and hands 
birkby said the condition of the first bones found made him 
optimistic he might be able to recognize knife marks gunshot 
wounds or postmortem breakage of the bones that could indicate 
cannibalism 
the diggers hope to sift the truth from the legends that have 
grown up around the deaths of five utah men who went with packer on 
a goldprospecting trip in the san juan mountains in 1874 
packer who admitted eating his companions remains was the sole 
survivor the way he told it the group got snowbound on the 
9000foot mountain ridge in 1874 
he said shannon bell one of the party killed the other four 
while packer was away from camp packer said he killed bell in 
selfdefense and ate the remains of the five men to survive 
packer was convicted of murdering one of the prospectors israel 
swan on april 13 1883 but the state supreme court overturned the 
sentence and when he was retried packer was convicted of 
manslaughter 
packer was sentenced to serve 40 years in prison but was paroled 
in 1901 he died april 24 1907 
the gravesite of the five victims has been set off by a marker 
which honors the five men who were murdered on this spot early in 
the year 1874 while pioneering for mineral resources of the san juan 
country 
working in shortsleeved shirts hiking shorts and hats and 
using common garden tooks archaeologist jim ayres birkby and some 
of their graduate students dug about 6 inches under the marker 
tuesday before locating parallel rows of rock that they speculated 
marked the graves of the five men the first bone was found a short 
time later 
lab work will determine age cause of death and other details the 
bones may be able to provide ayres said the searchers next task 
was to find if there are five separate graves or if all the victims 
bones were interred in one large pit

budapests communist party has proposed 
that oct 23 the day the 1956 antistalinist uprising broke out be 
celebrated as a symbol of popular will for democratic reform 
the proposal was indicative of the dramatic changes in the 
partys assessment of the revolt 
only last year there was an official ban on any public gathering 
oct 23 causing opposition groups to cancel a planned march while 
thousands of police prevented groups from forming around sites 
associated with the revolt 
the ruling communist party this year reversed its decadeslong 
official assesment of the revolt as a counterrevolution saying it 
began as a popular uprising 
andras fabriczky a secretary of the budapest communist party 
committee told the official news agency mti tuesday that 
participants in the protests that broke out oct 23 1956 with calls 
for greater democracy espoused reform ideas now also embraced by 
the current communist party leadership 
oct 23 should be a day of national reconciliation marked 
jointly by opposition groups and the party mti quoted fabriczky as 
saying 
the budapest committee said it also supported proposals by 
opposition groups and reform communists that a square be named after 
imre nagy the premier during the revolt who was executed in 1958 on 
charges of high treason 
earlier this month the hungarian supreme court canceled all 
charges against nagy in a move amounting to his legal rehabilitation 
last month his remains were reburied in an elaborate funeral 
ceremony attended by hundreds of thousands and the party and 
government have embraced him as a forerunner of communist reforms 
mti quoted fabriczky as saying the formal naming of a square 
should take place oct 23 as well as the laying of a cornerstone 
for a monument to the memory of the heroes and victims of 1956

city officials have approved a ban next 
year on plastic food containers coolants solvents and other 
products containing chlorofluorocarbons that deplete the earths 
ozone 
according to a city ordinance adopted tuesday local businesses 
will be banned from buying selling or using products containing 
chloroflurocarbons or cfcs as of july 1 1990 
scientists say cfcs are destroying the earths ozone layer which 
screens the suns ultraviolet rays exposure to large doses of 
ultraviolet rays can lead to skin cancer and other diseases 
the measure approved by a 41 vote is believed to be one of the 
most comprehensive ever adopted city officials said 
we think it is the most farreaching ordinance in the united 
states said mayor larry agran who proposed the measure we 
think it will set the standard nationally and globally 
under terms of the ordinance violators would be fined 50 for a 
first offense 100 for a second offense and 250 for each 
subsequent offense each day of noncompliance with the ordinance 
would be considered a violation 
the ordinance also creates the job of environmental program 
coordinator a person who would work with businesses to find 
alternative compounds to those containing cfcs and who would have 
authority to grant exemptions to the ordinance 
cfcs are found in such products as coolants cleaning solvents 
and plastic food containers including plastic coffee cups they 
have already been banned in aerosol products made in the united 
states 
companies in this city 40 miles southeast of los angeles that are 
expected to be most affected by the ban include insulation 
installers food packagers fire extinguisher manufacturers air 
conditioning and refrigeration repair operations and electronics 
manufacturers 
the ordinance will not ban the use of cfcs in automobile air 
conditioners and refrigerators but it will require service stations 
and repair shops to capture and recycle the compounds 
several representatives of businesses that would be affected 
spoke out against the ordinance during a 2hour hearing attended by 
about 100 people 
scott byington an air conditioning serviceman said the 
ordinance would increase the price of home air conditioner repairs 
from an average of 60 to 200 
youre going to have a flood of exemption applications said 
keith lehm western regional manager for general chemicals in 
wilmington del a national manufacturer of cfcs he called the 
measure overzealous and disruptive 
alex sapre corporate projects manager for hughes aircraft co 
said the issue would be better left to national or international 
environmental experts 
cfcs are a global concern and therefore need a global 
solution sapre said 
if we wait until all these people take action we might as well 
kiss off the future of the globe the mayor said

a federal official says the united states wants 
decisive action by cuba against drugsmuggling as that country 
makes overtures for a joint antidrug campaign including a reported 
meeting with a state department official 
word of the meeting between a top cuban diplomat and michael 
kozak deputy assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs came tuesday from rep charles rangel dny and was 
confirmed today by a cuban official 
however another state department official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said we have raised the issue of 
narcotics with the cubans on many many occasions over the years 
we certainly think theres ample room for the cubans to take 
action he said were looking for deeds rather than just 
words 
he declined to accept cubas execution last week of four military 
officials including a hero of the revolution for drug 
trafficking as sufficient evidence of that countrys commitment to 
the war against drugs 
the united states is waiting for such actions as interdicting 
drugs stopping the flow over their territory the official said 
rangel said he was told of the meeting between kozak and jose 
antonio arbesu fraga the new chief of the cuban interests section 
by arbesu and his assistant chief manuel davis the cuban interests 
section is that countrys substitute for an embassy attached 
formally to the czechoslovakian embassy 
the cubans said tuesday they have talked with the state 
department and told them that cuba is waiting to see how havana can 
better establish a dialogue because no matter what the political 
differences are no one can allow the drug traffickers to take 
advantage rangel said 
they also said they told kozak they are willing to cooperate in 
any international antidrug venture said rangel who chairs the 
house select committee on narcotics abuse and control 
clinton adlum a spokesman for the cuban interests section said 
today that arbesu who arrived in the united states in june has 
visited with several officials at the state department including 
mr kozak in these conversations the drug problem has come up 
however adlum said there still is no ongoing dialogue between 
the countries on cooperation in antidrug efforts 
cuba is definitely interested in this adlum said we have 
always been interested in cooperation with anybody including the 
united states 
the state department official said kozak had met with cuban 
representatives many times over the years but he declined to say 
whether the specific meeting in question had taken place or what 
might have been discussed 
one indication of possible change in the us stance was the 
cancellation of a closeddoor coast guard briefing of rangels 
committee on uscuban drug cooperation 
the meeting was scheduled for early tuesday morning but coast 
guard commandant adm paul yost called rangel late monday to cancel 
it saying changing developments were responsible according to 
rangel 
a coast guard spokesman lt cmdr marc w wolfson said today 
the admiral had to cancel the briefing because the administration 
thought it would be premature to give a briefing while theyre 
reviewing the situation and taking a look at the circumstances in 
the caribbean right now 
while wolfson declined to speculate on a possible change in us 
attitudes toward cooperation with cuba he said he believed the 
state department had advised yost to hold off on the briefing 
cuban leader fidel castro called last week for cooperation 
between the two countries to combat drugs 
we need some way to communicate in this common battle castro 
said in a fourhour speech to the cuban council of state we need 
to talk to the americans about how to manage this situation 
he contended the united states failed to warn him of cuban 
military involvement in cocaine trafficking saying the united 
states had at least two names of military officers involved in a 
cocainetrafficking conspiracy long before contacts in colombia 
alerted cuban officials 
last thursday one of castros trusted advisors army maj gen 
arnaldo ochoa sanchez and three other military officers were 
executed for smuggling tons of drugs into the united states 
the drug scandal stunned and embarrassed castro and his communist 
government which for years denied us accusations that cuba was 
being used to smuggle cocaine and marijuana

vietnams foreign minister nguyen co 
thach said today the vietnameseinstalled government in cambodia 
should agree to a ceasefire with guerrilla forces opposing it 
official media reported 
also today prime minister hun sen of cambodia left for paris to 
attend an international conference on cambodia starting july 30 
also expected at the paris conference are the cambodian guerrilla 
factions vietnam and its ally laos the sixmember association of 
southeast asian nations and in their first collective attempt at 
cambodian peace talks the five permanent members of the un 
security council britain france the united states china and the 
soviet union 
vietnams radio hanoi said thach was asked during an interview on 
vietnamese television about a truce proposal made by thai prime 
minister chatichai choonhavan a few months ago 
the cambodian issue cannot be solved peacefully without a 
ceasefire thach replied therefore vietnam fully supports the 
thai prime ministers proposal that the cambodian parties sign a 
ceasefire agreement in bangkok and considers this as part of a 
political solution to the cambodian issue 
hun sen and prince norodom sihanouk leader of the threeparty 
guerrilla coalition said in may they agreed in principle with the 
proposal but the khmer rouge the largest and most hardline 
guerrilla force rejected it 
thach also said that in recent talks in indonesia we have 
formed a basis for a political solution to the cambodian issue 
but he did not elaborate 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 and ousted the 
communist khmer rouge which killed hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians and attacked vietnamese border villages during its nearly 
fouryear reign 
vietnam says it will withdraw its 60000 to 70000 troops from 
cambodia by sept 30 whether or not there is a political settlement 
in the war

were internal organs and not external limbs as a published report

discrepancy the daily news said today

rejected supreme court nominee robert bork told 
a house panel today that the high court erred in ruling that the 
constitution protects flag burning and the only way to turn things 
around is through a constitutional amendment banning that form of 
protest 
the supreme courts 54 decision that flag burning is a mode 
of expression protected by the first amendments guarantee of the 
freedom of speech seems to me plainly wrong and to rest upon 
propositions that either are not relevant or that cannot be 
supported bork told the house judiciary constitutional law 
subcommittee 
that ruling might have gone the other way had the senate in 1988 
not rejected president reagans nomination of bork to the supreme 
court 
bork says he would have sided with the minority opinion of the 
four justices who would have upheld the texas law banning flag 
burning justice anthony m kennedy whose nomination was approved 
after bork was rejected voted with the court majority in the case 
now that those decisions are history the subcommittee is taking 
testimony on whether a constitutional amendment banning flag burning 
is needed a regular statute would suffice or no remedy is required 
bork a former federal appeals court judge who is now with a 
washington think tank said the constitutional amendment approach 
backed by president bush was the only way to go 
the matter cannot be cured by statute he said it is idle 
to suppose that a constitutional ruling can be reversed by stattute 
and it would be dangerous to try 
also scheduled to testify today was charles fried who served as 
solicitor general under president reagan in that role he declined 
to submit a brief with the supreme court in the flag burning case 
on tuesday paul kamenar of the washington legal foundation told 
the subcommittee his group had urged fried to file a brief with the 
court on behalf of the united states but to no avail 
there are some who say that if the united states had weighed in 
on this case with the obvious federal interest involved we may have 
gotten the fifth vote we needed and thus would not be here today 
kamenar said 
kamenar whose group filed its own arguments in the case on 
behalf of veterans groups and others said he supports a 
constitutional amendment to turn the court ruling around 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas introduced the 
bushbacked amendment in the senate on tuesday saying there was 
no guarantee that a regular statute would satisfy the court 
but sen bob kerrey dneb a vietnam veteran and medal of honor 
winner said his colleagues were jumping too quickly to push 
flagprotection legislation in order to gain political capital 
kerrey said he at first was outraged by the court but he 
read the decision and found it appealing 
i was surprised to discover it was reasonable 
understandable and consistent with those values which i believe have 
made america so wonderful 
harvard university law professor laurence tribe told the house 
subcommittee that the goal of the constitutional amendment could be 
accomplished through a statute like one proposed by senate judiciary 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel 
biden would make it a federal crime punishable by a fine of up 
to 1000 and a years imprisonment or both for someone to 
knowingly deface the flag 
the statute would remove all references in the existing federal 
flag burning statute to ideas communicated in the process of 
flag desecration and would punish only the physical act itself 
the supreme court held in its 54 ruling in the texas case that 
desecrating the flag was protected under the constitutions first 
amendment guarantee of free speech as far as the act of destroying 
the flag was an attempt to communicate a political point of view

a man who crashed his truck through a 
gate at the lorimar television studio burned the vehicle and then 
killed himself may have had a business dispute with a production 
company there police said 
there may be a possible business dispute involving one of the 
onlot production companies we just dont know which one police 
capt thomas mahoney said after the rampage tuesday on the lot where 
the tv shows dallas and knots landing are made 
the former metrogoldwynmayer studio lot now owned by 
lorimartelepictures corp has studios that are rented out to other 
production companies 
police withheld the name of the dead man until relatives could be 
notified the man randomly fired six shotgun rounds but no one was 
there at the time and no else was wounded police lt jerry dalven 
said the man turned the gun on himself when officers arrived and 
ordered him to drop the weapon 
the man drove up to a west gate at the lot shortly after 5 pm 
tuesday police said he handed a security guard two canisters of 
methyl bromide gas and told the guard you have five minutes to 
live 
officer ed henneberque said the gas is toxic 
the guy just busted through the gates said bill mccullum a 
lorimar security guard all i know is i could have been the one 
lying on the ground 
the driver parked the vehicle against the wall of a studio 
building and apparently set it afire with a can of pressurized 
lubricant henneberque said 
dave stapf a spokesman for the studio said the man wasnt 
believed to have been a former employee 
at first we thought it was special effects said kelly 
hustis a truck driver at the lot then we saw the dust fly 
he didnt seem to want to hurt anybody he stood there for a 
long time telling a security guard to get back get back hustis

a lawyer representing 
families of people who died when a us warship shot down an iranian 
jetliner said today the united states compensation offer is 
woefully inadequate 
the state department announced monday it will pay up to 250000 
for each fulltime wage earner and up to 100000 for each of the 
others killed in the incident it said the money would be paid to 
selected intermediaries either government or private to make sure 
it reaches the families 
attorney nagib ya ghafoor said the money should be paid 
directly to the families of the 290 victims rather than going 
through intermediaries 
he also noted that iraq paid 750000 to each of the families of 
37 us sailors killed when an iraqi jet mistakenly attacked the uss 
stark in the persian gulf in may 1987 
on july 3 1988 the uss vincennes fired missiles at what it 
thought was an iranian jet fighter flying over the persian gulf in 
preparation for an attack all 290 people on board the iran air 
jetliner were killed when the plane crashed into the gulf 
the state department said the united states was not obligated 
under international law to pay any compensation and it blamed iran 
in part for the incident because it allowed a commerical jet to fly 
over an area where a battle had been going on 
but it recalled that former president reagan announced eight days 
after the iran air incident that the united states would pay 
compensation in keeping with american humanitarian traditions 
the proposed amounts were not announced until this week 
under the us plan which officials said was personally approved 
by president bush the families to receive the money would have to 
waive any further claims against the united states 
the stark settlement totaled about 27 million us officials 
estimated the iran air victims package could total 30 million 
ghafoor said the only difference between the two incidents was 
that the stark victims were military and the iranian jetliner 
carried civilians 
he said the us offer of up to certain amounts indicated the 
united states intended to negotiate to minimize the amount of 
payments 
iran has demanded compensation for the loss of the jet and is 
suing the united states in the world court 
relatives of some victims have filed a separate lawsuit against 
general electric co makers of the vincennes computerized radar 
system

treasury secretary nicholas brady said today he 
expects an agreement reasonably soon between private banks and 
mexico in the first test of his plan for reducing the 13 trillion 
debt of poor third world countries 
back from the paris economic summit brady told the joint 
economic committee of congress the endorsement of his plan by the 
heads of state of the seven industrial powers puts pressure on 
private banks to be more forthcoming in negotiating debtreduction 
agreements 
several members of congress have expressed skepticism about the 
workability of the plan and its reliance on governmentbacked 
guarantees to cover interest payments to the private banks on the 
remaining balances 
the administration had sought to put some of those fears to rest 
hoping to announce at the summit an agreement in which mexicos 15 
creditor banks agreed to a 30 percent to 40 percent reduction in the 
54 billion they are owed by its government no announcement was 
made 
i wish it were going faster but these negotiations are very 
complicated and take a long time brady said today i think 
were going to get resolution reasonably soon 
and when we do get it he said i think everybody will feel 
relieved that the first transaction has taken place and other ones 
will follow much more quickly because we know how to do it 
sen paul sarbanes dmd questioned whether private banks in 
other countries were resisting the debtreduction efforts in the 
belief that their governments were not as supportive of bradys plan 
as the united states was 
last april a month after the plan was revealed it received a 
qualified endorsement from the finance ministers of the six other 
industrial powers france italy west germany britain japan and 
canada 
brady said the significance of the summit was that the issue has 
now been kicked upstairs to the headofstate level 
rep john lafalce dny said tuesday the summit may have 
produced a recognition by both the private banks and the bush 
administration that bradys plan cannot work without more direct 
government intervention 
the banks have changed their tune said lafalce who wants to 
establish a new international agency to take the lead on deciding 
how to divide losses on third world loans which have soured 
they realize that the bank advisory committees cant facilitate 
it lafalce said referring to multinational groups of commercial 
bank creditors who have been negotiating debtreduction agreements 
with third world governments such as mexicos 
to pressure the private banks lafalce and other lawmakers have 
introduced legislation that would effectively cut their profits if 
they continue resisting substantial voluntary reductions in what 
third world countries owe 
at the conclusion of the summit bush quipped to reporters that 
he was willing to put replace bradys name with his own on the 
debtreduction plan but not until there is more evidence it will 
work 
while the bush administration anticipated a breakthrough during 
the summit in negotiations between 15 private banks headed by 
citicorp of new york on reducing mexicos 54 billion debt and its 
annual interest payments an accord never materialized 
bradys plan was based on the premise that private banks would 
forgive large portions of the debt owed them by developing countries 
for guarantees from governmentfinanced multinational lenders such 
as the world bank to protect them from further losses 
mexico originally sought a 55 percent forgiveness of their debt 
to the private banks after brady announce his plans in march 
the banks reportedly have offered a 35 percent reduction but 
only on the condition the multinational world bank and the 
international monetary fund guarantee the interest payments on the 
remaining balance 
however the agreement between bush and the leaders of the six 
other industrial powers provides only limited interest support 
by their taxpayers through the imf and world bank for transactions 
involving significant debt and debt service reduction

federal agents arrested the alleged kingpin of 
a fishsmuggling ring and detained the captains of two taiwanese 
fishing vessels in the north pacific as part of a sting operation 
involving the sale of 13 million worth of salmon 
brian gorman a spokesman for the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration said today that a us coast guard 
cutter was continuing to shadow at least two taiwanese driftnet 
vessels about 1000 miles north of midway island that were involved 
in the attempted illegal sale of 500 metric tons of salmon 
patrick lee of taipei taiwan was arrested late tuesday as he 
walked out of the vault of a seattle bank carrying suitcases filed 
with more than 1 million in cash gorman said two associates of 
lee also were arrested in seattle he said 
gorman said that as lee was arrested in seattle the fishing 
vessel red fin chartered by noaa was rendezvousing with several 
taiwanese vessels in the north pacific to complete the actual 
transfer of the fish 
when the two captains boarded the red fin to arrange details of 
the transfer they were detained but their two vessels fled when the 
coast guard cutter morgenthau appeared on the scene the spokesman 
said 
congressional sources who asked not to be identified said the 
state department had asked the government of taiwan for permission 
to board and inspect the two vessels 
gorman said that lee was being charged today in seattle with 
violations of the lacey act which prohibits commerce in illegally 
caught salmon or wildlife the maximum penalty would be a fiveyear 
prison sentence and 20000 fine 
in addition gorman said the us attorney in seattle may file 
additional charges and a grand jury was expected to convene there 
today 
we think he is the kingpin gorman said of lee adding that 
the sting operation had taken sixmonths to pull off 
weve arrested people in the past in salmonlaundering 
operations but we have never had an undercover operation of this 
size said gorman certainly this is the first time we have been 
involved in a highseas operation 
he said that in addition to alleged violations of us law 
taiwan prohibits the export of salmon 
sen frank murkowski ralaska said the sting operation began 
early this year when lee contacted a member of the us fishing 
industry with an offer to sell salmon the american company that lee 
approached than contacted agents of the national marine fisheries 
service 
over the next six months an agent poised as a buyer and 
communicated with lee over monitored telephone and fax machines 
to arrange the sale that climaxed in tuesdays arrests the senator 
said 
this should put the lid on one of the biggest salmonpirate 
operations and if the others have any brains theyll sit up and 
take notice too said murkowski

the authors of a book released today said they 
have compiled the most comprehensive guide to the soviet nuclear 
arsenal and that the red armys stockpile is dwindling because of 
mikhail gorbachevs policies 
we believe that the arsenal is declining that it peaked some 
time last year one of the authors thomas b cochran told a news 
conference theyre not ahead of us and were not ahead of them 
the fact is both can do a lot of damage to the other 
the book a slick oversized redcovered paperback entitled 
soviet nuclear weapons claims the soviet arsenal grew because 
of the perception of how to achieve national security the 
advancement of certain foreign policy goals the desire for 
recognition as a superpower domestic political struggles 
bureaucratic inertia and military service rivalry 
with soviet president gorbachevs doctrine of necessary 
defensive sufficiency however the arsenal is declining the 
authors say 
they are and will continue in the future to get rid of their 
relics just as we did robert s norris one of the authors said 
in an interview tuesday they are 40 percent larger than we are 
and at first glance thats alarming but look at why and theres 
less concern 
soviet nuclear forces are following the us pattern of the 
past 10 to 20 years certain military missions that once used 
nuclear weapons began to be phased out a statement about the book 
said the weapon was either not replaced or replaced with a 
conventional system 
but william m arkin one of the other authors warns one 
should not confuse technical obsolescence with real decisions to 
remove weapons 
arkin points out that a large percentage of the arsenals of both 
the united states and the soviet union are not included in any of 
the arms control negotiations 
and those are the nuclear weapons that are most likely to cause 
nuclear war he said adding that 14000 of the 33000 soviet 
warheads are not included in any of the arms talks he cites bombs 
on jet fighters artillery and naval weapons 
norris said the book relied heavily on us government 
statistics many of them obtained through the freedom of information 
act 
this book seeks to put together everything we know about the 
topic in one place he said pointing out the authors used 
extensive footnotes to document their research 
what is lacking norris readily acknowledged is the specifics 
from the soviet union 
we didnt get any information from the soviets he said 
the next step is to have the soviets tell us more about out its 
beginning to happen we hope this book will be a lever 
norris during a recent trip to the soviet union left a copy of 
soviet nuclear weapons for gorbachev 
we hope hell continue what hes started to do to bring out 
more information norris said 
the book is for experts and laymen alike norris said pointing 
to the numerous pictures and graphs in the 433page book it was 
published under the auspices of the natural resources defense 
council a private organization that bills itself as long 
concerned about the dangers and problems posed by the unleashed 
atom 
the other two authors are thomas b cochran and jeffrey sands

the country 
july 12 
burlington county times willingboro nj on bushs trip to 
poland 
in his twoday visit to poland president bush stepped into 
situations rife with diplomatic risk and opportunity 
he was right not to go too far offering relatively modest aid 
while pledging support andchallenging poles to begin transforming 
their country with patience courage ingenuity and sacrifice 
a key to his sixpoint package is a 100 million enterprise 
fund to support polish entrepreneurs 
that kind of ecomonic incentive plus all the symbolic support we 
can offer will help to reinforce the will of the polish people to 
break away from the hopelessness of communism and begin to forge 
their own destiny

statesmanjournal salem ore on the sampl crisis 
every day that passes without a bailout of the 150 billion 
savings and loan mess is another 10 million in losses for which we 
must pay 
congress has allowed more 10 million days to pass than it should 
have without acting on president bushs rescue plan it should agree 
quickly on a plan get the bailout going and close down ailing sampls 
before they lose more money 
bush did well in drafting his bailout but each house made 
changes some good some bad 
the congressional conference committee should accept the 
houses recommendation that the taxpayers portion of the bill be

the duluth minn newstribune on attempts to balance the budget 
just because president bush vowed back when he was candidate bush 
that the words new taxes would never cross his lips congress is 
looking for new ways to raise money that dont look like taxes 
so our nations leaders ponder hikes in the tax on tobacco and 
snuff while discarding the idea of raising cigarette taxes and 
lawmakers look at repealing a tax break on employee stock ownership 
plans but wont consider hiking the gasoline tax 
if the important task of moving toward a balanced budget requires 
new income members of congress and george no new taxes bush 
should consider all possible sources not just those that pass the 
duck test if it looks like a duck its a duck if it looks like a 
tax its a tax 
but we have an even better idea before congress and the executive 
branch leap upon the back of some poor revenue source that doesnt 
look like a taxcollecting duck why not try cutting spending first

anderson sc independentmail on the us supreme court 
the founding fathers never intended that the supreme court would 
be the branch of government that made everything right the court is 
intended only to be the last resort on interpretation of law 
the most important law the court must interpret is the 
constitution yet even in fulfilling that function it is not the 
duty of the court to nail new amendments onto the constitution 
simply because wise men and women think they are needed to achieve 
justice 
it is true that in interpreting the law justices have some 
latitude to construe the law broadly or narrowly but essentially 
the duties of the court are technical relying on the legal 
scholarship to come to an informed lawyerly judgment about what the 
law enacted by others means when applied in very specific cases 
the recent decisions of the supreme court suggest to us that the 
court is groping to return to the original function envisioned for 
that body by the founding fathers 
legislative bodies made up of elected officials not the court 
are supposed to make laws but if the laws are within the 
permissible bounds defined by the constitution narrowly 
interpreted the supreme court seems to be saying that it will not 
throw out even stupid laws 
after all democracy requires that voters who elect stupid 
legislators should live with the results

charleston wva daily mail on speaking fees for members of 
congress 
president bush has called for an outright ban on speaking fees 
for congressmen and senators beginning in 1991 a new study by 
common cause shows why this is a good idea 
in all 64 companies or lobbying groups spent 20000 or more for 
honoraria to congressmen and senators in 1987 
the tobacco institute led the league with 123400 followed by 
the national association of broadcasters at 113500 
most of the money goes to the leaders of the house and senate 
the folks who set the congressional agenda 
this money isnt passed out in the civicminded spirit of 
providing lawmakers with a forum for discussing the issues of the 
day lobbyists get plenty in return look at laws covering the 
tobacco television banking trucking and defense industries 
honoraria represent the legalized bribery of members of congress 
and should be banned congress belongs on the public payroll not 
the payrolls of special interests

the daily union junction city kan on the moon landing

the tax dollars spent on the us space program have been subject 
to debate from time to time as to its worthiness and place in the 
national budget 
we believe a space exploration budget deserves to be part of our 
nations expenditures 
the technological gains made through the development of the space 
program are too numerous to mention the advantages space affords 
man to see his fragile planet from another perspective is worth the 
price alone 
but perhaps the space program fulfills one of mans greatest 
needs that is to explore the unknown to learn about our

vicksburg miss evening post on response to oil spills 
if anything good can be said to come from the three recent oil 
spills it was governments quick and effective cleanup response 
what happened in rhode island and in delaware and texas was 
in dramatic contrast to the spill in valdez when exxon 
ploddingly presumed to clean up after itself 
the success and speed of response to the rhode island spill 
indicates that cleanup is better coordinated by government hands 
than the slow sticky hands of the oil industry 
if the government had delayed action as usual to determine the 
fault the resulting enviornmental damage to the sensitive marsh 
areas surrounding narragansett bay would have been more severe 
instead it was a case of cleanup first fault and fines later that 
should be the prototype for subsequent spills 
prompt cleanup however was not enought for delaware gov 
michael castle who was more interested in prevention than 
response castle has a point 
while government efforts to contain the dregs plus the oil 
industrys recent announcement of a multimilliondollar 
spillresponse program are both commendable making sure these 
messes dont happen in the first place is still the key

los angeles times on offshore oil drilling 
there will be considerable debate in the us senate soon over 
the level of oil imports but once the rhetoric is over senators 
can vote with a clear conscience for a oneyear moratorium on oil 
exploration and production in the outer continenal shelf including 
the entire california coast 
the houseapproved moratorium obviously comes in reaction to the 
exxon valdez accident in alaska in march and more recent tanker 
spills in the east 
critics claim the legislation is overkill since offshore oil 
production does not necessarily lead to tanker spills 
but oil in the water is oil in the water the years delay may 
finally force congress and the administration to honestly weigh the 
benefits of offshore oil production against the liabilities within 
the context of a real energy policy 
there will be more time to consider replacing dirty oil with 
cleanerburning natural gas officials can factor in the oil savings 
from the use of alternative fuels in autos as proposed in the 
presidents amendments to the clean air act

peninsula daily news port angeles wash on military 
procurement 
defense secretary dick cheney understands where the real military 
savings can be found that is in procurement defense buying will 
account for more than 60 billion of this years 305 billion 
defense budget 
the problem of course is how to get at those potential savings 
any number of defense officials before cheney have tried to 
streamline the procurement process and failed 
it is the gordian knot of the defense establishment and as 
cheney noted in calling for reform alexander the greats fabled 
singlestroke solution simply cutting the knot does not apply to 
this 20th century problem 
cheney says he has no quick fix for streamlining the 
pentagon but he does have a complex plan to overhaul the 
weaponsbuying bureaucracy and he hopes to achieve some 30 billion 
in total savings by the 1993 fiscal year 
whether or not that is a realistic expectation is anybodys guess 
it is important that congress cooperate because defense budgets 
are certain to decline in the years immediately ahead the only way 
to keep the nations defense capabilities from declining as well as 
to spend more carefully

chronicletribune marion ind on flag burning 
monroe county sheriff james young says a us supreme court 
decision isnt going to stop him from arresting people who burn the 
american flag 
young has told his deputies to continue arresting people who 
deface the flag he based his policy on two theories 
that flag burning fits the definition of disorderly conduct 
under indiana law 
that desecrating an american flag violates the first amendment 
freedom of expression of us citizens who revere the flag as a 
symbol of their country 
young believes hes on solid ground with the disorderly conduct 
law because few public acts provoke a more violent response than 
defacing an american flag 
young also defends his policy on constitutional grounds arguing 
that the flag is a collective expression of public patriotism 
that should be protected under the first amendment 
young may be stretching the point a bit too far but the us 
supreme court also has been known to do that occasionally

israels deputy finance minister 
and a senior plo official held secret indirect talks in this city 
last month with a former dutch official acting as intermediary 
dutch and plo officials said today 
abdullah hourani a member of the palestine liberation 
organizations executive committee held indirect and triangular 
talks on june 26 with yossi beilin the deputy finance minister 
according to the plos representative in the netherlands afif 
safieh 
on thursday beilin said on israeli army radio that clear and 
official albeit indirect peace talks were under way 
between the plo and the israeli government he did not give details 
or say whether he was involved 
the israel government considers the plo a terrorist group and 
bans its citizens from direct contacts with the organization 
max van der stoel who was dutch foreign minister from 197377 
and from 188182 acted as a gobetween for the talks in this 
diplomatic capital safieh told the associated press 
a dutch foreign ministry spokesman peter van vliet confirmed 
van der stoels role in the israeliplo contacts but would give no 
further details 
we were kept informed by van der stoel but this is no 
initiative of the foreign ministry van vliet said 
safieh also declined to discuss the substance of the talks 
van der stoel was not immediately available for comment 
amsterdams de volkskrant newspaper quoted van der stoel as 
saying i have tried to find out clearly what the bottlenecks are 
the differences of opinion and where there are possibilities for a 
beginning of understanding 
according to the newspaper beilin and hourani had planned to 
issue a joint statement after the daylong talks but their plan fell 
through because of mounting tensions in the israeli government 
coalition 
beilin is a member of israels leftofcenter labor party and a 
close political ally of finance minister shimon peres the finance 
minister has proposed a mideast peace conference which would involve 
israel its arab neighbors and palestinian representatives 
earlier this month labor threatened to leave israels coalition 
government after premier yitzhak shamir of the rightwing likud bloc 
bowed to conservative preconditions on his proposal to hold 
elections in the israelioccupied territories one stipulation was 
that the 19month palestinian uprising must end before voting occurs 
we hope that this news will not be exploited in the 
intraisraeli domestic debate said safieh who also claimed that 
likud through a variety of channels has also been communicating 
with the plo leadership he refused to give details 
safieh described van der stoels role in the talks as trying to 
bridge existing gaps between the two parties and he said the 
three officials had held more than one meeting during the day 
according to safieh hourani was in the netherlands for a 
conference of the world peace council a private peace group beilin 
was reportedly holding unrelated talks at the finance ministry

an explosion ripped through a small 
apartment building today injuring eight people who apparently 
didnt hear or ignored officials warnings to leave because of a 
natural gas leak authorities said 
the blast at the public housing project occurred more than 90 
minutes after a car ran into a gas meter and workers were unable to 
shut off the gas quickly authorities said 
some of the injured people were trapped in rubble for up to four 
hours as workers tried to free them while not disturbing the 
wreckage authorities said 
it was a bad situation its almost like pickup sticks you 
never know which one is going to cause the rest to collapse said 
fire chief don werner 
workers searched through debris of the twostory brick building 
in the sawyer manor complex to check for any other possible victims 
but said they didnt expect to find anyone else 
hospitals reported receiving eight injured people including four 
in critical condition 
assistant fire chief neil mills said he had no idea why anyone 
was in the building at the time of the explosion the building had 
three apartments plus a community center and offices 
they had told them to get out of the bulding but people were 
going in and out he said you know how people are they take a 
chance to save a little bit of something 
when the blast occurred at 345 am attempts still were being 
made to find the proper wrench necessary to turn off a highvolume 
gas line 
normally it would be shut off at the meter werner said 
well the cars sitting on top of the meter 
police sgt mike dailey said authorities were first called to the 
scene on a report of a disturbance which may have involved drivers 
trying to ram another car somehow one car hit the gas meter behind 
the apartment 
he said he did not know whether there had been any arrests 
the force of the blast showered the area with glass and broke 
windows in surrounding buildings in the project

a navy investigation into the explosion that 
killed 47 sailors on the battleship uss iowa in april has found 
strong evidence that a suicidal sailor set it off according to two 
reports 
the 10week probe with fbi assistance ruled out unstable 
gunpowder or flaws in the mechanical or electrical systems in the 
gun turrets where the explosion occurred said nbc news and todays 
editions of the new york times 
the network cited unidentified navy sources tuesday the 
newspaper quoted officials in the pentagon and congress who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
in washington defense secretary dick cheney today refused to 
comment on the reports saying he hasnt seen the final report of 
the navy investigation into the blast 
the unreleased navy report said gunners mate clayton hartwig 
25 may have been responsible for the blast according to nbc and 
the times 
navy spokesman lt greg smith told the associated press that the 
conclusion of suicide was not based on official reports of the 
navy it is the opinion of nbc and mr fred francis the network 
reporter 
other pentagon officials told the newspaper the navy had been 
reluctant to issue a report fearing it would further demoralize the 
ships crew and bring on legal action bad publicity or charges of 
incompetence or coverup 
smith said the investigation report had been submitted to the 
commander of surface forces for the atlantic fleet in norfolk va 
and eventually would land on the secretary of defenses desk 
the investigators based their findings on a psychological profile 
of hartwig by the fbi and 228 other exhibits including a threehour 
videotaped statement from another iowa sailor david smith nbc said 
david smith rejected hartwigs sexual advances the night before 
the explosion he was quoted as saying in an interview with an 
investigator 
he also said hartwig had discussed how to set off a bomb using a 
ninevolt battery and a small timer nbc reported 
the two men talked about explosions that kind of stuff how to 
set off the powder all that kind of stuff david smith was quoted 
as saying 
hartwig took him to his locker and showed him a timer nbc 
reported 
part of me can see him doing it david smith was quoted as 
telling investigators 
in addition a psychiatric study done by the fbi center for 
analysis of violent crimes found that hartwig was disturbed and 
under a lot of stress virtually insuring some type of reaction 
in this instance it is suicide according to the report 
naval investigators also pointed to the rejection of hartwig by 
gunners mate kendall truitt who survived the explosion hartwig 
had named truitt as the sole beneficiary of a 50000 
doubleindemnity life insurance policy 
asked about nbcs report tuesday night hartwigs father earl v 
hartwig of cleveland said there was no way definitely that his 
son was suicidal 
hartwigs sister kathy kubicina of cleveland said her brother 
was not a homosexual and that 17 of his letters had been reviewed by 
a team of psychiatrists who decided he was a normal healthy young 
man 
in nbcs report david smith was quoted as telling the 
investigator he didnt immediately report what he knew because he 
was scared others would think he too was homosexual 
i could see my name labeled on every newspaper across the 
usa that two gays had a fight and i could see my life going down 
the toilet right away he said 
previous news reports indicated that at one point investigators 
focused on truitt as well as hartwig truitts attorney ellis rubin 
of miami said last month that naval investigative service agents 
had apologized to his client for news leaks suggesting truitt was 
involved in the explosion 
the navy is up to its old tricks of releasing selected parts of 
an investigation to a favored media source and hence to the entire 
world rubin said tuesday night the first victim was ken 
truitt now the victim is clayton hartwig his memory and his 
family 
the iowa is on a sixmonth deployment to the north atlantic and 
the mediterranean

president bush today gave congressional leaders 
a review of his trip to europe and house speaker thomas foley 
predicted bush will win approval for his promised 125 million in 
new aid to promote free enterprise in poland and hungary 
the president also voiced opposition to a proposal in the senate 
that would restrict official us contacts with representatives of 
the palestine liberation organization 
foley speaking to reporters outside the white house following 
the 75minute meeting predicted that bushs aid package for reforms 
in the eastern europe nations generally will receive strong 
support 
he said bush and the lawmakers did not discuss the space 
initiative the president may announce thursday the 20th anniversary 
of the first moonwalk but the speaker said the sentiments bush has 
expressed previously that any space initiative has to be fiscally 
responsible 
foley said the consensus of all those present was that bush 
had a very successful trip in both eastern europe and at the 
economic summit in paris he deserved congratulations which he 
received 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee said he was very delighted to see the presidents 
enthusiasm as to whats happening in eastern europe and his desire 
to take whatever initiatives we can to help change the communist 
economic and political systems there 
that was most encouraging theres a lot more enthusiasm than 
we saw on that three or four months ago from the bush 
administration said bentsen who added that he certainly will 
support the aid for poland and hungary 
both houses of congress are now considering the administrations 
overall 144 billion foreign aid package a house appropriations 
subcommittee late monday earmarked 15 million for bushs initiative 
in hungary 
sen bob packwood rore the ranking minority member of the 
finance committee said it was hard to get any foreign aid through 
congress 
but he called the aid proposals for the two warsaw bloc countries 
a very modest package i think its well worth giving them the 
encouragement youre wise to start out modestly until you see 
if the reforms really come to fruition 
on another topic packwood said the plo amendment the senate is 
considering would in bushs view simply shut down the 
negotiations he was quite strong on that issue 
the amendment cosponsored by sens jesse helms rnc and 
john f kerry dmass would bar negotiations with any plo 
representative unless the president first certified to congress that 
the representative had not played any role in terrorist activity 
that resulting in the death injury or kidnapping of american 
citizens 
bush returned home tuesday to a military honor guard and the 
cheers of his cabinet and a large crowd gathered on the south lawn 
of the white house 
bush was clearly tired from the grueling 9000mile journey 
across four nations but ebullient 
everywhere in warsaw gdansk and budapest among the leaders 
of the summit nations in the netherlands i found an enormous 
amount of excitement he said everywhere people seem to sense 
that we live at a moment when positive change is possible

a korean air lines supervisor agreed in 1983 
that a navigation mistake by the crew of illfated flight 007 led to 
the shootdown of the plane by the soviet union an analyst who 
studied the tragedy testified today 
frank houston of seattle told a us district court jury that 
kals chief trainer of pilots yoon bae kim agreed by shaking his 
head in the affirmative about the idea that the plane had been 
offcourse almost from the minute it took off from anchorage alaska 
houston and kim were among a group of aviation experts who looked 
into the shootdown over soviet territory which killed all 269 
people aboard the plane 
houston said he and other members of a team ran tests in a 
simulator at boeing facilities in seattle based on the available 
flight data about the jumbo jet that was destroyed by a soviet 
fighter plane on sept 1 1983 
the team of analysts concluded that the kal crew probably had 
punched into the planes computerized navigation system the wrong 
number for the longtitude before taking off from anchorage alaska 
for seoul south korea 
its like a touchtone telephone what they did in my opinion 
is misdial houston said in describing the device the crew used to 
program the navigation system aboard the plane 
the plane was estimated to be 300 miles off course when it was 
shot down by russian military aircraft the simulator tests with the 
longtitude number off by 10 degrees placed the craft in the location 
it is believed to have gone down inside russian waters 
houstons characterization of kims views is important to the 
civil suit in which families of 138 of the dead passengers allege 
willful misconduct by the airline 
on tuesday an attorney defending kal said flight 007 was on 
course until only a short time before it was blown out of the sky 
george tompkins disputed the international investigation of the 
incident in which houston participated that probe found the plane 
was significantly off course for hours before it was destroyed by 
the soviet union 
tompkins refused to concede the kal jumbo jet was off track so 
early the best evidence is that the crew was flying its correct 
route until shortly before it was destroyed he said 
tompkins said the crew sent radioed position reports periodically 
to anchorage and tokyo pinpointing the planes location as being on 
course for the first four hours of its flight 
us air traffic controllers who tracked the earliest parts of 
flight 007 before it went out of radar range reported nothing 
abnormal tompkins said

a day full of thunderstorms with plenty of 
hail and lightning means a good day at the office for bruce boe 
he and a team of 200 researchers from across the country are part 
of the north dakota thunderstorm project a 23 million effort that 
involves scientists and students from 12 universities 10federal and 
state agencies and five private companies 
their aim is to find ways to reduce hail and enhance rainfall 
and also to learn more about the atmosphere around the storms 
actually weve made tremendous progress said boe director 
of the north dakota atmospheric resource board and one of the 
project organizers theres something you can learn from every 
cloud 
the bigger the better added george bershinsky a weather 
researcher from the university of wyoming he pilots an airplane 
used for tracing and studying storms cloud physics and air motion 
the thunderstorm project which began june 12 and will end july 
22 uses six airplanes along with a complex system of ground radar 
to study hail as well as the structure of storms the processes 
that produce lightning and the role clouds play in the transport of 
gases like ozone and carbon monoxide through the atmosphere 
but in severe weather the planes fly mainly during the day for 
safety boe said we havent had as many really big thunderstorms 
as we would have liked at the hours we would have liked he said 
five graduate and 10 undergraduate students whose training 
ranges from meteorology and physics to engineering and computer 
science are using the project as a summer job their work is being 
financed by a special national science foundation program for 
students 
seven of the students representing universities from new york to 
wyoming are nicknamed hail chasers because they are dispatched 
during storms to catch and measure hail 
last week when golfball size hail and a tornado were reported 
about 100 miles north of bismarck the hail chasers were sent out to 
collect samples but they got a ribbing from their coworkers after 
they missed the severe weather and wound up in an area of only light 
rain 
were still trying to get our great hail said brenda pobanz 
who just graduated from the university of north dakota with a degree 
in meteorology 
researchers from a number of countries with weathermanagement 
programs including greece jordan morocco and south africa have 
visited or are planning to visit the project to learn from the north 
dakota experience boe said 
of the 60 or 70 weather experiments conducted about four dozen 
have been successful boe said 
the research team terms an experiment a success if the weather 
elements are there and the equipment works properly and measures 
what we want it to measure he said 
the project is being financed primarily by the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration and the national science foundation 
boe said bismarck was selected as the site because his agency has 
been conducting weather research with noaa for nearly a decade and 
has the facilities and expertise 
it may take several years to analyze all of the data accumulated 
during the project said boe who hopes for a followup project 
this project wont answer all the questions about 
thunderstorms he said

prime minister rajiv gandhis son started 
college this week and was accused of cheating even before he 
attended a class took an exam or cracked a textbook 
a rightwing opposition party gearing up for parliamentary 
elections expected by years end is alleging the prime minister used 
his clout to help his 17yearold son rahul get into the elite st 
stephens college 
admission is highly competitive and only about 1350 students 
attend the threeyear college located on the treeshaded campus of 
delhi university 
college officials say rahul whose entrance exams suggest he 
shoots a pistol better than he solves a math problem gained 
admission through a limited quota set aside for athletes 
the sports quota is just a ruse to accommodate the privileged 
sections of the society said madan lal khurana of the bharatiya 
janata party or the indian peoples party 
the college khurana added doesnt even have a shooting team 
but prem sagar dwivedi a history professor and member of the 
college panel that selected the 390member freshman class dismissed 
the suggestions and said the college has a shooting club that meets 
regularly 
rahuls bona fides as a sportsman cannot be doubted i havent 
heard anyone inside or outside the college questioning rahuls 
credentials dwivedi said 
rahul won three gold medals in a pistol shooting competiton 
conducted by the delhi state rifle association in november 1988 a 
month later he finished fourth in a national firing tournament held 
by the national rifle association of india the highestranking body 
for the sport 
for rahul going to college allows him to emerge from a highly 
sheltered well guarded cocoon he plans to study history and will 
attend day classes and then return to his familys official 
residence 
rahul attended a private boys school run by roman catholic 
priests until 1982 when threats were made by sikh extremists 
against the gandhi family his grandmother prime minister indira 
gandhi was assassinated on oct 31 1984 and his father was 
elected to succeed her 
rahul and his 18yearold sister priyanka were tutored at home 
priyanka is studying psychology at a womens college in new delhi 
to counter opposition charges the governing congress party 
sponsored a welcome ceremony for rahul on monday the first day of 
classes 
party members hung banners saying welcome rahul gandhi the 
voice of students 
reporters were ordered to leave the campus when rahul arrived in 
a bulletproof car accompanied by five bodyguards 
he was greeted by several seniors who took him to the cafeteria 
and cornered and bullied him for at least two hours in a tradition 
for new students known as ragging and similar to hazing 
rahul was badly ragged by some unsavory elements but i must 
say he took it very sportingly said sanjoy bhattacharya a senior 
history student 
since the controversy over rahuls admission started fellow 
students have spoken out on his behalf 
i dont like the way the opposition is carrying on the 
antirahul campaign the poor chap hasnt had a normal education and 
if he wants to attend a proper college now whats wrong 
bhattacharya said give the poor guy a chance 
the indian press frequently critical of his father has sprung 
to rahuls defense 
one can only wish him well and hope he is able to lead as 
normal a college life as possible making friends with a wide 
crosssection of people along the way said the sunday observer a 
respected englishlanguage weekly 
dwivedi said why all this fuss prime ministers sons go to 
college all over the world

hurricane dalilia surprised forecasters and 
turned north putting it on course to pass close to hawaii late 
today and prompting authorities to warn residents anew to stock up 
on emergency items 
on tuesday the storm appeared to be turning away from the 
islands but it shifted to a northwesterly direction and forecasters 
said dalilia could come closer than they initially expected 
forecasters said dalilias new track would bring its center to 
within 70 miles of hawaii islands south coast late today 
the central pacific hurricane center expected to upgrade a 
tropical storm watch meaning wind up to 73 mph and heavy rain were 
possible to a hurricane warning for hawaii island southernmost in 
the hawaiian chain 
at 2 am today the hurricane was about 310 miles southeast of 
hilo on hawaii island moving westnorthwest at about 13 mph the 
national weather service said its maximum sustained wind speed was 
75 mph a storm is classified a hurricane when that speed reaches 74 
mph wind gusted to 90 mph 
national weather service forecaster dick sasaki said dalilias 
hurricaneforce winds extend to 25 miles from its center 
the storms center would have to pass very close or right over 
any of the islands to bring any hurricaneforce winds sasaki said 
right now our main concern is high surf said neil gyotoku a 
spokesman for hawaii county civil defense high tide is this 
afternoon and theyre expecting bigger surf to hit about then 
there were no immediate plans for evacuation gyotoku said 
hawaii residents were urged to stock up on batteries canned 
goods and other emergency supplies 
hawaii island beach parks were closed tuesday when surf surged to 
more than 15 feet on the southeast coast of hawaii island 
were going to be keeping these beaches closed as a 
precautionary measure said bruce butts a spokesman for hawaii 
county civil defense 
although there were reports of waves washing up on coastal roads 
in some spots hilo police said there were no reports of injury or 
damage as of late tuesday 
the last major storm to hit hawaii was hurricane iwa which 
brushed the island of oahu and roared over of kauai with wind up to 
117 mph in november 1982 causing 234 million damage

healthy men over age 50 appear to cut their risk of 
heart attacks in half if they take an aspirin every other day 
although there is no clear evidence that younger men are helped a 
study concludes 
a preliminary version of the research was widely publicized a 
year and a half ago when it found a dramatic reduction in heart 
attacks among regular aspirin users 
now a more detailed analysis of the voluminous data gathered 
over about five years in that research suggests that the benefits of 
aspirin are most noticeable in older men who are also at highest 
risk of heart trouble 
the research called the physicians health study was directed 
by dr charles h hennekens of brigham and womens hospital in 
boston and published in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
overall the study found that men who took a single aspirin every 
other day had a 44 percent reduction in their risk of heart attacks 
however the benefits were limited to those over age 50 who cut 
their risk about in half 
we have a clearcut conclusive benefit on reducing a first 
heart attack said hennekens 
he said people should not start taking regular aspirin unless 
they consult first with a doctor or other health professional in 
helping make a decision doctors should consider a patients other 
risk factors such as blood pressure cholesterol level and family 
history of heart disease 
in an accompanying editorial dr valentin fuster and others from 
mount sinai medical center in new york wrote that aspirin appears 
to be beneficial in the prevention of a first myocardial infarction 
heart attack at least in men over the age of 50 and it has its 
largest effect in those with uncontrolled risk factors 
aspirin works by making the blood less likely to clot heart 
attacks usually occur when clots form in the coronary arteries 
choking off the hearts blood supply 
the study was conducted on 22071 men doctors they were given 
packs of pills and randomly assigned to take aspirin beta carotene 
or dummy placebos although the aspirin part of the study is over 
the project is continuing to see if regular use of beta carotene 
reduces the cancer rate 
since the publication of our preliminary report 74 percent of 
the participating physicians who were assigned to placebo have 
requested that their calendar packs be changed to aspirin the 
researchers wrote 
among other findings 
aspirin users were slightly more likely to have strokes but the 
number was too small to be statistically meaningful 
there was no overall decrease in cardiovascular deaths among 
those taking asprin but the study would have had to continue to the 
year 2000 or beyond to show any impact on mortality 
the benefits of aspirin appeared to be greatest among those with 
low cholesterol levels

william lucas nominated to be the governments 
chief civil rights enforcer was questioned sharply today about why 
he and his family were fined in 1985 for failing to declare 8900 
worth of purchases to us customs inspectors 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio cited a us customs service 
report that the lucas family failed to disclose the purchases when 
they passed through customs at the seattle airport following a trip 
to japan and south korea 
how do you explain concealing receipts and merchandise from the 
customs inspectors metzenbaum asked 
lucas said the customs violation involved several pieces of 
jewelry carried in a cosmetics case by a member of his family whom 
he did not identify he was not aware of all the purchases his wife 
and daughters made during their trip lucas said 
the questioning took place as the senate judiciary committee 
began hearings on lucas nomination to be assistant attorney general 
for civil rights he said he had discussed the customs fine with 
committee investigators 
metzenbaum asked why lucas failed to disclose on a committee 
questionnaire that he had once been investigated for violating 
customs regulations for which he was fined the senator did not 
disclose the amount lucas was fined for trying to conceal undeclared 
merchandise 
there was no investigation lucas said 
you didnt think when they went through your pockets and the 
pockets of your family that that wasnt an investigation the ohio 
democrat asked 
i wasnt searched nor did i consider that an investigation 
lucas responded 
lucas said his family declared they had purchased 4800 worth of 
merchandise on the trip 
earlier sens edward m kennedy dmass and joseph biden 
ddel chairman of the senate judiciary committee questioned 
whether lucas met professional qualifications to be assistant 
attorney general for civil rights 
biden who said he was favorably disposed toward you told 
lucas one of the things youre going to have to speak to is your 
lack of technical legal experience 
i think its important to determine why and how deeply 
committed you are to enforcing the civil rights laws of this land 
biden said 
it remains to be seen whether mr lucas is the right man for 
this important job kennedy said during an opening statement a 
number of serious questions need to be raised 
the justice department acknowledged on the eve of todays hearing 
that lucas a black republican from michigan failed to state on a 
1981 new york state bar application that he had once failed a bar 
exam in the district of columbia 
lucas merely answered that he had been admitted to the michigan 
bar in 1971 when asked if he had ever taken a bar examination or 
applied to practice law in another state justice department 
spokeswoman deborah burstionwade confirmed tuesday evening 
metzenbaum said that unlike the other assistant attorneys general 
selected to run the justice departments other divisions lucas 
lacks extensive legal experience in the area he would supervise 
why is the civil rights division subjected to a different 
standard what kind of signal does that send to the american 
people metzenbaum asked 
rep charles grassley riowa accused lucas opponents of 
raising shopworn arguments used by the bigots of old to keep black 
americans down 
lucas career despite an orphaned upbringing in harlem is a 
monument to what you could do and what you can accomplish in america 
regardless of race or color or accident of birth grassley said 
lucas who swore to the accuracy and truthfulness of his answers 
when signing a statement submitted to gain admission to the new york 
state bar in 1981 also stated he had never been a witness in a 
court proceeding when in fact he had testified several times ms 
burstionwade confirmed 
he also inaccurately stated he had never been a party to civil 
suits when he had been sued in his capacity as sheriff in wayne 
county mich she confirmed 
ms burstionwade said the inaccuracies were not known to 
attorney general dick thornburgh and his top aides until they 
received a copy of the new york form this week it had been 
requested by the senate judiciary committee 
while acknowledging the inaccuracies ms burstionwade added 
that i dont see they negate four decades of public service 
there is no concern about his honesty or his ethics ms 
burstionwade said the mans background is just too admirable 
a number of civil rights organizations including the national 
association for the advancement of colored people oppose lucas 
nomination saying he lacks the legal qualifications for the job 
in addition to his incorrect answers on the bar application 
lucas has inaccurately described himself on resumes and in sworn 
testimony as once having been a justice department lawyer 
employed as a legal assistant in 1963 lucas left the justice 
department after failing the district of columbia bar he joined the 
fbi and later became sheriff and eventually chief executive of wayne 
county mich which includes detroit 
elected to public office as a democrat lucas became a republican 
in 1985 a year before he ran unsuccessfully for michigan governor

citizens angry at the army for killing 
prodemocracy protesters in beijing are retaliating with attacks on 
soldiers chinese and western sources said wednesday 
in hong kong a chinese language newspaper reported wednesday 
that about 20 more people were executed for joining in the 
protestschinese officials denied the report 
incidents of shooting at soldiers in retaliation for the military 
crackdown are going on theyre going on a lot and theyre all 
over the country a western diplomat in beijing said on condition 
of anonymity 
he said there was no clear sign of a nationwide organization 
behind the attacks but he did not give other details 
a chinese source reported several cases of beijing residents 
firing on patrolling soldiers since the army shot its way into the 
city center june 34 china has said about 200 people died in the 
june attack but chinese witnesses and western intelligence sources 
said the death toll may have been as high as 3000 
people who lost family members can be anguished enough to do 
something rash like shoot a soldier the source said on condition 
of anonymity too many weapons and ammunition were taken from 
army trucks during the turmoil it was not clear if any soldiers 
have died in the attacks 
official media reported that some protesters are continuing 
counterrevolutionary activities underground and government 
spokesman yuan mu has acknowledged that guns taken by crowds from 
army trucks could cause further unrest 
however there has been only one reported attack on soldiers in 
which a truck barrelled past a checkpoint in beijing on june 17 and 
fired at the soldiers wounding one two men in the truck later were 
arrested 
the government said it suspected sabotage when dynamite blew up 
on a shanghai train june 26 killing 24 people but the attack did 
not appear to be connected to troops 
in hong kong the chinese language newspaper ming pao said the 
executions of about 20 people took place about 10 days ago it said 
most of the group were members of an outlawed independent workers 
union set up during the protests 
the beijing peoples high court and police refused to comment on 
the report several dozen executions are known to have taken place 
since the protests were crushed but the authorities have linked 
only 12 to the protests many chinese believe the number is far 
higher 
many chinese also believe large numbers of arrests are continuing 
in secret even though the number reported have trickled to a few a 
week more than 2060 arrests have been reported in the official 
media since june 4 
the western diplomat estimated arrests nationwide at no more than 
5000 chinese sources have put the number in beijing at more than 
2000 
in other developments the japanese embassy said chinese police 
have promised a thorough investigation of an anonymous threat to 
kill two japanese in china each month 
the threat was made in a letter mailed to japan airlines beijing 
office and signed by a previously unknown group the bloodbright 
dare to die squad the group accused japan of colluding with the 
communist party dictatorial government and plotting to launch a 
largescale economic invasion of china 
embassy spokesman minoru kubota said his governments warning to 
japanese citizens to be careful in visiting china issued after the 
army attacked the student protesters still stands he said no 
further action would be taken until police complete their 
investigation

supporting the rebels as nicaragua celebrated the 10th anniversary 
of the sandinistas rise to power 
the united states still hasnt decided to be respectful of the 
rights of the nations of the third world ortega told a managua 
rally of 200000 cheering supporters many waving redandblack 
flags of the ruling sandinista national liberation front 
if the president of the united states is for peace he should 
stop immediately his policy of war against the people of nicaragua 
and dismantle the contras ortega said 
army and private trucks public buses and family cars carried 
nicaraguans to the plaza of the revolution along lake managua 
throughout the morning 
go go go shouted a squad of about 50 young people running 
down a flagbedecked avenue to the plaza most held small flags of 
the sandinista national liberation front and wore tshirts with the 
anniversary logo weve got 10 down and we keep going forth 
some people had said they would boycott the rally because they 
had little to celebrate in a country that ranks among the worlds 
poorest 
in his 50minute speech ortega said the government is 
controlling inflation and he repeated earlier pledges there will be 
clean national elections as scheduled feb 25 
the us congress cut off all but nonlethal aid to the contra 
rebels in 1988 shortly before rebel leaders signed a temporary 
truce with the sandinistas 
before entirely dismantling the contras the united states has 
been insisting the sandinistas reform election laws to accomodate 
objections from opposition groups and ensure press freedom fair 
campaigning and balloting 
banks businesses and government offices were closed to 
commemorate july 19 1979 when the victorious sandinista rebels 
marched into managua to take power two days after dictator anastasio 
somoza fled 
managua mayor carlos carrion opened the ceremony with a speech in 
which he said nicaragua has withstood 10 years of imperialist 
aggression and survived 
never again foreign domination carrion said for 10 years 
nicaraguas sovereignty has been in the hands of the people 
nicaraguas sovereignty is not up for discussion its to be 
defended with weapons 
barricada the official newspaper of the sandinista front 
carried no news on its front page only two pictures of joyous 
nicaraguans and in big red letters splashed accross the page 10 
years of changes and victory and more to come 
exciting agitated tormenting hard and sweet moving in their 
pain and joy these 10 years of revolution to which we have come 
today against all predictions and designs have a positive balance 
for the interests of the nicaraguan people it said in an 
editorial 
but some managua residents said most of those at the rally would 
be sandinista militants or public employees afraid of losing 
government jobs if they failed to attend 
five years ago people were still very enthusiastic about the 
revolution a technician who did not want his name used said 
tuesday people would paint and fix their houses and neighbors 
would tell each other lets go to the plaza 
but managua has been deteriorating people are now feeling the 
weight of the revolution 
an economic report underwritten by sweden nicaraguas main 
noncommunist supporter said last years per capita output was 
300 making nicaragua poorer even than haiti long the poorest 
country in the hemisphere 
before with what i earned i could support my children buy 
food said a cleaning woman who identified herself only as 
socorro but now were eating once a day there just isnt enough 
to go around and i have two jobs and my husband also works 
the sandinista government has blamed ussupported contra rebels

a newspaper has lifted the lid off the dirty side 
of the war in afghanistan with two soviet veterans accounts of red 
army soldiers beating innocent prisoners trading submachine guns 
for turncoats and barely surviving attacks by their own helicopters 
the daring weekly moscow news carried the war stories by valery 
abramov and ruslan umiyev under the headline the whole truth has 
to be told about this war 
over the past year the soviet press has questioned the 
leaderships decision to invade afghanistan in 1979 but stayed away 
from criticizing how the war itself was run 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov came under public and 
official attack at the congress of peoples deputies last month for 
claiming that soviet pilots were ordered to kill soviet soldiers who 
were likely to be captured by afghan guerrillas 
abramov told moscow news that sakharovs claim that soviet 
soldiers killed each other could have been based on a confused 
firefight he witnessed in june 1980 in faizabad 
the guerrillas fire was driving us into the ground suddenly 
our helicopters appeared and started to strafe our own battalions 
abramov wrote 
it was some kind of hell he said the shooting stopped he 
said after officers apparently understood their mistake 
umiyev who served in afghanistan from 1985 to 1987 said he 
too had seen soviet fliers mistakenly attack their own troops 
adding it was quite a mess there why should we be silent about 
it 
recounting incidents that are shameful to recall abramov 
described how two afghan prisoners suspected of being guerrillas 
were brought into his camp 
we already had people killed and missing lost friends and 
we unleashed all our accumulated pain on those two we beat them all 
night with short breaks i too tried to beat them as painfully as 
i could it seemed as if they were to blame for the deaths of our 
soldiers and in the morning it turned out they were peaceful 
inhabitants who had never participated in any battles 
umiyev told moscow news the official silence should also be 
broken about all the soviet soldiers in afghanistan who went over to 
the other side 
soviet units often would exchange three guerrillas or 10 
submachine guns for the chance to get their hands on such turncoats 
he said 
his unit traded for one such soldier who reportedly had served 
six years as a grenade launcher with the guerrillas umiyev said 
we tried him right on the square he said anyone could ask 
him questions he was silent and cried they gave him eight years 
we were all mad that they gave him so little 
the nations legislature the supreme soviet is evaluating the 
decision to invade afghanistan and is scheduled to report its 
findings in october 
the soviet army completed its pullout from afghanistan in 
february an estimated 15000 soviet soldiers and 1 million afghans 
died during the war

a peace corps volunteer claims rep gus savage 
dill sexually assaulted her during a dinner outing in the capital 
of zaire and material relating to the incident has been forwarded 
to the house ethics committee state department officials said today 
they confirmed a washington post story that quoted the volunteer 
as saying savage repeatedly fondled her for more than two hours in 
the back of a chauffeurdriven embassy car 
the woman said savage continued his advances even though she 
tried everything short of hitting him or hurting him 
physically to make him stop the newspaper reported in todays 
editions 
one state department official who insisted on anonymity said 
the us ambassador to zaire william harrop had a confrontation 
with savage over the incident an unidentified witness told the post 
that harrop spoke very strongly to savage chewed him out as 
much as an ambassador chews out a congressman 
jill gross of the state department inspector generals office 
said today that allegations of the incident had been sent to the 
house ethics committee on tuesday night 
they were sufficiently serious that someone should look into 
them she said 
efforts to reach savage today were unsuccessful he did not 
return repeated phone messages left at his office 
a peace corps official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the woman has not brought a formal complaint against savage and the 
agency would not pursue the case without her consent 
the ball is in her court the official said its something 
we told her right from the beginning 
neither the state department officials nor the post disclosed the 
identity of the volunteer 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said the house ethics 
committee has authority to review the allegations against savage 
that committee is capable of reviewing matters within its 
purview foley told reporters adding that he was making no 
judgment on the facts in the case 
every member of congress has a high responsibility for personal 
conduct as an elected member of the house of representatives if it 
is true in this country it is even more true when traveling abroad 
as a representative of the united states he said 
the post said savage declined to comment on the account 
an aide to savage donnavan dunkley declined to discuss the 
incident with the associated press when reached at home tuesday 
night 
peace corps spokesman lee raudonis told the associated press the 
volunteer had given the agency the account described in the 
newspaper but the agency had not been able to confirm the 
volunteers account independently 
the fact that shes being given a new assignment indicates that 
we think she is capable of the assignment and that we have 
confidence in her he said 
the woman told the post she did not file a formal complaint 
because she did not want to publicize the incident and risk damaging 
the peace corps the paper said she agreed to the interview 
reluctantly 
according to the account in the post the incident happened march 
19 when savage made an official visit to the african capital of 
kinshasa and asked for a briefing on peace corps activities which 
the volunteer was scheduled to give in a few days 
other members of the dinner party included members of savages 
staff and the american embassy staff including embassy information 
officer daniel mcgaffie savage wanted to sample the citys 
nightlife and insisted the woman ride with him she told the paper 
as soon as the three cars of the party left the ambassadors 
home he grabbed me the volunteer said in her interview 
he tried to force me to have sex with him he kept touching 
me after i told him to stop many times loudly she was quoted 
as saying 
after a twohour outing that included stops at three or four 
bars the volunteer fled a hotel disco with savage in pursuit the 
account continued 
mcgaffie was reported to have interrupted a tense public 
encounter between the savage and the volunteer and took the woman 
home according to the newspaper account 
an official familiar with the meeting said savage did not feel 
as if it had been as extreme as she suggested 
the volunteer was sent to washington for six weeks of treatment 
of the sort given to victims of sexual offenses and is now awaiting 
a new assignment by the peace corps 
sherman funk inspector general of the state department told the 
ap if true the story is pretty egregious 
he said he had referred the incident to somebody else for 
review i dont think its appropriate for me to comment further 
savage has an unlisted number the newspaper quoted him as saying 
why dont you ask me about economic development projects 
i dont want to talk about that ask me the same kind of 
questions you ask white congressmen you dont ask white congressmen 
questions like that savage who is black told the post

president bush today was weighing costs and 
timing as he neared a decision on a space council recommendation to 
set up a manned outpost on the moon and send astronauts to mars 
officials said 
theres a lot of analysis that needs to be considered 
especially in terms of cost to maintain a human outpost on the 
moon and a mars mission white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater told reporters it is a costly venture and those aspects 
need to be considered 
one administration official close to the issue said bush appeared 
likely to endorse the language before him in a draft speech that 
calls for building a permanent moon post as a way station to mars 
but what timetable he might set was unclear 
its not a question of whether we will go to mars someday we 
will go to mars its a question of how quickly said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity the source added that 
the president was mulling how specific he should be about dates for 
the venture 
bushs speech thursday will mark the 20th anniversary of mans 
first steps on the moon taken by apollo 11 astronaut neil armstrong 
on july 20 1969 
sources said the draft speech on bushs desk contained no 
pricetag or timetable for such a project 
dr frank martin the head of nasas exploration office said 
such a project would more than double the current nasa budget of 
some 13 billion a year bringing it to about 2 percent or 3 percent 
of the total federal budget 
while a strong supporter of an agressive space program bush did 
not want to set expensive goals that could not reasonably be funded 
officials said 
vice president dan quayle a principal booster of the proposal 
that came to bush through the national space council that quayle 
chairs expected to talk to the president about it by telephone 
today between speaking engagements in california said his press 
secretary david beckwith 
aides noted that bush could make significant revisions in the 
speech before delivering it fitzwater said there are all kinds of 
choices and options available here timing questions and so 
forth 
bush on tuesday was noncommittal about what he will say in the 
speech which has been billed as a major space policy address 
im not ready to say whether were going to have a new space 
initiative i want to be sure that what i propose passes any test of 
fiscal sanity fiscal reasonableness he told reporters traveling 
home with him from his european trip 
another idea the possibility of a joint space venture with the 
soviets was not included in the recommendations sent to him 
according to two officials the administration looked at the speech 
more in terms of setting us goals in space independent of what 
the soviet agenda might be one said 
but that did not mean space cooperation with the soviets has been 
ruled out the two officials said 
the president also is expected to push congress for renewed 
funding of the ongoing space station project whose budget is 
threatened by congressional cuts funding reductions proposed by the 
house appropriations subcommittee recently would seriously 
undermine that project quayle said tuesday 
quayle on tuesday hinted at a bold proposal in a speech in san 
diego he said the administration is moving forward to put the 
pieces in place for another great leap forward in space 
he said the nation must begin to think about the voyage of a 
new mayflower about expanding the human presence into the solar 
system as a longterm goal 
the only specifics quayle mentioned were continued white house 
backing for three projects already announced space station 
freedom a new earth observation satellite and the national 
aerospace plane 
he said that by the year 2000 the nation must be on our way to 
pioneering the solar system and establishing outposts on the moon 
and mars 
space boosters want bush to issue a call reminiscent of president 
john f kennedys 1961 challenge to the nation to land a man on the 
moon by the end of the decade 
white house officials preparing bushs thursday message on space 
asked for extensive briefings on a nasa plan called mission to 
planet earth a proposal for an intense environmental study of the 
planet from space sources said 
there was talk that by supporting the mission to planet earth 
the president could help his image as the environmental president 
a source at the national aeronautics and space administration said

rivers are rising and the people of 
bangladesh prepare for the annual deluge which can bring the 
blessing of rich harvests or the curse of destruction and death 
after devastating floods last year that killed at least 1400 
people and submerged threefourths of the country the government 
began an ambitious program to cope with future disasters 
a giant earthen dam is being built around dhaka the capital as 
part of a twoyear 100 million floodalleviation program 
warehouses of emergency rice and wheat supplies have been raised 
in many parts of the country about 400 helipads have been built to 
facilitate emergency relief and rescue operations 
perhaps the most practical steps are being taken by the people 
who are resigned to the annual floods that invariably disrupt their 
lives but in good years nourish the crops without washing them 
away 
at mohadepur a village of 6000 people 30 miles northwest of 
dhaka families have raised the ground beneath their bamboo houses 
which now stand on specially constructed hillocks several feet above 
surrounding fields of rice and jute 
the 22 men women and children of four families who live on one 
of the hillocks labored nearly a month hauling baskets of gray mud 
from the isamati river about 50 paces away 
jehanara 20 lives in one of the four homes that form the 
perimeter of the hillocks central courtyard she said the houses 
stand about 2 feet higher than they did when the 1988 flood peaked 
in august and september 
last year she and her neighbors said the water reached at least 
that far into their houses which have mud floors the walls are 
made of mats woven from split bamboo tied to bamboo poles and the 
roofs are of thatching or corrugated aluminium 
men from nearby houses said everyone in mohadepur with the time 
or money had raised at least the level of the family kitchen which 
usually consists of an earthen oven carved into the claylike ground 
during last years flood they said families sometimes could not 
eat for days at a time because there was no dry place to cook rice 
the staple in bangladesh and whatever other food was available 
on an adjacent but lower hillock mohammad ali said last years 
flood waters were three feet above ground level so he raised the 
area by two feet 
how far people raise hillocks is a calculated gamble the logic 
goes like this since the 1988 flood was said to one in a century 
this one shouldnt be as bad but if it is kneedeep in water is 
better than waistdeep or worse 
ali prosperous by local standards because he raises more than 
enough rice to feed his family and sells the excess said he hired 
17 men to elevate his compound he said it took about 15 days and 
cost him the equivalent of about 76 
he said there is nothing he can do to save his one and onethird 
acres of rice and jute if the floods are bad the current rice crop 
is due for harvest in late august 
its really difficult the 40yearold farmer said in 1987 
i lost the rice seedlings to too much rain in 1988 i lost 
everything to the flood 
i may lose it again but i cant find any other job what can i 
do its all up to allah 
rivers have not reached the levels of this time last year and 
there is hope that when they crest in a month or so the floods 
will be less severe up to 10 feet of water covered vast stretches 
of bangladesh last year 
the government said 21 million people nearly onefifth of the 
nations 110 million lost their homes last year and another 24 
million were affected by the floods which generally meant they were 
temporarily displaced or could not feed themselves 
about 30 million people relied on governmentsupplied food for at 
least a month after the water receded 
because of the government program if flooding is as bad this 
year the number of people affected would be about the same but 
the rescue work would be easier and quicker serajul hossain khan 
minister of relief and rehabilitation said in an interview 
he said the helipads would enable the air force to move food more 
rapidly but some foreign observers question whether helicopters are 
the answer 
what will they deliver except reporters a western relief 
official said privately on a good day they can get a dozen in the 
air you cant even begin to feed 30 million people by helicopter 
he and other foreign aid officials said the government appears to 
have enough reserves at least 1 million tons of rice and wheat for 
an emergency

battle and said he does not foresee a major loss this weekend but

demanding his resignation 
in yokohama his wife said i deeply apologize for the 
criticism regarding my husband the party used 80 buses to bring

gains for the leading opposition japan socialist party from its 
current 21 seats to 6470 mainichis poll was based on interviews 
july 1416 with 34237 eligible voters chosen at random across japan 
support for the liberal democrats was given as 27 percent 18 
percent lower than in a similar poll conducted before the last 
election in 1986 the socialists rose in popularity from 13 percent 
in 1986 to 30 percent and mainichi sid 26 percent of respondents 
were undecided

department of defense officials 
envisioned thousands of red white and blue balloons floating into 
the air to celebrate national constitution week 
but an environmentalist who has seen how deflated balloons kill 
marine animals only saw red his concerns prompted the defense 
department to cancel proposed launches at military bases around the 
country 
robert schoelkopf director of the marine mammal stranding center 
in brigantine was alerted to a pentagon memo with suggestions on 
ways bases could celebrate national constitution week in september 
one suggestion called for ringing tower bells for 202 seconds on 
sept 17 while simultaneously releasing red white and blue balloons 
in recent years schoelkopf has recovered dead marine animals 
including whales dolphins and turtles that have suffocated on 
deflated balloons that fell to the sea 
in addition the defense department would be in direct 
violation of the clean ocean act which prohibits the disposal of 
nonbiodegrable products into the ocean schoelkopf said 
after unsuccessful attempts to reach defense department 
officials schoelkopf turned to us rep h james saxton rnj 
who appealed to defense secretary dick cheney earlier this month 
we dont need to spend thousands of dollars in taxpayers money 
to launch balloons that will kill dolphins and other marine 
animals saxton said tuesday from his washington office 
a defense department spokesman said tuesday that another memo was 
in the works withdrawing the suggestion for a balloon launch and 
explaining why 
as soon as the problem was brought to our attention everyone 
was alerted maj james l adams said were reversing that 
suggestion

korean air lines chief trainer of pilots 
agreed in 1983 that crew members of flight 007 probably 
misprogrammed a navigation system leading to the shootdown of their 
jumbo jet over soviet airspace a witness testified wednesday in a 
lawsuit against kal 
frank houston of seattle told a civil court jury in us district 
court that he and other analysts who studied the tragedy reached the 
conclusion while conducting tests in a simulator at boeing 
facilities in november 1983 
at houstons home kals chief of training yoon bae kim 
agreed by shaking his head in the affirmative about the idea 
that the crew had misprogrammed the system said houston resulting 
in the plane being off course almost from the minute it took off 
from anchorage alaska 
the team of analysts felt that the kal crew probably had punched 
into the planes computerized navigation system the wrong number for 
the longitude at anchorage before taking off for seoul south korea 
its like a touchtone telephone what they did in my opinion 
is misdial houston said in describing the device the crew used to 
program the navigation system aboard the plane 
houston said he invited those involved in the investigation to 
my home we had a drink it seemed to be the consensus this was 
the most likely cause 
the most likely cause of what asked us district court 
judge aubrey robinson 
the most likely cause of this tragic accident replied 
houston 
houston explained that the misprogramming had caused the plane to 
fly 10 degrees off course leading it to a point 300 miles away from 
its assigned flight path when it was shot down by a soviet fighter 
plane 
the international civil aviation organization concluded that 
flight 007 was off course for nearly 5 hours and intruded into 
soviet territory for several hours before it was shot down 
houston a retired airline pilot was among the aviation experts 
who assisted in the icao probe the sept 1 1983 shootdown killed 
all 269 people aboard 
houstons characterization of kims views undermines statements 
made tuesday by george tompkins the attorney defending kal in the 
civil trial families of 138 of the dead passengers have filed suit 
alleging willful misconduct by the airline 
tompkins said there was no proof of any programming error by the 
crew and that flight 007 was on course until shortly before it was 
blown out of the sky by a soviet jet fighter 
the best evidence is that the crew of the kal jumbo jet was 
flying its correct route until about an hour before it was 
destroyed tompkins said 
tompkins said the crew sent radioed position reports periodically 
to anchorage and tokyo pinpointing the planes location as being on 
course for the first four hours of its flight 
the families of the dead passengers are trying to prove that the 
airlines crew knew it was off course but proceeded toward seoul 
anyway without the use of a misprogrammed navigation system

trustees in this village where a woman went 
on a shooting spree in a school have voted down a request to buy uzi 
submachine guns to replace shotguns carried in police cars 
i do not believe we should have uzis in winnetka said jeanne 
bradner village president in the suburb north of chicago her vote 
broke a 33 tie tuesday night and defeated the proposal 
police chief herbert timm asked the trustees for funds to buy six 
uzis a request that was turned down by a village council committee 
last week in a lastditch effort three trustees then proposed that 
timm be allowed to buy two or three uzis a measure that was 
defeated tuesday 
however the trustees did approve funding for the police 
department to replace revolvers with 29 semiautomatic glock17 
pistols which can fire 18 bullets before reloading the 
austrianmade weapons cost 311 each 
winnetka is the stylish suburb where laurie dann went on a 
shooting spree in an elementary school a year ago killing one 
student and injuring six other people before taking her own life 
timm said his request for new weapons was to replace outofdate 
firearms not in response to the dann shootings he said the uzis 
would replace 12gauge shotguns that are kept in patrol cars 
some residents who opposed giving police rapidfiring uzis said 
the weapons would increase the chances of innocent bystanders 
getting shot some also said the guns would be targets of thieves 
some residents also disapproved of the glock17s arguing that 
the pistols lack a builtin safety mechanism to guard against 
accidental firing

the soviet nuclear stockpile peaked last year 
and dropped in recent months because of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs military strategies the authors of a book released 
wednesday said 
the idea that they are churning out nuclear weapons like 
sausage is baloney william m arkin one of the authors of 
soviet nuclear weapons said at a news conference under 
gorbachev there has been a significant change in the composition and 
complexion of soviet forces 
the book was published under the auspices of the natural 
resources defense council a private organization that describes 
itself as long concerned about the dangers and problems posed by 
the unleashed atom 
the volume contains pictures and explanations of soviet nuclear 
weaponry ranging from blackjack bombers to sierra class submarines 
it includes a map of what it says have been some 600 underground 
nuclear explosions 
the authors said they relied heavily on us government 
documents using the freedom of information act to obtain reports 
one author thomas b cochran said to soviet journalists at the 
news conference this book should be published in the soviet 
union he and the other authors released a copy of a letter they 
sent to gorbachev during a recent trip to moscow urging publication 
you have stressed the need for historians to fill in the blank 
pages of your history the letter said we hope that in some 
small way our effort may stimulate soviet accounts of the 
development of atomic and hydrogen bombs missiles aircraft ships 
and submarines 
figures in the book indicate a soviet arsenal of 33000 nuclear 
weapons about 40 percent larger than the united states has but 
cochran saying there is a us superiority in readiness said the 
numbers can be deceiving 
we believe that the arsenal is declining that it peaked some 
time last year cochran said of the soviets holdings theyre 
not ahead of us and were not ahead of them the fact is both can do 
a lot of damage to the other 
the book says the soviets built up their arsenal grew because of 
the perception of how to achieve national security the 
advancement of certain foreign policy goals the desire for 
recognition as a superpower domestic political struggles 
bureaucratic inertia and military service rivalry 
gorbachevs doctrine of necessary defensive sufficiency 
however has meant a slowdown 
soviet nuclear forces are following the us pattern of the 
past 10 to 20 years certain military missions that once used 
nuclear weapons began to be phased out a statement about the book 
said the weapon was either not replaced or replaced with a 
conventional system 
the book said the modernization of soviet strategic nuclear 
forces seemed to have slowed in the past two years with the new 
blackjack bomber and ss24 icbm being introduced in small numbers 
arkin added they have a lot of old junk and they never throw 
anything out but he also said one should not confuse technical 
obsolescence with real decisions to remove weapons 
he said large portions of the arsenals of both the united states 
and the soviet union are not included in any of the arms control 
negotiations 
and those are the nuclear weapons that are most likely to cause 
nuclear war he said 
he said 14000 of the 33000 soviet warheads are not included in 
any of the arms talks he cited bombs on jet fighters artillery and 
naval weapons

people were standing around because they couldnt get in to 
help said another neighbor who identified herself only as ellen 
i saw the mother and father come out of the side of the house by 
the kitchen and she laid out on the side of the house screaming 
my babies my babies 
i heard this spitting and sputtering and a big bang said 
william shelton another neighbor i looked out the window and the 
house across the street was totally engulfed in flames i ran out 
and there was nothing anybody could do to get inside the house it 
was totally involved 
duncan pardue a spokesman for the federal aviation

military pilots who chased thomas 
root on his flight down the east coast saw his head move several 
times during the 800mile trip when he claimed to be unconscious a 
federal investigator said today 
the pilots also noticed changes in the position of the sun visor 
on the planes windshield said andrew alston an investigator with 
the national transportation safety board 
root was confronted with the pilots accounts this morning but 
was unable to explain the movement alston said root has maintained 
that he lost consciousness and traveled on autopilot before ditching 
in bahamian waters last week 
various pilots reported that as he was intercepted from the 
right his head would turn to the right and as he was intercepted 
from the left his head would move to the left alston said the 
sun visor moved position at least three times during the flight 
alston said any criminal investigation about the mystery flight 
would be handled by the fbi 
officials also said a blood test screening for carbon monoxide in 
roots blood system turned up negative raising further questions 
about whether he fell unconscious 
in other developments reports surfaced that two days before 
roots mysterious 800mile flight a federal task force began 
investigating him on suspicion of running guns and drugs 
a gun manufacturer and a police chief meanwhile cast doubt on 
roots claim that he was shot when his gun discharged as the plane 
crashed in bahamian waters last week 
hes been saying some things that are now ludicrous 
hollywood police chief richard witt told the associated press late 
tuesday nobody is going to know what really happened until he 
starts to put away those things that are implausible and starts 
talking about whats plausible 
the task force working under the drug enforcement 
administration began investigating the washington lawyer eight days 
ago after a meeting of state and federal law enforcement officials 
from washington maryland and virginia according to todays fort 
lauderdale sunsentinel 
the group took action because of the discovery of 35 guns and 
five gallons of ether a chemical that can be used to process 
cocaine during an april 24 search of the hangar where root stored 
his plane said emile manara a special agent working for the task 
force 
task force members told the sunsentinel that the us drug 
enforcement administration has uncovered evidence suggesting that 
root also had made unscheduled landings in remote areas 
manara said such behavior fits the pattern of suspected drug 
smugglers but he cautioned that the task force had not found any 
direct evidence linking root to drug smuggling or gun running 
we thought that this guy warranted some looking into manara 
said 
root 36 remains in stable condition at memorial hospital in 
hollywood with a gunshot wound to the abdomen he has said he 
doesnt know why he passed out during the flight and claimed his 
32caliber smith amp wesson revolver kept in the planes glove 
compartment discharged during the crash 
dick bachmann vice president of smith amp wesson told the ap that 
the guns safety features make such accidental firings impossible 
suggestions that it could are absolutely false he said 
and witt a veteran homicide investigator told the ap there was 
indisputable scientific proof that roots bullet wound was at 
least four hours old when he arrived at the hospital 
witts claim supported the findings of us coast guard surgeon 
james rahman who has said that peritonitis or inflammation of the 
abdominal cavity showed root must have been shot at least two 
hours before he was rescued 
all this would indicate that mr root is being less than 
truthful witt said 
manara said the task force investigation of root has been put on 
hold while other agencies make their inquiries into the flight 
the search of roots hangar at the manassas va airport also 
turned up chemical lighting sticks which smugglers often attach to 
drug loads tossed out of airplanes said bill kelmartin a prince 
william county va police investigator assigned to the task force 
kelmartin said that in an interview after the hangar search root 
told him and a us customs agent he kept the sticks in the 
airplanes cabin for backup lighting in case of an electrical 
problem 
roots work for sonrise management services inc a company that 
deals with radio stations also is the subject of investigation and 
legal disputes 
a lawsuit filed july 3 in us district court in macon ga 
accused root of legal malpractice breach of contract and fraud in 
handling a 75000 transaction for dr kenneth bazemore of byron 
ga bazemores suit contends root sent the money meant as an 
initial payment for two broadcast companies to ralph savage 
chairman of sonrise without permission 
the lawsuit stems from bazemores plans to buy savages interest 
in vista communications inc and desert broadcasting corp in palm 
springs calif it seeks return of the money damages and legal fees

an 11yearold who escaped from a boys 
home and evaded police by living in a forest has embarrassed social 
authorities and prompted a parliamentary investigation into the case 
the youth identified only as pikkis has been on the run in the 
forest near his former home in espoo outside helsinki for more 
than a week friends secretly gave him food and clothing 
pikkis fled from an institution for homeless boys in turku 125 
miles from espoo where he was sent by social authorities 18 months 
ago 
i ran away because i could not live in that place the people 
there are pigs they ordered me about and hit me pikkis said in a 
television interview in which only his voice was heard 
living in the forest is much better than being in that boys 
home i wouldnt go back even if they paid me pikkis said 
the case of pikkis dubbed the forest boy by the media has 
generated interest in a country that prides itself on the high level 
of welfare for the unfortunate and the care available for all 
citizens 
assistant parliamentary ombudsman pirkko koskinen said 
something was apparently rotten and she had commissioned a full 
report on the case 
obviously an 11yearold boy cannot play at being robinson 
crusoe the forest is no place for him to live we must find a 
solution to the problem before the hot summer weather ends she 
said of course what im particularly interested in is to find 
out what happened at that boys home in turku 
pikkis was sent to turku after his parents separated because 
according to press reports his father was incapable of looking 
after him and his mother didnt want to 
annikki alho senior psychologist at the turku boys home denied 
anyone was beaten at the home but said she could not discuss 
pikkis specific case 
it is obvious that our methods do not include hitting we never 
use such means on anyone besides it is forbidden by law alho 
said 
yes there are dickensian overtones to the whole affair but 
when we get to the bottom of it im sure it wont be as bad as made 
out by the press alho said 
last weekend pikkis was given shelter in a friends house after 
four adults were allowed in on his secret 
on monday only minutes before he was due to meet welfare 
authorities neighbors put the police on his track and the boy 
again went underground 
it is really unfortunate that we did not make contact with the 
lad because we have a foster family lined up for him at the moment 
it seems that the media know more about the case than we do said 
laura jussila social welfare officer in espoo 
our prime concern is with the wellbeing of the boy but we do 
not want to break the law or step on anyones toes jussila said

some siberian miners returned to work after the 
government made pay concessions but more walked out in the ukraine 
and president mikhail s gorbachev said wednesday the coal strike 
could imperil his reforms 
gorbachev said there were reports of railway workers being urged 
to strike and if labor trouble spreads we may have to take such 
extreme measures that it will hurt what weve been doing to 
modernize the economy he did not elaborate 
strikes are rare in the soviet union and were ended by force 
before gorbachev gained power in march 1985 
tass said 24000 strikers in the kuznetsk coal basin of western 
siberia were working wednesday after some of their demands were 
granted and called the partial return a change for the better 
state television said 150000 kuznetsk miners remained on strike 
izvestia the government newspaper said strike committees in 
four kuznetsk cities decided to end the walkout which began july 
11 and that coal deliveries had resumed 
a correspondent said on the evening television news program 
vremya that the strike had spread to 70 of the 120 mines in the 
donetsk basin of the ukraine more than triple the previous number 
and mine construction workers joined the walkout 
in a report from the donetsk city of yenakiyevo vremya said 
steel and cokechemical plants were on the verge of a stoppage 
for lack of coal a striker said on the program that miners agreed 
to provide 1000 tons to one cokechemical plant to keep it running 
earlier reports in the official press had said operations at 
steel and power plants were affected by short supplies of coal and 
coke 
the strikes in the countrys two leading coal basins are the 
worst soviet labor unrest since the turbulence of the 1920s a few 
years after the 1917 bolshevik revolution 
in moscow gorbachev told the national legislature the strikes 
had deprived the nation of more than 1 million tons of coal and 
there are reports of calls to railroad workers to join the strike 
as of aug 1 
such a development of events poses a threat to the 
implementation of plans projected by the policy of perestroika 
his economic reform program gorbachev said and issued his warning 
about possible extreme measures if the trouble spreads 
gorbachev said he and premier nikolai i ryzhkov sent a telegram 
assuring donetsk miners all concessions granted the siberian miners 
would apply to the men working other soviet coal fields 
the government agreed to most miner demands including those on 
pensions and overtime gorbachev told the supreme soviet 
legislature but he added that settling some longerterm issues 
would take up to a month 
tass outlined a concessions package tha includes bonus pay to 
night shifts and for men using pneumatic hammers strikers also have 
complained about poor housing and shortages of consumer goods and 
food and the government has made general pledges of improvements in 
those areas 
anatoly saunin a legislator from donetsk told the supreme 
soviet every day lost in the mines costs millions of rubles that 
otherwise might help improve living conditions in the entire nation 
you mustnt hold a knife to the throat of the government he 
said apparently addressing the strikers 
izvestia said coal production worth 31 million had been lost in 
donetsk and the strike had cost industry in one siberian region 75 
million

offhours classes at the capital iron and steel 
co used to focus on new technologies now however study is 
mandatory and the text is senior leader deng xiaopings speech on 
crushing prodemocracy protests 
all 184000 workers at the companys facility in western beijing 
are taking part in onceweekly classes in which the themes of dengs 
speech are repeated examples are raised and personal experiences 
are recounted and analyzed 
after studying dengs speech i improved my thinking and 
understand more clearly the nature of the rebellion wang songjie 
a worker in capital steels sintering plant told five coworkers 
two top plant officials three lowerranking officials and a foreign 
journalist on wednesday 
the workers some about to go on shifts and some coming off 
gathered for their class in a tiny factory sitting room copies of 
dengs june 9 speech to army officers balanced on their knees 
noisy fans kept the hot muggy air circulating as the six 
students took turns summing up what they learned about the 
sevenweek student movement for a freer society that deng condemned 
as an effort to overthrow the government and socialist system 
the army ended it june 34 with an attack on the protesters in 
central beijing in which hundreds and perhaps thousands of people 
were killed thousands have been arrested since 
not one of the participants mentioned the deaths or arrests but 
wang appeared to defend them 
if bad elements savagely cause turmoil and dont allow us to 
attack them this would be so unfair he said martial law is 
supported by the people 
we must have unified thinking said li zuowei an engineer 
what is this thinking it is the policy expressed by deng 
xiaoping this cannot be shaken and will not be changed 
phrases from dengs speech and newspaper commentaries abounded 
a handful of people with ulterior motives stability and 
unity uphold production grasp well ideological education 
there have been many rumors said worker he dakun but 
after studying deng xiaopings speech we expelled all outside 
disturbances from our minds and put all our efforts into our work 
rumors are indeed legion including shaky reports that workers at 
other factories are staging slowdown protests against the 
government at one point during the protests students reported they 
had heard that capital steel workers were on strike but those at 
wednesdays class denied it 
in fact many workers came to work even though transportation 
was stopped he said one worker mu kehua in order to fulfill 
the factory quota spent 70 yuan about 19 on a taxi to get to 
work 
cao muming director of the sintering plant said only one of his 
plants 1088 workers joined the protesters in tiananmen square 
he is being investigated and is studying cao said 
the workers recitations were expressionless and there was no 
opportunity to ask them privately what they thought many beijing 
residents say privately they oppose the army crackdown although not 
all supported the students 
all across the nation work units are holding classes to study 
dengs speech with the aim of wiping out the silent opposition but 
capital steel is taking special pains 
as beijings most prominent factory its workers epitomize in the 
public mind the urban proletarian who is supposed to lead socialism 
during the student movement authorities reportedly threatened to 
punish any capital steel worker who took part 
now they are determined to maintain capital steels image as a 
socialist bastion every other week the workers in each plant 
gather by the hundreds for political lectures 
but the real education comes in the small groups where workers 
must show they have internalized the message 
for any chinese over the age of 30 that may not be difficult 
veterans of the 196676 far leftist cultural revolution and more 
recent lessviolent political campaigns are experienced in 
stringing together phrases from official documents 
the only time the discussion became lively was when a reporter 
asked about the date of the largest march of the student movement 
when more than 1 million people filled beijing streets 
that was may 17 the workers said what happened on the 
street it seemed they had no need to study

doctors wednesday reported a growing number of 
stressrelated illnesses among people in a resort city southwest of 
tokyo that has been jolted by thousands of tremors and several 
volcanic eruptions in the past two weeks 
weve had an increasing number of patients complaining of 
insomnia and gastritis due to stress and fear of earthquakes and 
volcanic eruptions said mikio kakefu director of the national 
hospital in ito city 
ito a coastal resort city on the izu peninsula about 60 miles 
southwest of tokyo has had more than 23000 temblors including 486 
strong enough to be felt since june 30 
on july 13 an undersea volcano erupted off the ito coast 
creating a mound 82 feet high according to the maritime safety 
agency japans coast guard 
volcanic activity has slowed since then and no strong 
earthquakes have been recorded since sunday no injuries or damages 
were reported after the eruption 
but the central meteorological agency has warned the volcano is 
likely to erupt again because the movement of magma or molten rock 
continues 
kakefu said the hospital which has an average of 250 outpatients 
daily monday began receiving more patients with stomach aches 
insomnia and diarrhea all from fear and stress 
they didnt feel sick for a couple of days after the eruption 
because they were still tense he said kakefu said he does not 
have any statistics but indicated the number of such patients is 
likely to increase 
pets have also been developing similar symptoms since shortly 
after the eruption said masaaki mochizuki an ito veterinarian 
he said he has examined 129 cats and dogs suffering the 
earthquake syndrome between july 4 and july 14 
symptoms such as nausea diarrhea and loss of appetite were 
frequent among cats and many dogs suffered skin problems including 
rashes and hair loss he said he said some dogs were also afflicted 
with coughing and trembling due to excessive fear 
my busiest day was july 14 the day after the eruption 
mochizuki said symptoms in animals appeared earlier than in 
people because animals are more sensitive and they feel the 
temblors and noises more strongly 
we humans have information from the municipal office and the 
meteorological centers which help to relieve our tensions but 
such things dont work for animals he said

capitol hill which produces 60 tons of trash a 
day took a look wednesday at ways it could recycle more of its 
words or at least the paper theyre printed on 
before the house subcommittee on procurement and printing was a 
bill by rep bill green rny calling on the architect of the 
capitol george white to devise a plan to recycling more of 
congress rubbish 
only 10 percent of the paper the house and the senate throws away 
now is sold for reuse green said by passing his bill congress would 
be setting an example for the rest of the country 
white laid before the subcommittee an elaborate plan it called 
for a yearlong pilot program under which workers in two 
congressional office buildin of the executive legislative and 
judicial branches of the federal government to comply with local 
laws respecting control and abatement of solid waste or hazardous 
waste disposal 
we expect you to do it she said 
fiftythree percent of washingtons waste is paper said ms 
winters 
the very nature of our city is reflected in the waste generated 
within the city she said 
the city she said produces 381000 tons of waste paper a year 
much of it highquality paper valuable when recycled 
it is a national resource which must be reused to do any less 
would be to encourage a national disgrace 
white reported that capitol hill including congress hill 
neighbors the library of congress and the supreme court generate 
20000 tons of trash a year much of it paper and only 10 percent of 
it recycled 
that amounts to roughly eight pounds a day for each of the 15000 
people who work for congress 
because it is all lumped together it commands only 1 a ton from 
recyclers high quality paper separated out might go for 15 a 
ton he said

sukhumi the regions capital said troops were gaining the upper 
hand on wednesday following imposition of a state of emergency 
which included a curfew 
the man said shooting stopped in sukhumi on wednesday but the 
line was cut off before he could give his name or further details 
abkhazians are a minority in their homeland a socalled 
autonomous republic inside the southern republic of georgia both 
abkhazians and georgians claim ethnic discrimination by the other 
mobs of more than 100 people have attacked troops and citizens 
for the purpose of seizing arms and ammunition tass said 
wednesday

highway gunmen also shot up two passenger trains in sukhumi said 
tass adding that no one was injured 
on monday an armed band attacked the inguri hydroelectric 
station in the mountains near djvari and cut off the power to some 
districts before police restored the situation and posted 
guards the tbilisi newspaper said 
tass described food shortages as acute in some areas the 
newspaper said 69 trains were stuck in sukhumi and in the georgian 
capital of tbilisi because abkhazians had ripped up a section of 
track and striking railroad workers in sukhumi refused to repair it 
authorities reinforced the interior ministry troops raising the 
total dispatched to the region to 4500 soldiers and 2000 
policemen said the newspaper account which was read over the 
telephone by gizo grzeledze of the georgian foreign ministry

we raise our hands brother against brother neighbor against 
neighbor if rage blinds our eyes 
gumbaridze and other senior georgian leaders met with groups to 
try to ease tensions and a commission was formed to investigate the 
cause of the rioting 
many leaders of abkhazia were blamed for serious violations of 
political and ideological work inertia and lack of initiative 
tass said of the meetings 
an abkhazian official said the rioting was touched off by new 
rules that would split the state university in sukhumi into georgian 
and abkhazian sections 
for months abkhazians have been pressing for their region to 
secede from georgia and become the 16th soviet republic giving it 
more political and economic autonomy 
in april ethnic conflicts in abkhazia set off demonstrations in 
tbilisi the georgian capital that developed into demands for 
georgian independence from the soviet union 
soldiers crushed the protests and at least 20 people were killed

several hundred protesters lined the 
street around the internal revenue service office wednesday as tax 
agents tried to auction the home of a pair of tax resisters 
the only bidders were the protesters who offered to trade 
21414 in food and donated services to the poor for the home of 
randall kehler a founder of the nuclear freeze campaign and his 
wife betsy corner the couple has refused to pay federal taxes for 
12 years to protest government spending on the military 
the protesters bid was rejected and the government acquired the 
home for the minimum bid of 5100 
food is not legal tender said robert ruttenberg an irs 
spokesman 
the donated canned goods filled a truck parked outside the irs 
office 
we feel good that this community is making a statement about 
where our resources ought to be going and that is to support our 
communities and feed the poor not to build weapons and destroy the 
planet kehler said 
according to ruttenberg the couple owes about 27000 in back 
taxes 
kehler said that instead of paying taxes he and his wife have 
filed returns and donated the money they owed to local charities and 
peace groups they have continued to pay state and local taxes he 
said 
the first year we had a taxable income was in 1977 he said 
we would haaxes before any eviction proceedings can be 
started against them and their 9yearold daughter kehler said he 
and his family wont pay and wont go quietly 
we will refuse to cooperate with any eviction and nonviolently 
occupy our own home he said 
ruttenberg said the number of tax resisters protesting military 
spending has dropped to about 5000 from about 22000 in the early 
1980s 
if they want to change the law let them elect people that will 
do that he said but they are breaking the law and doing it at 
the expense of other people who have to pay their freight for 
social secuirty and food stamp programs

a soldier in an elite infantry battalion 
committed suicide and another shot himself in the foot to escape 
brutality from fellow troops a newspaper reported wednesday 
the daily hadashot said both incidents occurred in a single 
platoon the unit it said was dominated by former criminals 
who beat recruits and gave orders to officers who were too 
intimidated to discipline them 
the commander of the givati battalion which often is used to 
suppress palestinian riots in the occupied gaza strip said reports 
of abuse in the unit were exaggerated hadashot and the independent 
haaretz reported 
a military spokesman would not confirm details of the reports 
but the spokesman said the platoons commander deputy commander and 
three noncommissioned officers were dismissed several months ago 
and the platoon disbanded 
the spokesman who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
also said the head of southern command maj gen matan vilnai met 
with givati commanders in connection with recent incidents but 
would not elaborate 
platoons in the israeli army generally have about 20 soldiers 
the soldier who shot himself in the foot was tried before a 
military court and given a threemonth suspended sentence for 
unauthorized use of his weapon the newspapers reported 
he was identified only as a resident of the negev desert town of 
ofakim 
hadashot said that during the trial it was disclosed that another 
soldier in the platoon committed suicide but gave no details 
the picture painted by the accused was described by one judge 
as a sodom and gomorrah haaretz reported 
the accused described to us a situation where his unit is ruled 
by soldiers with criminal backgrounds who act violently toward 
anyone who does not submit to their will haaretz quoted the court 
decision as saying 
haaretz said soldiers in the platoon beat recruits and abandoned 
their guardposts but the newspaper gave no other details of 
brutality 
we wonder how such a unit will stand up when it is called to 
battle it said 
the commander of givati identified only as col y told the 
newspapers the soldiers testimony was incorrect but confirmed 
there were problems in the unit 
i personally dismissed the platoon commander and the unit 
commander for their lack of control over the soldiers he said 
he accused the court of being unnecessarily harsh and added we 
are talking about an elite unit that is doing difficult work in the 
occupied territories and in lebanon and to come today and dirty 
their names in not reasonable 
it was not the first time givati troops were accused in court of 
brutality 
in may a military court convicted four givati soldiers of abuse 
and sentenced them to nine months in jail for beating a palestinian 
refugee in gaza with their rifle butts and a broomstick the arab 
died of later beatings he received from other soldiers the court

south africas administrator in namibia 
on wednesday announced the release of 24 political prisoners and a 
reduced role for some police 
the moves by namibias top official louis pienaar are likely to 
reduce tensions in the territory as it heads toward independence 
after 74 years of south african rule 
pienaar made the announcement after he met with un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar conferred for two hours 
wednesday 
we are now broadly speaking back on track for elections in 
early november said perez de cuellar 
however he also acknowledged potential obstacles it is 
perhaps inevitable that after so many years of conflict fears and 
distrust should persist but they should not be allowed to 
continue 
pienaar said i am completely satisfied in the manner in which 
the meeting was conducted 
he said the 24 men to be freed thursday are considered the last 
political prisoners in namibia however he said he decided against 
releasing eight men convicted or accused of political violence 
pienaar previously linked the freeing of political prisoners to 
the release of people he believes are being held by the southwest 
africa peoples organization 
the group known as swapo waged a 23year guerrilla war against 
south african rule of namibia it is now the favorite in 
preindependence elections set for november 
south africa agreed in december to carry out the un 
independence plan under terms of a regional peace accord under the 
usbrokered pact south africa also pledged to halt aid to 
guerrillas battling the angolan government 
in exchange the agreement stipulated that the estimated 50000 
cuban troops supporting the angolan government would be withdrawn 
pienaar said he changed his mind about freeing prisoners when 
perez de cuellar assured him the united nations would seek the 
return to namibia of all swapo detainees 
swapo has said it released all 201 of its detainees in april 
however only 153 returned to namibia two weeks ago and on 
wednesday they released a list of 439 people they say still are held 
in southern angola 
pienaar also said he would deploy to lesstense regions policemen 
who previously belonged to a counterinsurgency unit known as 
koevoet the afrikaans word for crowbar 
many of koevoets estimated 3000 members were integrated into 
the regular police force after the unit was officially disbanded in 
january 
koevoet has been accused of dozens of atrocities in northern 
namibia where most of the bush war was fought swapo says former 
koevoet members who are mostly black namibians continue to harass 
its supporters 
pienaar also said un police monitors in northern namibia will 
be encouraged to accompany local police patrols 
the united nations has more than 5000 soldiers and police in the 
territory but their role is largely supervisory 
perez de cuellar also met with members of 10 political factions 
he was quoted as saying the vigorous election campaign was 
heartening evidence that political leaders are working for national 
unity 
namibia will need all of its people all their skills and 
resources when it stands before the world as an independent 
state he said 
pienaar also said one unresolved issue concerns his charges that 
1900 swapo fighters are massed in angola near the namibian border 
swapo denies the charges 
the un chief is to visit several northern towns thursday to 
examine security and observe the ongoing repatriation of 41000 
namibian refugees on friday he heads to south africa for talks 
with government leaders

the government said wednesday that 
washington must dismantle us bases in greece next year without a 
new defense pact even though talks on such an agreement have been 
frozen 
a fiveyear agreement signed by the previous socialist 
administration expired last year 
the issue of the us bases in greece is frozen but the 
17month countdown which began last december for the americans to 
remove the bases if a new agreement was not signed is still in 
force said deputy foreign minister george papoulias 
the agreement specified that the united states would remove its 
four major military installations at the end of the time limit 
without a new agreement 
the last of at least 15 rounds of negotiations on a new accord 
ended in may 
a temporary governing coalition of conservatives and leftists has 
said it will avoid national issues including the bases matter and 
instead leave them for the new government to result from elections 
in october 
the coalition was formed after the june 18 vote failed to give 
any one party a majority in the 300member onechamber parliament 
the temporary government has said it will deal mainly with 
scandals surrounding officials of the defeated socialist 
administration 
two of the us bases are on the aegean island of crete where 
the 6th fleet refuels and the air force maintains a communications 
station the navy also has a listening post and the air force a 
support group in the athens area

president roh taewoo on wednesday 
dismissed or reassigned six cabinet ministers and fired his 
intelligence chief but the opposition denounced the moves as merely 
cosmetic 
the changes were not expected to alter government policies they 
were widely seen as political housekeeping moves to try to reassure 
citizens that the governing democratic justice party is concerned 
about social unrest rising crime and welfare problems 
opposition leaders said roh had ignored the publics desire for a 
complete change to erase the legacies of disgraced former president 
chun doohwan he left office in 1988 and later went into rural 
exile after apologizing for abuses during his regime 
most of rohs 23member cabinet worked in some capacity under the 
chun government 
wednesdays shakeup involved home construction communications 
labor and healthsocial affairs ministers as well as the first 
minister of state for political affairs 
prime minister kang younghoon and the other 16 ministers were 
retained in the last cabinet changes in december 1988 kang and 19 
ministers were appointed 
the most noticeable action wednesday was the dismissal of park 
sehjik as head of the main government intelligence organization 
the agency for national security planning park was replaced by 
former attorney general suh dongkwon 
park a former army general who served as chief organizer of the 
1988 seoul olympics was held responsible for his agencys failure 
to detect a series of secret visits to communist north korea by 
south korean dissident leaders 
under south koreas anticommunist law unauthorized visits to 
the communist north are a crime 
the largest opposition group the party for peace and democracy 
said roh had filled his cabinet with hardliners associated with his 
disgraced predecessor 
the party focused on the choice of suh as intelligence chief 
he suh was in the vanguard of the governments suppression of 
political opposition and dissent while in his legal post said 
party spokesman lee sangsoo 
lee said the cabinet change ignored the peoples ardent desires 
for further democratization and liquidation of human rights abuses 
and corruption under chun 
lee inche spokesman for the second largest opposition group 
reunification democratic party said the changes were not adequate 
to satisfy the peoples anticipation of renovation in government 
he said the public had anticipated a shakeup that would include the 
premiership 
in other changes announced wednesday national assemblyman kim 
taeho of the governing was made home minister succeeding lee 
handong 
kwon yonggack president of the staterun korea housing corp 
and a retired army general became construction minister

housing starts led by a steep rise in 
apartment building rebounded 7 percent in june as interest rates 
fell the government reported wednesday but analysts said 
singlefamily construction would remain weak as the economy 
continues to slow 
new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 14 million units last month up from 131 million 
units in may when construction fell 25 percent the commerce 
department reported 
while junes increase was the highest since an 86 percent hike 
to 151 million units in february 1988 it reflected a 28 percent 
rise in apartment construction the highest since a 43 percent 
increase in april 1988 
singlefamily construction fell in june for the third straight 
month prompting david seiders chief economist for the national 
association of home builders to say this sector of the housing 
market is still in a bit of the doldrums because of both 
interest rates and the economy 
builders are extremely cautious said chief economist david 
berson of the federal national mortgage association theyre 
waiting to make sure the decline in interest rates leads to a 
sustained increase in singlefamily sales 
the housing industry had been among the sectors of the economy 
hardest hit as interest rates edged upward over the past year while 
the federal reserve sought to restrain economic growth and contain 
inflation 
but as inflation seemed to slow fixed rate mortgages had fallen 
to 1007 percent by the end of june from a peak of 1122 percent in 
march and analysts began looking for a pickup in housing activity 
seiders however said wednesdays report was not a signal that 
interest rates have revived the housing industry 
the really interestsensitive part is singlefamily 
construction where we saw a bit of a decline he said adding 
that another reason for the decline is the slowing economy which 
will leave housing rather weak for the rest of the year 
economist john tuccillo of the national association of realtors 
called the weak singlefamily sector a reflection of the health of 
the residential construction market 
construction of singlefamily homes fell 2 percent in june to an 
annual rate of 975000 units the lowest level since august 1984 
when 967000 units were started singlefamily construction fell 51 
percent in may and 47 percent in april 
apartment construction on the other hand rose last month to an 
annual rate of 425000 units but this sector often is volatile 
construction of multifamily units had risen 26 percent in may after 
falling 266 percent in april 
tuccillo saw two other disturbing factors a disproportionate 
volume of activity in the west and a decrease in applications for 
building permits 
the west posted a 214 percent increase in starts to 443000 
units on a seasonally adjusted annual rate the south also 
registered an increase up 58 percent to 548000 units 
but the northeast had a 5 percent decrease to 171000 units while 
midwestern starts were down 33 percent to 238000 units 
applications for building permits a barometer of future 
multifamily housing activity were down 35 percent following 
increases of 1 percent in may and 85 percent in april they had 
fallen the three previous months however

treasury secretary nicholas brady rejected on 
tuesday a suggestion that the paris economic summit last week 
signified a retreat by the united states from its position since the 
end of world war ii as the leader in world economic affairs 
i dont think we have the passing of the baton yet but it is a 
serious worry brady told the joint economic committee of 
congress the fiscal pressures we are under certainly do 
circumscribe our ability to flesh out that leadership with the 
presentation of funds 
on another issue brady repeated the administrations intent to 
open talks with congress on a fiscal budget for 1991 opposing a tax 
increase but despite prodding by sen william roth rdel he 
declined to categorically rule out the possibility of a tax increase 
certainly the 1990 budget was put togehter with that in mind 
and thats what happened brady said we would begin with that 
same process in 1991 the presidents position is quite clear and 
that obviously is my position 
in response to questions on the significance of the summit brady 
said us inablity to come up with its prescribed and agreedto 
contributions to the world bank and other multinational agencies has 
become a source of embarrassment in worldwide forums 
brady made the assessment after the committees chairman rep 
lee hamiltion dind noted that president bush offered a very 
modest 125 million to encourage fragile democratic and free 
market economic movements in poland and hungary 
cleaning up the environment and relieving the debt burdens 
depressing third world countries were the other two primary topics 
of the summit but hamilton noted the united states offered no new 
economic help for either 
if you look at the areas which seemed to dominate the summit 
in all cases it seems to me american funds simply were not 
available in large quantity hamiltion said 
brady noted that japan with a pledge of 65 billion has assumed 
the leadership in sharing the burden of third world debt reduction 
we have to give credit where credit is due he said they 
have come forth with hard money to support the debt strategy 
but he complained that other countries with large surpluses 
west germany and taiwan have offered little help 
brady said he also expects an agreement reasonably soon 
between private banks and mexico in the first test of his plan for 
nudging private banks into forgiving large protions of the 13 
trillion debt owed by developing countries 
endorsement of his plan by the heads of state of the six other 
industrial powers britain france west germany italy canada and 
japan puts more pressure on the banks to negotiate debtreduction 
agreementsm he said 
several members of congress have expressed skepticism about the 
workability of the plan and its reliance on governmentbacked 
guarantees to cover interest payments to the private banks on the 
remaining balances 
the administration had sought to put some of those fears to rest 
hoping to announce at the summit an agreement in which mexicos 15 
creditor banks agreed to a 30 percent to 40 percent reduction in the 
54 billion they are owed by its government no announcement was 
made 
i wish it were going faster but these negotiations are very 
complicated and take a long time brady said tuesday i think 
were going to get resolution reasonably soon 
and when we do get it he said i think everybody will feel 
relieved that the first transaction has taken place and other ones 
will follow much more quickly because we know how to do it 
sen paul sarbanes dmd questioned whether private banks in 
other countries were resisting the debtreduction efforts in the 
belief that their governments were not as supportive of bradys plan 
as the united states 
brady said the significance of the summit was that the issue has 
now been kicked upstairs to the headofstate level 
last april a month after the plan was revealed it received a 
qualified endorsement from the finance ministers of the six other 
industrial powers

cabinet secretary louis sullivan on wednesday 
backed away from supporting local needleexchange programs to help 
stem the spread of aids and told congress the bush administration 
opposes such programs 
the health and human services secretary said that after talking 
with aids and drug abuse experts and members of congress he 
believes at this time there is insufficient scientific evidence to 
conclude that needleexchange programs are effective in curbing the 
spread of the aids virus 
he also said the administration is opposed because of concern 
that programs that provide clean needles to drug addicts could be 
viewed as sanctioning iv drug abuse 
we await better solutions to the twin scourges of aids and iv 
drug abuse he told the subcommittee 
sullivans comments during a more than twohour appearance before 
the house energy and commerce health subcommittee were a departure 
from statements he made in an interview with the association press 
in march 
in the interview the secretary said he did not subscribe to 
the view that it needle exchange condones drug abuse he also 
said that while he did not favor a federal needleexchange program 
because of strong opposition in some communities the federal 
government could provide trained health officials and other support 
for communities that want such programs 
he said in march it is an idea that certainly deserves some 
investigation to see if it does work and if it does then that would 
then strengthen those other communities where there is concern that 
it is sending the wrong message 
he told members of the subcommittee we want to gather all the 
information that we can about these programs and because of the 
fact that there has not been evidence clear evidence that these 
programs are effective we are not prepared to advocate or come 
forth with programs 
sullivans ealier statements alarmed some in the bush 
administration including drug czar william bennett who opposes 
needle exchange programs presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said bush is opposed to exchangeable needles under any condition 
sullivan said his department planned no efforts to conduct its 
own evaluation of the effectiveness of needleexchange programs but 
he said the national institute on drug abuse which is part of hhs 
would consider applications for research grants for such an 
evaluation 
however he said it will be difficult to develop an effective 
methodology 
pressed by rep henry waxman dcalif subcommittee chairman 
sullivan agreed to convene a panel of scientists to determine how 
the effectiveness of these programs can be evaluated scientifically 
waxman asked sullivan to report back to the subcommittee with the 
panels recommendations 
needleexchange programs are under way in england australia 
sweden and the netherlands as well as several us cities 
including new york city tacoma wash and boulder colo 
sullivan said the studies evaluating the effectiveness of some of 
these programs is not convincing because none has compared a 
group of addicts receiving clean needles with a group that is not 
also it is not clear whether findings that show decreased needle 
sharing and no increase in drug abuse are resulting from other 
factors he said 
at a hearing in april the subcommittee heard from officials of 
three needleexchange programs who said their programs were 
effective in reducing the spread of aids 
several democrats on the subcommittee who believe needleexchange 
programs should be looked into as a possible tool in the fight 
against the aids epidemic were clearly frustrated by sullivans 
newfound opposition to the such programs and questioned the 
administrations commitment to fighting aids 
where are the strategies asked rep james scheuer a 
democrat from new york city which has more aids cases than any 
other us city your statement reflects your cool and thoughtful 
style but theres no urgency there

measles vaccinations are being recommended for as 
many as 100 million people 32 or younger and two doses of vaccine 
are being urged for children after reports of measles outbreaks in 
18 states 
the recommendations from the american academy of pediatrics and 
the centers for disease control were prompted by an estimated 350 
percent increase in measles cases nationwide this year dr william 
atkinson an epidemiologist at the cdc in atlanta said wednesday 
cdc figures show that 7563 measles cases have been reported 
nationwide this year through july 9 compared to 1586 cases during 
the same period last year 
its the worst outbreak in nine years atkinson said 
measles hits most often in winter and most outbreaks wind down 
with the onslaught of midsummer heat he said 
its primarily innercity black and hispanic children who dont 
get into the healthcare system very easily who are affected 
atkinson said 
the disease characterized by a high fever cough and rash is 
extremely contagious and generally more severe in adults 
most children are routinely vaccinated when they are about 15 
months old but vaccines produced before 1980 are less resistant to 
heat and often less potent said dr martha lepow a member of the 
academys committee on infectious diseases 
the academy and the cdc both say immunization efforts should be 
aimed at schoolage children the group most affected by the current 
outbreaks 
the academy recommends children be given combined vaccinations 
for measles mumps and rubella or german measles at 15 months of 
age and again when they enter middle school or junior high 
the organization based in suburban elk grove village also 
recommends revaccination for anyone entering college adults in 
healthcare professions and adults 32 or younger who live in a 
region where theres an outbreak said ms lepow 
most people over 32 contracted measles during epidemics that hit 
the country before 1957 and are naturally immune atkinson said 
atkinson said the cdc supports the academys recommendations and 
will issue similar guidelines within the next few months 
the cdc believes that anyone 32 or younger who hasnt had measles 
roughly 100 million people should be revaccinated he said 
the academys policy also does not apply to anyone who has had 
measles said ms lepow a professor of pediatrics at albany medical 
college in albany ny 
in highrisk areas children should be vaccinated at 12 months of 
age the academy says those vaccinated before their first birthday 
should have a second vaccination at 15 months and a third upon 
entry to middle and junior high school 
children under 1 often dont respond to the vaccine ms lepow 
said 
the academy formerly recommended a single dose at age 15 months 
and did not have a revaccination policy for those school age and 
older except in the cases of outbreaks 
no unusual reactions have been associated with revaccination the 
academy said in a news release but noted that women should not be 
pregnant when receiving the vaccine or for three months afterwards 
about 60 outbreaks in 45 states have been reported this year 
atkinson said 
outbreaks are considered active in 18 states he said the cdc 
defines an outbreak as five or more cases believed to be linked in a 
specified area 
texas has been the hardest hit with 1800 cases reported so far 
in houston alone he said 
other states where outbreaks are considered active are alabama 
arizona california connecticut florida illinois kentucky 
michigan minnesota nebraska new jersey ohio oregon 
pennsylvania tennessee utah and wisconsin

contract negotiations between the united 
mine workers and the pittston co got off to a rocky start wednesday 
and the union accused the nations largest coal exporter of being 
inflexible 
umw president richard trumka said pittston refuses to negotiate 
in good faith and will not rescind what it calls its final offer 
which the union rejected last month 
they want us to be flexible but they dont want to be union 
spokesman joe corcoran said 
pittston coal group president michael odom said wednesday on 
cbs this morning that the company is standing by its previous 
contract proposal 
at this point the movement will have to come from the union 
odom said we have our proposal on the table 
we feel our proposal recognized the dynamics of the coal market 
we operate in we feel our proposal would put people back to 
work 
trumka said odoms appearance on the show put the union in a sour 
mood 
how can the mood be good when they get on tv and say how 
inflexible they are 
about 1900 umw miners are on strike at pittston operations in 
virginia west virginia and kentucky the virginia and west virginia 
miners went on strike in early april and the kentucky miners 
followed in june 
up to 46000 miners in 10 states had been off the job in sympathy 
with the pittston miners until monday when most returned to work at 
trumkas urging isolated pockets of striking wildcat miners remain 
most in west virginia 
wednesdays negotiations were conducted from separate rooms with 
federal mediators shuttling messages between them 
corcoran said one of the main sticking points is pittstons 
insistence on ending its contributions to the 1950 umw retirement 
fund which covers 130000 pensioners who retired between 1947 and 
1976 
pittston which has 560 retirees covered by the fund said it 
doesnt want to contribute to pensions received by retirees of other 
companies 
corcoran said the 1950 fund was established so miners who went 
from company to company when mines shut down could have pensions 
youre talking about guys who worked for eight or 10 different 
companies and when they retired they wouldnt have a pension 
because they didnt work for one company long enough corcoran 
said 
if pittston pulls out of the retirement fund he said other 
companies will want to do the same which would put the burden on 
the federal government

powers once concentrated in polands 
collective council of state on wednesday pass to the presidency a 
new post with a wide range of domestic and foreign policy duties 
the president is elected by the national assembly a joint 
meeting of the 460member sejm or parliament and the 100seat 
senate to be elected a candidate must receive a majority of the 
votes with at least half the national assembly present 
on wednesday communist leader gen wojciech jaruzelski was 
elected to the post 
the presidency is part of the historic deal reached in april 
between communist authorities and the opposition that legalized the 
independent solidarity trade union after a sevenyear ban in 
exchange for opposition support of partially free elections 
the unstated purpose of the new office is to guarantee a period 
of communist control while democratic political reforms and economic 
changes are under way 
the president the highest representative of the polish state is 
elected for a six years and can serve only one subsequent term any 
polish citizen who meets the requirements to be elected to the sejm 
may be a candidate for president but he need not be a member of the 
parliament 
the presidents duties previously were carried out by the council 
of state which was created in 1952 and will cease to exist 
the council of state included top members of the communist 
coalition led by a chairman who was sometimes referred to as 
president of the council however real power rested with the ruling 
politburo led by the first secretary of the communist party 
jaruzelski has headed the council of state since 1985 previous 
presidents of the council included henryk jablonski from 1972 to 
1985 and jozef cyrankiewicz from 1970 to 1972 
the new president will be the sixth in modern polish history 
which dates from 1918 when the country regained its independence 
although poland had an elected president before world war ii the 
real head of state during most of the interwar period was a man 
never elected to the post 
marshall jozef pilsudski proclaimed the polish state at the end 
of world war i and secured its independence by defeating the soviet 
army in 1920 wielding powers over defense and foreign policy 
similar to that of the new presidency 
pilsudski had the title of state leader until he retired from 
public life in 1922 he seized power again in a 1926 coup and held 
it until his death in 1935 for most of that time he held no formal 
title but was the countrys acknowledged strongman 
the first president gabriel narutowicz was assassinated after 
only one week in office in 1922 there were two more presidents 
until the start of world war ii in 1939 and one president of the 
london governmentinexile during the war 
the only president after world war ii was boleslaw bierut the 
prostalin communist chief he held the office from 1947 until 1952 
until the office was dropped from the constitution 
one of the presidents first tasks will be to nominate a new 
prime minister who will then be asked to form a government the sejm 
must approve the prime minister and his cabinet 
the president can veto legislation passed by the sejm but can be 
overriden by a twothirds majority of the parliament 
the president ratifies and cancels international agreements and 
is reponsible for defense in the warsaw pact nation 
he has the right to introduce martial law as required by a 
foreign threat to state security and he can proclaim a partial or 
universal mobilization of the armed forces for the same reason 
the president can also introduce a state of emergency as a result 
of an internal security threat to the country for a period of up to 
three months without consent of the national assembly the state of 
emergency can be extended by another three months with national 
assembly approval 
during the state of emergency the president cannot dissolve the 
sejm nor can constitutional or electoral changes be introduced 
the president does have the right to dissolve the national 
assembly and call new elections if the legislature fails to form a 
government or pass a national budget or if legislation is passed 
making it impossible for the president to perform his constitutional 
duties 
the president will sit in a large wooden chair that has been 
waiting in the balcony of the national assembly since members of the 
sejm and the senate were elected a month ago in polands freest 
voting for four decades

consumer prices rose a modest 02 percent in 
june the smallest advance since early last year the government 
said wednesday in a report that bolstered the view that inflationary 
pressures are beginning to ease 
the slowdown in the consumer price index reflected the fact that 
energy and food costs which had been shooting upward this year 
finally moderated last month energy costs actually fell while food 
prices edged up by the smallest amount in seven months 
even with the june price moderation consumer prices for the 
first six months of the year rose at an annual rate of 59 percent 
the sharpest increase for the first half of a year since 1982 
the bush administration hailed wednesdays report as very good 
news that the country is not headed for another inflationary 
spiral 
we remain confident in the ability of the economy to sustain 
its growth while controlling and ultimately reducing inflation 
michael j boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers told reporters at the white house 
many private economists were just as upbeat saying the inflation 
report could not have come at a better time for federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan who must testify before congress on 
thursday about the progress the central bank is making in 
controlling price pressures 
this is about as good as one could ask for on the inflation 
front right now particularly when you think back to six months aso 
when everyone was fearful that we had runaway inflation said 
david jones economist at aubrey g lanston amp co a government 
securities dealer in new york 
the report on consumer prices was the second good signal on 
inflation last friday the labor department said that wholesale 
prices actually fell in june their first decline in 18 months 
in another report wednesday the commerce department said that 
housing construction rebounded 7 percent in june the biggest 
onemonth increase in 16 months to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 140 million units 
analysts said the upturn in new homes and apartments reflected 
the hopes of builders that mortgage rates will be headed lower as 
the central bank turns its attention from fighting inflation to 
keeping the country out of a recession 
responding to widespread signs of an economic slowdown the fed 
has already made two small moves toward loosening credit conditions 
in the past seven weeks and analysts predicted further easing steps 
in the months ahead 
the cpi report suggests that there is no great acceleration in 
inflation going on said david wyss senior financial economist at 
drimcgraw hill an economic consulting firm i think we are going 
to see much better numbers on inflation in the second half of the 
year mainly because of improvement in food and energy prices 
at the beginning of the year energy costs shot up at an annual 
rate of 403 percent reflecting the worldwide runup in crude oil 
prices 
however energy prices at the consumer level actually fell by 1 
percent in june the biggest decline since a 19 percent drop in 
october 1986 another period when a rapid runup in petroleum costs 
was followed by a price rollback 
the cost of gasoline at the pump dropped by 1 percent while home 
heating oil natural gas and electricity costs were down as well 
last month 
food costs which had been climbing at the fastest pace since 
1980 slowed in june to just a 02 percent increase the smallest 
advance since last november 
after surging by 32 percent in may the cost of fruits and 
vegetables declined 1 percent in june prices of beef port and 
dairy products fell as well 
while food and energy costs played a major role in the inflation 
slowdown prices excluding these two categories also showed 
moderation increasing just 02 percent 
clothing costs fell 11 percent in june after increasing 23 
percent in the first five months of the year with the big decline 
coming from bigger than usual endofseason price markdowns 
especially in womens clothing 
medical costs rose 07 percent in june the biggest advance for 
any of the major categories with doctors costs hospital costs and 
prescription drug costs all rising sharply 
the various changes in june left the overall consumer price index 
at 1241 of its 198284 base that means that a hypothetical 
selection of goods costing 100 during the base period would have 
cost 12410 in june 
in a separate report today the labor department said americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation were 
unchanged in june after falling 14 percent in may

mayor marion barry said wednesday that he will 
sign a bill limiting outside income for top elected city officials 
but denied it is an attempt to discourage jesse jackson from 
entering the 1990 mayoral campaign 
i think its a good bill barry said it doesnt affect me 
i make enough money in this job 
the bill passed last week by the district of columbia council 
places a 10000 annual limit on honoraria for the mayor and the 13 
members of the council some council members opposed the bill 
pointing out that jackson earns much of his estimated 200000 
annual income from speeches and appearances barry earns 82500 per 
year 
the bill was sponsored by council member john ray a declared 
mayoral candidate council chairman david clarke who also is 
seeking the mayors office added an amendment placing a 10000 
yearly cap on book royalties for the mayor and council chairman 
barry denied that the bill was intended to discourage jackson 
from running and described it as ethics legislation the mayor could 
have vetoed the bill or allowed it to become law without his 
signature 
the mayor however sidestepped questions about whether he 
anticipates having to run against jackson and also refused to 
comment on whether he expects jackson to support his bid for an 
unprecedented fourth term 
god gave me a great brain im a smart politician barry 
said my timetable will not be decided by others 
barry also refused to talk about a meeting he had with jackson on 
tuesday at a downtown hotel jackson who has said he is not running 
for mayor but has declined to rule out an eventual run met with 
barry and walter fauntroy the districts nonvoting congressional 
delegate for about 90 minutes 
barry described the session as a prayer meeting fauntroy 
declined to comment on the meeting jackson was unavailable 
wednesday 
the meeting came just hours after jackson said he intended to 
move his legal residence to washington a step which would allow him 
to enter the mayors race

rejected supreme court nominee robert bork on 
wednesday urged congress to approve a constitutional amendment to 
overcome the courts ruling that protects flag burning 
the supreme courts 54 decision that flag burning is a 
mode of expression protected by the first amendments guarantee of 
the freedom o speech seems to me plainly wrong bork told the 
constitutional law subcommittee of the house judiciary committee 
borks testimony was no surprise to members of the panel but the 
remarks of former solicitor general charles fried caught them off 
guard 
fried had been expected to say that a new statute protecting the 
flag was possible but he told the subcommittee he now agrees with 
bork that only a constitutional amendment would do the job and he 
opposes both an amendment and a statute 
the subcommittee began hearings last week on how to address last 
months ruling which was quickly seized upon for denunciation by 
politicians of both parties 
president bush is pushing a constitutional amendment while many 
democratic leaders saying they fear harm to the bill of rights 
favor a carefully crafted statute to address the courts concerns 
bork a former federal judge now at a washington think tank said 
he saw little threat to constitutional freedoms 
putting out of bounds a few means of expression in no way 
threatens the american system of free speech he said 
bork said if his nomination by president reagan in 1987 had been 
approved the ruling would have gone the other way justice anthony 
m kennedy whose nomination was approved after bork was rejected by 
the senate voted with the court majority in the case 
now he argued congress should move swiftly to approve the 
constitutional amendment which would give congress and the states 
authority to prohibit physical desecration of the flag 
the court would recognize a statute as intellectually 
dishonest if it tried to ban flag burning and pretend that was not 
an attempt to stifle expression he said adding after several 
years of litigation we certainly would be right back where we are 
today 
fried was the reagan administrations chief advocate before the 
nations highest court and in that role he declined to enter the 
flagburning case 
he has said he might have sought to enter the case if the statute 
in question had been worded differently and he had been expected to 
tell the committee that a new statute could work but he changed his 
mind 
fried instead agreed with bork and the justice department that a 
constitutional amendment is the only way to overrule the court in 
this case the arguments against a statute were devastating he 
said 
whatever the technicalities the evident purpose of such a 
statute would still be to punish acts of expression he said 
however fried said he was dead against trying to overturn the 
court 
fried recalled how he fled czechoslovakia as a youngster and 
became an american citizen and told the panel that tolerance of 
acts like flagburning was what made america special 
america its traditions and values and its flag are important 
but foremost among those values is the principle that no one shall 
be punished for his political expressions no matter how offensive 
or bizarre he said 
that commitment to liberty is our first and greatest 
contribution to the history of mankind he said 
i hope and urge and pray that we will not act that no statute 
be passed and of course that the constitution not be amended in 
short i believe the johnson case is right not just as a matter of 
present constitutional law it is right in principle he said 
democrats whose strategy is to produce a statute in order to 
cool the fervor for an amendment told fried it was too late to hope 
for no action 
hope that congress would let the court ruling stand was dashed 
when president bush traveled to the iwo jima memorial to announce 
his support for the amendment said the subcommittee chairman rep 
don edwards dcalif the issue was taken away from us by the 
president of the united states he said 
but fried said that the games that are being played are so 
transparent the court is going to see right through them 
he told the lawmakers there are times when you can earn your 
rather inadequate salaries by just doing the right thing its 
called leadership

the bush administration has asked cuban 
authorities for the results of their investigation of drug smuggling 
into the united states by cuban military officers the state 
department said wednesday 
deputy spokesman richard boucher said the administration is 
interested in taking appropriate action based on whatever 
information cuban officials provide 
no response has been received from cuban authorities boucher 
said 
he acknowledged that there have been contacts recently between 
cuban and american officials but said that there have been no 
discussions on formal cooperation in combatting drug smuggling 
his statement was confirmed by clinton adlum a spokesman for 
cubas diplomatic mission here 
the state department has been wary about joint cooperation with 
cuba there is uncertainty among us officials as to whether the 
recent trials of military officers charged with drugrelated 
offenses is part of a broader campaign in cuba to halt use of that 
nations air space and territorial waters to ship illicit drugs to 
us markets 
some officials are concerned that the crackdown may be limited to 
a small group of traffickers and that other drug smuggling 
activities may be continuing with official acquiescence 
boucher said the united states is looking for a serious 
effort by cuba to end use of cuban territory for usbound drug 
shipments originating in colombia 
the united states wants cuba to prosecute people to 
investigate allegations of complicity in drug trafficking and to 
interdict trafficking through their air space and waters boucher 
said 
cuban president fidel castro called last week for cooperation 
between the united states and cuba to curb drug trafficking 
we need some way to communicate in this common battle castro 
said in a speech we need to talk to the americans about how to 
manage this situation 
he contended the united states had failed to warn him of cuban 
military involvement in cocaine trafficking saying the united 
states had at least two names of military officers involved in a 
cocainetrafficking conspiracy long before contacts in colombia 
alerted cuban officials 
last thursday one of castros trusted advisors army maj gen 
arnaldo ochoa sanchez and three other military officers were 
executed for smuggling tons of drugs into the united states 
previously cuba had denied us allegations that cuba was being 
used to smuggle cocaine and marijuana to the united states

i state that citizen wojciech jaruzelski has received the 
required number of votes and has been elected by the national 
assembly to be the president of the polish peoples republic 
parliament speaker mikolaj kozakiewicz said after the vote 
the post gives jaruzelski the communist party leader control of 
the military and foreign relations and allows him to nominate the 
next prime minister the office has a sixyear term 
politburo member marian orzechowski nominated jaruzelski earlier 
today saying no politician in poland would be met with universal 
approval but praising jaruzelski as an advocate of national 
reconciliation 
solidaritys parliamentary floor leader bronislaw geremek 
neither endorsed nor opposed the nomination but said opposition 
lawmakers could not forget jaruzelskis 1981 martiallaw decree that 
was directed against the union 
one by one lawmakers filed up to a wooden box at the front of 
the parliament chamber and deposited printed paper ballots with the 
options for against and abstain 
many held up ballots showing they were voting against jaruzelski 
i was and i am for lech walesa said senator gabriel janowski 
said as he deposited his ballot against jaruzelski 
the voting took nearly 1 hours votes were counted in the 
presence of the lawmakers 
as lawmakers gathered for the vote about 50 antijaruzelski 
demonstrators from the confederation for an independent poland 
rallied outside jaruzelski must go read one of their banners 
after a long and emotional debate tuesday it had been expected 
that most solidarity lawmakers would vote against jaruzelski who 
imprisoned many of them as he tried to crush their free trade union 
movement with martial law 
but some while not forgiving the general for past repression 
argued that defeating him could undermine reforms needed to reverse 
the countrys economic decline 
in addition to the solidarity opposition jaruzelski faced 
opposition in his own communist coalition where some members are 
openly sympathetic to solidarity 
opposition leaders said they did not offer a presidential 
candidate of their own because they believed that winning the 
presidency would be unrealistic and could court a backlash from 
communist hardliners 
in its editions today the opposition gazeta wyborcza said in an 
editorial that the countrys new president would be a guarantor of 
a stable course as poland enters a transition period leading to 
full democracy 
communistcontrolled newspapers announced in banner headlines the 
news that jaruzelski citing a sense of duty had reversed a 
june 30 decision eschewing the presidency and would run after all 
the communist leadership asked him to reconsider 
an announcement by solidarity leader lech walesa that he would 
cooperate with jaruzelski as president and words of praise from 
president bush during a visit last week also appeared to have helped 
persuade the general 
jaruzelski must deal with worsening food shortages and inflation 
now headed for annual rate of 160 percent 
the pressing economic problems have caused widespread discontent 
and were the impetus behind the ruling communists concessions to 
solidarity 
in april the free trade union movement was reinstated after a 
sevenyear ban and allowed to field candidates in june elections 
that were the countrys freest since the communists seized power 
four decades ago 
in parliament where solidarity won all but one of the seats it 
was allowed to contest the communist coalition has 300 of the 560 
seats 
in an apparent sign of growing discontent with climbing prices 
and worsening shortages 11000 bus and streetcar drivers went on 
strike tuesday in the populous southern province of katowice to 
demand higher wages

employer sanctions against hiring undocumented 
workers appear largely responsible for slowing the rate of illegal 
immigration across the mexican border according to a study released 
wednesday 
the study by researchers for the urban institute and princeton 
university said 71 percent of the decline in apprehensions along the 
usmexico border appears due to the deterrent effect of the 
1986 immigration reform and control act 
frank bean of the urban institute and one of the studys authors 
said the sanctions against employers who hire undocumented workers 
are the only real deterrent in the law so it is not unrealistic 
to think that most of the deterrent effect is due to sanctions if 
not all 
dan stein executive director of the federation for american 
immigration reform said the study provides the first major 
empirical evidence that sanctions are effective 
it shows that many people who dont have unbridled motivation 
to get around the law are discouraged from coming it is a 
ratification of what we have been saying all along stein said 
using a statistical model the study said the control act is 
associated with a cumulative net reduction in apprehensions of 
nearly 700000 people or 35 percent below what would have been 
anticipated if circumstances had not changed in the 23month period 
following the laws enactment in november 1986 
apprensions are considered the best available indicator of the 
flow of illegal immigration across the southern border 
about 12 percent of the decline is due to changes in the 
immigration and naturalization services efforts another 17 percent 
is due to the laws agricultural legalization program and the 
remaining 71 percent is due to the deterrent effect the study 
said 
in addition to the sanctions the laws major features include 
legalization programs for which more than 3 million undocumented 
immigrants applied and stepped up enforcement at the southern 
border 
ins spokesman verne jervis said the study supports our 
contention that irca is effective in reducing the flow of illegal 
aliens across the southern border we think sanctions are a major 
factor in the sharp decline in apprehensions and illegal border 
crossings 
but rep albert bustamante a texas democrat whose district 
includes a stretch of border from laredo to del rio said he does 
not believe the flow of illegal immigration is down

defense secretary dick cheney praised south 
koreas decision to purchase us fighter jets on wednesday but 
indicated the sensitive topic of coproduction of the sophisticated 
fighters hasnt been resolved 
cheney met with reporters after completing the annual series of 
talks with his south korean counterpart lee sang hoon 
i would like to get the best deal that we can cheney said 
when asked about the issue 
the subject of coproduction still eagerly sought by the south 
koreans has raised concern among some lawmakers on capitol hill who 
are worried about the transfer of sensitive technology with a nation 
eager to build its own aviation industry 
lee told reporters south korea intends to purchase us fighters 
but had not yet decided which type 
asked about a possible coproduction plan cheney said he had 
advised his counterpart to purchase us produced fighters 
he added however that it is in the us interest to see that 
the republic of korea has necessary equipment to upgrade its air 
defenses and that the two sides have been discussing the best 
method by which that can be accomplished 
cheney said the two sides have been exploring other 
possiblities and other options and that no final decision has been 
made 
what is likely to result will probably be some blend cheney 
said adding that he was pleased the koreans had decided to purchase 
us planes over those of other nations 
the us secretary also reassured his south korean counterpart 
that the united states has no immediate plans to cut us troop 
strength on the korean peninsula 
lee and the us secretary said their talks had been fruitful 
and they issued a joint statement in which both sides pledged to 
maintain the close and longstanding security relationship between 
the two countries 
the south koreans have expressed interest in either the f16 
made by general dynamics corp or the f18 made by mcdonnell 
douglas corp 
the south koreans reportedly seek to buy a dozen of the planes 
assemble three dozen more from ussupplied kits and then build 
about 72 on their own 
sens john heinz rpa and alan dixon dill have called the 
proposed deal a threat contending it would transfer critical us 
technology to a nation that will use it to develop its own aviation 
industry to compete with us firms 
lawmakers made the same argument last month as they approved a 
plan to coproduce the fsx fighter with japan but placed 
restrictions on negotiations for further stages in the project 
president bush has threatened to veto the resolution 
cheney has come under pressure from some members of congress to 
slash us troop strength in south korea given that nations 
prosperous economic condition 
the secretary has refused to make any changes in the us 
position this budget year but has not ruled out looking at such a 
proposal in the future 
the united states spends 26 billion a year on troops in south 
korea 
cheney assured his korean counterpart that us troops will 
remain in korea as long as they are needed to meet the threat and as 
long as the government and the peoples of the republic of korea want 
them there 
in response to the congressional demands pentagon officials have 
begun to consider possible plans for a reduction in about 43000 
us troops on the korean peninsula but the proposals are only in 
preliminary stages officials have said

the government on wednesday proposed 
legislation that would outlaw surrogate motherhood and genetic 
engineering and impose restrictions on artificial insemination of 
lesbians and single women 
west germany has strict limits on abortion that are being 
challenged by the increasingly leftleaning populace 
justice minister hans engelhard who introduced the embryo 
protection law at wednesdays cabinet session told reporters it 
aims to prevent the misuse of modern technology in particular 
human engineering 
engelhard said the embryo protection law would make west germany 
the first nation to forbid alteration of the human embryo 
not everything that is technically feasible should in fact come 
to pass he said 
naziera attempts at human engineering left an indelible imprint 
on many germans who remain strongly opposed to scientific 
manipulation in reproduction 
engelhard called the practice of human engineering or scientific 
selection of sex physical features and other manipulations of the 
embryo a nightmare 
while some scientific interference in embryo development could be 
beneficial man should not be the last victim of modern 
technology the minister stated 
referring to surrogate motherhood engelhard said the concept of 
intentionally producing children for rearing by others contradicts 
the 1949 basic law governing west german society 
the bill also seeks to prohibit use of public funds for 
artificial insemination of single women or homosexuals which would 
likely force any seeking to bear a child to turn abroad for 
assistance 
the bill as approved by chancellor helmut kohls threeparty 
coalition was scaled back from a more restrictive proposal by the 
conservative christian social union which sought a ban on 
artificial insemination except between married heterosexuals 
engelhard a member of the liberal free democratic party but a 
conservative on reproductive issues said the law was expected to 
win parliamentary endorsement 
the opposition social democratic party and the farleft greens 
said the proposal was inadequate 
renate schmidt of the social democrats complained that it focused 
on limiting reproductive assistance to heterosexuals while leaving 
the door wide open to other forms of population manipulation 
she pointed out that nothing under the proposed bill would deter 
people from selecting sperm donors on the basis of desirable 
physical attributes like skin eye and hair color 
greens parliamentarian marieluise schmidt described the proposal 
as piecemeal and said her party stood for full renunciation of 
reproductive technology and embryo research

in a tart exchange that tested the limits of 
senatorial courtesy democratic leader george mitchell accused 
republican sen jesse helms on wednesday of trying to stall 
consideration of a 46 billion state department authorization bill 
mitchell was trying to get the senate moving on more than a 
hundred amendments to the bill when helms the floor manager of the 
bill stood up to ask for additional time for more to be submitted 
helms at first protested that mitchell was trying to curb the 
amount of time being given to debate on the bill but when the maine 
democrat said the north carolina republican had read him wrong 
helms amended his complaint to say he was worried about mitchell 
seeking to limit amendments 
helms the ranking republican member of the senate foreign 
relations committee long has been known for exploiting the senate 
rules to promote his conservative foreign policy aims including 
delaying tactics and the adroit use of amendments 
mitchell said i dont want to delay this bill any further 
this is already in the fourth day 
helms well mr majority leader i say this as your friend and 
one who wants to cooperate with you but dont ignore the fact that 
it was you who scheduled the first day of consideration of this bill 
on a friday and it was you who declared that there would be no 
vote telling senators go go bye bye stay home 
mitchell theres no reason why senators cant be present to 
submit amendments if theyre serious about doing so 
helms does the majority leader give any assurance that no 
attempt will be made to add the foreign aid bill to this 
authorization bill for the state department does the majority 
leader contemplate linking them together and making them one bill 
mitchell no i do not 
helms i can be assured that thats not going to happen 
mitchell if i can get cooperation to get this bill passed the 
presidents bill then i will be pleased to discuss that with the 
senator but what the senator is asking is that he have unlimited 
right to delay this legislation for as long as he wants and also 
extract from me a commitment that i will not present another bill 
that he doesnt want in others heads the senator wins tails i 
lose thats what the senator is suggesting 
helms sounds like a good proposition to me i regret that 
he has implied that i am delaying this bill i dont think the 
senator could document that its not so 
mitchell the senator is the republican manager of the bill 
i announced last night that we were going to go to this bill at 915 
this morning 
helms right 
mitchell managers of the bill have the responsibility in the 
senate to be present when the bill is to be presented we had a 
30minute delay this morning because the senator didnt show up 
on time 
helms you told me last night you were going to have a morning 
other business period 
mitchell i specifically announced it 
this is the presidents bill this is the administrations 
bill im doing my best to accommodate the president and what i 
find over and over and over again is that i am struggling to advance 
the presidents interests when members of the presidents party are 
opposing the presidents interests

supporters of salman rushdie said wednesday that 
the author who is under an iranian death threat for writing a novel 
many moslems consider blasphemous believes reconciliation with his 
opponents is possible 
the indianborn british novelist author of the satanic 
verses said many moslems had written him letters of support since 
he was forced into hiding in february said the international 
committee for the defense of salman rushdie and his publishers 
before he died last month irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
called on moslems to kill rushdie whose novel was first published 
in english last year two iranian clerics supported the edict by 
offering a 52 million bounty 
angry moslems have demonstrated against the book in many cities 
around the world including several in england 
the defense committee set up to organize protests by freespeech 
groups said it collected signatures on a petition of support from 
2500 writers and about 10000 readers in 67 countries 
the names were listed in an 82page booklet which called on iran 
to lift the death threat against rushdie 
the committees chairman kevin boyle told a news conference 
that rushdie said in a telephone call that it was assumed there was 
an unbridgeable gap between his version of islam and that of 
moslems who accuse him of blaspheming islam 
according to boyle rushdie said the declarations of support 
emphasized that in fact there is no such unbridgeable gulf that 
he does write from the islamic tradition 
it is his hope that the recognition by those who have written 
to him and those who have signed this petition will be part of 
a process of mutual understanding within islam leading to 
reconciliation boyle said 
in belgium the french version of the satanic verses went on 
sale wednesday and news reports said the few copies available were 
quickly sold 
in brussels most bookstores put the novel on sale on their back 
shelves and others did not sell it 
the novel includes a scene in which prostitutes take the name of 
the prophet mohammeds wives and it suggests mohammed wrote the 
holy koran instead of receiving it from allah

africans next president fw de klerk 
the president of mozambique expressed optimism about de klerks 
commitment to end apartheid quickly after taking power 
de klerk says he plans to negotiate a constitution providing a 
national vote for south africas black majority within five years 
i was pleased to hear that the commitment is to work to achieve 
this goal as quickly as possible chissano said especially

and if there is a sound process of change in south africa i think 
that south africa will be part of that group of countries he said

washington for the first time in more than 30 years

the senate rejected a resolution wednesday 
seeking to limit the number of political appointees president bush 
could send as ambassadors to the nations embassies 
the vote rejecting the senate resolution was 61 to 38 it would 
have set the limit to 30 percent 
the vote came after democratic members of the senate foreign 
relations committee voiced complaints that up to two thirds of the 
ambassadorial appointments made in the first six months of the bush 
administration have been political supporters of the president not 
professional diplomats 
that percentage if continued would reverse the typical average 
in the last several presidential administrations senators said 
the amendment offered by sen al gore dtenn to a pending 
bill authorizing 46 billion in spending for the state department 
and allied agencies represented a fallback position 
the senate on tuesday soundly defeated 7920 his attempt to 
impose a mandatory 15 percent ceiling on the number of political 
nominations to diplomatic posts 
gore said many of his colleagues had found that too severe 
but he said the situation needs to be addressed 
all of us in both parties are really uneasy and embarrassed 
gore said 
it is not just a question of the occasional candidate whose 
credentials are grossly inadequate he said it is our 
realization that the well being of our country really does depend 
more on the astuteness of our diplomats than at any time since the 
very earliest days of the republic 
earlier the senate foreign relations committee examined the 
qualifications of a number of ambassadorial candidates including 
wealthy republican contributor joseph b gildenhorn and former child 
actress and ambassador shirley temple black 
gildenhorn a washington lawyer and real estate investor with 
banking interests has been nominated to be us ambassador to 
switzerland from 1984 to early this year he and members of his 
immediate family contributed nearly 230000 to republican campaigns 
and causes 
the nominee told the committee that he believed the american 
academy of diplomacy an organization composed of 100 distinguished 
former diplomats including all former secretaries of state treated 
him unfairly when it rated him as unqualified for the job 
i consider myself qualified in all of my endeavors 
gildenhorn said ticking off a series of accomplishments including 
his graduation with honors from the yale university law school 
im proud of my accomplishments and im pleased that i have 
achieved financial success over the years gildenhorn said im 
honored that the president thinks im qualified i feel confident 
that i am ready to do an able and competent job as ambassador to 
switezerland 
sen joesh r biden jr ddel told gildenhorn that there is 
rising concern about the number of major gop fundraisers and 
contributors being named ambassadors 
given bushs background as a diplomat with service as us envoy 
to china and united nations ambassador it has come as somewhat of 
a surprise biden said 
under questioning gildenhorn said he plans to study french one 
of the major languages of switzerland depending on what my time 
schedule is 
but he said that while he does not now speak french or german or 
italian i would not be adversely effected because english is used 
universally 
mrs black previously served as us ambassador to ghana and has 
held a large number of positions including posts at the united 
nations 
sen paul sarbanes dmd told her that in contrast to some of 
the bush nominees she has established a substantial and impressive 
record and is qualified for the position to which she has been named 
even in 1974 when she was first nominated as an ambassador 
sarbanes said i thought you brought a record of consequence and 
had demonstrated that you were a serious person

pilot thomas roots head turned toward 
military chase planes during the time he claimed he was unconscious 
and his small plane flew 800 miles on autopilot an investigator 
said wednesday 
authorities also ruled out carbon monoxide poisoning based on a 
blood test as an explanation for his claimed loss of consciousness 
results of drug and alcohol tests are expected later this week 
root continued to stick to his story that he passed out during a 
routine business trip after putting his singleengine cessna on 
autopilot he said he revived when the plane ran out of gas and 
ditched in the sea near the bahamas where he was rescued doctors 
later found he had been shot in the abdomen 
andrew alston an air safety investigator with the national 
transportation safety board interviewed the 36yearold washington 
communications attorney again wednesday at hollywoods memorial 
hospital where he remains in stable condition 
alston who first interviewed root on saturday two days after 
his crash and rescue said at a news conference that he confronted 
root with inconsistencies in his story but root had nothing 
substantially different to say in response 
roots family didnt respond to associated press requests for 
interviews 
alston said inconsistencies include roots failure to remember 
the gunshot the movement of his head toward military planes sent to 
intercept and follow him and movement of his windshield sun visor 
various pilots reported that as he was intercepted from the 
right his head would turn to the right and as he was intercepted 
from the left his head would move to the left alston said the 
sun visor moved position at least three times during the flight 
he declined to interpret the inconsistencies 
he was there you werent i wasnt said alston 
he said root remained calm and collected during their interview 
alston wouldnt say if root could face charges for misleading 
investigators 
fbi spokesman paul miller said that agencys investigation is 
continuing 
we anticipate that once all our facts are developed we will 
again discuss the matter with the us attorneys office in miami 
miller said 
he said one statute being considered in the investigation 
concerns destruction of aircraft and motor vehicles 
published reports say root was under watch for possible drug 
links and questionable flights 
roots plane sank in water about a mile deep miller said a 
decision on whether the plane should be raised for evidence probably 
would be made in washington 
root has insisted his 32caliber smith amp wesson revolver must 
have fired when his cessna hit the water dick bachmann vice 
president of smith amp wesson said the guns safety features make 
such accidental firings impossible 
and hollywood police chief richard witt told the ap there was 
proof that roots bullet wound was at least four hours old when he 
arrived at the hospital 
witts statement supported the findings of coast guard surgeon 
james rahman who has said that peritonitis inflammation of lining 
of the abdominal cavity showed root must have been shot at least 
two hours before he was rescued root was picked up almost 
immediately after his plane went down 
in other developments reports surfaced that two days before 
roots flight a federal task force began investigating him on 
suspicion of running guns and drugs 
the investigation was prompted by discovery of 35 guns and five 
gallons of ether a chemical that can be used to process cocaine 
during an april 24 search of roots airplane hangar at manassas 
va said emile manara an agent working for the task force 
roots family has said root collected guns but moved them out of 
his home to keep them away from small children and that the ether 
a powerful solvent was intended for cleaning the plane 
the hangar search also turned up chemical lighting sticks which 
smugglers often attach to drug loads tossed out of airplanes said 
bill kelmartin a prince william county va police investigator 
assigned to the task force 
kelmartin said root claimed he kept the sticks in the airplane 
for light in case of an electrical problem 
a lawsuit filed july 3 in federal court in macon ga accused 
root of legal malpractice breach of contract and fraud in handling 
a 75000 transaction for a client

the treasury department pleaded with congress 
on wednesday to raise the national debt ceiling and announced its 
first step to avoid exceeding the limit if congress fails to act 
before its august recess 
our immediate need is for legislation to increase the debt 
limit treasury undersecretary robert r glauber told a senate 
finance subcommittee without the extension he said the government 
would have problems issuing payroll and social security checks 
glauber echoed treasury secretary nicholas f brady who wrote 
senate leaders last month urging an increase of the debt ceiling by 
300 billion from the current limit of 28 trillion the house has 
passed similar legislation 
meanwhile in its first action to insure that the debt limit is 
not exceeded the department announced it is suspending until 
further notice the sale of special securities for state and local 
governments 
the government has been forced to suspend such sales at other 
times when congress was unable to agree on legislation raising the 
national debt limit 
state and local governments buy the special treasury securities 
as a temporary investment vehicle for money they raise in the bond 
market 
if the securities are not available for purchase state and local 
governments could be forced to cancel planned bond sales leading to 
turmoil in the municipal bond market 
glauber warned the finance subcommittee of other effects of 
congressional inaction on the debt limit increase 
without an increase in the debt limit by aug 1 full 
investment of the social security trust funds may not be possible 
he said 
the law requires the treasury secretary to invest trust fund 
assests in interestbearing government securities the securities 
are a form of government debt and are counted with other government 
bonds and notes against the debt limit 
while congress normally appropriates the money to cover any 
interest lost to the trust funds during a period when they cannot be 
invested this action has been criticized by groups representing the 
elderly 
glauber also said that if congress did not take action before 
its monthlong recess beginning aug 5 the treasury would not be 
able to make the government payroll for september 
this would include writing payroll and pension checks exceeding 
23 billion 
glauber also proposed changing the method of measuring debt on 
government securities from the current face amount to one based 
on the actual value of the security at a particular time 
for instance some treasury securities worth 10000 are sold at 
a discount accruing interest over time until they are worth their 
face value at maturity

consulate when 25 armed police appeared and ordered her and four 
other relatives and friends to leave 
police who said the group had not obtained a permit for the 
sitin chased away onlookers and journalists 
us embassy spokeswoman susan clyde said the embassy asked for 
police protection not knowing what sort of demonstration the 
sitin could develop into 
mrs biamby began a hunger strike monday to protest the detention 
by us immigration authorities of her son and two other former 
haitian officers lt col leonce qualo and col himmler rebu 
the three hospitalized in a medical unit of the metropolitan

if president bush in his apollo anniversary 
speech on thursday hands nasa the job of sending americans back to 
the moon and on to mars congress will first have to provide the 
billions to rebuild a muchweakened space agency 
todays nasa cant do it said the agencys administrator 
richard truly last week 
since the heyday of apollo which put 12 americans on the moon in 
the late 1960s and the early 1970s nasas work force has shrunk by 
14000 from 36000 the managers of apollo are retiring or have 
gone in recent months many of the top officials have resigned 
the space agencys contractor force which builds the 
sophisticated equipment needed for such a venture also is down from 
a peak of 400000 in the apollo days to slightly more than 100000 
today 
for any of the goals the president is likely to set a space 
station is a bottom line necessity and there has been considerable 
opposition in congress for spending the 30 billion that alone will 
require 
during apollo the nation spent between 4 percent and 5 percent of 
its federal budget on space bush has asked congress for 133 
billion next year about 1 percent of the 116 trillion for 1990 
to do these kinds of programs the nasa budget would have to 
increase by a factor of two at the minimum and possibly a little 
higher said frank martin head of the nasa office of exploration 
he estimated space spending would quickly climb to 30 billion a 
year to land men on mars in 2020 
martins office outlined four potential manned expeditions late 
last year two of them involving moon bases one establishing a mars 
outpost and the other a base on the martian moon phobos 
one of the moon bases would not be permanently staffed serving 
chiefly as an astronomy laboratory where telescopes free of 
earths atmosphere could study the most distant galaxies and 
search for life the base would be serviced by visiting astronauts 
every every three years 
the second base on the front side of the moon would be manned 
permanently 
many astronaut crews would be required to construct an 
antarctictype facility using lunar soil that is rich in metals and 
silicon which could be mixed with water to form a kind of cement 
oxygen which can be extracted from rocks on the moon could be 
mixed with hydrogen brought from earth to provide water and also 
supply rocket fuel for mars or other space expeditions 
nasa has studied two approaches for exploring mars one using 
humans the other a robot capable of moving around the surface a 
combination of those two would place astronauts on phobos to guide 
the rover on mars 
an expedition to phobos would establish early leadership by 
sending the first human travelers to the martian moon to explore 
conduct resource surveys and establish a science station said the 
exploration office in an annual report

former housing secretary samuel pierce jr will 
testify at least twice more to a congressional panel investigating 
allegations of mismanagement and favoritism in the agency he headed 
for eight years the subcommittees chairman said wednesday 
pierces earlier testimony that he was not involved in many of 
the projectfunding decisions at the department of housing and urban 
development has been called into question by later witnesses 
subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif said staff members 
for the panel met with pierce wednesday 
there was no discussion with respect to the substance of his 
statements lantos said that would have been inappropriate 
pierce will testify aug 3 before the house government operations 
subcommittee on housing and employment and will come back at least 
once and perhaps twice more after labor day lantos said 
at the august hearing pierce will be asked about his possible 
role in approving funding for a project in durham nc that 
converted a defunct hosiery mill into housing for the elderly 
hud staff members recommended strongly that the project should 
not receive 15 million in government money saying the project was 
too expensive was located atop a toxic waste site and was too close 
to railroad tracks 
last week shirley mcvay wiseman former assistant secretary for 
housing at hud testified under oath that pierce himself ordered her 
to approve money for the project 
i want the project funded wiseman quoted pierce as saying 
that project was being pushed by a former law partner of pierce 
pierce met wednesday with stuart weisberg staff counsel for the 
subcommittee who eluded reporters waiting outside his office in 
anticipation of the meeting 
lantos who called the meeting private refused to say how many 
other people met with pierce or whether it was held outside the 
capitol complex 
i will not tell you where it was held lantos said it was 
a relaxed lengthy cordial and productive meeting 
the subcommittee has been examining allegations of influence 
peddling at hud in which wellconnected republicans obtained scarce 
funds to fix up housing projects either they or their clients were 
developing in one case former interior secretary james watt was 
paid more than 300000 to help a developer obtain funds to fix up a 
300apartment housing project 
in addition the subcommittee has investigated huds practice of 
using private agents to finalize the sale of foreclosed property 
owned by the department in at least a dozen cases these closing 
agents failed to hand over money from the sales to hud resulting in 
a loss estimated at 20 million 
lantos said he expects the hearings to continue through the fall 
and will move into other areas of hud but the panel will not try to 
investigate everything about the department 
were sort of viewing this as a whitman sampler a box of 
chocolate candy lantos said we wont go after each piece of 
chocolate 
while the inquiry eventually will end it will not reach a tidy 
conclusion he said 
the hud crisis is an ocean without a shore lantos said we 
will not reach the shore because there isnt one 
a republican member of the committee said members were not 
interested in trying to get someone to perjure themselves but 
needed to hear from pierce to resolve conflicts between his earlier 
testimony and the accounts of subsequent witnessses 
he was very adamant in saying never that he was never 
involved said rep christopher shays rconn he have a 
conflict that we need to resolve we just really want the truth on 
what he did

william c lucas nominated as the nations 
chief civil rights enforcer on wednesday defended both his 
commitment to the drive against discrimination and his actions when 
customs inspectors found 8800 worth of undeclared goods in his 
luggage 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio querying lucas about the 1985 
incident with the customs service asked how do you explain 
concealing receipts and merchandise from the customs inspectors 
lucas said the violation involved jewelry carried in a cosmetics 
case by an unidentified member of his family 
he said he had not been aware of all the purchases his wife and 
daughters had made during their trip to japan and south korea their 
declaration to customs inspectors in seattle he said was for 
merchandise worth 4800 
lucas was told by the committee chairman sen joseph biden 
ddel that his nomination to head the justice departments civil 
rights division has been contentious and will be contested 
one democratic senator said he wanted lucas called back to answer 
other questions but a republican predicted lucas would be swiftly 
confirmed by the senate 
the black former sheriff and county executive fielded repeated 
questions about his runin with customs inspectors 
metzenbaum quoted a customs service report as saying that the 
lucas family had initially said they had no receipts but that a 
search revealed there were receipts the senator said customs 
officials reported lucas repeatedly told them that the luggage 
contained sweatshirts 
lucas also told the committee that his family were inexperienced 
travelers and had been unclear about how to report the goods 
metzenbaum said the customs service described lucas as an 
experienced traveler 
metzenbaum asked why lucas had failed to disclose on a committee 
questionnaire that he had once been investigated for violating 
customs regulations for which he was fined the senator did not say 
how much lucas had been fined for trying to conceal undeclared 
merchandise 
lucas said there had been no investigation 
you didnt think when they went through your pockets and the 
pockets of your family that that wasnt an investigation 
metzenbaum asked 
i wasnt searched nor did i consider that an investigation 
lucas responded 
he was also questioned about his commitment to enforcing civil 
rights laws 
if a case is brought to me involving a cross burning on the 
lawn of a citizen believe me this is not just cold facts to me 
the 61yearold former wayne county mich official told the 
committee 
i have been there i have smelled the smoke i have smelled the 
fear 
he did not elaborate 
several senators said they were not certain that lucas was the 
right man to champion the civil rights cause 
lucas was repeatedly asked his opinions of several supreme court 
decisions this year that have inflamed the civil rights community 
its leaders say the rulings will make it increasingly difficult for 
minorities to make headway in the areas of job discrimination sex 
bias in the workplace and minority setasides in public contracts 
lucas declined to criticize the court in a number of instances in 
which senators gave him an opportunity to do so instead he said he 
would monitor the effect of the rulings and promised to push for 
legislation if problems arise 
frankly what i think you are saying is well make a study of 
it and if it doesnt work out propose legislation said 
metzenbaum adding but time has a way of slipping by 
lucas reception split largely along party lines 
he will be a moderator a conciliator a unifier said orrin 
hatch rutah while sen charles grassley riowa described lucas 
as a monument to what can be achieved without regard to race or 
color 
hatch predicted that lucas would be confirmed with little delay 
and told the nominee 
i happen to believe that you will make one of the greatest 
attorneys general of the united states in charge of the civil rights 
division or any other division if you were given the chance and the 
opportunity 
but sen edward m kennedy dmass told lawmakers there were 
a number of serious questions that need to be answered and sen 
paul simon dill after questioning lucas said he still had 
doubts about the nominees commitment 
after lucas finished more than three hours of testimony one 
senator said he still had enough questions about the nominees past 
that he wanted lucas called back to the stand 
sen howell heflin dala told a reporter there are a lot of 
charges against him we need to get to the bottom of them 
heflin asked if he wanted to question lucas further about 
misstatements he made on a 1981 application to join the new york 
bar replied 
i aint got to the bottom of it yet 
lucas critics hammered at his relative lack of experience within 
the civil rights field but his supporters scoffed at that 
the bush administration has acknowledged that lucas has never 
taken part in a trial or handled an appeal but has sought to stress 
his talents as a manager nevertheless giggling swept over the 
hearing room when during an exchange with sen arlen specter 
rpa the nominee declined to argue a legal point saying i am 
new to the law 
lucas received his law degeee in 1962

attackers threw grenades into a crowd 
of sinhalese and tamil worshipers at a ceremony meant to promote 
ethnic peace killing 13 people and wounding 85 authorities said 
a police official said three grenades were hurled at the 
gathering tuesday night in kataragama a town about 100 miles 
southeast of colombo 
no one claimed responsibility for the attack 
united news of india said a sri lankan tamil politician escaped 
assassination wednesday but 13 people were injured when a grenade 
thrown at his car missed and struck another vehicle 
vardaraja perumal a moderate tamil leader and chief minister of 
northeastern province was traveling in a motorcade in jaffna when 
the grenade was thrown the agency said the report could not be 
confirmed in sri lanka 
about 5000 people had assembled in kataragama for a procession 
ending a weeklong religious festival that attracts both sinhalese 
buddhists and tamil hindus the police official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the annual ceremony is viewed as a demonstration that tamils and 
majority sinhalese can live together in peace and harmony tamils 
are waging war for an independent homeland prompting a backlash 
among sinhalese militants 
it is a tragedy beyond comparison said ranjith madumma 
bandara a government lawmaker who participated in the procession 
from a hindu temple to a buddhist shrine 
there is nothing sacred in this country anymore he added 
hours after the explosions the government warned people to be 
vigilant in crowded places such as bus and train stations 
the subversives are prepared to place explosives and detonate 
them by electrical or other means to cause death and destruction of 
innocent civilians it said without identifying the subversives 
bandara a sinhalese buddhist said two women walking beside him 
were killed but he escaped injury another women and three children 
were also killed 
among the injure was dharamadasa banda minister of state for 
rehabilitation and religious chief for the two shrines said bandara 
in madras india a sri lankan tamil party blamed the attack on 
sinhalese militants from the leftwing peoples liberation front 
ponnudurai ravinesan spokesman for the eelam peoples revolutionary 
liberation front said he had information from sri lanka that the 
grenades were thrown by radicals of the front 
the front has often attacked fellow sinhalese since it launched 
an uprising in 1987 to overthrow president ranasinghe premadasas 
government it accuses the sinhalesedominated government of selling 
out its own people in efforts to make peace with tamil rebels 
about 14000 people have been killed on this island nation off 
southern india since the strife began tamil militants launched 
their war for a independent homeland in 1983 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and claim 
they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who make up 75 
percent of the population 
the government imposed censorship july 6 amid escalating violence 
and a political dispute with india over withdrawal its peacekeeping 
forces 
premadasa has demanded india withdraw its estimated 40000 
soldiers by the end of july indian prime minister rajiv gandhi 
rejected the request saying a premature pullout would lead to more 
bloodshed 
indian troops were dispatched to sri lanka on july 30 1987 to 
supervise a peace pact designed to give tamils some autonomy in the 
north and the east the most militant tamil guerrilla group ignored 
the accord and started attacking indian soldiers sri lankan 
security forces and civilians 
india became involved in its neighbors problems because of 
sympathies of its own 60 million tamils for the rebel cause

a quebec woman seeking an abortion asked an 
appellate court wednesday to overturn an injunction obtained by her 
former boyfriend in the third such case this month in canada 
the cases have increased pressure on the government to come up 
with a new abortion law canada has been without legislation since 
early 1988 when the supreme court threw out the existing law 
saying the cumbersome procedure required for an abortion infringed 
on womens rights 
the toronto star on wednesday quoted justice minister doug lewis 
as saying the government will tackle the abortion issue this fall 
but will not necessarily come up with a new law 
in quebec 21yearold chantal daigle turned to a threejudge 
appeals panel after superior court judge jacques viens monday 
granted an injunction sought by her former boyfriend jeanguy 
tremblay 25 
ms daigle is 20 weeks pregnant she could seek an abortion 
outside of quebec but could face a twoyear prison sentence and a 
fine if the injunction stands 
last week in toronto the ontario supreme court threw out an 
injunction that was preventing barbara dodd 22 from having an 
abortion 
she went ahead with the operation immediately but on tuesday she 
appeared publicly with greg murphy 23 who had sought the 
injunction and she accused abortion rights groups of encouraging 
her to have the operation 
i think the fetus should have the right to life said ms 
dodd 
she said prochoice activists whom she did not name used me 
to promote their cause 
i was under control by those people ms dodd said as murphy 
sat beside her at the news conference i was never given a moment 
to myself to think about what i was doing 
cherie macdonald spokeswoman for the ontario coalition for 
abortion clinics said her organization had not pressured ms dodd 
to go through with the procedure 
its absolutely false she said she is a very confused 
young woman 
a woman in winnipeg manitoba went ahead with an abortion 
earlier in july after her former boyfriend failed to obtain an 
injunction 
the house of commons has been reluctant to act on the 
controversial issue the federal government placed six options on 
abortion before the house of commons in july 1988 none received a 
majority 
in a column wednesday in the globe and mail newspaper lawyer 
jacques jm shore wrote that many canadians are disappointed and 
angered by the federal governments continued laissezfaire 
attitude toward abortion 
it is becoming more obvious each day that canada cannot remain 
unique in the western world as a nation with no legal boundaries 
concerning the willful termination of pregnancy he wrote at 
least until a new law is passed canadians can expect that 
additional names will be added to the growing list of women who 
are required to battle in court before being allowed to undergo an 
abortion

like a cat with nine political lives rep gus 
savage has survived gaffes that might have ended many political 
careers 
he has been slammed by political challengers for absenteeism in 
congress and globetrotting appearances for questionable causes 
accused by government agencies of failing to disclose sources of 
funds and investigated for personnel practices 
but the latest crisis allegations of sexual misconduct raised 
by a 28yearold peace corps volunteer could be the most 
explosive in an article wednesday in the washington post the woman 
accused the 63yearold congressman of repeatedly fondling her in 
the back of a chauffeurdriven embassy car while he was visiting 
zaire in march 
savage frequently counters criticism by labeling it racially 
motivated and none of his past problems have affected his 
popularity in the 2nd district a predominantly black area that 
contains some of the nations most impoverished neighborhoods 
last november he was reelected with 83 percent of the vote 
having earlier topped a fiveway democratic primary by getting more 
votes than his four challengers combined 
when asked about the alleged sexual misconduct savage told a 
reporter from the washington post i dont want to talk about 
that ask me the same kind of questions you ask white 
congressmen 
savage gained prominence in chicago political circles first as a 
civilrights organizer and later as publisher of a chain of 
community newspapers 
he made unsuccessful tries for the democratic congressional 
nomination in 1968 and 1970 losing to candidates backed by the 
powerful democratic machine controlled by thenmayor richard j 
daley 
when the white incumbent retired in 1980 voters in the 2nd 
district on chicagos south side chose savage over the machines 
handpicked black candidate 
the the chicago suntimes found he finished his first year in 
office having participated in only 51 percent of the recorded votes 
the lowest percentage in the house 
the following january savage showed up at a demonstration in 
lisbon portugal leading 50000 demonstrators against american 
policy who were described as mainly communist trade unionists 
savage dismissed his critics saying at the time i have 
different priorities than most politicians i didnt go to congress 
to get along or to go along 
he defended his absenteeism at another juncture by saying it 
is plumb foolish to depend on legislation from a white congress to 
provide for black liberation 
the federal election commission filed a civil suit against 
savages 1982 campaign in 1984 accusing it of failing to report the 
source of its money and asking the court to impose a 5000 fine 
more recently savage came under fire for inflaming racial 
passions in chicagos mayoral elections during the february 
primary savage called eventual winner richard m daley who is 
white and a son of the late mayor a bornandbred racist 
when democratic national committee chairman ron brown came to the 
city to campaign on daleys behalf savage called the black party 
leader an oreo for supporting daley over black challenger 
timothy evans 
savage his son thomas john savage and walter fauntroy the 
district of columbias congressional delegate also are subjects of 
a preliminary investigation by the fbi into fauntroys employment of 
the younger savage 
investigators have said thomas savage reported he was living in 
chicago and running for the illinois legislature at the same time he 
was on fauntroys payroll 
the fbi also is looking into any connection between the younger 
savages job and his fathers employment of a former fauntroy aide

sen richard bryan dnev urged energy 
secretary james d watkins on wednesday to scrap plans to build a 
highlevel nuclear waste dump in nevada saying delays now made it 
certain the site would not be ready in time 
the energy department has set a 2003 target date for opening the 
underground repository but a series of technical and political 
obstacles have put that target in doubt 
the dump would hold waste from commercial nuclear plants that 
will be dangerously radioactive for at least 10000 years it is 
about 100 miles northwest of las vegas 
nuclear utilities are desperate for a permanent storage facility 
because the cost of keeping waste in temporary storage at 
reactor plants is escalating 
bryan said watkins has legal authority to halt the departments 
work at nevadas yucca mountain which so far has been limited to 
preparing a means of characterizing the site or determining its 
geologic suitability as a dump 
bryan said in a letter to watkins that the department should turn 
away from the underground storage idea to consider ways of storing 
the waste at reactor sites in dry casks or other methods 
i believe you can restore scientific integrity and rational 
public policy to a program that if continued is destined to fail 
for scientific economic and political reasons bryan said in his 
letter 
a nuclear regulatory commission geologist in a report made 
public tuesday said preliminary energy department analyses of 
volcanic potentials near yucca mountain had grossly understated the 
chances of an eruption 
the geologist john trapp said the odds of an eruption during 
the next 10000 years may be about one in six rather than the 
onein30 chance cited by other scientists 
sen harry reid dnev said on the senate floor wednesday that 
trapp was a hero 
he did what no one expected him to do tell it like it really 
is and let the chips fall where they may reid said adding that 
the proposal for storing nuclear waste at yucca mountain was 
seriously flawed and an economic disaster 
a nuclear waste repository under yucca mountain would be as 
smart as storing nitroglycerin in a boiling tea pot he said 
watkins has said he feels bound by the nuclear waste policy act 
amendments of 1987 to carry out a suitability study at yucca 
mountain even though the state government has gone on record 
opposing the project 
christina sankey a department spokeswoman said in response to 
bryans letter that while she was not sure watkins had seen it the 
plea would not change his mind that it is too early to give up on 
yucca mountain 
he opposes such a move she said

a united airlines dc10 carrying 298 
people crashed in an explosive ball of fire wednesday while trying 
to make an emergency landing at least 80 people survived an 
official said 
flight 232 from denver to chicago carried 287 passengers and 11 
crew members said deborah jones a united spokeswoman 
the crash a halfmile from a runway could be one of the worst 
in us history 
a witness mark smith said he saw survivors walking away from 
the crash 
we could see the plane tumbling down the runway after a 
wing hit the ground said smith who said he was working about 
1500 yards from the site 
he said the plane broke into 15000 different pieces and the 
only intact piece was the nose 
the plane experienced complete hydraulic failure before the 
crash just after 4 pm federal aviation administration spokesman 
fred farrar said 
the tail engine failed and this may have caused a hydraulic 
failure said bob raynesford another faa spokesman 
this plane went down on approach to the airport they were 
having problems before it went down so they were prepared at the 
scene said police lt gene erickson 
raynesford told cnn that there appear now to be 80 survivors 
cbstv quoted janet flanagan of st lukes regional medical 
center as saying that 26 people walked in and at least nine were 
critically injured 
diane kay a spokeswoman for the marion health center said 24 
survivors had been brought there 
theyre all being treated she said were seeing burns and 
multiple injuries i dont have a condition report at this time 
we did hear a jolt we saw all the smoke said jean hopper 
manager of a motel 6 near the airport the smoke is still rolling 
quite heavily from the airport 
witnesses watched as the plane struggled to make it to the 
airport 
we watched it circle coming in to the southeast of our plant 
we were optimistic we thought it was going to make it said glen 
olson city editor of the sioux city journal olson and other 
employees watched the airplane circle from the newspaper plant six 
miles away 
the airport has two active runways each 9000 feet long which 
can accommodate a plane the size of a dc10 the area immediately 
around the airport which is seven miles from downtown is crop land 
in corn soybeans and pasture with some trees 
no unusual weather was reported wind speeds were clocked up to 
30 mph 
the nations worst air crash happened 10 years ago and involved a 
dc10 
on may 25 1979 american airlines flight 191 lost an engine on 
takeoff from chicagos ohare airport banked sideways out of 
control slammed into a field and exploded all 258 passengers and 
13 crew members died as well as two people on the ground 
the national transportation safety board laid primary blame for 
the crash on the airline citing maintenanceinduced damage a 
10inch crack in the engine mount that caused the left engine to 
tear loose the ntsb also criticized mcdonnell douglas design as 
vulnerable to maintenance damage 
mcdonnell douglas suspended production of the dc10 airliner in 
1983 dc10 orders collapsed in 1979 because of the recession and 
the may 1979 crash of an american airlines dc10 in chicago that 
killed 273 people bad passenger reaction to the crash apparently 
discouraged airlines from placing orders in all 369 dc10s were 
produced the last one in february 1983

sen bob dole said chinas ambassador to the 
united states told him wednesday that very few chinese students 
were arrested in the crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrations and 
only 10 people have been executed 
dole the senate gop leader said ambassador han xu made the 
remarks to him after being handed a protest letter signed by 42 
republican senators 
the letter predicted tremendous damage to uschinese 
relations should your government continue on the course of 
statesponsored violence and intimidation on which you are 
embarked 
in his view very few students were arrested and most of those 
who are sought were criminals dole said reporting on his meeting 
with the ambassador 
he said there had been only 10 executions added the senator 
from kansas 
sen pete wilson rcalif who attended the meeting said that 
the ambassador was told that television and newspaper reporting from 
china indicates that hundrds of people have been arrested and many 
executed 
he said the ambassador did not accept that characterization of 
the situation 
dole said the ambassador also protested arrangements being made 
to enable chinese students and scholars in the united states to 
extend their stay in order to avoid persecution in china 
it was his view that most chinese students would like to stay 
in the united states permanently dole said he said they arent 
in any danger at home and that they are needed at home 
the letter noted that han xu is concluding his service in the 
united states and returning to china 
we want to be certain you take with you no illusion about our 
reaction to recent events in china and our concern about their 
impact on uschinese relations the letter said 
the american people and those of us who have been elected to 
represent them are outraged that your government has so brutally 
repressed peaceful demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of 
chinese citizens the letter said 
we regard the continued harassment arrest and even execution 
of those deemed responsible for organizing the demonstrations as 
gross violations of the rights of your citizenry 
earlier the senate adopted a resolution naming the small park 
across the street from the chinese embassy here tiananmen square 
park 
the sponsor sen malcolm wallop rwyo said the park would 
remind beijing that america will never and can never forget the 
ruthless and callousness of the chinese government in crushing their 
citizen demonstrators and their aspirations 
the resolution also expressed the sense of the senate that a 
statue should be erected in the park in plain view of the embassy to 
further honor the students who were killed in the square

louisianas illegally segregated system of 
higher education must be dismantled to achieve a better racial mix 
at 17 public colleges and universities three federal judges ruled 
wednesday 
among the changes ordered by the panel are the creation of a 
single board to govern higher education instead of the four existing 
now restriction of admissions at some universities and 
establishment of a community college system 
the present scheme for governing education in louisiana three 
operating boards and one coordinating board has perpetuated 
illegal segregation in louisianas higher education even though the 
systems creation postdates the filing of this case the judges 
said 
the system of multiple boards is therefore a defect in the 
states system of higher education that violates the federal 
constitution 
the lawsuit was filed 15 years ago by the us justice 
department it became clear in december 1988 that the issue could 
not be settled so the three judges appointed paul verkuil 
president of william and mary college in virginia to conduct 
hearings and write a desegregation plan he submitted it in may 
the plan was recommended by gov buddy roemer when he took office 
in 1988 
the state has won the people have won i believe we have buddy 
roemer and three judges to thank said the governors attorney 
john kennedy at a news conference roemer was on vacation 
the court gave the state 30 days to disband the four governing 
boards and appoint a new 17member board the court declined to set 
a ratio of whitetoblack members 
the order calls for louisiana state university in baton rouge to 
be designated the flagship university with the greatest number of 
graduate and research programs 
it also calls for creation of an intermediate level of 
institutions offering significant doctoral and other graduate 
programs and for gradually merging the lsu law school and the 
southern university law school both in baton rouge 
the court refused to set the amount of money that must be spent 
to adopt the order 
taking into consideration funds freed by the elimination of 
duplicative programs the board the president and his staff shall 
develop budgets for the reclassified institutions including 
spending for improving the quality of predominantly black 
institutions whenever fiscally possible the court said 
the jurists who wrote the order were 5th us circuit court judge 
john m wisdom us district judge charles schwartz and district 
judge veronica wicker 
other reaction from around the state was varied 
former gov john mckeithen who left the lsu board last year and 
was the first governor to push desegregation was skeptical 
for the life of me i dont know any way to make a white go to

the senate unanimously adopted an amendment 
wednesday to restore to public housing authorities the power to 
evict drug criminals from federally funded public housing 
the measure sponsored by sens daniel p moynihan dny and 
alfonse damato rny was added to the foreign relations 
authorization act of 1990 
today we have restored the original intent of my provision to 
last years drug bill moynihan said afterward dont let it be 
said that we didnt get tough we drew the line now we can work 
toward our original goal of demanding accountability 
during final consideration of the 1989 supplemental 
appropriations bill in june language was added to limit moynihans 
original eviction provision in the antidrug abuse act of 1988 both 
moynihan and damato voted for the supplemental not realizing they 
were voting to undo the eviction measure damato said at a news 
conference monday in new york 
the new provision restores the ability of federal officials to 
waive administrative hearings for drug criminals when the hearings 
would duplicate eviction proceedings in state courts 
by passing this amendment we are saying that we will no longer 
subsidize violence and criminal activity in public housing 
moynihan said wednesday 
in considering the same foreign relations authorization bill the 
senate unanimously passed a moynihan amendment offering political 
and financial assistance to burmese students 
the amendment provides 250000 in refugee assistance for burmese 
protesters living in thailand india and border camps 15 
scholarships to burmese students who have sought asylum outside 
their country which is engaged in civil war and requests a report 
from the attorney general and secretary of state on us immigration 
policy toward burmese protesters 
the amendment also calls on the administration to continue its 
condemnation of human rights violations by the current military 
regime in burma

gen wojciech jaruzelski speaks now of 
reconciliation and reform but his martial law declaration of 1981 
echoes so loudly in polish ears that the stern man behind the dark 
glasses nearly lost the presidency 
earlier this year his communist party shifted course 
dramatically and decided to make solidarity legal again after trying 
for more than seven years to obliterate the independent union 
jaruzelskis government aware that the communists needed help in 
controlling polands social unrest and economic crisis offered 
talks with the opposition that produced political reforms leading to 
wednesdays presidential election in parliament 
it would be the greatest drama for me if history one day said 
those decisions were wrong he said in a recent interview with the 
associated press thats why i wish so much that the agreement 
that this pluralism passes the test in real life 
straight and serious often seeming remote behind the glasses and 
a lifetimes worth of military medals jaruzelski is a far cry from 
presidential counterparts in the west 
little is said of his domestic life and he rarely engages 
citizens or reporters in conversation during public appearances 
he was born july 6 1923 to an upperclass family in eastern 
poland and was attending a roman catholic boarding school in warsaw 
when poland was invaded at the beginning of world war ii 
his official biography says he stayed in the northeastern 
soviet union during the war working as a laborer poles who knew 
the family however said the jaruzelskis were caught by soviet 
occupiers and deported a siberian labor camp where wojciechs 
father died 
the young man entered a soviet officer training school in 1943 
and later served with the communistled polish first army which was 
formed in the soviet union and fought with the red army against the 
nazis 
jaruzelski joined the polish communist party in 1947 and rose 
through the political and military ranks becoming defense minister 
in 1968 
in october 1981 at the height of solidaritys defiance 
jaruzelski became communist party chief the only career military 
officer to hold supreme power in a soviet bloc country 
two months later he announced martial law solidarity was 
suppressed then outlawed and its leaders arrested western aid and 
investment was cut off and poland slid into economic crisis 
it was such a difficult and dramatic decision and for me 
personally very painful jaruzelski said in the ap interview 
the general has not apologized for martial law or repudiated it 
and he leaves open the question of whether loyalty to the kremlin or 
a patriotic wish to prevent soviet intervention prompted his action 
whatever his motive the memory of those times has created 
profound skepticism about his recent movement toward reform and 
democratic change 
when he told the communist party leadership june 30 he would not 
run for the new more powerful presidency jaruzelski acknowledged 
he was linked too closely to martial law and too little to reform 
i will not crawl to this post jaruzelski said in the ap 
interview two days before the announcement 
then came a pledge of cooperation from lech walesa the shipyard 
electrician who founded solidarity and won the 1983 nobel peace 
prize and appearances with president bush and other western leaders 
he changed his mind from a sense of duty was the military 
way he explained it and ran for the presidency after all

on the eve of the winter couture collections 
opening sunday the talk is more about new faces on the french 
fashion scene than about hemlines 
so many italians are showing that one wonders if it wont be a 
spaghetti revolution 
in may gianfranco ferre took over the chief creative post at 
dior from marc bohan diors couturier for 30 years 
angelo tarlazzi was designated as head of guy laroches couture 
following laroches death last february he has long been on the 
paris scene and plans to keep the frenchbased readytowear firm he 
has headed with his own label for 12 years 
two other famous italians valentino and gianni versace will 
show during couture week but separately rather than as part of 
the official french chambre syndicale couture group of 23 houses 
it will be versaces firstever showing in paris valentino has 
already shown couture once but has shown his luxury readytowear 
for several years both are throwing festive parties after their 
shows in museums but versaces offering might look stilted since 
hes draping his outfits on steel mannequins 
what do the french think of all these italians invading the 
sacred halls of haute couture jacques mouclier president of the 
chambre syndicale de la couture parisienne is sanguine 
its a demonstration of paris supremacy in fashion that they 
all want to come we dont worry about it if we subtracted the 
foreign designers we wouldnt have many left ungaro is of italian 
origin and so is cardin whose name was cardini and think of karl 
lagerfeld 
born in germany lagerfeld is chanels designer and also creates 
his own readytowear line in france 
for the last ten years weve been encouraging foreigners many 
japanese italians and the american patrick kelly to work and show 
their readytowear here 
but now mouclier thinks that the foreign newcomers should do as 
lagerfeld and tarlazzi did become nationalized or unofficially 
french wed like to see them give up their commitments abroad and 
work only in france 
ferre 44 will be giving up designing couture under his own name 
in milan to design for dior arguably the most prestigious couture 
label in the world but he has kept his own readytowear operation 
in milan 
ferres show for dior will be held in a private mansion the 
salomon de rothschild foundation followed by a gala dinner for 
select clients 
fashionwatchers reckon that this is a move to help pacify any of 
the rich and fairly conservative women who might find the change 
from bohan to ferre upsetting 
backed by the agache financial group headed by bernard arnault 
which also finances christian lacroix dior reportedly wanted new 
angles and excitement which ferre may or may not deliver trained 
as an architect he is known for his sharply constructed outfits and 
his love of rich fabrics 
a preview model in a french newspaper showed a waspwaisted coat 
with raised collar worn with spike heels that hinted strongly of the 
old new look created by christian dior himself in 1947 
angelo tarlazzi said i wont do anything shocking or 
overdressed for the house of laroche 
but he does promise big long and comfortable coats over skinny 
cigarette pantsuits as well as a version of the sexy backless 
sheath created by guy laroche for film star mireille darc 
more changes this season lanvin which has been bought by the 
midland bank will not be showing couture at all as designer maryll 
lanvin left when the new management came in we havent found a 
designer yet said a lanvin spokesman 
and madame gres at 86 the doyenne of french couture will 
be showing a collection featuring cocktail clothes and evening 
gowns in the new gres shop on the rue du faubourg st honore 
having not shown for two seasons 
the main lines are hers said an assistant but since she 
is quite fatigued she has had a lot of help in details 
all over town couturiers are revving up to lay on their 
surprises for next winter but they are giving out a few previews as 
well so far it seems that as with readytowear almost anything 
goes lots of short skirts a few long and swirly ones big and warm 
coats and trousers back with a vengeance

the house ways and means committee on wednesday 
approved 16 billion worth of tax credits and childcare benefits to 
lowerincome families over the next five years 
the initiative which is somewhat more generous than president 
bush recommended for child care but less than the senate voted was 
approved on a 2610 vote 
the action came as members of the taxwriting panel continued to 
look for a way to solve a heated controversy over reducing the 
income tax surtax that older americans pay for catastrophicillness 
insurance aides indicated there was no progress on that issue 
wednesday 
the childcare amendments were added to a bill designed mainly to 
raise 53 billion in revenues for deficit reduction in 1990 the 
committee has not decided how to pay for child care although it is 
weighing proposals by rep dan rosteniowski dill the chairman 
that would impose new taxes on mutual life insurance and chemical 
companies and make permanent the temporary 3 percent tax on local 
and long distance telephone service 
there is continuing talk among committee members about cutting 
the tax on capital gains which would be expected to raise revenues 
for a year or so bush has called for a cut but many democrats are 
opposed because most of the direct benefit would go to those with 
incomes over 100000 
the panels childcare initiative which would become effective 
in 1991 is a giant step forward rostenkowski told reporters 
i hope the bush administration will committee itself to its 
campaign promise and do something for children he said 
the proposals would benefit not only families in which both 
spouses work outside the home but also those families in which one 
spouse stays at home to care for the children 
the heart of the committees childcare plan would expand the 
existing earnedincome credit which is worth up to 910 a year in 
tax cuts or in cash if there is no tax liability for working 
families with children and incomes up to about 18000 
the committee voted to raise the maximum credit to 1217 for a 
family with one child 1540 if there are two children and 1790 
if a family has two or more under current law the credit is the 
same regardless of the number of children 
the plan would create a new credit for families with one or more 
children under the age of 6 this credit which would be in addition 
to the earnedincome credit would be for 6 percent of the first 
6500 of earned income with a top credit of 430 in 1991 
a third part of the committees package would authorize 155 
billion worth of federal grants for social services with 80 percent 
of the money earmarked for improving childcare services 
by a 2014 vote the committee rejected an attempt by rep hank 
brown rcolo to eliminate the increase in socialservice grants 
and use the money to finance an even larger credit for families with 
children under 6 
unlike the childcare plan passed by the senate the ways and 
means committee bill does nothing to change the tax credit now 
allowed working parents to help offset expenses of caring for a 
child the senate voted to make that credit available even to 
families whose incomes are so low that they owe no tax

ptl founder jim bakker refused to answer 
questions wednesday in the federal tax evasion trial of two former 
aides on grounds he might incriminate himself 
bakker appeared only because his attorney failed to quash a 
subpoena compelling him to testify for the defense he entered us 
district court before the jury returned from an afternoon break in 
the trial of james and david taggart 
david taggart 32 was bakkers top personal aide and james 
taggart 35 was the television ministrys interior decorator the 
taggarts are accused of evading 487000 in federal income taxes 
during their years at ptl prosecutors say the two men diverted 11 
million in ministry funds to their own use 
both were fired when jerry falwell took over at the television 
ministry following bakkers resignation in march 1987 following 
revelations of the jessica hahn sexandmoney scandal 
 
bakker and richard dortch his former top deputy at the 
nowbankrupt television ministry are to go on trial here aug 28 on 
24 counts of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy 
as defense attorney ben cotten attempted to ask bakker a series 
of questions wednesday the ptl ministrys founder took the fifth 
amendment 
what was the ptls policy on cash advance cotten asked 
on the advice of my attorney i decline to answer on the 
grounds my answer may tend to incriminate me bakker responded 
questions about ptl policy on blank checks and about who hired 
the taggarts in 1983 brought the same reply 
asked if he would give the same answer to other questions bakker 
said yes 
prosecutor david brown then asked bakker whether he knew the 
defendants and asked him about david taggarts employment contract 
and a bonus payment to him bakker again refused to answer 
judge robert potter then released bakker saying this court 
will not force him to testify 
asked later if he wanted to comment on his reasons for not 
testifying bakker replied no the judge has asked that there be 
no comment 
bakker accompanied by attorneys harold bender and george t 
davis left in their car davis said in a telephone interview that 
bakkers refusing to testify wednesday did not mean bakker would not 
testify at his own trial 
testifying earlier in the day james taggart described himself as 
an artist with no knowledge of several questionable financial 
transactions mentioned during the trial 
a lot of these mistakes im learning in this courtroom he 
said im under a microscope and im learning 
taggart showed jurors large photos of some of his work he 
appeared relaxed and confident as he recalled the first time bakker 
noticed his design flair at a party he and his brother held at 
their house in 1981 
the interior was very theatrical and dramatic taggart said 
taggart said he almost immediately became involved in the 
interior design of ptls heritage usa christian retreat 
he said one of his first big assignments was decorating bakkers 
vacation home in the highland beach fla and that bakker had only 
one request 
as soon i walk into it i want to know james taggart did it 
he recalled bakker telling him i want the theatrics and flair of 
james taggart 
by 1984 taggart was chief interior designer 
he testified that bakker placed great demands on him and put no 
limits on how much money he could spend 
he trusted me taggart said he confided in me

the house ethics committee was asked wednesday 
to investigate charges that rep gus savage dill sexually 
assaulted a peace corps volunteer while on an official trip to zaire 
last march 
three of savages democratic colleagues reps patricia 
schroeder of colorado matthew mchugh of new york and barney frank 
of massachusetts formally requested the ethics investigation 
which means the congressional panel must inquire into the 
allegations 
savage denied the charges 
they tried to destroy dr martin luther king with a lie 
im in very good company he told reporters from chicago 
television stations on the capitol steps 
at the same time officials at the peace corps said they were 
willing to seek disciplinary action against the chicago democrat 
but wont do so without the womans consent 
the ball is in her court said one agency official who spoke 
only on the condition of anonymity its something we told her 
right from the beginning we would go great guns 
the peace corps worker claims savage fondled her for more than 
two hours in the back of a chauffeurdriven embassy car in kinshasa 
the capital of zaire on march 19 according to several government 
officials who confirmed an account originally published in the 
washington post 
he tried to force me to have sex with him he kept touching 
me after i told him to stop many times loudly he kept saying 
thats the way the world works she was quoted as saying 
savage angrily brushed past a reporter on the house floor 
wednesday and used expletives when she asked for comment but 
outside on the capitol steps he offered a different account of the 
night in question 
we were in a caravan of four or five cars savage said in 
remarks monitored in chicago we made four or five brief stops and 
got out of the car and got back in if there were any kind of abuse 
then why would she keep getting back into the same car 
he added it doesnt surprise you that the person who remains 
independent of plantation politics in chicago that that man who 
refuses to be bought or to be bossed that grates hard on some of 
you white journalists but that will not stop gus savage at 
all 
savage is black 
neither the government agencies involved nor the washington post 
has disclosed the womans name 
the newspaper account quoted her as saying savages advances 
continued even though she tried everything short of hitting 
him or hurting him physically to make him stop 
she eventually left her post in zaire to get counseling and 
medical treatment at a washington hospital and is awaiting another 
peace corps assignment the agency official said 
jill gross of the state department inspector generals office 
said the allegations were forwarded in a letter to rep julian c 
dixon dcalif chairman of the house ethics committee the 
committee had no formal comment 
the state department has no jurisdiction in the case gross said 
but the allegations were brought to our attention from 
department employees in zaire and they were sufficiently serious 
that someone should look into them 
she declined to release the letter sent to the ethics committee 
citing confidentiality 
the three democrats wrote in a letter to dixon 
we write to ask the ethics committee to inquire into the 
assertion that our colleague from illinois mr savage behaved 
improperly towards a federal employee while on a congressional 
tour 
the twoparagraph letter noted that the lawmakers had no 
independent knowledge of the incident but added we believe that 
the accusation is sufficiently serious to justify your looking into 
it 
the incident allegedly occurred while savage was on an official 
visit to zaire in midmarch and had dinner one night at the 
residence of us ambassador william harrop the dinner attendees 
included the peace corps volunteer who was scheduled to brief the 
congressman a few days later on agency activities there an official 
said 
after dinner savage insisted the woman ride alone with him in an 
embassy limousine while the congressmen members of his staff and 
others visited area bars the official said 
as soon as the three cars left the ambassadors home savage 
grabbed me the woman told the post 
the volunteer tried to flee from savage at a hotel disco and was 
eventually escorted home by an embassy officer a peace corps 
official said 
she reported the incident the next day to bruce cohen peace 
corps director in zaire and harrop later confronted savage this 
official added 
the ambassador spoke very strongly to savage and chewed him 
out as much as an ambassador chews out a congressman an 
unidentified witness told the post 
the woman did not make a formal complaint against savage because 
she thought it would hurt the peace corps said an official who 
added she is still reluctant to initiate a case against the 
congressman 
we have a pretty impressive record going against people who 
violate peace corps types the official said 
if this person is willing to testify well go up to capitol 
hill with it he said

the damaged exxon valdez was towed toward an 
island wednesday for repairs to enable it to enter port and no 
leaks were observed from the tanker for the third day in a row 
officials said 
a series of samples taken from the cargo tanks on the ship that 
cause the nations worst oil spill were being analyzed for toxicity 
and hydrocarbon content results were expected in several days said 
coast guard petty officer elizabeth neely 
the ship which was 14 miles south of san clemente island on 
tuesday was to moved to within 7 to 10 miles south of the island on 
wednesday said exxon shipping co spokeswoman jan cool 
san clemente island is 60 miles northwest of san diego 
cool said exxon officials were trying to determine whether divers 
operating in ocean waters can safely cut off a half dozen steel 
plates hanging from the ships bottom 
cool said they would determine whether the work can be done in 
the open ocean before taking the tanker into an anchorage just off 
the island 
the plates peeled away during the ships 2500mile journey from 
alaska where it underwent preliminary repairs after smashing onto a 
reef march 24 in prince william sound and spilling nearly 11 million 
gallons of crude 
the plates one of which hangs down about 70 feet must be 
removed so the valdez can navigate a san diego harbor channel whose 
depth averages about 40 feet 
the valdez is scheduled to undergo a ninemonth 25 million 
repair at san diegos national steel and shipbuilding co once it 
has been declared free of navigational and environmental hazards 
on july 10 coast guard officials suspended the valdezs 
scheduled harbor entry after an 18mile slick was sighted near the 
ship discharges of oil mixed with organic compounds such as 
plankton continued for several days after that

a judge on wednesday granted a research 
labs request to silence a former technician who complained about 
safety and health procedures more than a year before another worker 
died of a rare virus 
international research and development corp won a preliminary 
injunction in van buren county circuit court against james casey in 
connection with a lawsuit the company filed against casey and david 
bailey last september 
irdc alleges the men violated a confidentiality agreement with 
the company by giving statements some of which the company says 
are false to government investigators who were inspecting the 
company 
judge meyer warshawsky ruled that irdc could suffer irreparable 
harm to its reputation if casey continued making allegations against 
the mattawan company 
warshawsky warned bailey not to discuss the case but did not 
include him in the injunction irdc had sought to silence bailey as 
well 
casey allegedly told inspectors from the us food and drug 
administration about health and safety problems at the lab 
resulting in several citations and a loss of business irdc 
attorneys said 
warshawsky said that on monday he would set a date for the trial 
of irdcs lawsuit 
casey has countersued the company contending he was exposed to 
dangers at the lab and was fired in retaliation for his complaints 
about safety problems 
the court action comes one month after the death of a technician 
who contracted a rare virus from an infected research monkey 
another former irdc technician is hospitalized with the infection 
the deadly herpes b virus 
the company alleges statements made by casey and bailey have 
contributed to bad publicity and death threats from animal rights 
groups 
attorneys for bailey and casey said their clients right to free 
speech outweighs any harm that might come to the company 
the independent contract research laboratory tests drugs and 
chemicals for medical pharmaceutical veterinary and agriculture 
companies 
after seven years as manager of the largeanimal toxicology 
department bailey went to company officials in 1987 to discuss 
perceived safety violations his attorney said 
nothing happened attorney craig lubben said of the companys 
response things became worse he feared about the quality of 
the testing 
in january 1988 bailey quit after 10 years with the company 
casey was fired in november 1987 after 10 years with the company 
he too had complained to company officials 
both men were warned against discussing company operations with 
anyone their attorneys said 
company vice president francis x wazeter iii testified that his 
business depends on confidentiality because the lab tests compounds 
that are trade secrets or have patents pending 
irdc attorney john allen said the company could be irreparably 
harmed if bailey and casey discuss their experiences at the company 
caseys attorney joseph cutro said any bad publicity 
surrounding irdc is the result of last months death

turkish cypriot police wrestled with greek 
cypriot women who forced their way across the islands ethnic 
dividing line wednesday past un soldiers to protest the 15th 
anniversary of the turkish invasion 
the police arrested dozens of the 1000 women who accompanied by 
a greek orthodox bishop and two priests held a womens return 
march to protest the invasion that drove them from their homes in 
northern cyprus the bishop chrysostomos of kition and a priest 
whose name was not known also were arrested 
the semiofficial anatolia news agency in turkey said 109 
demonstrators were arrested including the bishop and the priest 
four of the detainees were taken to a hospital for treatment of 
minor injuries 
turkish cypriot police dragged many detainees away by the hair or 
clothes canadian soldiers of the multiniational un peacekeeping 
force on cyprus formed a human barrier to protect others 
police dragged away steve weizman a british reporter for reuters 
news agency after punching and kicking him katherine mcelroy also 
of reuters was arrested 
anatolia said those detained were being held in a gymnasium the 
agency quoted brig gen ali yalcin the turkish cypriot police 
commander as saying they will receive legal treatment 
greek cypriot president george vassiliou and senior police 
commanders held an emergency meeting at the nicosia police 
headquarters they requested un intenvetion to secure the release 
of all detainees government sources said 
the women penetrated the ethnic boundary called the green line 
at dusk after scuffling with the canadian soldiers who patrol it and 
knocking down barbed wire barricades at the ayios kassianos 
neighborhood 
they occupied a wardamaged elementary school and the st georges 
church some climbed onto the church roof with a bell and began 
ringing it while others sang hymns in greek 
canadian soldiers warned the women they would not be able to 
protect them from turkish cypriot policemen gathering by the dozens 
only 10 yards away but were ignored the buffer zone along the line 
is about 50 yards deep at that point 
marina demitriou an organizer of the march shouted at the 
canadians you should tell the turks to go away this is our land 
and we have the right to be here a canadian officer replied 
were trying to protect you now please go away 
a few minutes later turkish riot police supported by dozens of 
riflecarrying soldiers charged into the buffer zone pushing the 
women outside the church onto the ground and arresting some the 
policemen entered the church

demonstration was intended to reiterate our right to return to 
the northern third of the island the turkish army seized in an 
invasion that began july 20 1974

us officials said wednesday theyve netted a 
taiwanese businessman who allegedly masterminded the sale of 550 
tons of usspawned salmon illegally caught on the high seas 
the sale was made to undercover agents who arrested patrick lee 
of taipei as he carried suitcases holding 13 million in cash out 
of a seattle bank vault 
we think he is the kingpin brian gorman spokesman for the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration in washington dc 
said of lee 
evidence collected in a sixmonth sting operation demonstrates 
the blatant piracy of american salmon on the high seas said 
rolland schmitten regional director of the national marine 
fisheries service 
two associates of lee also were arrested in seattle three 
others including the captains of the two fishing boats were in 
custody in the midpacific late tuesday after they had boarded a 
fishtransport vessel used by undercover agents acting as buyers of 
the salmon 
lee and john chin wang formerly of taiwan but a recently 
naturalized us citizen and wesley ming hsu of los angeles were 
each charged wednesday in us district court with one count of 
violating the lacey act which prohibits commerce in illegally 
caught salmon or wildlife 
jen chu an interpreter and ship captains tsun long lin and shu 
meng ging will be charged with violating the lacey act when they 
arrive in seattle said wayne lewis an agent of the national marine 
fisheries service in seattle 
the maximum penalty for each lacey act violation is a fine of 
20000 and a fiveyear prison sentence 
the case probably will be presented to a federal grand jury in 
seattle and additional charges are likely lewis said 
this should put the lid on one of the biggest salmonpirate 
operations and if the others have any brains theyll sit up and 
take notice too said sen frank murkowski ralaska 
meanwhile a 180foot fish transport vessel and a coast guard 
cutter tracked the two captainless taiwanese fishing vessels some 
1000 miles north of midway island 
the vessels carry part of the 550 tons of salmon that were 
supposed to have been delivered to lee the price was 125 per 
pound for the fish 
coast guard cmdr brian hunter said armed boarding parties of 
federal agents were aboard bothvessels and were awaiting permission 
to board them he said the united states has asked permission to 
board from the government of taiwan 
there was no evidence the thousands of pounds of salmon were 
being thrown overboard as had happened in one recent attempt to 
halt a taiwanese fishing boat in the north pacific hunter said 
the sting operation began early this year when lee contacted a 
member of the us fishing industry with an offer to sell salmon 
the american company that lee approached contacted national marine 
fisheries service agents 
over the next six months a nmfs agent posed as a buyer and 
communicated with lee over monitored telephone and fax machines 
to arrange the sale which climaxed in his arrests tuesday 
schmitten said the illicit harvest of usspawned salmon on the 
high seas threatens to destroy american fish runs unless we stop 
it were not going to have any fish runs he said 
the 550 tons involved in the sting sale equals whole seasonsize 
catches of certain species for washington state fishermen he said

gen wojciech jaruzelski won the powerful 
new presidency wednesday without a vote to spare after some 
opposition legislators boycotted the election and some members of 
his own communist party opposed him 
the communist party leader who imposed martial law in 1981 but 
later encouraged reforms that swept solidarity into the legislature 
said he hoped to unite the nation 
jaruzelski wearing civilian clothes and his customary dark 
glasses was met by applause from communist lawmakers when he 
arrived at the joint session of parliament barely an hour after the 
vote and took the oath of office solidarity lawmakers were silent 
i want to be a president of reconciliation a representative of 
all poles jaruzelski 66 said in a brief acceptance speech i 
will serve the nation i will serve the fatherland the one that has 
not perished the one that is and will be 
of the national assemblys 559 members 270 voted for jaruzelski 
and 233 against thirtyfour lawmakers abstained and 15 some of 
whom boycotted the election did not participate seven ballots were 
counted invalid 
with 537 valid votes 270 or 50 percent plus one was ruled 
the number required for election 
the twochamber national assembly has 300 members from the 
communist party or their allies and 259 members from solidarity 
the close vote indicated some dissatisfaction from communist 
hardliners who oppose jaruzelskis compromises with solidarity 
the solidarity boycotters may have provided victory by reducing the 
number of votes jaruzelski required 
government ministers gave one another the thumbsup sign as word 
of jaruzelskis victory spread through the chamber 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak jaruzelskis second 
choice for president was ebullient 
i am very happy he is the best for this office which will 
be so difficult in these times kiszczak said 
solidarity leader lech walesa sent a letter of congratulations to 
the general who suppressed and crushed the independent union early 
in the decade but who later began to advocate reform 
my wish for you is that the time you are given to perform this 
office will be a stage in the history of our homeland effectively 
leading to freedom and democracy and to regaining polands proper 
position in europe walesa said solidarity spokesman janusz 
onyszkiewicz read the letter to reporters 
in washington the bush administration congratulated jaruzelski 
and said the choice of leadership is an internal matter for the 
polish people our only concern is to see the political and economic 
reform process go forward 
since 1985 jaruzelski has been head of the council of state the 
collective leadership whose chairman sometimes was referred to as 
president real power rested with party politburo which he also led 
by electing jaruzelski the national assembly assured him 
continued control of the military and foreign relations the 
president also will choose a prime minister who then will form a 
government with parliamentary approval 
one by one wednesday lawmakers filed up to a wooden box at the 
front of the chamber and deposited printed paper ballots 
many held up ballots showing they were voting against jaruzelski 
at least three said they werent participating at all because there 
was only one candidate 
i was and i am for lech walesa said sen gabriel janowski of 
siedlce said as he deposited his ballot against jaruzelski 
solidaritys parliamentary floor leader bronislaw geremek 
neither endorsed nor opposed the nomination but said opposition 
lawmakers could not forget jaruzelskis 1981 martiallaw decree 
under which many of them were imprisoned 
we express the hope that the future president will act for 
the realization of the promises of democratization for the 
fulfillment of the promises of change in our country geremek said 
from the podium 
as lawmakers gathered for the vote about 50 antijaruzelski 
demonstrators from the confederation for an independent poland 
rallied outside jaruzelski must go one banner read 
some solidarity members while not forgiving the general for past 
repression argued that defeating him could undermine reforms needed 
to reverse the countrys economic decline 
it is a great relief said sen karol modzelewski of wroclaw 
we would have been in real trouble if he did not make it 
in its editions wednesday the opposition gazeta wyborcza said in 
an editorial that the new president would be a guarantor of a 
stable course as poland enters a transition period leading to full 
democracy 
on tuesday jaruzelski cited a sense of duty and reversed his 
june 30 decision not to seek the presidency 
an announcement by walesa that he would cooperate with jaruzelski 
as president and words of praise from president bush during a visit 
last week may have helped change his mind 
jaruzelski must deal with worsening food shortages and inflation 
now headed for annual rate of 160 percent the pressing economic 
problems have caused widespread discontent and impelled the 
communist partys concessions to solidarity 
in april the free trade union movement was made legal again and 
allowed to enter candidates in june elections that were the freest 
since the communists gained power four decades ago

survivors told of terror and heroism as 
their crippled dc10 struggled wednesday to reach an airport and 
then crashed and broke up while attempting an emergency landing 
the plane came down it bounced twice flipped into the air and 
we were sitting there upside down and it began to fill up with 
smoke said cliff marshall of columbus ohio who was returning 
home from denver 
then god opened a hole in the basement the bottom of the 
plane and i pushed a little girl out i grabbed another kept 
pulling them out until they didnt come no more 
marshall said he thought he helped a halfdozen out and then he 
ran 
there were about 290 people including 11 crew members on the 
united airlines flight en route from denver to chicago when it 
crashed while trying to land at the airport in this western iowa 
city more than 500 miles from its destination 
passenger charles martz 58 of castle pines colo said the 
scene on the ground after the crash looked like a battlefield 
bodies were strewn all over the place bodies had burns their 
clothing burned off stripped off 
this one gal i just remember seeing had no feet and she was 
still breathing a little bit and moaning but what could you do 
an unidentified survivor interviewed by kmns radio in sioux city 
said that about a halfhour before the crash there was a big 
loud noise that kind of shook the plane 
the pilot said there was a problem he said and the plane 
circled for about a halfhour while the pilots figured out what to 
do then they said we were preparing for a crash landing 
when we hit the plane broke right in front of me it rolled 
over twice i think then it burst into flames he said i 
grabbed an old lady in front of me and a baby and i went out the 
plane then i looked back and there were flames and i ran into the 
cornfield 
passenger david lansberger told cable news network that 
passengers were mostly calm as the emergency landing attempt 
approached in part because they were expecting no more than a very 
rough landing 
we really thought that we would just land and walk off he 
said 
when the plane hit the ground there was noise everywhere 
i just remember thinking this is what it is like to die 
martz a former navy pilot who still often flies for his 
business said that when the problem developed the united pilot 
calmly told passengers that there was a problem with the right 
engine but the plane could fly perfectly well without its power 
but i could tell it was worse than that martz said 
the pilot just before landing came on and said that this may be 
more than a rough landing so do the best you can to assume the 
crash preparedness position 
ron rhode of columbus said he was sitting with an 8yearold boy 
ben radtke of prairie view ill 
the plane hit bounced and we ended upside down i let him 
go rhode said 
rhode said he and and another passenger danny surue of chicago 
threw the boy from the plane and then got out themselves surue 
said the boy was sitting by himself alone and they said we were 
going to crash so ron got up and went over and sat by him 
ben was not hurt but he said he was afraid he was going to 
diethe boy still wore his united airline badge 
rod vettor who suffered only bruises in the crash said 
passengers braced for the landing after the pilot announced the

cuban troops are withdrawing from angola on 
schedule the assistant secretary of state for africa said wednesday 
over 26 percent of their troops have left everything is going 
in apple pie order and the soviet contribution has been very 
useful herman cohen told the cable news network in an interview 
on international hour 
they helped bring about the agreement signed last september 
theyre urging the mpla to observe the ceasefire they urged the 
mpla to go into this negotiation so were working very closely with 
them to make sure it all stays on tracks 
mpla is the portuguese acronym for the marxist party that rules 
the former portuguese colony in southwest africa cohen said there 
had been about 50000 cuban troops supporting it 
cohen said jonas savimbi head of the rebel unita forces will 
not take part in a new government for a year or 18 months but then 
he would have to get a big job such as prime minister 
i think he has to play a major role in any angolan government 
because he represents at least 40 percent of the angolan people and 
maybe more cohen said 
so hes going to have a high post the only way the government 
and the country can stay together is if he bring his people along 
into it he has already conceded that the president of angola with 
be the current president president jose eduardo dos santos so 
hes not looking to take over that job 
cohen said angola will probably have a parliament and a oneparty 
government with mpla and unita merged into something new 
the administrations of former president ronald reagan and 
president bush have supported savimbi cohen said he had tremendous 
support in congress

publicly funded programs allowing drug addicts in 
seattle and tacoma to exchange needles are illegal the state 
attorney general warned wednesday but local health officials said 
the exchanges will continue 
the programs have helped control the spread of aids by removing 
contaminated needles and have drawn some addicts into treatment 
centers the officials said 
attorney general ken eikenberrys opinion was issued as us 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan in washington 
backed away from earlier support of needleexchange programs and 
told congress the bush administration opposes such programs 
eikenberry issuing his opinion in response to a state lawmakers 
request said washington states 1988 aids law does not authorize 
needle exchanges and that the legislature failed to amend a 1989 
antidrug law to allow distribution of needles 
he said it was up to local prosecutors to decide whether to bring 
charges against needle distributors prosecutors in both cities said 
they didnt plan to at least not immediately 
these people are not trying to commit criminal acts said tom 
felnagle chief criminal deputy prosecutor for pierce county 
its a narrow construction of the law said tacomapierce 
county health department director al allen we plan to continue 
operating our program unless the policy of our health board 
changes 
tacomas program was the first in the nation and pierce county 
won an award this year from the national association of county 
health officers for aids prevention 
the needle exchanges were begun in august 1988 by david purchase 
a former drug counselor who continues his work even though the 
program was taken over in january by the county health department 
were going to keep doing what we do purchase said in an 
interview our goal is to save lives the seriousness of the 
problem justifies an appropriate effort to prevent the spread of 
aids 
health officials say the program has substantially reduced needle 
sharing by addicts the sharing of aidsinfected needles is a major 
cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
counselors distributing needles in the tacoma area have persuaded 
more than 150 addicts to visit drug treatment centers since the 
program began said terry reid manager of the tacomapierce county 
aids program 
reid said information indicates the exchanges do not encourage 
people to start using drugs or to use more drugs 
jack jourden manager of regional services of the seattleking 
county department of public health said the agency plans to 
continue the program and has asked for more money in its 1990 budget 
the city and the county would provide 65000 to help expand the 
program beyond the single needleexchange center in downtown 
seattle tacoma has two such centers 
the seattle center provides up to 10 clean needle per week per 
addict bleach for cleaning needles safe sex information and 
referrals to treatment centers the seattle program has been under 
way for about two months 
randy gainer assistant city attorney for seattle disagreed with 
eikenberrys opinion and said his office told both the local health 
department and the city council that the program did not violate 
state laws 
there is room to permit needle exchanges under current state 
law gainer said he would not comment further on eikenberrys 
opinion 
republican state rep charles wolfe of spokane who requested 
eikenberrys opinion said he hoped police would arrest officials in 
his city if it proceeds with plans for a needleexchange program 
if they hand out needles they would be violating the law i 
believe in upholding the law said wolfe a physician in 
occupational medicine 
he said that exchanging needles gives the wrong message to young 
people 
the aids law created a division in the state department of social 
and health services to finance aids tracking treatment and 
education 
the antidrug legislation was a 70 million package of three 
dozen bills including tougher laws on drug dealing and education and 
treatment 
the legislature banned needle exchanges in one of the drug bills 
but gov gov booth gardner vetoed the ban

president daniel ortega marked the 10th 
anniversary of the sandinista revolution wednesday by calling for 
president bush to stop his policy of war against nicaragua and 
disband the contras 
today the people are better off than before 1979 ortega told 
more than 100000 people who jammed the plaza of the revolution 
along the shores of lake managua 
better days are coming he said as the chanting and singing 
crowd held aloft a sea of the redandblack flags of the ruling 
sandinista national liberation front 
ortega said the rally showed the depth of sandinista support 10 
years to the day after they took power following the defeat of 
dictator anastasio somoza whose family had ruled nicaragua with 
us support since the 1930s 
in washington president bush issued a statement saying the 
sandinistas had failed to live up to their decadeold promise of 
democracy 
but now with the eyes of the world upon them the sandinistas 
have another opportunity to give peace and democracy a chance 
bush said in reference to coming nicaraguan elections 
until wednesday celebrations had been lowkey in part due to 
nicaraguas miserable economic state which left many unenthusiastic 
about the sandinistas 
but when rain clouds that had dampened the city cleared away 
thousands flowed into the plaza sovietmade mi17 helicopters with 
news photographers aboard circled overhead 
most of those at the rally were young people chanting the land 
is ours and we have 10 years down and we continue ahead 
in his 50minute speech ortega said his government is 
controlling inflation which reached an estimated 20000 percent 
last year and accused the united states of imperialist 
aggression for maintaining an economic boycott and blocking 
financial credits 
ortega also praised two people who were once allies but have now 
become enemies alfonso robelo who became a leader of 
antisandinista forces and violetta barrios de chamorro publisher 
of the opposition newspaper la prensa 
ortega claimed the throng at the plaza topped 300000 but 
observers estimated it at between 150000 to 200000 
ortega said the rally showed the sandinistas have at least that 
many votes assured for next years elections he said the sandinista 
show of strength might scare the opposition into abstaining 
but lets all be very clear about this they can take or 
leave the elections but there will be elections on feb 25 1990 
ortega said and they will be clean and honest elections 
ortega has said he is willing to talk to the political opposition 
to discuss further reforms to electoral and news media laws 
the opposition claims the sandinistas have an unfair advantage 
for the elections set as part of an agreement among central 
american presidents that also calls for dismantling the 
ussupported contra guerrillas 
the united states still hasnt decided to respect the rights of 
the nations of the third world and of nicaragua ortega said 
if the president of the united states is for peace he should 
stop immediately his policy of war against the people of nicaragua 
and should let the contras be dismantled from honduran territory 
ortega said 
most contras as the usbacked antisandinista rebels are 
known moved to camps in neighboring honduras after us military 
aid ended and their leaders and the sandinistas signed a truce in 
march 1988 
however pockets of contras still roam northern and central 
provinces and occasional skirmishes are reported nonlethal us 
aid continues 
recalling the first few months of the revolution ortega gave 
guarded praise to mrs chamorro and robelo who were members of the 
junta of national reconstruction that took control after the 
sandinistas entered managua on july 19 1979 
mrs chamorro a powerful symbol of the upperclass stand against 
somoza resigned from the junta a year later and said the 
sandinistas goals were incompatible with her hopes for a democratic 
nicaragua 
she now is a leading opposition presidential contender according 
to polls 
ortega said mrs chamorros decision not to accept conditions 
that the gringos wanted to impose on the junta was firm and 
courageous 
barricada the official newspaper of the sandinista front 
published a special edition with an editorial that called the last 
10 years exciting agitated tormenting hard and sweet 
the newspapers front page had no stories only two huge pictures 
of happy people and in big red letters ten years of change and 
victory better days are coming 
of robelo ortega said he recalled his attraction to common 
people and said he even wore the redandblack kerchief of the 
sandinista front and sang workers to power part of a 
revolutionary song 
but he couldnt make the jump said ortega 
robelo a millionaire industrialist joined the directorate of 
the nicaraguan resistance the umbrella organization of 
antisandinista guerrilla and political forces he resigned last 
year to run a party that tentatively plans to take part in next 
years elections 
a recent swedishsponsored economic study said per capita output 
in nicaragua last year was 300 making it the poorest nation in the 
hemisphere the sandinistas have maintained the 300 figure is far 
too low

i wouldnt call it a threatening letter i would call it an 
affectionate letter but a bit rambling he said 
andrews said he also expressed to his friend that he was going 
to harm miss schaeffer but the detective said it was unclear to 
investigators why bardo allegedly might have wanted to harm the 
actress 
there is an indication that there was an ongoing attempt to 
contact her andrews said adding that bardo had called miss 
schaeffers agency several times in the past 
bardo appeared to be very tired and dirty when discovered on the 
freeway said tucson police spokesman sgt paul hallums bardo 
formerly worked at a tucson fastfood restaurant and reportedly 
attended a tucson high school he said 
the guys real passive with everybody hes being passive and 
polite with everybody hallums said 
hallums said the man was wearing a white tshirt jeans and 
sandals had dark hair kind of shaggy 
neighbor irene tishkoff said tuesday she saw a bookish 
looking man with curly brown hair flashing the photo of miss 
schaeffer hours before the slaying 
he stopped me and he pulled this picture out of a large manila 
envelope packed with junk and it was her she said he asked if 
i had seen this girl in the neighborhood i said what and just 
turned away i thought it was strange 
police found no indication that miss schaeffer was being 
harassed andrews said a former boyfriend was questioned but was 
not a suspect 
she didnt have an enemy in the world said her agent 
jonathan howard she was a very successful young actress on the 
ascent getting job after job i cant believe this has happened 
witnesses said the attacker was seen standing outside the 
twostory building at least since 630 am tuesday 
i was in the kitchen making coffee and i heard what sounded 
like a car backfiring said richard goldman a television 
screenwriter who lives across the street after the pop there 
were two bloodcurdling screams 
i looked out the window and i saw a guy in a yellow shirt 
jogging at a fair clip as if it was ball four and he was running 
to first base 
neighbor kenneth newell rushed to help miss schaeffer i felt 
her pulse i couldnt feel any he said 
the actress was pronounced dead at cedarssinai medical center 
about 30 minutes later said hospital spokeswoman peggy shaff 
miss schaeffer appeared on my sister sam on cbs from 1986 to 
1988 playing patti russell the younger sister of miss dawbers 
character sam 
words cannot express the grief and rage that i feel miss 
dawber said in a statement from new york 
miss schaeffer once moved into miss dawbers california home so 
the two could develop a convincing relationship for the show 
a native of eugene ore miss schaeffer worked as a model in 
japan in 1984 doing commercials and magazine covers upon her 
return to the united states she took a regular role in the abc soap 
opera one life to live 
she also appeared in the woody allen film radio days and an 
episode of the nbc series amazing stories 
she was most recently seen in the feature film scenes from the 
class struggle in beverly hills and had just completed a 
costarring role in one point of view an upcoming feature 
directed by dyan cannon 
miss schaeffer returned recently from italy where she had a 
supporting role in a tv miniseries about the hijacking of the cruise 
ship achille lauro 
the attack was chillingly reminiscent of the one suffered by 
raging bull actress theresa saldana in 1982 when a deluded fan 
seriously wounded her with a hunting knife outside her west 
hollywood home 
similarly former beatle john lennon was slain dec 8 1980 by a 
deranged fan outside his new york apartment and after taxi 
driver established her fame actress jodie foster attracted the 
attention of john hinkley jr who tried to assassinate president 
reagan in 1981 to impress her

president bush on thursday will seek to commit 
the united states to building a manned outpost on the moon and 
sending astronauts to mars an administration official said 
wednesday 
bush will not outline a specific proposal but will endorse the 
concept of a moonmars mission which was recommended by vice 
president dan quayle and the national space council that quayle 
chairs said the official 
the official revealed the presidents decision on condition of 
anonymity 
bushs announcement will come in a major space policy speech 
outlining his goals to revitalize the nations space program on the 
20th anniversary of mans first visit to the moon 
the speech will include no timetables or cost estimates the 
official said 
another official said bush will ask quayle and the national space 
council to flesh out the proposal with specifics 
the moonmars recommendation originated in the national 
aeronautics and space administration which sent it to the president 
via quayle and the council 
bushs speech thursday will include a pretty general two or 
threesentence kind of goal white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said earlier 
as he weighed his decision bush spoke to quayle about the matter 
on tuesday and planned to discuss it with him again wednesday by 
telephone from california where the vice president is on a speaking 
tour 
theres a lot of analysis that needs to be considered 
especially in terms of cost to maintain a human outpost on the 
moon and to mount a mars mission fitzwater told reporters it is 
a costly venture and those aspects need to be considered 
at nasa dr frank martin the head of the exploration office 
said such a project would more than double the current nasa budget 
of some 13 billion a year pushing it above 2 percent of the total 
federal budget 
congressional leaders who spoke to reporters at the white house 
after meeting with bush on other topics voiced caution about the 
cost of such a proposal 
we will be anxious to come together with a program that can 
provide continued american involvement in projects of importance and 
scientific value said house speaker thomas s foley but 
obviously we also have to consider the problems that we have here at 
home we have resources that are not as unlimited as they once were 
certainly we are under very great budget restraints 
fitzwater said while bush was aware of those restraints he also 
is committed to furthering exploration of space 
bush on tuesday told reporters that any space proposal he makes 
must pass a test of fiscal sanity fiscal reasonableness 
quayle hinted at a bold bush proposal saying in san diego that 
the administration was moving toward action on another great leap 
forward in space 
he called for expanding the human presence into the solar 
system as a longterm goal and said that by the year 2000 the 
nation must be on our way to pioneering the solar system and 
establishing outposts on the moon and mars 
the recommendation before the president did not include another 
idea that had surfaced previously a joint space venture with the 
soviets two officials said

highlevel nuclear waste that will remain radioactive for 10000 
years a senior government geologist says 
department officials say the analysis by john trapp a staff 
geologist at the nuclear regulatory commission is flawed but they 
acknowledged tuesday that more study is needed before determining 
whether the site can be used 
trapp in what he called preliminary calculations said his

the louises were adamant they had been 
punished for something that wasnt their fault 
you know how much i like bingo this is my 40th wedding 
anniversary and im here and my husbands sitting at home said 
louise sharp one of about 70 players at a reinstituted game run by 
the knoxville association for the blind 
if i do something i can tell you in a split second if ive 
sinned or not said louise mccall i dont feel like ive sinned 
when i play bingo 
until midjune the two bingo veterans had been denied their 
favorite pastime for more than three months the game they attended 
this night was legal only because participants werent required to 
pay to play 
they and thousands like them are angry that their game of choice 
got caught in a vise at the same time robbing charities of a major 
source of income 
the state alcoholic beverage commission suspended all bingo 
licenses march 9 after the state supreme court ruled the games are 
lotteries which are banned by a section of the state constitution 
thats been on the books since 1835 
before that churches and other taxexempt groups could play for 
charity as long as they filed necessary paperwork but unscrupulous 
operators were taking advantage of the profit potential in 1986 
thenattorney general michael cody said less than 2 percent of 44 
million in bingo proceeds went to charity 
many players are going to games in neighboring states now that 
they cant play at home a bingo operator in bristol va said the 
crowds more or less doubled immediately after the ban went into 
effect that has waned he said but several new bingo games have 
sprung up near the border 
some tennessee operators are taking a chance of their own by 
offering free games they hope will skirt the gambling issue by 
requesting donations 
bingo fans who come to the algood rod and gun club across the 
street from the algood police department about 75 miles east of 
nashville are asked to give 20 someone who didnt pay would be 
pointed out to other patrons said owner harold chaffin they 
would probably like to know who didnt give 
the free games still give prizes although the size is determined 
by the generosity of donors attorney general charles burson said 
local prosecutors would have to examine each operation to decide 
whether to press charges 
other groups are meeting the gambling issue head on 
the benevolent bingo operators of tennessee mostly veterans 
groups spent over 25000 lobbying for a constitutional convention 
on lotteries the effort went nowhere in the general assembly which 
has adjourned for the year 
one problem with amending the constitution is that by law 
tennessee can hold a constitutional convention only every six years 
the state does not have an income tax and tax reform of some sort 
is given priority by many government officials they oppose a 
convention just on gambling because it would delay a vote on an 
income tax and they are not ready for a tax reform convention 
the bingo operators asked the states 750 registered charities to 
support the effort group president jim fuller general manager of 
american legion post 43 in tullahoma said the ban would hurt 
hundreds of legitimate charities 
its put us in a bind were trying to work around and recover 
from said the rev thomas kirk rector of the cathedral of the 
immaculate conception in memphis some of our schools were hit 
harder than others 
the school at his church derived up to 40000 a year from bingo 
kirk said to this point weve been able to operate on a surplus 
we had available but we will have to have fundraisers of other 
kinds 
st michaels catholic church in memphis averaged about 30000 a 
year said business manager diane harder were looking for other 
ways to raise that money right now the projection is that not one 
alternative will handle it it will probably have to come through 
several fundraising projects 
at st patricks catholic church 50 miles west of nashville in 
mckuen organizers of what is billed as the worlds largest barbecue 
planned a variety of fundraisers in hopes of making up for lost 
bingo revenue but they said the 135yearold latejuly picnic 
which drew 20000 people last year would likely take in only about 
half its normal amount 
the fraternal order of police lodge in bristol was raising about 
8000 a month through bingo for volunteer fire departments and 
rescue squads said kent bradford former manager we gave 1000 
each to 10 different organizations in january we spent about 
10000 on the christmas fund for food baskets a santa claus 
dinner and so forth 
since the ban the fop has lost our building which was our 
meeting place bradford said we lost everything we could do as 
a charitable organization we just lost it all

underwater scientist robert d ballard is 
becoming host of national geographic explorer on superstation 
tbs because he says the movie and television image of scientists is 
driving young people away from science careers 
were going to change the shows emphasis to more live 
exploration said ballard the man who found the titanic and the 
bismarck and recently led an expedition to a sunken roman ship that 
effort was telecast live to several hundred thousand youngsters in 
12 museums across the country 
his discovery of the nazi battleship bismarck resting upright in 
15000 feet of water about 600 miles west of brest france will be 
shown in an october episode of the weekly explorer series the 
fabled world war ii ship was sunk in a battle with british naval 
forces on may 27 1941 ballard found the ship june 8 
i want to motivate children and show them that science is a 
contact sport said ballard who will become host in september 
weve created an image that scientists are nerds and thats 
created a devastating effect on interest in science as a career 
the battle for childrens minds is between grades four to 12 
right now 50 percent of all the students in american colleges 
studying sciences are foreign students were now 17th in the world 
in science literacy behind spain hungary and ireland and 
hopelessly behind germany japan england and the scandinavian 
countries 
he warned that if more american students dont become interested 
in science the united states will slip economically industrially 
and militarily 
the image children have of scientists is that of a harebrained 
forgetful wacko that they get from movies like back to the 
future said ballard children want to fit in with their peer 
groups they dont want to look like some silly guy 
ballard is more in the mold of indiana jones he has participated 
in or led more than 60 deepsea expeditions he is a senior 
scientist in the ocean engineering department of the woods hole 
oceanographic institution head of the deep submergence laboratory 
and director of the institutions center for marine exploration 
the 50000ton bismarck was the biggest battleship launched by a 
european power and was such a threat to the allies that british 
prime minister winston churchill ordered an allout effort to sink 
the bismarck 
the bismarck sank the british battle cruiser hood on may 24 
1941 but two days later british torpedo planes damaged the ships 
steering gear and rudders the crucial battle came the next day 
the germans lost their main guns and control in the battle 
said ballard the captain ordered the ship scuttled at 10 oclock 
she was equipped with the latest in military technology and he 
didnt want the ship captured the ship was struck by more torpedoes 
at 1036 and sank three minutes later of 2200 crewmen aboard the 
bismarck only about 115 survived 
the ship capsized and its gun turrets which were held in place 
by their weight fell out she landed upright and other than the 
missing turrets and some superstructure damage she is in remarkable 
condition the nazi swastikas are still visible on her deck 
the bismarck was examined by the deepsea robot argo which 
ballard also used to find the titanic four years ago the robot is 
equipped with sonar video cameras and still cameras pictures taken 
by argo its tender and the mother ship on the surface will be used 
in the explorer program in october 
the jason project in the mediterranean sea explored a 3rd century 
roman ship and undersea volcanoes six onehour shows of the 
exploration were sent live by satellite to 12 museums in a twoweek 
period each museum had an exact replica of the control facilities 
aboard the other ship so that the youngsters saw exactly what 
ballard saw only onehalf second later 
future live television projects will take ballard to the great 
lakes to look for two ships sunk in the war of 1812 to lake 
champlain to look for a gunboat sunk in the revolutionary war to 
the pacific off okinawa to explore the japanese battleship yamata 
and to the pacific to examine the japanese aircraft carriers that 
attacked pearl harbor and were sunk in the battle of midway 
we have a large program of exploration lined up and will have 
the continued involvement of young people ballard said well 
take some children into the field but most will participate by 
telepresence it will almost be like being there because they will 
be surrounded by video pictures on the great lakes project we will 
have joy sticks in the museums that will let the youngsters actually 
control the robot

blacks pay respects to whites and whites pay 
respects to blacks in a new united methodist hymnal being 
distributed to congregations across the country 
the mutual consideration is reflected in the lyrics as well as in 
the broad range of selections from europeanderived classics to 
slave spirituals 
female also gets included along with male in the language about 
people such as substituting all for men but references to 
god and jesus remain mostly male 
there were tradeoffs says the rev carlton r young editor 
of the hymnal whose repertoire of 625 numbers includes 300 new 
ones many are evangelicalstyle gospel songs and black spirituals 
it was a process of giveandtake which is how methodists have 
stayed methodists all these years he said in a telephone 
interview from his nashville tenn office 
for example in the newly included black spiritual every time i 
feel the spirit the ethnic pronunciation is ever time ah fil de 
spirit but the book puts the song in standard english 
to put it in dialect would have been very ill advised said 
the rev william farley smith a harlem pastor and member of the 
hymn committee that compiled the new book replacing a 1966 version 
that would have turned off whites and made it so only ethnics 
would sing it this would detract from the original intent and be 
discrimination in reverse it would have left out all the anglos 
theyre not used to the ethnic pronunciations but blacks know 
it already and sing it in the book we put the words in proper 
english so as to accommodate whites 
on the other hand several hymns were modified to eliminate 
antiblack implications such as getting rid of metaphors equating 
white with purity or godliness 
however the big change is the inclusion of 122 revivalstyle 
gospel songs and black spirituals many of them widely popular but 
new to the book and also 17 hispanic hymns 14 of asian origin and 
seven from american indians 
about 4 million copies of the new hymnal are expected to be in 
hands of most of the 38000 congregations of the 9 millionmember 
denomination by octorber 
its the first time for spanishlanguage hymns to be included 
songs such as camina pueblo de dios walk on o people of god 
and mantos ye palmas filled with excitement lyrics also are 
given in english 
smith pastor of harlems st marks united methodist church 
said the books emphasis on spirituals and gospel hymns will help 
regain the evangelistic fire marking methodisms origins 
we started out as a tentrevival church but have tended to 
become cathedrals of liturgical formality he said now were 
going to recapture our old spirit and the book will help do that 
among familiar but newly included gospel songs are i surrender 
all nothing but the blood of jesus in the garden pass 
me not o gentle savior and shall we gather at the river 
among newly included spirituals are swing low sweet chariot 
go down moses this little light of mine its me its 
me o lord standing in the need of prayer and oh mary dont you 
weep 
however the book retains traditional favorites including 60 by 
methodist founder john wesley and his brother charles 
in many cases selections were mae by popular demand as happened 
when a wave of protests reversed a committee move to drop the 
martialstyle onward christian soldiers and battle hymn of the 
republic 
as for response from members now that the book is getting into 
the pew racks the rev richard s parker of the suburban largely 
white united methodist church in port washington ny said most 
people find its better theyre getting used to it and like it 
they feel the process of producing it was fair that the church 
listened to them 
however a member valerie lau objected to the inclusive 
language for people it was just to satisfy a group of womens 
libbers and im a traditionalist but this too will pass 
smith whose black harlem congregation was one of the pilot 
churches trying out the hymnal said weve been using it all 
along and it has worn very well our people are very happy with 
it 
the rev warren danskin of manhattans john street church 
americas oldest methodist church said that from the sampling so 
far our folks are very pleased 
young a church music scholar who has led the project for five 
years of committee sessions and church hearings across the country 
to get input from members said theres a great surge of interest 
in this hymnal the people know that what is there is what they want 
to sing

simply put the question was who should be 
counted as a person and who if anybody should not but theres 
nothing simple about it 
the senate voted one answer and in effect invited the supreme 
court to decide whether it was right or wrong 
that happened because in the arithmetic of congressional 
reapportionment every question becomes complex contentious and 
politically charged 
the point at issue in senate debate on a new immigration bill was 
whether illegal aliens should be counted in the process that will 
reallocate house seats among states after the 1990 census there 
could be enough of them to shift seats away from at least five 
states to sun belt states with large numbers of illegal residents 
nobody is certain because counting illegal aliens is a hard thing 
to do given the fact that they dont want to be spotted by the 
government then again the census bureau maintains that not 
including them and still coming up with an accurate 1990 population 
count would be even more difficult a census of only legal 
residents cannot be done as accurately as a census of all 
residents according to census bureau testimony to congress 
after the 1980 census the government estimated that there were 
257 million people in the united states illegally there were other 
guesses some of them far higher the government made no attempt to 
count them out in the redistricting process indeed the two 
previous administrations decided that the constitution required that 
the census cover illegal aliens along with citizens 
there is not likely to be any change in that prior to the 1990 
census next spring the senate has passed an immigration bill 
including an amendment that would cut illegal aliens from the 
redistricting numbers but it is not likely to clear congress before 
the next years national head count 
sen richard shelby dala proposed and won the immigration 
bill amendment that is supposed to exclude illegal aliens from the 
redistricting process it would give secretary of commerce robert 
mosbacher the assignment of adjusting the census figures so that 
illegal aliens dont count for purposes of redistributing house 
seats it does not come with instructions so the department would 
have to figure out how 
shelbys amendment says only that the secretary is to make such 
adjustments in total population figures as may be necessary using 
such methods and procedures as the secretary determines feasible and 
appropriate to keep illegal aliens from being counted in 
congressional reapportionment 
that task would be perilous politically since it would involve 
taking house seats away from some states and giving them to others 
all on the basis of estimates with 435 seats in the house every 
representative gained by a state is a representative lost by another 
opponents of the shelby amendment led by sen edward m kennedy 
dmass said it was unconstitutional as well as unworkable the 
framers of the constitution intended to count all persons kennedy 
said 
the constitution itself says the apportionment of the house is to 
be determined on the basis of the whole number of free persons 
excluding indians and counting every five slaves as three persons 
that was amended after the civil war to say that the apportionment 
of house seats will be based on the whole number of persons in 
each state 
neither the original article nor the amendment mentions 
citizenship in connection with apportionment although the term 
citizens is used in some other provisions opponents of the 
amendment said that showed the authors of both documents wanted 
everybody counted for purposes of apportionment 
but sen alan k simpson rwyo said the people who wrote the 
documents had no concept of illegal aliens because there werent any 
in their time 
that came later with immigration restrictions that began in 1875 
sen bob dole of kansas the republican leader said the question 
should be put squarely to the supreme court he said it is unfair to 
count illegal aliens in reapportionment it just does not make any 
sense dole said it does violate the constitutional principle

rather than leaving the decisions and expenses to 
their survivors increasing numbers of americans are arranging for 
their funerals in advance 
funeral directors insurance companies and other organizations 
have responded with a broad array of programs and services to meet 
the increased demand 
last year says the american association of retired persons 
sales of preneed funeral contracts surpassed 800000 in this 
country 
the basic idea of planning funeral arrangements ahead of time 
makes a lot of sense the association says in a special report it 
has published on the subject that way you can make choices in an 
orderly way that might otherwise have to be dealt with by others in 
haste amid trying emotional circumstances 
but the aarp urges that you proceed with care before you start 
writing checks for a specific package 
should you preplan your funeral definitely the association 
says aarp recommends everyone preplan but cautions consumers 
about prepaying their funerals there are risks 
first of all it notes illadvised commitments can be costly 
with the average cost of a traditional funeral approaching 3000 
that outlay covers such items and services as a casket memorial 
services and the use of a funeral home it typically does not 
include other basics such as a burial site limousines and flowers 
which all together can double the total cost or more 
of course any funeral arrangement should first suit your 
religious and emotional preferences however says the aarp a 
prepaid arrangement should also make sense practically and 
financially 
for example it says you may well want to look for a plan that 
offers flexibility should you change your mind in the future about 
where you want the funeral to be held 
most but not all preneed plans offer some portability or the 
ability to move with you the association points out 
the longer you expect to live after you sign a contract it 
observes the more inflation protection you probably will want 
this protection can take the form of a guarantee from a funeral 
director that the services will be provided at no further charge no 
matter what the going rate is at the time 
or the money you put up can be invested for you through a trust 
setup or insurance policy that allows it to grow over time there 
are some preneed plans which earn no interest the aarp says 
dont waste your money on these 
even supposing that your plan keeps you ahead of future increases 
in funeral costs there is another question to be considered in 
advance 
in cases where more funds build up than are needed to cover 
funeral costs some plans turn the excess over to your survivors 
while others provide for the funeral director to receive it 
in addition to the financial arrangements the aarp says its 
important to shop carefully for the funeral services themselves 
which can vary widely in price and details from one establishment to 
another 
federal trade commission rules require funeral directors to 
provide itemized price lists that can be used in comparisonshopping 
you can also check with government authorities and consumer 
agencies to help determine the reputation and reliability of a given 
funeral director 
visit a minimum of two funeral homes the aarp advises 
its important to shop around for the best prices on the 
merchandise and services you select 
dont allow anyone to push you into purchasing merchandise you 
dont want or cant afford

among the more riveting sideshows in 
british politics is edward heaths war of words with the woman who 
took his job 
the former prime minister has been out of office for 15 years 
but his bitterness toward margaret thatcher seems undiminished 
in britain former prime ministers tend to fade away into 
lifetime sinecures in the house of lords 
not ted heath from his seat in the house of commons he erupts 
periodically against the woman he believes has betrayed the 
conservative partys principles and his dream of european unity 
europe is only the latest in a long run of contentious issues 
heath has attacked mrs thatchers economics her foreign policies 
her attitude to the poor he has called his relationship with her 
a polite nihilism she shrugs and says we all know ted 
they are a study in contrasts heath the consensus man 
flagbearer of the benevolent onenation conservatism of the 
victorian prime minister benjamin disraeli mrs thatcher the 
hardline freemarket radical a consensushater and proud of it 
she is a roundtheclock political being with few outside 
interests he in office was a yachtsman and sometimes symphony 
conductor and still is now he has taken up cultivating orchids an 
accomplished pianist he owns two steinways and has written books on 
music sailing travel and christmas carols 
at 73 he exudes a fleshy vigor topped off by a grand mane of 
white hair and the famous eartoear smile he is too partisan to be 
regarded as an elder statesman but on european issues his opinions 
command attention 
it was heath who brought britain into the european economic 
community in 1973 after years of resistance both at home and in the 
france of the late charles de gaulle now the eec is striving for 
greater unity through a single european currency and central bank 
and harmonized social policies and heath wholeheartedly supports 
the idea 
his latest broadside against mrs thatcher was triggered by her 
claim that the eec was bent on rolling back her freemarket 
revolution by forcing socialism upon britain and engulfing it in 
bureaucracy 
on television he accused mrs thatcher of an attempt to mislead 
the public then in an interview with the associated press at his 
home on the grounds of salisbury cathedral he amplified 
this is nonsense it cant possibly be true if the people 
of this country elect another labor government they may get 
socialism a large part of the eec is not socialist and isnt going 
to support socialism now 
he said he believed mrs thatcher was confusing socialism 
with the social order which the eec wants to bring about by 
harmonizing social welfare and which he says the conservative party 
has believed in since the mid1800s 
for conservatives proud of their tradition of party unity the 
squabbling is an embarrassment but heath is unrelenting on radio 
and television panels on the international lecture circuit and in 
the house of commons where his debating skills always draw a good 
crowd he warns that britain is in danger of becoming a secondclass 
member of the european club 
my view of europe is to bring about an everincreasing 
unity inside the community a way of life in which you work 
together share each others benefits and problems and enable people 
to have a much higher standard of living than they would otherwise 
have and put the community in a position where it can influence 
international affairs heath says 
if britain doesnt want to take part they will be left 
outside the other 11 will go on without us and we shall then become 
a secondrate second tier in the community 
critics say heath is still nursing wounds inflicted when he was 
dumped as party leader in 1975 in favor of mrs thatcher the first 
woman to lead a political party in britain a year earlier he had 
lost the third of his four electoral battles against archrival 
harold wilson of the labor party 
i think ted felt desperately and totally betrayed by the 
party says lord whitelaw who also lost to mrs thatcher in the 
party leadership fight 
this rather shy rather withdrawn man felt deeply affronted 
whitelaw said in a television interview in april certainly he 
would mind more than most people who had been beaten by a woman 
most men wouldnt like it but i think he minded more 
he added that heath a bachelor had no wife to say whats the 
good of feeling so bitter about it 
the true extent of heaths bitterness is likely to be revealed in 
his forthcoming memoirs 
i would have thought there would be massive interest in them 
wouldnt you he asked with a tiny smile and the promise im 
not going to be discreet

contrary to church trends toward loftier music 
united methodists are turning to some foottapping gospel songs that 
the denomination previously shunned 
such hearty spirituals as go down moses and shall we gather 
at the river are additions to the churchs new hymnal now being 
distributed to congregations nationwide 
its a serious reformation in united methodist hymnody says 
the rev carlton r young of nashville tenn the hymnbook editor 
we have made a profound turnaround to give people the songs they 
like to sing 
many of them such as in the garden and softly and tenderly 
jesus is calling had been excluded from previous denominational 
hymnals as too sentimental 
but they and other popular gospel songs spurned by musicologists 
and generally omitted from formal church repertoires are in the new 
book along with the longtime classic numbers 
weve still got the highbrow stuff bach mendelssohn and 
vaughan williams everything we had young said in a telephone 
interview but weve expanded it to include that which had not 
been included 
before weve had an elistist hymbook and such musical taste 
came at a high premium now weve put the premium on that which 
people can enjoy and sing readily alongside the good music 
copies of the new hymnal are rolling out to congregations from 
the churchs publishing house in nashville tenn with 3 million 
expected to be delivered by september and an additional million by 
october an unprecedented 4 million 
thats almost one for every two members of the 9 millionmember 
denomination the nations second largest protestant body 
most news stories about the book which is replacing a 1966 
version have played up changes to make lyrics more sexually 
inclusive of people such as changing good christian men 
rejoice to good christian friends rejoice 
most such alterations are submerged in the texts such as a 
phrase in hark the herald angels sing changed from pleased 
with man with men to dwell to pleased with us in flesh to 
dwell 
masculine references are almost always retained for god and 
jesus as in come thou almighty king even the male generic 
term for humanity is kept in dear lord and father of mankind 
two hymns portray feminine attributes of god as like a mother 
eagle her broad wings described in one number as checking the fall 
of her young as they struggle to fly 
however far more dramatic than the broadened gender metaphors is 
the books opening to songs historically excluded from hymnals of 
major liturgical churches presbyterian episcopal lutheran roman 
catholic and methodist 
past exclusion of popular gospel songs and spirituals has been 
our main inadequacy young said the complaint for the last 50 
years is that we didnt have the hymns people wanted to sing 
musicologists spurned such songs young observed only the 
people liked thembut they now occupy a principal place alongside 
traditional hymns i dont think any mainline denomination has had 
the turnaround that weve had young said 
the newly incorporated songs evolved in america from revivals of 
the 19th century and out of the travail of blacks rather than from a 
european heritage which has long dominated most american hymnals 
we were slow in accepting the homegrown creations young 
said yet they are at the heart and recall of our constitutency 
theyre familiar to our people but they hadnt been in the book 
among the black spirituals included for the first time are 
swing low sweet chariot its me its me o lord this 
little light of mine tis the old ship of zion give me that old 
time religion im goin a sing when the spirit says sing and 
kum ba ya my lord 
gospel favorites newly added include marching to zion 
nothing but the blood i surrender all pass me not o 
gentle savior theres within my heart a melody leaning on 
the everlasting arms and lord of the dance 
altogether the books 625 hymns include 84 gospel songs and 38 
black spirituals a total of 122 there also are 17 spanish hymns 
offered in that language for the first time 14 asian and seven 
american indian hymns of 300 carryovers from the old book 60 are 
by founder john wesley or brother charles 
two martialstyle hymns onward christian soldier and the 
battle hymn of the republic at one point were eliminated by the 
revision committee but were reinstated in response to 11000 
protest letters 
the result of such input young said is a populist instead of 
elitist hymnbook compiled under membership influence the 
political climate will not sustain anything that does not belong 
squarely within the earshot of the average methodist 
young 63 professor of church music at emory universitys 
chandler school of theology in atlanta who took leave five years ago 
to head the hymnal revision said the book fully breathes the 
american spirit 
he said it may make the church a more lively place

they wanted to stir up debate play the 
provocateurs take an idea to its limits and they certainly did get 
peoples attention 
but when congress completes work on a national service bill 
there is virtually no chance it will include the radical proposal 
advanced by sen sam nunn and rep dave mccurdy to require military 
or community service in return for student financial aid 
where the two democrats envisioned a lofty new definition of 
citizenship critics foresaw indentured servitude for lowincome 
students 
few question the value of public service senators in fact have 
jumped onto the bandwagon with a host of alternatives that have 
turned out to be more appealing to members than the nunnmccurdy 
bill itself 
objections to the nunnmccurdy plan have ranged from president 
bushs stand against any incentives for voluntarism to pentagon 
murmurings that the proposal could undermine the volunteer army 
perhaps the most widespread concern was expressed by education 
secretary lauro cavazos when he said the plan raises questions about 
equity 
liberal rep william ford dmich writing of the bill in the 
chronicle of higher education laid it on the line bluntly it 
holds the educational aspirations of the poor hostage to public 
service while excusing the affluent 
and conservative sen john mccain rariz called it 
incredibly unfair to penalize somebody because of an accident of 
birth frankly i dont know what they were thinking of 
nunn dga introducing his bill last january said it was time 
to awaken a new spirit of citizenship and obligation in america 
mccurdy dokla said the idea was to appeal to the broad values 
of citizenship rather than the narrow views of selfinterest 
so they proposed that young people spend one to two years in 
education social conservation or military service public safety 
work vista or the peace corps in return participants would receive 
10000 to 12000 a year to be used for college job training or a 
down payment on a home service would be required to qualify for 
student aid 
the senate labor and human resources committee is planning to 
complete work on a 200 million to 400 million national service 
bill before congress breaks aug 4 for its summer recess 
aides say it will have many components including one linking 
public service to student aid that stems in part from the 
nunnmccurdy proposal however it will not make student financial 
aid contingent on service or in any way dismantle the existing 
system of grants and loans 
the section is expected to combine elements of nunnmccurdy with 
a parttime national guardtype service program proposed by sens 
barbara mikulski dmd and claiborne pell dri 
the option of a parttime commitment would mean participants 
would not have to postpone college in addition the program would 
be purely voluntary since lowincome students could get financial 
aid without participating 
in the house the education and labor committee is expected to 
draft a national service bill this fall against a backdrop of heavy 
lobbying by labor unions concerned about volunteers usurping their 
turf and education groups opposed to linking service to student aid 
a highranking committee aide said members have universally rejected 
the nunnmccurdy approach and may spurn any plan even a purely 
voluntary one that links the two 
nunn and mccurdy profess to be satisfied at this point with the 
impact of their proposal on the senate our whole purpose was to 
challenge and to be somewhat provocative in our approach mccurdy 
said in an interview plus ours was the only one that dealt with 
the military 
nunns spokesman scott williams said nunn never expected to win 
acceptance of his sweeping vision on the first try this is only 
the beginning of what we see as a long haul he said 
it could be argued that bush actually started the national 
service debate with his thousand points of light campaign theme 
and a campaign promise of a 100 million volunteer program 
last month with that in mind bush announced a youth engaged in 
service foundation which would receive 25 million a year in 
federal money to spur americans to volunteer for social service 
however he has not sent any legislation to capitol hill 
frustrating the efforts of committee members in both chambers who 
would like to see the presidents initiative included in the major 
national service bill 
as soon as we get something in writing well try to work it 
in said a senate aide who spoke on condition of anonymity 
but while lawmakers are generally receptive to bushs ideas the 
feeling is not mutual service is its own reward bush told a 
group of 3000 students last month he has said he does not support 
programs that offer stipends or payment subsidies or use student 
aid funds to pay for volunteer service 
several components of the expected senate bill could lead to a 
confrontation with the white house among them the pellmikulski 
section expansions of vista and volunteer programs under the older 
americans act and a fulltime youth service corps that would pay 
participants or give them education benefits 
based on bills introduced by sens christopher dodd dconn and 
daniel patrick moynihan dny the corps would be open to high 
school graduates and dropouts aged 1625 participants would work on 
public lands or at government agencies hospitals schools nursing 
homes lawenforcement agencies or nonprofit service organizations 
bush is reported to favor one element of the projected senate 
bill a student community service plan sponsored by committee 
chairman edward kennedy dmass the program would involve 
elementary secondary and college students and outofschool youth 
in tutoring assisting the elderly antidrug abuse efforts work in 
daycare centers homeless shelters and food banks academic credit 
could be earned

the world either has too much food or it 
doesnt have enough famine is always a crop failure away 
right now say agriculture department analysts concerns are 
growing as they did a decade ago that hunger will march across 
the world but in most of the 1980s there were rising food 
stockpiles depressed prices and worries about farmers producing too 
much 
a team of usda economists has prepared a collection of papers 
about the world food situation and how it seems to be shaping up by 
the early part of the 21st century 
one view shared by many and described in the usda report is 
that a large part of the current worry about declining food reserves 
stems from decisions by american and european policymakers eager to 
reduce costly stockpiles 
but the global food supply and concerns about it run in cycles 
the analysts said despite favorable longterm trends showing growth 
in production the world always seems to be facing a crisis either 
of scarcity or of plenty policy decisions must be made either way 
in the last four decades world food production has more than 
doubled exceeding the rate of population growth that is a global 
statistic and there are numerous exceptions where famine has been 
rampant the sahel region of africa is a current example 
t kelley white of the agriculture departments economic research 
service noted in his summary of the reports that world grain 
production has held close to its longterm trend for a long time in 
other words grain production has been quite stable around that 
trend 
also the margin between too much and too little food is quite 
narrow white said in most years the worlds population tends 
to consume what is produced that is accumulation and drawdown in 
global stocks from year to year are relatively minor 
most food is consumed in the country where it is produced and a 
relatively small amount of the world total goes into international 
trade 
for example white said grains are the most widely traded group 
of commodities but only 12 percent of world production was exported 
and imported in the years 1984 through 1986 much of the trade is 
between net exporting countries to add variety to diets and to 
overcome seasonal shortages 
the number of net foodexporting countries is small and they 
tend to be highly developed highincome lowpopulationgrowth 
countries he said the vast majority of the worlds population 
lives in chronic fooddeficit countries 
many of the latter are also poor underdeveloped and limited in 
capacity to use commercial food imports to offset domestic shortages 
the concern about too little food is in reality primarily a 
concern about the vulnerability of the poor developing countries 
with high rates of population growth often highly variable domestic 
agricultural production and limited means of importing food white 
said 
why considering the huge crop surpluses of just a few years ago 
have concerns emerged again about the worlds ability to feed itself 
during the last two years world grain stocks have been drawn 
down to what many consider dangerously low levels white said 
the drawdown has resulted from a combination of policy actions 
primarily by the united states and the eec european economic 
community to restrict production and move burdensome stocks onto 
world markets through efforts to maintain market competitiveness 
white continued the effect of these policy actions was 
reinforced by the severe drought in north america in 1988 and early 
1989 in the united states and argentina which significantly reduced 
production 
but both of these factors policy actions and drought are 
shortterm he said neither seems to indicate a longterm change in 
the worlds ability to produce food 
however such phenomena do remind the world of the thinness of 
the margin between planty and scarcity and they focus attention on 
longerterm trends that could limit growth of food production over 
the long haul white said 
much is being said about the growing environmental concerns that 
plague vast areas of the world the abuse and degradation of 
agricultural land water and air pollution and the use of chemicals 
that can cause harm 
world population growth rates have declined but white said the 
population base in lowincome developing countries is so large that 
growth is still significant annually the global population grows 
by about 90 million 
therefore the additional food production required just to 
maintain percapita consumption levels will remain high well into 
the 21st century he said 
it is true that the supply of land and water for agricultural 
production is limited and in some cases being degraded white 
said but there are technologies available now that offer solutions 
on balance it appears that in the next two to three decades 
the longerterm phenomena that are causing concern do not pose an 
insurmountable obstacle to the world food system white said in 
this time frame food crises will likely continue to be localized 
and to be the consequence of policy induced inflexibilities in the 
world trading system and lack of effective demand rather than of 
the failure of supply 
in the longer term he said there are threats to the productive 
capacity of the world 
however there is little doubt that there are means by which 
such dangers can be avoided and there is time to implement these 
actions white said

financial institutions and savings bond and note owners will 
now only have to recall an easy to remember 403020 formula to 
determine how long bonds will earn interest the department said 
tuesday in a statement 
for instance it said 
series e savings bonds issued before december 1965 will stop 
earning interest exactly 40 years from their issue dates 
series e bonds series ee bonds and savings notes freedom 
shares issued after november 1965 will stop earning interest 
exactly 30 years from their issue dates outstanding series h bonds 
issued between 1959 and 1979 also have a 30year final maturity 
series hh bonds issued since 1980 will stop earning interest 
20 years from their issue dates 
in addition to ending bondholder confusion the department said 
the new formula would reduce its adminstrative costs by reducing 
questions from bond owners asking when their bonds will stop earning 
interest 
it said within the next year as new bonds are printed and 
issued the final maturity will appear on the face of the bonds

estimated 450 nonunion jobs in an effort to make the railroad more 
competitive 
employees affected range from clerical workers to upper level 
management in all 12 states where santa fe operates said spokesman

the commerce department has ruled that imports 
of unprocessed fresh chilled and frozen pork from canada are being 
subsidized by about 3 cents per pound a ruling that could mean new 
duties of the same amount 
the departments determination announced tuesday now goes to 
the international trade commission which has 45 days to decide 
whether the imports injure the us pork industry 
if the commission agrees with the commerce finding the 
department will order the bureau of customs to collect 
countervailing duties on the imports to offset the subsidies 
canadian pork imports that would be subject to such duties were 
about 341 million last year 
the departments investigation was triggered by a january 
complaint from the national pork producers council the national 
pork council women conagra red meats inc dakota pork industries 
inc farmstead foods ibp inc illinois pork corp thorn apple 
valley and wilson foods inc 
the department said its investigation did not include processed 
or preserved pork products such as canned hams cured bacon 
sausage ground pork or live swine it noted it had found imports of 
live swine to be subsidized in a 1985 investigation 
the canadian embassy said it would use the dispute resolution 
procedures of the new uscanadian free trade agreement to press 
its view that the department is wrong 
the embassy said us law is wrong under international trade 
rules to count as a subsidy incomestabilization arrangements 
designed to smooth out fluctuations in farmers incomes also us 
law should not automatically assume that any benefits from such 
plans are fully passed through to the pork processor the embassy 
said

intels corp 25 percent drop in its 
secondquarter profit was another sign that the semiconductor 
industry faces a significant downturn according to some industry 
analysts 
the slowdown is now a reality said michael boss an analyst 
with dataquest inc of san jose we saw the seeds of it in the 
first quarter but its taking a little longer to play out in terms 
of revenue 
boss said his company predicted the downturn last year and 
doesnt expect an end until the second quarter of 1990 many 
semiconductor companies will experience negative growth through the 
next two quarters he said 
intel on tuesday reported its secondquarter earnings fell to 99 
million or 53 cents a share from 130 million or 73 cents a 
share in the same period last year revenue rose 3 percent to 747 
million intels stock finished the day down 250 at 2887 
the companys report followed an earnings and sales decline 
reported by advanced micro devices of sunnyvale last week and 
indications by a key industry economic gauge that orders may be 
gradually slowing 
secondquarter earnings by amd fell by more than half while sales 
fell 11 percent jerry sanders amds chief executive predicted 
revenues will remain flat for the rest of the year 
while the industrys booktobill ratio released last week 
for the month of june reached an alltime high the order rate 
suggested the industry may slow down gradually later this year the 
ratio measures orders vs shipments 
junes 16 percent increase in orders was below the average 31 
percent increase over the past 10 years according to thomas 
thornhill an analyst for shearson lehman hutton inc in san 
francisco 
some analysts think the apparent slowdown will be shortlived 
and is likely a strong seasonal drop 
analyst mel phelps with hambrecht amp quist in san francisco said 
intels earning were partially hurt by a 17 million charge due to a 
planned factory shutdown and without it earnings per share would 
have climbed another 7 cents he said 
the company took the charge to cover costs associated with the 
1990 planned shutdown of a wafer fabrication plant in livermore the 
company is attempting to transfer the plants 400 workers to other 
locations 
phelps anticipates strong intel sales through the end of the 
year partially because of the introduction of new microproccessor 
products and total revenues of 31 billion compared with 28 
billion last year 
analyst michael stark of robertson stephens amp co in san 
francisco said intels report was the sign of at least a summer 
slowdown he expects it to be shortlived and for sales to continue 
strong growth through the rest of the year although not by as much 
as he would like 
its raised a flag of caution in some peoples minds we really 
dont think its more but its clearly the full brunt of a 
seasonal weakening he said 
but analyst rick whittington of kidder peabody amp co in new york 
said the industry was heading into a quasirecession or even an 
absolute recession 
whittington who has been advising clients to sell intel stock 
for the last six weeks said intels introduction of the new 
microproccesors strategically makes sense but they run the risk 
in the short term of experiencing a classic downturn and as they 
shift gears they could be blasted away with margins really sharply 
intel said new orders received for advanced microprocessors were 
strong continuing a recovery from an inventory correction that 
occurred in the fourth quarter of 1988 secondquarter orders also 
were higher than those in the first 
dataquests boss said that because of the relative strength of 
the years first two quarters the worldwide and north american 
semiconductor markets will end the year with about 15 percent 
growth compared with 34 percent in 1988 next year should see flat 
growth he said

the head of the commodity futures trading 
commission says it is too soon to impose restrictions on dual 
trading the system in which brokers can trade for themselves and 
their customers at the same time 
at a hearing tuesday on legislation that would reauthorize the 
15yearold agency cftc chairwoman wendy gramm said it was 
conducting a study on dual trading that is to be completed in 
october 
since our analysis is not yet complete we believe that a 
statutory restriction based on specific volume levels would be 
premature she told exasperated members of the house subcommittee 
on conservation credit and rural development 
in dual trading floor brokers at a futures exchange may trade 
for their own accounts and that of their customers a practice that 
critics claim creates a conflict of interest 
the reauthorizing legislation sponsored by subcommittee chairman 
glenn english dokla and rep e thomas coleman of missouri the 
ranking republican would place sharp restrictions on dual trading 
in the futures markets 
englishs subcommittee began an investigation of dual trading in 
response to revelations in january of an undercover fbi probe of 
alleged abuses by as many as 100 traders at the chicago board of 
trade and the chicago mercantile exchange the nations two largest 
futures markets 
the proposed legislation would bar dual trading except for 
futures that have an average daily trading volume of fewer than 
7000 contracts 
the legislation also would require exchanges to adopt procedures 
allowing them to reconstruct the times of trades to the nearest 
30second interval an accurate reconstruction of the brokers terms 
and time of a trade known as an audit trail allows investigators 
to determine whether brokers are abusing dual trading rules 
because no system can detect every type of trade violation said 
ms gramm we believe that a careful analysis is necessary before 
increasing the trade timing standard to 30 seconds or less 
english however noted that the cftc conducted 14 studies on 
audit trails in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 
theyve just about studied everything to death said the 
chairman its time that you act 
on other topics ms gramm told subcommittee members that her 
agency had little more than a consulting role in last weeks 
emergency action on soybean futures in chicago 
ms gramm said her agency was now reviewing the emergency order 
by the chicago board of trade for soybean traders to liquidate large 
holdings 
while cbot officials consulted her agency before issuing the 
order ms gramm indicated little other action was taken by the 
cftc which regulates futures and commodity options markets 
rep david r nagle diowa asked ms gramm what she did after 
cbot officials notified her that they were ordering all traders to 
reduce their july contract soybean holdings to 1 million bushels by 
the close of trading thursday 
i thanked them for the information said ms gramm adding 
that she neither approved nor discouraged the action under repeated 
questioning by subcommittee members however ms gramm conceded 
that no opposition was a form of approval 
i dont find your answers very confidenceinspiring said 
nagle 
ms gramm maintained that under law the cbot and other exchanges 
are selfregulatory and bear the first responsibility to maintain 
orderly trading in and liquidation of futures contracts 
several subcommittee members criticized the cftc for a 
businessasusual type of approach after ms gramm said no major 
legislative changes were being sought despite ongoing probes at 
commodities exchanges in chicago and new york as well as the soybean 
affair at the cbot 
english said during a break in the hearing that he was dismayed 
by the attitude of the agencys officials 
the cftc has a great deal of authority but they dont seem 
willing to use it he added

the alar controversy has spread to the 
cherry crop with south korea and taiwan virtually halting imports 
of washington cherries even though cherry industry officials say the 
chemical was not used on the 1989 crop 
several large containers of washington cherries are reportedly 
stalled in a south korean port while the south korean government 
decides whether to admit them officials said tuesday 
there has been no government action against cherry imports in 
taiwan but consumer fears have destroyed the market there 
officials said 
south korea and taiwan are small markets for washington which 
produces about onethird of the nations cherries but they had been 
doubling their cherry purchases for the past few years 
it means loss of a growing market overseas for washington 
cherries said brent heinemann a trade specialist for the 
washington state department of agriculture 
heinemann said at least two 1700box containers of washington 
cherries are sitting at the port of inchon south korea and hadnt 
cleared customs as of last week 
they may not be sold said heinemann who was on a trade 
mission to south korea last week and saw washington cherries 
disappear from markets the day after the controversy began 
ted zacher president of the chief wenatchee fruit packing 
cooperative in wenatchee said all air freight shipments of cherries 
to south korea have stopped 
we dont use alar on cherries zacher said where they got 
that information i dont know 
the washington cherry industry has scrambled to produce test 
results showing that alar is no longer used on their crop but the 
test results have not been believed or reported in south korea 
heinemann said 
the taiwanese council of agriculture should move to reassure 
consumers that us cherries are safe said bill bryant of the 
northwest horticultural council in yakima 
in a letter to the us department of agriculture last week 
bryant said that a test commissioned by the fruit industry trade 
group found no traces of alar in 10 washington cherry samples 
alar residues should not be an issue with cherries the 
letter said 
washington growers had hoped to ship 100000 20pound boxes of 
cherries to taiwan and south korea this year worth about 2 million 
wholesale bryant said 
this year well be fortunate to ship 30000 boxes bryant 
said 
even that would be a huge jump from the 7400 boxes shipped to 
the two countries last year 
alar the marketing name for daminozide leaped into the 
international picture in late february when a consumer group the 
natural resources defense council alleged in a report that eating 
apples treated with the growth regulator increased cancer risk in 
children 
alar helps make apples red and keep them crisp 
although the federal government pronounced apples safe to eat 
the resulting consumer uproar hurt domestic and international apple 
sales and caused severe economic damage to apple growers sales 
dropped so sharply the federal government recently agreed to step in 
and purchase 15 million worth of apples to help growers 
washington produces about half the nations apples 
taiwan one of washingtons largest apple markets dropped its 
apple imports dramatically as a result of the alar report 
the cherry scare is an outgrowth of a recent south korean boycott 
of florida grapefruit after a consumer group in south korea 
contended that a government study reported alar in some grapefruit 
but no one seems sure how a link was made to cherries 
a few years ago alar was used on some cherries but there is no 
alar on the 1989 crop and alar has never been used on grapefruit to 
my knowledge said bryant 
industry officials speculate that the alar rumors were started by 
agriculture interests in the two countries who are afraid of foreign 
competition 
domestic farmers in both countries are looking for any way to 
keep foreign agriculture products out of their markets bryant 
said 
washington produced about 55 million boxes of cherries this 
year worth about 100 million there are about three weeks left in 
the current season

the chicago board of trades emergency directive 
to defuse what may have been a developing corner on the soybean 
market apparently achieved its first goal uneventfully 
tuesday was the deadline for traders to reduce their holdings of 
july contracts to 3 million bushels and prices closed at the end of 
the day showing no signs of shock 
prices settled 9 cents lower to 18 cents higher the july 
contract which settled at 696 a bushel and the august delivery 
were the only two to close higher 
a second deadline under the emergency order believed aimed at a 
large soybean position of the italian agribusiness giant ferruzzi 
spa comes thursday when traders will have to reduce their july 
holdings to no more than 1 million bushels 
meanwhile the soviet union and china issued letters suggesting 
the emergency order interferes with the free markets used by world 
soybean suppliers 
such an action the soviet letter said if not very well 
economically and legally justified undermines the basic principle 
of commodity futures trading as a hedging mechanism for our sellers 
of us grain 
in washington tuesday wendy gramm chairman of the commodity 
futures trading commission said her agency has taken no stand on 
the board of trade action but will try to determine if it was 
justified 
financial analysts meanwhile presented their theories about the 
mixed price reaction in soybean trading tuesday 
supply tightness aside there are two reasons the closing 
prices were interesting said a trader who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity 
the first is that the volume in july beans was very thin 
because nobody wants to get involved that might explain the healthy 
price climb there 
as for august ferruzzi may simply have rolled their july 
contracts into the next month he said 
ferruzzi which failed in court last week to block the bot order 
has denied rumors that it attempted to illegally corner the market 
ferruzzi has said it accumulated contracts for delivery of as 
much as 24 million bushels of soybeans when only about half that 
many soybeans actually were available for sellers to honor 
commitments to meet export business commitments and ensure a 
steady flow of product for its processing plants 
this line of reasoning was disputed by the american grain 
merchant cargill which issued a statement tuesday on the issue 
while a major market participant has said that its long july 
soybean futures position was to cover its processing and export 
commitments it said those commitments could have been covered 
easily and at lower cost in cash markets 
cargill also denied rumors that it asked the board of trade to 
limit the july soybean holdings and said its own position in that 
delivery was insignificant

the eec commission wednesday said that 
great britain will raise its limit on foreign shareholders in 
rollsroyce plc to 295 percent from 15 percent 
the move followed talks with the british government challenged 
by the commission over the 15 percent ceiling 
the new limit will be valid until the end of 1992 a shorter 
period than the five years requested by britain according to claus 
ehlermann a commission spokesman 
rollsroyce a british aeroengine group was privatized in 1987 
the commission challenged the british ceiling earlier this year 
saying that the measure breached european economic community rules 
which outlaw restrictions on foreign investments except where 
national security is at stake 
the british government argued that it imposed the restrictions 
because rollsroyce was involved in military production 
the commissions inquiry into the rollsroyce share ceiling was 
triggered by west german and belgian investors who complained they 
had been forced to sell rollsroyce shares at a loss 
separately a commission official who asked not to be named 
said that the eec was still examining a similar 15 percent limit on 
foreign share holdings in british aerospace plc a british weapons 
and aircraft manufacturer 
the british government imposed the limit in 1985 when it sold its 
remaining shares in british aerospace but the government retained a 
golden share which makes the company effectively bid proof 
the spokesman would not say whether a similar arrangement to that 
concerning rollsroyce would be worked out for british aerospace

president mikhail s gorbachev said today that 
thousands of striking coal miners and other workers are urging 
railway employees to join the work stoppage and that the unrest 
threatens his economic reforms 
strikes have shut down more than 200 mines and factories in the 
countrys two top coalproducing regions official reports said in 
a report to the supreme soviet gorbachev said they have resulted in 
a 1 millionton drop in coal production 
following gorbachev to the podium legislator anatoly saunin said 
each lost work day cost millions of rubles that might otherwise help 
improve living conditions you mustnt hold a knife to the 
throat of the government he told strikers 
saunin from the donetsk region of the ukraine the countrys top 
coal region said the number of striking mines there increased from 
20 on tuesday to 58 today 
now there are reports of calls to railroad workers to join the 
strike as of aug 1 gorbachev said during the parliamentary 
session which was broadcast on television and radio 
such a development of events poses a threat to the 
implementation of plans projected by the policy of perestroika he 
said referring to his efforts to restructure the economy 
miners began walking out july 11 in siberias kuznetsk basin coal 
region workers in other industries in the region soon followed on 
saturday miners in the donetsk coal basin began walking off the job 
the miners are demanding more local control over their industry 
as well as higher wages and better living conditions 
gorbachev said he and premier nikolai i ryzhkov sent a telegram 
to miners in the ukraine assuring them that any concessions granted 
to siberian miners would apply to other mining regions as well 
he blamed some of the miners discontent on antisocialist 
elements but said he understood their basic demands 
government negotiations with strike committees have resolved most 
of the miners demands including those on pensions and overtime 
but some longerterm questions will take up to a month to settle 
and the miners are refusing any delay he said 
central authorities have so far balked at granting miners more 
control over their industry 
if the strike spreads to other sectors of the economy we may 
have to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what weve been 
doing gorbachev said without specifying what steps he would take 
he said the lost coal production could not be recovered by 
increasing the mines output because they already work at full 
capacity 
recent reports have put the total number of strikers in the 
donetsk and kuznetsk regions at more than 112000 but the number 
appeared to be rising 
because of disrupted coal deliveries the strike threatened a 
catastrophe at metallurgical and electrical power plants tass 
said 
the politburo sent to kuznetsk nikolai n slyunkov a member of 
the ruling communist party body who worked several years in the 
tractorbuilding industry and has spoken about labor discipline 
he held marathon meetings with strikers monday night and tuesday 
and addressed 30000 people in the main square of prokopyevsk 2100 
miles east of moscow 
miners in the donetsk basin are demanding a 40 percent wage 
increase for night work improved living conditions a fixed day off 
and retirement after 20 years of underground work 
they also demand that the coal mining ministry trim its 
managerial staff 
tass carried a report tuesday denying that the soviet unions 
third major coal region karaganda in kazakhstan also was on strike 
a proposed law on ending strikes and other labor conflicts is 
being rushed through the supreme soviet legislature tass said 
a spokesman for the strike committee in prokopyevsk valery 
legachev said tuesday that slyunkov promised to increase the 
areas regular food supplies by 20 to 30 percent as well as soap 
and washing powder 
izvestia the government newspaper reported tuesday that 
slyunkov promised higher pay for night work longer vacations and a 
doubling of the wholesale price of coal to pay for the benefits 
the strikes are believed to be the nations worst since the 
1920s when the country was gripped in revolution civil war and a 
power struggle records from that period are sketchy but fighting 
was widespread and industrial production was severely disrupted 
until gorbachev came to power in 1985 the official media did not 
report job actions in the soviet union underground reports 
described strikes that were of much shorter and not as widespread as 
those in kuznetsk and donetsk

housing construction reflecting lower interest 
rates rebounded 70 percent in june after falling for four straight 
months and reaching the lowest level in may since 1982 the 
government said today 
fixed mortgage rates which peaked at 1122 percent in march 
before falling to 1007 percent by the end of june had been blamed 
for the recent decline in housing activity 
the commerce department reported that new homes and apartments in 
june were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 140 million 
units up from 131 million units in may when construction fell 25 
percent 
junes increase was the highest since an 86 percent hike to 151 
million units in february 1988 it reflected a 280 percent increase 
in apartment construction the highest since a 43 percent increase 
in april 1988 
mays overall drop had been the fourth consecutive one adding up 
to the longest string of declines since activity slowed for five 
months in a row from february through june 1987 the may level was 
the slowest pace since the 130 million rate in december 1982 
the housing industry had been among the sectors of the economy 
hardest hit as interest rates edged upward over the past year with 
the federal reserve seeking to restrain economic growth to contain 
inflation 
analysts said the decline in mortgage rates had come too late to 
help the housing industry in may but thought activity would pick up 
as rates continued to fall 
construction of singlefamily homes fell 20 percent in june to 
an annual rate of 975000 units the lowest level since august 1984 
when 967000 units were recorded they fell 51 percent in may and 
47 percent in april

425000 units construction of multifamily units had risen 26 
percent in may after falling 266 percent in april 
by region overall housing construction decreased last month by 
50 percent in the northeast where starts fell to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 171000 units 
the midwest also recorded a drop down 33 percent to 238000 
units 
the west on the other hand posted a huge 214 percent increase 
to 443000 units starts in the south were up 58 percent to 548000

eastern airlines will have to wait another day 
before a federal bankruptcy judge rules on its request to release 
100 million from the companys creditors to finance a planned 
august expansion 
us bankruptcy judge burton lifland in new york adjourned until 
thursday to give the company more time to negotiate with its 
creditors committee which asked the judge tuesday to give eastern 
only 40 million to ease its cash crunch 
eastern which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
five days after it was hit march 4 with a massive strike has told 
its creditors it needs the entire 100 million and half of it 
immediately 
meanwhile eastern chairman frank lorenzo and president phil 
bakes scheduled a news conference in atlanta today no details were 
released late tuesday 
pilots union spokesman hank weber said negotiations were 
continuing with the company 
theyre still negotiating weber said denying published 
reports that the two sides were at an impasse i dont know whos 
throwing out this stuff 
company spokesman robin matell said he couldnt comment on 
negotiations 
but while eastern proposed to guarantee 2300 pilot jobs up from 
an original guarantee of 1700 the union sought guarantees for 
2400 the union also would not agree to workrule and other 
concessions in the amount sought by eastern the newspaper reported 
today 
eastern claims it can rebuild without the unions into a smaller 
efficient carrier it more than doubled its daily schedule to 220 
flights this month and had promised to fly 390 by aug 1 
however the request for release of funds by the creditors stated 
eastern plans to fly 330 flights daily in august company officials 
said the figure used by their attorneys in new york was inaccurate 
but they also acknowledged some cancellations may be necessary 
a company spokeswoman said tuesday that eastern will announce by 
early next week which if any flights will be canceled 
documents obtained by the pilots union and information from 
travel agents indicated easterns major problems are in atlanta the 
focus of its rebuilding plan 
eastern is no longer selling tickets on nearly 50 flight legs in 
and out of atlanta including to cleveland ohio and between 
several smaller cities in alabama and florida and other southern 
points 
there are some flights proposed that they cant meet the 
schedule said sal depace coowner of golden jet travel inc in 
atlanta i dont know whether its because of pilots because of 
airplanes or why 
depace chairman of the national association of retail travel 
agents said he talked to eastern management officials on tuesday 
and was told there would be a temporary reduction in flights to some 
smaller cities 
its not going to be a permanent situation as i understand 
it he said 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said no flights have been 
canceled but eastern is trying to minimize passenger 
inconvenience so we are not taking new bookings 
you have to look at where youre going to impact the most 
customers and how your crew capability and planes match up ms 
ceremsak said 
in virtually all the markets involved there are other eastern 
flights she said eastern will announce any cancellations within 
a week so that passengers will have plenty of time to adjust she 
said 
fewer than 300 of easterns 3800 union pilots have come back to 
work since the march 4 walkout by the machinists pilots and flight 
attendants crippled the carrier that had been flying nearly 1100 
flights daily

japans largest maker of kimonos has 
purchased the 350room dana point resort hotel for more than 100 
million one of the largest real estate deals in southern california 
this year 
japanese garment giant masuiwaya bought the hotel overlooking the 
ocean from edward and thomas slatkin of the edward thomas companies 
the slatkins had bought the hotel and resort which occupies 116 
acres for a reported 65 million from the southmark pacific corp 
of pasadena 17 months ago 
analysts said masuiwaya which also owns the colonial inn in la 
jolla and the cliffs in northern california may be getting in on 
the start of a booming resort area 
edward thomas companies said the sale to masuiwayas investment 
arm tokyo masuiwaya california corp was completed tuesday the 
new owner retained the hotels current management the slatkin 
brothers told the los angeles times 
edward thomas companies was represented by goldman sachs and co 
while tokyo masuiwaya california corp was represented by yasuda 
trust and banking co 
despite the huge appreciation that the dana point resort sale 
represents the price was not out of line for a coastal resort 
industry analysts said 
if you look at recent hotel sales in southern california like 
la costa resort in san diego county that sold for 250 million and 
hotel bel air for 110 million it is in keeping with what is 
happening said jim burba a partner in the costa mesa office of 
pannell kerr forster an accounting firm 
prime hotel property in southern california is selling at very 
high prices in comparison to other parts of the us because this is 
perceived to be a strong economy and a strong market burba said 
masuiwayas purchase appeared tied to orange countys promise as 
a future resort center said richard n kipper a partner at 
laventhal amp horwath in costa mesa 
the japanese have to be aware of the plans for several major 
highend resorts on the orange county coast and are interested in 
coming in at the start of the creation of a prime resort 
environment kipper said 
local authorities have approved plans to build nine hotels along 
the coast between corona del mar and laguna beach in huntington 
beach and in dana point 
harry hartnett a consultant with kenneth leventhal amp co in 
newport beach said the deal is a continuation of the japanese 
pattern of acquiring socalled trophy hotel properties that have 
a high visibility and prestige 
they did it first in hawaii and now that they have bought most 
of the major hotels there they are turning to california he said 
in recent years japanese investors have acquired the hotel bel 
air in beverly hills la costa resort hotel and spa in carlsbad and 
the westin chain which includes the westin south coast plaza in 
costa mesa and the westin bonaventure in los angeles

lakewood industries a hibbing chopsticks 
factory that gov rudy perpich had called a major step in efforts to 
revitalize northern minnesotas iron range has closed 
lakewood forest products the plants parent firm in canada said 
tuesday that it closed the factory because of a financial 
restructuring the company said in a press release that it had been 
talking with a potential overseas investor but that discussions 
broke off tuesday 
discussions with other potential investors are continuing but 
management has determined that in light of the companys working 
capital position it is necessary to close the plant until adequate 
financing sources have been identified and a financial restructuring 
plan implemented the release said 
the company did not specify what kind of reorganization it is 
considering and officials did not return phone calls 
the chopsticks plant was restarted with about 20 employees in 
march after a threemonth shutdown because of equipment problems 
since it opened three years ago the plant has had trouble getting 
its machinery to produce uniformly acceptable chopsticks and its 
debts have mounted as production has lagged 
ian ward president of the canadian firm said in march that it 
was 6 million in debt including 500000 owed to the city of 
hibbing 250000 to the state and more than 3 million to holders 
of development bonds issued by the iron range resources and 
rehabilitation board 
the hibbing plant reported a 35 million net loss on 400000 in 
sales last year 
in april the internal revenue service filed a lien against the 
hibbing operation for failing to pay 68000 in federal income and 
social security taxes it withheld from employees paychecks in 1987 
and 1988 
the publicly subsidized hibbing plant has been plagued by 
technical production problems since lakewood opened it in mid1986 
with the goal of producing 7 million pairs of chopsticks daily for 
the japanese market 
the plant produced just 100 cases for the us market in its 
first year of operation and didnt make its first export shipment 
until october 1987 
on its first anniversary the hibbing plant was criticized by 
independentrepublican leaders as a governmentbacked boondoggle 
conceived for perpichs hometown perpich was unavailable for 
comment on the closing

inflation slowed in june as consumer prices 
rose a modest 02 percent the smallest advance in 16 months the 
government reported today 
the price moderation reflected the biggest drop in energy prices 
in more than two years and the smallest increase in food costs this 
year 
the 02 percent june rise in the consumer price index the 
governments primary gauge of inflation at the retail level was 
just onethird the 06 percent increase recorded in may 
even with the slowdown prices at the consumer level rose at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 59 percent in the first six 
months of 1989 the fastest pace for the first half of a year since 
1982 
but the moderate june advance the smallest increase since a 
similar 02 percent rise in february 1988 was certain to be seen as 
good news at the federal reserve board which has been concerned 
that the country might be on the verge of another inflationary 
spiral 
todays report on consumer prices coupled with news last week 
that wholesale prices actually fell in june provided concrete 
evidence that the spurt in prices in the early part of 1989 was 
finally beginning to moderate 
patrick jackman a labor department analyst said price pressures 
over the next several months should moderate enough to keep consumer 
inflation for all of 1989 down at around 5 percent prices rose 44 
percent in both 1987 and 1988 
the trouble at the beginning of the year was that energy prices 
driven by the runup in world petroleum prices shot up at an annual 
rate of 403 percent 
however energy prices at the consumer level actually fell by 1 
percent in june the biggest decline since a 19 percent drop in 
october 1986 
food costs which had been climbing at the fastest pace since 
1980 moderated as well in june rising by just 02 percent 
reflecting a declining impact from last summers drought 
while both food and energy prices moderated in june other costs 
were held in check as well the consumer price index excluding food 
and energy rose only 02 percent in june down from a 05 percent 
advance in may 
food prices edged up just 02 percent in june reflecting in 
large part a sharp turnaround in fruit and vegetable costs prices 
of these products declined 1 percent in june after surging 32 
percent in may 
prices also fell for dairy products beef and pork 
the 1 percent drop in overall energy costs reflected a 1 percent 
drop in gasoline prices at the pump and declines for home heating 
oil natural gas and electricity costs 
clothing costs fell 11 percent in june after increasing 23 
percent in the first five months of the year the big decline was 
credited to larger than usual endofseason price reductions 
particularly in womens clothing 
medical costs rose 07 percent in june the biggest advance for 
any of the major categories with doctors costs hospital costs and 
prescription drug costs all rising sharply 
the various changes in june left the overall consumer price index 
at 1241 of its 198284 base that means that a hypothetical 
selection of goods costing 100 during the base period would have 
cost 12410 in june 
in a separate report today the labor department said americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation were 
unchanged in june after falling 14 percent in may 
average weekly earnings in june before adjusting for inflation 
were 33243 up 32 percent from a year earlier taking the 52 
percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the 
12month period real weekly earnings were down 19 percent 
with backtoback good reports showing inflation moderating at 
both the wholesale and retail levels many economists are optimistic 
about the price outlook for the rest of the year 
i think were past the worst on inflation and now the 
question is the running rate of where inflation will settle down 
said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
donald ratajczak director of the economic forecasting project at 
georgia state university said he was looking for gasoline prices to 
fall for a couple of months and smaller upward pressure on food 
costs for the rest of the year 
the surge in inflation from the drought and oil is now over 
he said 
but not all economists are convinced inflation pressures are 
moderating 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said that 
outside the favorable developments in energy and food prices other 
areas were still under price pressures 
the underlying rate of inflation isnt declining at all if 
anything it is getting a little worse evans said 
the bush administration in releasing its midyear update on the 
economy predicted tuesday that consumer prices would rise by 49 
percent this year up only slightly from last years 44 percent 
increase 
the administration remains confident of the future course of 
the us economy said michael boskin chairman of the presidents 
council of economic advisers

with two top 10 movies and a bustling new 
studio tour in florida the walt disney co already is having a hot 
summer 
a 7minute appearance by roger rabbit the 80s answer to mickey 
mouse is helping pack families in for showings of disneys honey 
i shrunk the kids 
robin williams whose risque brand of humor probably would have 
made the late walt disney blush is pulling a whole different 
audience for dead poets society 
and the disneymgm studios tour outside orlando puts the 
granddaddy of amusement park companies at the forefront of the 
latest trend in fun factories by taking customers backstage to play 
at moviemaking 
its the new disney one that repulsed a raid on the magic 
kingdom of the business world five years ago revved up a plan to 
make movies for older audiences and devised new ways to wring 
billions out of a familiar lineup of animated characters and 
amusement parks 
with finetuning that remains the formula for the future said 
michael eisner disneys chairman and chief executive officer 
to me its not what next but whats not next eisner said in 
an interview we have plenty to do with the disney franchise with 
the disney attractions with the disney image to keep us occupied 
for 20 years we dont have to go out and prove that size is 
better 
fostering the franchise has paid off disneys earnings rose 17 
percent last year to 522 million on sales of 34 billion in the 
first half of this year earnings totaled 149 million on sales of 
1 billion the second half is bigger because of summer park 
visitors and movies 
the amusement parks disneyland in anaheim calif and disney 
world in lake buena vista fla are disneys biggest moneymakers 
accounting for more than half its sales and earnings 
but the big story of the last few years is movies particularly 
the young adultoriented films produced by disneys touchstone 
pictures studio 
movies like good morning vietnam cocktail and who 
framed roger rabbit propelled disney to the top spot in the box 
office derby last year for the first time disney movies captured 
194 percent of the nations ticket sales ahead of paramount at 
152 percent 20th century fox at 116 percent and warner bros at 
112 percent 
the companys two early entries this summer the traditional 
disney family comedy honey i shrunk the kids and touchstones 
dead poets society have drawn scant media attention partly 
because of the hoopla over blockbusters like batman and 
indiana jones and the last crusade 
but both are making enough to put them among the top 10 
boxoffice attractions honey which is preceded by the roger 
rabbit cartoon tummy trouble set a disney record by collecting 
143 million its opening weekend 
hollywood is impressed with disneys shrewd marketing its move 
to sign a stable of young stars like bette midler and tom cruise 
and an unusual emphasis on containing production costs 
during the movie and television scriptwriters strike last year 
union negotiators saw disney studio chief jeffrey katzenberg as 
their nemesis on the producers joint negotiating group 
in tv the company also is mixing the old with the new golden 
girls and empty nest supplement broadcast staples the boom in 
home video is a boon to disney with its library of childrens 
favorites and new features 
in the fiercely competitive amusement park business new 
attractions are crucial and disneys bid for glory this year is the 
studio tour in florida the 400 million addition to the magic 
kingdom and epcot center includes peeks at working movie studios a 
recreation of the hollywood boulevard in ts 1930s heyday and a 
doityourself music video 
the company declines to release attendance figures for its parks 
but insiders say crowds at the new studio tour in florida are 
running above expectations the company gets royalties from tokyo 
disneyland and is lining up funding for a planned park outside paris 
rival mca inc which battles disneyland for tourist dollars in 
southern california with a tour at its universal studios plans to 
open its florida studio as an attraction next year and is 
considering a european park 
but analysts downplay the competition 
for one thing the worldwide demand for fun appears insatiable 
then theres what has become known as the disney magic the 
seemingly boundless affection for mickey minnie goofy and the rest 
of the cartoon gang 
i think disney owns the florida vacation franchise and anyone 
who thinks they can take that away is not going to be a happy 
camper says jeffrey logsdon who follows the company for crowell 
weedon amp co in los angeles 
its been suggested a recession could spoil the fun 
even a mild slowdown of the type many economists expect in coming 
months inevitably would cut into peoples spending on extras like 
gasoline and the 94 fourday pass to the florida complex says 
harold vogel an entertainment industry analyst at merrill lynch 
capital markets in new york 
others doubt anything short of an economic disaster would 
seriously dampen consumer enthusiasm for parks movies and tv both 
live and recorded after all hollywoods golden age was born during 
the great depression 
unfortunately the rougher it gets the more people want to 
have some exit from their environment says ceo eisner 
amid a wave of hostile takeover attempts at big media companies 
disney recently tightened its defenses with a poison pill plan 
that would allow present stockholders to buy new stock at halfprice 
if an unfriendly bid arose 
but disney already was considered relatively safe from raiders 
partly because of its experience with a hostile takeover attempt 
five years ago analysts say it should remain that way as long as 
the stock remains strong 
nearly 25 percent of the companys stock is owned by those 
friendly to management including 17 percent controlled by texas 
investor sid bass and allies and nearly 3 percent in the hands of 
roy disney nephew of the late animator and company founder

michael eisner the executive who hosts 
the magical world of disney on sunday night television says 
hes uneasy in his uncle walt role 
eisner who began giving homey introductions to the family 
anthology show after he was named chairman and chief executive 
officer of the walt disney co said in an interview it was strictly 
a business move 
im not wild about the notoriety or the public acceptance or 
all that stuff eisner said but we decided early on that we had 
to be a company with a rudder 
eisner 47 was referring to a management team including 
president and chief operating officer frank wells that was credited 
with revitalizing the company after a takeover battle in 1984 
part of the magic of the old disney shows they felt was the 
introduction by walt disney before his death dec 15 1966 
i figured that i had to do it irrespective of my own desires 
for privacy and my wifes demanding of it because i thought it 
was part of the job eisner said 
viewers seem to like the spots but its a different story with 
eisners wife jane and children michael eric and anders 
i think im pretty poor eisner said i think its worse 
than it is though my children will confirm its as bad as i think 
it is

soviet union was in the market for corn and soybeans

director of research for allendale inc a futures brokerage in 
crystal lake ill 
talk of a soviet deal for as much as 200000 metric tons of south 
american soybean meal gave the soybean market a boost 
the price for july delivery of soybeans whipsawed in early 
trading as players tried to squeeze a little more profit out of the 
contract before it expires on thursday the july soybean contract 
has been extremely volatile in the past week following a board of 
trade order requiring traders to reduce their positions in that 
contract 
its a nomans land said one trader who noted that with 
few players in the july contract its price is subject to sharp 
swings

united mine workers and pittston co 
officials began federally mediated contract talks today the first 
negotiations in the bitter coal strike in six weeks 
outside the closeddoor sessions negotiators blamed each other 
for the long stalemate which has led to wildcat sympathy strikes at 
other companies that idled as many as 46000 miners at various times 
pittston coal group president michael odom said it is up to the 
union to get talks moving by responding to the companys latest 
contract offer 
we have our proposal on the table odom said on todays cbs 
this morning news show we feel our proposal recognized the 
dynamics of the coal market we operate in we feel our proposal 
would put people back to work 
before entering the talks umw president richard trumka 
responded i think it was a mistake for mr odom to go on tv this 
morning and say how inflexible he is 
the parties spent four hours with a judge tuesday before agreeing 
to resume negotiations talks had broken down june 8 
at todays talks the two sides sat in separate rooms with 
federal mediators shuttling messages between them the 3monthold 
strike has been marked by occasional violence and triggered wildcat 
walkouts by tens of thousands of miners 
umw president richard trumka speaking to reporters at a 
southwest virginia motel where the talks began said the way to 
solve the strike would be for pittston chairman paul douglas to 
participate in the negotiations 
im disappointed thats not going to happen trumka said 
but michael odom president of pittstons mining subsidiary 
pittston coal group inc told reporters the company wouldnt be 
pressured into changing its negotiators 
it would be improper for the union to dictate to us or for us 
to dictate to the union who represents them at the bargaining 
table odom said 
about 1900 umw miners are striking pittston for its refusal to 
sign a national contract guaranteeing full medical benefits for 
pensioners and prohibiting mandatory overtime and sunday work 
pittston miners went on strike in virginia and west virginia in 
early april after working 14 months without a contract workers in 
kentucky walked out in june hundreds of miners have been arrested 
for a variety of violent incidents and for civil disobedience 
tactics such as blocking coalhauling roads 
wildcat strikes in support of the pittston workers began last 
month and idled up to 46000 miners in 10 states 
most of those miners returned to work this week but wildcat 
strikes continued in parts of west virginia shots were fired 
tuesday at coal trucks in boone county wva no injuries were 
reported and state police superintendent jr buckalew said the coal 
fields were relatively quiet 
union officials in alabama told more than 3000 miners to return 
for tuesday nights shift at two companies after they failed to show 
up earlier in the day 
trumka said the company wants to stop financing pensions for 
6000 pittston retirees a move he claimed would lead other 
companies to seek to eliminate funds for 130000 pensioners widows 
and dependents 
pittston also refuses to allow 4000 laidoff employees to 
reclaim jobs when they become available trumka said 
do we see it as a frontal assault on the union yes we do 
he said 
odom reiterated the companys contention that it needs contract 
changes so it can meet competition from other producers including 
foreign companies 
theyre just going to have to recognize changes in the dynamics 
of the coal industry odom said 
the two sides met tuesday with us district judge glen williams 
who has been presiding over contempt charges against the union 
stemming from its picket line activity at pittston operations 
williams said he was encouraged by the presence at the meeting of 
trumka umw vice president cecil roberts odom and pittston vice 
chairman joseph farrell 
to see all this high brass here exceeds my expectations 
williams said 
trumka said he would have preferred that the union and company 
meet facetoface but said anything is better than stalemate 
if the talks fail trumka said the union would seek an 
independent labor expert to determine which side is refusing to 
bargain in good faith 
odom said he was not willing to assume the talks would fail we 
felt that federal mediation was the appropriate agency for a 
different approach he said

will continue to make it a priority for our company to contribute to

consecutive quarter

or 354 a share a 10 percent increase over the same period last 
year when earnings were 220 million or 304 a shae 
revenue for the quarter was 235 billion up 4 percent from the 
226 billion reported in last years second quarter 
richard j mahoney monsanto chairman and chief executive 
officer said the chemical company benefited from diversification 
combined with favorable market conditions 
monsanto has repositioned itself into a new category of 
company said mahoney a company with products that are based on 
chemistry but far less affected by traditional chemical industry 
cycles our product portfolio is now much less sensitive to economic 
fluctuations than in the past

percent to 463 million or 678 a share from 430 million or

half rose to 46 billion up 5 percent from 44 billion in the

monsantos core chemical business also increased with demand 
particularly strong in europe although autorelated markets slowed

congressional smoking opponents seeking a ban 
on smoking aboard all us airliners will ask a house panel to 
overrule a subcommittee vote keeping only the current ban for 
flights under two hours 
in a series of parliamentary moves aimed at heading off a total 
ban prosmoking forces won their first victory in the house public 
works and transportation aviation subcommittee on tuesday 
theyre probably all out there puffing happily right now 
said rep james oberstar subcommittee chairman 
the subcommittee voted 1718 against a move to extend the 
temporary ban on twohour flights to cover permanently all flights 
up to four hours oberstars bill proposing a total ban was amended 
to extend the ban on twohour flights from april 23 1990 to april 
23 1992 
oberstar dminn said heavy lobbying by tobacco interests 
helped defeat the total ban in the subcommittee 
the subcommittee also approved two other measures affecting 
aviation a limit on the liability of small plane manufacturers and 
a delay in implementing a rule requiring collision avoidance systems 
on large airliners 
the liability and collision measures are to be taken up by the 
full committee on thursday oberstar said the smoking bill also was 
scheduled for thursday but committee spokesman david smallen said 
today oberstar decided to postpone it for a later meeting 
the smoking vote was on the first of several measures pending in 
congress that would limit or ban smoking on airliners 
other bills and amendments in house committees would make the ban 
on flights of under two hours permanent phase in a ban affecting 
flights of up to four hours or extend the twohour ban to all 
flights with 15minuteperhour smoking intervals after the first 
two hours 
a ban on flights under four hours proposed by rep peter 
defazio dore would have applied to nearly all flights except 
those that go nonstop coasttocoast 
defazio said this would accommodate smokers and give nonsmokers 
the option of making one connecting flight on a crosscountry trip 
to stay on nosmoking flights under the present law it would take 
five flights to make a smokefree flight from san francisco to new 
york defazio said with stopovers in salt lake city denver omaha 
and chicago 
he said smokers could get prescriptions for nicotinelaced gum if 
they felt a fourhour flight was too long to go without smoking 
then they could put nicotine into their systems without putting 
it into everyone elses defazio said 
the bill changing the requirement for computerized devices that 
alert pilots to nearby aircraft would let the federal aviation 
administration extend a dec 30 1991 deadline for installation of 
the 100000 units 
airlines say they need more time to install the units and to test 
the system to see how it works when several airliners are equipped 
with them 
the collision avoidance system includes a screen in the cockpit 
which shows the pilot planes in his vicinity and if necessary 
audibly instructs the pilot to climb or descend to avoid a collision 
the liability act would decrease risks to manufacturers but would 
not cap liability claims proponents said that despite increases in 
general aviation safety insurance to cover aircraft accidents has 
skyrocketed forcing manufacturers out of business

brokerage houses banks and investors in 
spain are readying themselves for july 29 and el big bang the 
most sweeping changes in the countrys four stock exchanges since 
the first was founded in 1831 
without a doubt the reform represents a revolution said 
frederik artesani 29yearold head of research at lombardia y 
lacaci one of spains leading brokerages 
it is the definitive step to bring spanish financial markets 
and practices completely in line with those in the international 
financial system 
luis carlos crossier head of the new national securities 
commission says he is convinced spains big bang will be as 
important as the one in london that deregulated british financial 
markets in october 1986 
defending the rights of investors is one of the principal goals 
of the june 1988 bourse reform law said crossier whose agency 
will police the markets like the securities and exchange commission 
does in the united states and if we dont achieve this it will 
mean the total failure of the reform 
the economic boom that followed spains january 1986 entry into 
the european economic community has spurred socialist prime minister 
felipe gonzalez to modernize its markets with sophisticated 
computers and greatly increased competition 
the key result of el big bang as it has come to be known will 
be the end of the socalled latin model exchange in which 
governmentappointed brokers monopolize trading and supervise 
themselves 
on july 29 we go to the anglosaxon model the civil servant 
brokers disappear and the four stock exchanges madrid barcelona 
bilbao and valencia become interconnected private corporations 
owned by member brokerages or dealer companies said madrid stock 
exchange spokesman jaime sanz 
the madrid stock exchange accounts for nearly 70 percent of all 
trading done in spain 
stock exchanges in paris milan athens and lisbon are still run 
along the lines of the latin model which dates to the napoleonic 
era in the early 19th century 
on july 29 at least 20 percent of the more than 350 companies 
now listed in spain will be quoted on the new computer automated 
trading system cats linking the four exchanges the toronto stock 
exchange a pioneer in the use of automated securities trading was 
the developer of cats 
the four spanish exchanges once a cacaphonous din of yelling 
buyers and sellers will gradually be phased into the new system 
where the market price of stocks will be determined by people 
communicating via computer terminals 
in anticipation of the big day most spanish brokers already have 
established their own firms either alone or in conjunction with big 
spanish banks or foreign banks and brokerage houses 
the fixed 025 percentpershare commissions earned by current 
brokers will also give way to full commission competition among the 
48 brokerage firms and the 50 brokerdealers who so far have 
registered under the new law 
the big bang reform and the stampede of brokerages and banks to 
the market have incited a bidding war for the best people in the 
business 
brokerage and banking firms are raiding each other in some cases 
shattering longestablished trading and management teams 
industry sources say a few of the top spanish professionals have 
been lured away by yearly salaries of up to 40 million pesetas or 
about 341000 three years ago the rate was 5 million pesetas 
monica morales managing director of ibercorp a private bank and 
brokerage firm says offers going around are ludicrous 
one brokerage lost 11 people in one day weve lost one 
analyst one person in corporate finance and two fund managers 
concern has intensified in the industry that competition will 
become even more brutal after july 29 
there are too many participants and i dont think there will 
be enough market to go around morales said 
the market reform is totally necessary and inevitable but im 
not terribly happy about it the problem is that there are so many 
things to do in such a short time and many things left hanging 
croissier acknowledges the government has carried out the reform 
at a breakneck pace to prepare spain for further financial reforms 
in europe that will help shape the european communitys single 
market restructuring in 1992 
but he said the reforms will not be completed for another year 
still to be established is a new code of conduct aimed at banning 
insider trading for the first time and creating a new transaction 
settlement system to speed up the current archaic one which takes 
weeks 
the reform replaces a 1967 law and subsequent decrees by the 
authoritarian government of gen francisco franco his death in 1975 
cleared the way for the restoration of a democratic government two 
years later 
the old bourse code is quite outdated and it has been 
overwhelmed by the boom in stock market investment and new practices 
and methods croissier said 
between 1985 and 1988 the value of securities traded on the 
madrid stock exchange nearly tripled rocketing from 63 trillion 
pesetas or 528 billion to 18 trillion pesetas 
spains booming economy averaging a 45 percent growth rate over 
the past three years has drawn foreign money like a magnet direct 
foreign investment in spain went from 1 billion in 1983 to 4 
billion last year 
the madrid stock exchange index ended 1986 with a whopping 534 
percent increase in 1987 despite the global stock market crash in 
october the index rose 91 percent last year it rose 20 percent 
end adv for sunday july 23

refaat elsayed an immigrant who became 
a business tycoon and national hero was convicted of fraud and 
insider trading wednesday and sentenced to five years in prison 
elsayed 43 was convicted on 14 counts of swindling investers 
perjury insider trading and fraud in the biggest whitecollar case 
brought to a swedish court 
the stockholm district court also sentenced gaston portofaix the 
finance manager of elsayeds former company fermenta ab to one 
year in jail portofaix said he would appeal the verdict 
an immigrant who came from egypt in 1964 elsayed parlayed his 
1981 purchase of the failing biotechnical company fermenta into a 
financial empire based on pharmaceuticals 
charm and informality in the normally tightlaced swedish 
business world won him public attention the popular press was 
enamored with his tieless style and his weekend soccerplaying in 
the fifth league as his personal fortune grew to become swedens 
largest 
in 1985 elsayeds wealth in fermenta stock alone was estimated 
at 1 billion kronor or about 156 million 
his business acumen also was admired by a nation emerging from 
recession into prosperity swedish television voted him man of the 
year in 1985 
his success began to unravel the following year when it was 
discovered that his claim to have a doctorate degree was phony the 
disclosure led to a closer look at the companys transactions and 
elsayed was found to have put misleading information in annual 
reports to improve the companys profits 
he also was charged with selling off fermenta shares before the

defense secretary dick cheney said today he 
disagrees with a bush administration proposal to lift restrictions 
on exporting personal computers to soviet bloc nations 
i do not support that decision cheney told reporters 
my concern is that it will give them a computer capability that 
has military applications that should be avoided the secretary 
said 
it gives them significant capabilities they do not now 
possess he said 
cheney termed inaccurate a washington post report that he had 
been persuaded to withdraw pentagon objections to the proposal 
during a meeting with commerce secretary robert mosbacher 
the decision reportedly came after a fierce debate among the top 
members of president bushs cabinet 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told of cheneys remarks 
noted that bush supports the decision on the computers 
the commerce department announced tuesday that it was removing 
export controls on atcompatible and similar desktop personal 
computers to noncommunist nations 
it said the administration will also propose to the 17nation 
coordinating committee on multilateral export controls cocom that 
export restrictions be lifted against the soviet bloc nations 
cheney said he would prefer that exports be permitted for a 
lower level of technology 
mosbacher in a statement released tuesday said bushs trip to 
poland and hungary had paved the way for expanding trade in areas 
that improve prospects for prosperity in eastern europe without 
harming americas national security 
eliminating export controls on atcompatible personal computers 
is one way to meet this objective he said consistent with the 
spirit of the presidents initiatives we are creating new 
opportunities for us manufacturers to sell more widely abroad 
the at is an ibm model that was widely emulated 
the department said regulations removing the controls on exports 
to western nations will appear in the federal register on july 18 
and be effective immediately 
the cocom committee based in paris consists of australia 
belgium britain canada denmark france west germany greece 
italy japan luxembourg netherlands norway portugal spain 
turkey and the united states 
the net result of this decontrol is to focus and maintain 
export restrictions on those items that are truly strategic and 
that we can control effectively mosbacher said 
in this case these computers are available in 11 countries and 
from 70 vendors outside cocom countries he added those countries 
include hungary and czechoslovakia in the east bloc 
the department said there were about 6 million atcompatible desk 
top personal computers sold worldwide by us companies in 1988 of 
those 27 million worth more than 1 billion were sold outside the 
united states

the european commission proposed 
wednesday to give european airlines more flexibility in setting 
fares but stopped well short of complete deregulation 
european commissioner for competition sir leon brittan said that 
the proposals would remove obstacles to competition and should 
thus lead to lower prices for consumers 
eec transportation commissioner karel van miert said the package 
was meant to strike a balance between price liberalization on the 
one hand and maintaining high standards of safety and security on 
the other 
brittan said the package also sought to avoid the us experience 
in deregulation in which big airlines gobbled up smaller ones 
after price controls were lifted through rules against predatory 
pricing 
under the proposals airlines flying between two eec countries 
could cut prices by up to 20 percent from the previous season if one 
of the governments on the route approves a price cut of more than 
20 percent would trigger an antidumping procedure by the commission 
moreover price cuts of less than 20 percent could be challenged 
by other airlines flying the route or by the other government the 
cheaper fare would then be suspended for up to two months while the 
commission investigates the charge van miert said 
the proposals will be sent to the eec council of ministers for 
consideration by national governments van wiert and brittan said 
they hope the package can be adopted as eec law and become effective 
in july 1990 
under the current system airlines must have the approval of both 
governments on a route to cut prices giving an effective veto on 
fare reductions to governments seeking to protect a national airline

negotiators for northwest airlines pilots said 
wednesday a strike is possible by labor day but los angeles 
investor alfred checchi said the strike threat wont stop him from 
completing a takeover of the nations fourthlargest carrier 
negotiators for the air line pilots association told leaders of 
northwest pilots tuesday night that a breakdown in contract talks 
may be near 
but they also said that agreement on a new contract could be 
reached within a matter of hours if nwa inc management would 
bargain in a reasonable and responsive manner nwa is the parent 
company of northwest airlines 
a spokesman for northwest did not immediately return a phone call 
wednesday 
meanwhile the northwest pilots master executive council of alpa 
stopped short tuesday night of endorsing checchis 4 billion plan 
to buy nwa 
they stopped short of a complete endorsement of his buyout 
plan but judged his financial and business plans to be viable 
union spokesman jim halverson said wednesday 
earlier tuesday former republic airlines pilots now working for 
the eaganbased northwest embraced checchis 121pershare takeover 
bid 
halverson said the mediated contract talks were set to resume 
wednesday afternoon remaining issues are job security work rules 
and pay he said 
before a strike could occur an impasse in contract talks would 
have to be decided by the national mediation board if an impasse 
were declared it would be followed by a 30day coolingoff period 
after which the pilots would be free to strike 
checchi said wednesday his group intends to close the buyout deal 
despite the strike threat he said he considered the actions by the 
republic and the northwest master executive council on his buyout 
plan very encouraging 
he also said he didnt know when the deal would be completed but 
it was pending very shortly 
last week sources close to the transaction said checchi expected 
to complete the deal before aug 1 the st paul pioneer press 
dispatch reported saturday the star tribune also quoting 
unidentified sources in its saturday edition said checchi might 
close the deal by friday 
checchi also said wednesday that a contract settlement might be 
reached before the deal is closed 
these pilots and the company have been involved in negotiations 
for almost two years and that process seems to be coming to a 
satisfactory conclusion he said its my understanding theyre 
very close and sometimes when you get closest its kind of a point 
of maximum frustration for both sides 
former republic airlines pilots who joined northwest in the 
acquisition of republic in 1986 have been without a contract for the 
past 2 years while the contract covering northwest pilots expired 
three years ago 
talks to bring the pilots under one pact began in april 1987 and 
broke off last november when 96 percent voted to authorize a 
strike northwest then requested federal mediation and the talks 
resumed in december 
northwest spokesmen said last week that as long as talks 
continued an agreement was possible 
but in the alpa statement issued wednesday pilot leaders 
expressed increasing impatience with the lack of progress in 
contract talks and said a breakdown seems inevitable if talks 
aimed at a new contract do not produce an agreement within a matter 
of days 
as for the checchi buyout plan halverson said northwest pilot 
leaders had some difficulty in divorcing an endorsement of the 
checchi buyout proposal from a lack of progress in contract 
negotiations 
he checchi has been saying its a done deal on the other 
hand he says he has little or no influence in contract 
negotiations halverson said and were saying its difficult to 
reconcile those two statements 
checchi said wednesday he doesnt own the airline and therefore 
it would be totally inappropriate for me to be involved in 
contractual negotiations of an enterprise that i dont control 
halverson said northwest pilots are concerned about the large 
debt load in the buyout offer thats a problem for all 
pilots he said 
the northwest pilots however did conclude that the buyout plan 
appears viable from a business and financial standpoint the 
northwest group passed a resolution saying it endorses the checchi 
groups stated intentions for market growth expanded employment 
opportunity and the promise of harmonious employeeemployer 
relations 
the republic master executive council called checchis proposal 
the best available option to provide stability and growth 
potential for nwa and its workers 
but union spokesman curt kruse said tuesday that former republic 
pilots endorsement of checchis buyout offer doesnt mean pilots 
are pleased about the pace of contract negotiations he also 
stressed that the pilots still have concerns over the debt northwest 
would incur 
nobody is entirely pleased with increasing the debt at 
northwest kruse said however once we had an opportunity to 
review his checchis financial plan our concerns diminished 
somewhat we still have concerns 
the northwest mec represents about 3000 of the total 5000 
pilots employed by northwest the rest are represented by the 
republic airlines mec

grain and soybean futures prices closed moderately 
higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade as rainy weather 
moved out of the corn belt and talk turned to expectations of 
stronger foreign demand for grain 
soybeans for july delivery finished sharply higher but analysts 
dismissed the rally saying it represented limited buying in a thin 
market ahead of the july contracts expiration on thursday 
a weather system that brought badly needed moisture to the 
western corn belt states of iowa and minnesota was moving rapidly 
eastward 
traders are expecting to see another drier pattern or at least 
to see a pattern that is not as favorable to the crops as what we 
just saw said walter spilka a grain market analyst with smith 
barney harris upham amp co in new york 
the rally in the corn market reflected a rise in cash prices 
which began climbing late tuesday afternoon on rumors the soviet 
union was seeking to buy some us corn 
wheat futures were a little higher on perceptions of dryweather 
damage to the spring wheat crop 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 390 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
to 6 cents higher with july at 254 a bushel oats were 4 cents to 
4 cents higher with july at 146 a bushel soybeans were 7 cents 
to 32 cents higher with july at 728 a bushel and the more 
actively traded august contract up 13 cents at 687 a bushel

chrysler corp increasingly is getting a 
reputation as a truckmaking company a label chairman lee iacocca 
acknowledges but one he says is unwarranted 
yet analysts wonder if that may not be the smartest road for the 
nations thirdlargest vehicle maker to take 
right now its a truckmaker that also makes cars said auto 
analyst ronald glantz of montgomery securities inc of san 
francisco i think its an intelligent decision on chryslers part 
because trucks make more money that cars 
chrysler is expected to announce secondquarter earnings next 
monday near or slightly lower than those during the same time last 
year this time around the company will be relying more on the 
dollars generated by trucks than in the past leading to speculation 
the company is being driven by trucks 
if you call minivans trucks it looks that way because in the 
last 40 days in total weve sold one car for every truck iacocca 
said in an interview this week other companies arent quite in 
that position but thats just because of jeep cherokee strength 
and minivan strength 
chrysler through its dodge caravan and plymouth voyager holds 
56 percent of the minivan market in the united states it was the 
first to introduce the popular vehicles back in 1983 and since then 
has held most of the market 
through the first half of this year and for the first time in 
history chrysler sold more domestically made light trucks than 
cars together those vehicles make up more than 90 percent of the 
companys fleet 
through june 30 this year the company sold 097 cars for each 
truck a year ago at the same time the ratio was 114 cars per 
truck the gap was wider in the first half of 1987 as the company 
sold 156 cars per truck 
general motors corps car sales have run slightly more than 
twice the rate of its truck sales and ford sells better than 15 
cars for every truck 
despite the dominance of truck sales at chrysler iacocca said 
the company is very much in the carmaking business 
we cant become just a truck company he said weve got 
good car programs first of all our luxury cars are in pretty good 
shape because theyre not too big 
then we have an all new platform coming in late 92 he said 
thats a billiondollar effort at a new midsize group of cars and 
theyre coming along nicely he said 
the one thats tough is we dont have an dodge omni 
replacement at the moment our smallest car really is the pcar the 
plymouth sundancedodge shadow he said 
chrysler isnt letting todays truck business take care of 
tomorrow there will be more competition in the segment beginning in 
the next few months as the new gm minivans come to the market and as 
imports including mazda bring in more foreignmade versions 
a growing number of companies also are offering sportutility 
vehicles and chrysler will be among them 
the company has broken ground for a new assembly plant in detroit 
which will make a jeep codenamed the zj earlier this year 
iacocca announced that chrysler and the french automaker renault 
would join forces to make a smaller sportutility vehicle named the 
jj 
both of those products are to be introduced in the early 1990s 
and means the company will have more truck production capacity than 
it does now 
people look at the car side and wonder if they are at a 
competitive disadvantage to ford and general motors said analyst 
charles brady of oppenheimer amp co of new york thats hopefully 
just a temporary condition 
but clearly now you can make an excellent case if you want to 
classify it as a truckmaker he said i think in the insider 
area theyve neglected the car area over the next couple of years 
youd have to say the show belongs mostly to the truck side of the 
operation

boys across america may shake their heads in dismay but the 
courts have spoken gi joe is a doll not a toy soldier 
hasbro industries inc had sought to get joe out of duty import 
tariffs that is by battling the lessthanmacho designation of 
doll but a panel of three federal judges wasnt persuaded 
not to worry said company officials in pawtucket ri 
gi joe is still one of the guys said donald robbins 
hasbro vice president and general counsel boys know who he is 
even though gi joe has lost this battle hopefully he will 
not lose his courage for combat wrote judge paul r michel of the 
us court of appeals for the district of columbia upholding the 
us customs service in a july 12 ruling 
at issue in the case was not just gi joes macho image but a 
sizable chunk of his booty from the toy wars since hasbro began 
importing gi joe from hong kong in 1982 the customs service has 
imposed a 12 percent tariff amounting to millions of dollars 
last year hasbro argued before the us court of international 
trade in new york that gi joe is just an updated version of the 
traditional toy soldier and should not be subject to the duties 
placed on imported dolls 
although he wears military duds brandishes a submachine gun and 
lugs an assault pack both the trade court and the appeals court 
ruled that joe fit the standard definition of a representation of 
a human being used as a childs plaything in other words a doll 
tenyearold michael ritchie of allenwood texas who has about 
40 gi joe figures was skeptical 
its not really a doll he said itd be weird for me if i 
saw a girl playing with gi joe cause i never have girls usually 
play with a doll or something 
the decision had an attempt at humor but they really strictly 
applied the dictionary definition m barry levy who argued the 
case for hasbro said from his new york office 
when introduced 25 years ago gi joe was a pioneer in the 
marketing of flexible plastic figurines to boys hasbro was always 
careful to refer to him either as a mannequin or action 
figure never a doll 
after a lull in sales in the late 1970s joes popularity surged 
in the 1980s as babyboomers began buying their children the same 
toys they had as kids since 1964 total sales of the gi joe line 
have exceeded 12 billion hasbro said 
but like other old soldiers joe seems to be gradually fading 
away from his original 11inch size in 1964 he shrank to 8 
inches in 1976 and then to 3 inches in 1982 
at the same time he has lost some of his maneuverability and now 
comes permanently clothed in fatigues rather than removable 
uniforms 
one thing hasnt changed however no matter what the courts say 
hasbro marketing agents still talk about joe as an ordinary gi 
dogface paratrooper ranger green beret grunt or leatherneck 
just about anything but a doll

state insurance regulators could use legal 
hurdles to stall or even block a new hostile takeover bid clouding 
the future of farmers insurance group inc 
britains bat industries plc which swallowed up farmers less 
than a year ago after another hostile battle last week became the 
target of an investment group headed by takeover strategist sir 
james goldsmith 
that group has said it will sell the los angelesbased insurance 
giant if its 21 billion takeover proposal succeeds 
insurance regulators in the nine states where farmers operates 
are not saying whether they will oppose the new bid but the 
proposal appears likely to face the same regulatory hurdles that 
slowed bats takeover last year 
a major issue here is should insurance companies be subject to 
these types of takeovers asked ted kulongoski director of the 
oregon department of insurance and finance kulongoski has final say 
over the goldsmith groups application to take over farmers in his 
state 
when you have a product that is such an integral part of 
society that the government mandates should it be subject to 
takeovers that can load debt on the company and pass it off to the 
consumer kulongoski said 
oregon washington and idaho regulators initially opposed bats 
takeover of farmers last year giving in only after the hostile bid 
was replaced by a friendly merger agreement 
california regulators also rejected the merger but that decision 
was overturned by a state court 
the goldsmith proposal faces reviews by regulators in those 
states along with regulators in ohio texas illinois arizona and 
kansas 
we all didnt know we were having a dress rehearsal for this 
summers production ed southon deputy state insurance 
commissioner in washington said of the new bid 
we havent taken a position for or against southon said 
but if it is decided that this is a hostile takeover we will 
probably handle it the same way we did last year by opposing it 
in california where the insurance company is based and does 
about 40 percent of its business state department of insurance 
officials complained that the acquisition application the goldsmith 
group filed was incomplete 
we now have to review the application and will not comment on 
it until the 60day review process is up said department attorney 
lorraine johnson 
ms johnson said the application received last week would not 
be reviewed until it was considered substantially complete she 
declined to elaborate 
goldsmiths investment group made its 215 billion bid on july 
11 saying bats strategy of diversifying into financial services 
had failed goldsmith said that if the takeover succeeds he would 
sell the groups nontobacco businesses including farmers to pay 
takeover costs 
farmers has about 11 billion in assets most in the insurance 
business it ranks third in home and auto insurance behind state 
farm mutual automobile insurance co and sears roebuck and cos 
allstate unit and is the nations seventhlargest property and 
casualty insurance company 
insurance analyst gerald lewinsohn of merrill lynch amp co inc in 
new york said he didnt know of any case in which state regulators 
effectively blocked the takeover of an insurance company but they 
sure can drag things out for a long time with hearings he said 
if you review the battle by farmers last year you can see what 
can happen each state held hearings he said 
farmers initially resisted the merger last year with bat the 
worlds largest tobacco company suggesting bat had suppressed 
research pointing to the dangers of smoking 
state regulators also expressed concern that bat would drop 
farmers special discounts for nonsmokers the company owns the 
maker of kool and viceroy cigarettes among others 
farmers also persuaded numerous state and national lawmakers to 
attack bat because it has operations in racially segregated south 
africa 
the initial resistance paid off for the insurance company and its 
shareholders after an acrimonious battle farmers in august 1988 
agreed to a 52 billion cash acquisition at a price 15 per share 
higher than the initial 42 billion offer of january 1988 
farmers spokesman jeffrey c beyer declined to discuss the 
goldsmith offer referring all questions to batus bats us 
subsidiary in louisville ky batus spokesman wyatt wilson also 
declined comment 
bats board of directors has said it considers the proposed offer 
unwelcome and voted to reject it

than doubled in the second quarter from a year earlier 
the defense contractor and building controls maker reported that 
its secondquarter profit jumped to 748 million or 173 a share 
from 316 million or 75 cents a share in the second quarter of 
1988 
honeywell lost 435 million in 1988 and announced last month that 
it would cut its workforce of 78000 by 300 mostly through layoffs 
the strong secondquarter results following a good first 
quarter indicate we are making progress in improving our financial 
performance said james j renier chairman and chief executive 
officer we look forward to the second half of the year with 
confidence 
the 1988 second quarter included aftertax charges of 43 
million or 101 a share related to unrecoverable contract costs 
and the discontinuance of a product line honeywell said those 1988 
charges were partially offset by a gain of 15 million or 35 cents 
a share from the sale of real estate

billion from 175 billion in 1988 
profit for the first half of this year increased 542 percent

decline in firsthalf revenue to 345 billion from 349 billion 
renier said operating profit in honeywells industrial business 
was up substantially with notable strength in industrial automation 
systems space and aviation systems also posted strong profit in the 
second quarter led by a substantial increase in commercial avionics 
results and continued recovery in the military avionics group 
compared with a loss in the second quarter of 1988 
operating profit declined modestly in honeywells home and 
building automation and control business as expected due to 
continuing softness in construction markets profits from commercial

the dollar gained ground against most major 
foreign currencies wednesday in an unusual reaction to inflation 
news that ordinarily might have dampened enthusiasm for dollar 
buying 
gold prices dropped reflecting the good us inflation reading 
and the dollars advance investors often choose gold as a hedge 
against rising inflation 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery tumbled 430 to 36830 a troy ounce republic national 
bank of new york quoted a bid of 36820 for an ounce of bullion at 
4 pm edt down 370 from tuesdays late bid 
immediately after the labor department reported in the early 
morning that the consumer price index edged up 02 percent in june 
currency dealers sold dollars last months cpi rate was 
significantly smaller than mays 06 percent increase and the lowest 
monthly rate since february 1988 
the initial dollar selling was based on the thinking that 
moderating inflation could increase the chances for the federal 
reserve board to loosen its credit policies further and drive down 
us interest rates 
but the dollar sales soon abated 
john mccarthy chief currency dealer at the amsterdam rotterdam 
banks new york office said renewed demand for dollars emerged when 
it became apparent that the sellers lacked enough conviction to push 
the dollar below thresholds considered technically important 
plus the dollar benefited from rallies in the stock and bond 
markets wednesday which indicated that demand for 
dollardenominated investments remains robust despite the 
possibility of lower us interest rates 
i think the fact that us rates are declining is not a barrier 
to interest in the dollar said mccarthypeople are buying us 
securities for capital appreciation the attractiveness of the us 
bond and stock markets makes the dollar attractive 
the financial markets will be waiting thursday for clues about 
fed policy when alan greenspan the central bank chairman testifies 
at a congressional hearing

usx corp stock traded higher wednesday despite 
a jury verdict that a former unit of the pittsburgh oil gas and 
steel concern should pay at least 2435 million in an antitrust 
case 
in consolidated new york stock exchange trading usx stock closed 
at 3587 up 62 cents a share 
the rise reflects investors relief that the jurys verdict fell 
short of recent projections said analyst andrew gray of the 
investment firm donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
there was also doubt about who would ultimately be responsible 
for the damages and whether the award will withstand appeals 
a plaintiffs attorney had said that with the doubling and 
trebling of certain of the damages the bessemer amp lake erie 
railroad could owe 638 million under the verdict returned tuesday 
in us district court in philadelphia 
several analysts had projected the companys liability at 1 
billion gray said 
plaintiffs including four major steel producers accused the bample 
of conspiring in 1983 and 1984 to block the development of 
selfunloading ore boats in order to retain business hauling ore to 
steel plants 
usx sold the bample last year to transtar inc a holding of 
blackstone capital partners lp 
when blackstone and transtar bought the bample they didnt assume 
any responsibility for the liability in this incident usx 
spokesman william ryder said wednesday whether usx will be 
ultimately responsible remains to be litigated with blackstone 
the 638 million figure represents the speculation or 
extrapolation on the part of the plaintiffs attorney he said 
the fact of life is this is only the district court it 
could go higher and the award could be reduced on appeals gray 
said 
gray said he expects usx earnings to remain strong with potential 
for growth should natural gas prices rise as expected and petroleum 
exploration intensify boosting sales of the companys highly 
profitable tubular goods

gold futures prices slumped to their lowest levels in a month 
wednesday as investors dumped precious metals and snapped up stocks 
following a government report showing a slowdown in inflation 
on other markets stockindex futures soared energy futures 
plunged grains and soybeans advanced and livestock and meat 
futures were mixed 
gold settled 430 to 490 lower on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the contract for delivery in august at 36930 a troy 
ounce and the spot july contract at 36830 it was golds lowest 
close since june 16 when the august contract settled at 36880 
silver futures fell 89 cents to 104 cents with july at 51330 
a troy ounce 
the labor departments report of a lowerthanexpected 02 
percent rise in consumer prices in june prompted an immediate dip in 
the gold market and primed it for a big drop when the dollar rallied 
in afternoon trading 
they were particularly unsettled by the consumer price index 
because even after you subtracted food and energy you still got a 
low number said john oconnell a preciousmetals market analyst 
in new york with the futures brokerage refco inc 
he said traders typically strip the food and energy components 
from the governments inflation indicators to get a truer picture of 
how federal reserve board policies are affecting price movements 
food and energy prices are less affected by monetary policies than 
prices of other goods oconnell said 
gold prices began falling last week following another government 
report that showed inflation at the wholesale level slowing gold is 
often perceived as an inflationresistant investment 
despite golds weakness analysts werent quite ready to turn 
bearish on a market that has shown a good deal of strength in the 
past six weeks 
i think we still have to go down a few dollars to technically 
confirm the weakness said bernard savaiko senior metals analyst

mudslinging campaign ads are alienating 
voters allowing advocacy groups to skew the political process and 
should be reined in while congress grapples with runaway campaign 
spending a senate panel was told wednesday 
independent groups with no official ties to individual 
candidates are pouring millions into virulent hit and run 
campaign ads on radio and tv without identifying themselves or their 
true motives often in the waning days of campaigns when there is no 
time for response sen richard bryan dnev said 
bryan told the senate commerce communications subcommittee he 
feared such tactics would become the wave of the future and 
would go unchecked while congress bickers over a comprehensive 
solution to the problem of soaring campaign spending 
several senators including commerce committee chairman ernest f 
hollings dsc agreed that a comprehensive campaign spending 
reform bill was needed but that it had become mired down in 
partisan battles over proposed spending limits they said a 
piecemeal approach may be the only solution 
wednesdays hearing was on two campaign ad bills one introduced 
by bryan and sen bob graham dfla would require sponsors of 
campaign ads to identify themselves more clearly on screen a bill 
by hollings and sens daniel inouye dhawaii and john danforth 
rmo would require broadcasters to provide free air time to anyone 
targeted by a negative ad from the independent groups the bill 
also would require candidates to personally appear in any ad that 
mentions his or her opponent 
hollings said his intent was not to limit the content of 
political ads but to give voters clear and direct discussion of 
issues in which the person who makes the claim is held 
responsible he said that cannot happen when candidates themselves 
dont appear in ads 
he said it was a misnomer to call pacs independent that they 
often are connected with a candidate or political party and that 
they spent 10 million on broadcast ads in 1986 
these independent parties are responsible to no one especially 
the voter hollings said yet their enormous expenditures can 
throw a campaign way off balance 
except on one occasion when hollings attacked sen mitch 
mcconnell rky for ads depicting bloodhounds searching for an 
absentee opponent the senators generally steered clear of the 
touchy subject of negative ads carried out by a candidates campaign 
one witness however political analyst curtis gans showed 
memorable attack ads including lyndon johnsons ads hitting barry 
goldwater on nuclear weapons issues in 1964 sen quentin burdick 
dnd being bought by eastern labor unions and an ad against 
sen james sasser of tennessee that showed a fidel castrolike 
figure lighting a cigar with a stack of american foreign aid dollars 
gans said negative ads werent new just more prolific he said 
spending on the five most expensive senate races increased 10fold 
from 1974 to 1984 with television ad costs mushrooming 30fold 
since the 1960s he added voter turnout in presidential and 
midterm congressional elections has declined more than 20 percent 
he said the decline in voting and the rise in campaign spending 
was not coincidental

worried investors have pushed the stock price 
of micron technology inc down about 20 percent in the past week 
and things may get worse before they get better 
analysts point to growing uncertainty about prices and the sales 
outlook for dynamic random access memory chips also cited are big 
sales of micron stock by company founder ward parkinson and his twin 
brother joe parkinson chairman and chief executive officer of the 
boise semiconductor company 
memory chips or drams are microns mainstay product and are an 
essential component of computers and a growing variety of other 
electronic products 
micron executives declined to discuss the stock price decline 
the stock which closed at 1850 a share on july 10 was 1512 on 
wednesday in overthecounter trading the stock hit its 52week 
high of 2575 in midjune 
some analysts have cut earnings estimates for microns fourth 
quarter and fiscal year 1989 that ends aug 31 
richard whittington an analyst at prudentialbache securities in 
new york projects earnings per share this year will be 3 down 
from 325 in 1988 pershare earnings could slip to 2 in 1990 and 
may go lower he said 
prices have tipped over in the past two months after two years 
of stability whittington said you are not seeing chip 
dumping by japan you are seeing demand dry up 
kidder peabody amp co analyst michael gumport said fourthquarter 
earnings will be substantially less than 85 cents per share 
on june 1 the company had 384 million shares outstanding it 
earned 127 per share in the fourth quarter of last year 
essentially the spot price for drams passed below the 
contract price gumport said customers balked they are saying 
why should we buy them under contract when we can get them cheaper 
somewhere else 
on monday montgomery securities analyst daniel klesken 
reportedly cut his fourthquarter projection from 80 cents a share 
to 45 cents 
apparently the market is trying to signal us to the fact that 
they believe tougher times are on the way micron spokesman kipp 
bedard said tuesday 
microns stock went through similar convulsions last year 
insider sales the departures of two senior officers and rumors 
of impending price declines combined to depress the stock between 
june and september 1988 it went from about 26 to 1450 before 
recovering 
bedard said the 250 million expansion under way at microns 
southeast boise plant would not be affected by the latest events on 
wall street 
we are firmly committed to this business longterm he said 
we do believe memory opportunities through the 1990s are just 
outstanding 
before worries started eroding microns stock price parkinson 
reportedly sold 25000 shares june 1920 he retains 23350 shares 
on dec 3 he owned 91549 shares 
ward parkinson who resigned abruptly in may for personal 
reasons is said to have sold 150000 shares on june 19 he still 
holds 117775 shares down from 389974 shares on dec 3

conrail announced wednesday that its profit 
dropped 15 percent in the second quarter of the year blaming the 
coal strike inflation and an accelerated maintenance schedule 
in addition the freight railroad announced adoption of a 
strategy to discourage hostile takeover attempts 
earnings totaled 82 million or 119 per share for the second 
quarter compared with 97 million or 141 per share a year 
earlier 
secondquarter revenue edged up to 881 million from 879 million 
last year 
operating income fell primarily because of lost traffic during 
the coal strike in june said james a hagen chairman chief 
executive and president of the railroad 
inflation pushed costs up by 10 million and 8 million worth of 
equipment and maintenance work was finished earlier this year than 
last affecting the bottom line in the second quarter hagen said 
for the first six months of the year conrails earnings were 
down 2 percent to 142 million or 207 per share on revenue of 
175 billion conrail earned 145 million or 210 per share on 
revenue of 171 billion for the first six months of 1988 
conrails board adopted a socalled shareholder rights plan 
intended to make taking control of the company more expensive for an 
unwanted investor 
the rights are designed to assure that all of conrails 
stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any 
proposed takeover of the company and to guard against the use of 
abusive tactics to gain control of the company without paying all 
shareholders a premium value hagen said 
the plan is intended to encourage suitors to negotiate with the 
board of directors he said the strategy is not in response to any 
threat or proposed takeover hagen said 
the plan issues one right per share to stockholders if an 
unwanted suitors stake in the company increase to more than 10 
percent all shareholders except the raider can use their rights to 
buy two shares of stock for the price of one

the top officials of eastern airlines on wednesday 
maintained that the overall program to rebuild the strikebound 
carrier is proceeding well despite having to cut back on a planned 
flight schedule expansion next month 
eastern chairman frank lorenzo and president phil bakes also said 
negotiations with striking pilots were not going well denounced a 
plan by chicago businessman joseph ritchie and the unions to buy the 
airline and announced a plan to buy new aircraft 
as about 20 strikers picketed outside a downtown atlanta hotel 
bakes told a news conference that too much attention is being paid 
to the actual number of flights eastern will have in its planned 
august expansion 
the airline originally promised to have 390 flights daily by aug 
1 but said this week some reductions may be necessary before the 
strike by machinists pilots and flight attendants that started 
march 4 miamibased eastern had about 1100 flights daily it now 
has 220 
bakes characterized the august expansion as merely part of a 
ninemonth plan to rebuild the airline without the unions 
he said that so far eastern has significantly exceeded those 
plans 
bakes refused to say exactly how many flights will be on the 
schedule in august he said the airline is refusing to take bookings 
on flights for which crew training is incomplete 
we have said we would fly approximately 390 flights and when 
we finish the month of august we will be somewhat less than that 
bakes said but putting it in context it is literally irrelevant 
to the strategy the company is on 
the overall plan is coming along very very nicely he said 
ron cole a spokesman for the air line pilots association 
accused lorenzo and bakes of putting a happy face on a ridiculous 
sorry situation 
cole said the reduction in the projected august flights is a 
clear sign that easterns rebuilding plan is not working 
lorenzo is setting up the travel agents and the traveling 
public to take another bath cole said from tampa fla where 
representatives of eastern and the pilots union have been meeting 
for several days 
bakes said the airline has made progress in financial results 
hours flown and numbers of passengers carried he insisted that 
eastern has enough money from the sale of assets to persevere 
through the rebuilding period though he would not respond when 
asked how much money the airline was losing each day 
eastern is awaiting a ruling from a federal bankruptcy judge on 
its request to release 100 million being held in escrow by the 
companys creditors to finance the august expansion 
the appearance by lorenzo and bakes in atlanta followed 
unconfirmed reports that negotiations between the company and the 
pilots union had broken down the two eastern officials refused to 
discuss specifics of the talks but said they were not making 
progress 
i cant be here bubbling with optimism about where they the 
talks are going said lorenzo who also is chairman of easterns 
parent texas air corp 
lorenzo also dismissed the plan by ritchie and the unions to buy 
eastern as a public relations attempt 
ritchie said tuesday he is close to securing a highly 
confident letter from his financial adviser shearson lehman 
hutton inc in the letter shearson says it would agree to raise 
280 million in debt financing for the eastern bid ritchie told the 
wall street journal 
ritchie the principal owner and president of chicago research amp 
trading group also said he has been talking with the aflcio about 
an additional 200 million for an employee stock ownership plan 
mr ritchies proposal always has appeared to be insubstantial 
and irrelevant lorenzo said 
lorenzo also announced that houstonbased texas air planned a 
28 billion purchase of newgeneration boeing 737300 aircraft 
the plan calls for 50 firm purchases and 50 options lorenzo said 
40 of the jets are earmarked for eastern and 60 for its sister 
carrier continental airlines in addition continental has agreed 
to buy 13 airbus a300 jets and spare parts from eastern for 3035 
million

nursing homes with more than 38000 beds 
the secondquarter loss on revenue of 524 million compared with 
earnings of 111000 on revenue of 524 million in the yearearlier 
quarter earnings pershare were negligible because the company has 
54 million shares outstanding

profitability for beverly david banks who became chief executive 
officer in may told securities analysts in new york where the 
earnings report was disclosed 
but investors reacted negatively and the stock fell 87 cents to 
825 in composite new york stock exchange volume of 524 million 
shares 
more than half the volume came from a single sale of 352 million 
shares controlled by david h murdock chairman of castle amp cook a

mcdonnell douglas corp said wednesday it lost 
48 million in the second quarter citing the continuing effects of 
a major reorganization of its transport aircraft business segment 
the loss for the defense contractor caught stock analysts by 
surprise and sent the companys stock on the new york stock exchange 
into a tailspin 
mcdonnell douglas stock fell 5 a share to 72 
the secondquarter loss contrasted with a profit of 71 million 
or 183 a share in the three months ended june 30 1988 
secondquarter sales fell 36 percent to 3476 billion from 
3605 billion last year 
the loss comes on the heels of a poor first quarter when the 
company reported a 169 million profit only because of a 179 
million onetime tax credit 
for the first six months mcdonnell douglass said it earned 121 
million or 318 a share compared with 122 milion or 316 a 
share a year earlier sixmonth revenue fell to 682 billion from 
692 billion 
clearly two bad quarters in a row with such large losses seem 
to say mcdonnell douglas is in real difficulty said phillip 
brannon an analyst with merrill lynch research us in new york 
brannon said he didnt expect the companys problems in the 
transport segment which accounts for nearly 30 percent of the 
companys revenues would have been so prolonged 
this is definitely far worse than i think anyone anticipated 
said paul nisbet an analyst at prudentialbache in new york 
in the transport segment parts shortages and the training of 
thousands of new employees have increased costs and forced the 
reorganization which began in february and affects 5000 employees 
mcdonnell douglas said improved performance in the combat 
aircraft and information systems segments was overshadowed by a 
secondquarter operating loss of 158 million in the transport 
aircraft segment which had revenues of 952 million that compares 
with operating earnings of 10 million on revenues of 11 billion 
in the same quarter last year 
the missiles space and electronics systems segment had earnings 
of 10 million in the quarter down from 37 million in the same 
period last year due to reduced earnings in the delta ii launch 
vehicle program and a writeoff reflecting higherthanexpected 
costs in a laser communications program

continental airlines said wednesday it is ordering 
up to 100 new boeing jets in a 28 billion deal that is the largest 
ever for texas air corp the parent of both continental and 
strikebound eastern airlines 
forty of the new jets are earmarked for eastern now in the midst 
of bankruptcy reorganization and a lingering strike all the 
purchases by eastern first must be approved by a federal bankruptcy 
court 
houstonbased texas air also announced a complicated mix of 
transactions in which continental soon would purchase 11 widebody 
airbus a300 jets and spare parts from eastern for 3035 million 
continental also would lease two mcdonnell douglas dc10s from 
eastern and lease 34 jets back to its sister carrier 
i think this is an important step in continentals return to 
profitability and confidence in the future of the airline d 
joseph corr continentals chairman and chief executive officer 
told a news conference 
what were really doing is not only restructuring our fleet 
but were also at the same time providing for our fleet way out into 
the future corr said overall were looking at more seats to 
more destinations than prior to these changes 
under the deal houstonbased continental agreed to buy as many 
as 60 of boeing cos narrowbody 737300s with deliveries of 30 
aircraft planned for 1992 to 1994 and with an option to purchase 
another 30 of the jets in 1995 and 1996 
total cost of the continental purchase would be about 17 
billion corr said adding that about threequarters of the new 
fleet would replace aging aircraft 
corr declined to discuss financing for the purchase continental 
posted a firstquarter loss of 165 million narrowed from an 806 
million loss in the same quarter of 1988 
continental a nonunion carrier which emerged from bankruptcy 
reorganization in september 1986 and miamibased eastern were among 
only three major us airlines that did not have new planes on order 
prior to the boeing deal announced wednesday pan am corp is the 
third carrier 
corr said the federal bankruptcy judge overseeing easterns 
reorganization burton r lifland probably will have the final say 
over the airlines finances but he said continentals negotiations 
on an order for eastern planes had nothing to do with its sister 
carriers financial status 
the agreement with boeing allows continental to substitute a 
portion of its order for boeings 737400s or 737500s which have 
different seat capacities allowing for greater flexibility as the 
airlines needs change in the coming years corr said 
he insisted that the prices were fair market value denying any 
suggestion that the arrangement was part of a shift in assets at the 
expense of crippled eastern

defense secretary dick cheney sharply 
criticized an administration decision to allow the sale of personal 
computers to soviet bloc nations wednesday contending it gives them 
computers with military applications 
cheney sought out reporters to make a statement about the matter 
intent on clarifying a washington post story that he had been 
persuaded by commerce secretary robert mosbacher to support the 
decision 
i do not support that decision cheney said appearing 
clearly irritated 
the secretary said he opposed the move because it would give the 
soviets significant capabilities they do not now possess 
cheneys comments revealed the fierce debate waged inside 
president bushs cabinet over the decision which marks a major 
shift in policy from the previous administration 
conservative members of that administration had sought to retain 
tight control of hightech exports to the soviets but this 
administrations shift appears to have been influenced by the more 
open attitude between the superpowers fostered by soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev 
mosbacher in a statement released tuesday argued that bushs 
trip to poland and hungary had paved the way for expanding trade 
in areas that improve prospects for prosperity in eastern europe 
without harming americas national security 
eliminating export controls on atcompatible personal computers 
is one way to meet this objective he said consistent with the 
spirit of the presidents initiatives we are creating new 
opportunities for us manufacturers to sell more widely abroad 
mosbacher said the administration had decided to lift controls on 
such commonly used desktop models as the ibm ps2 and at models 
because they were easily obtainable in 11 countries including 
eastern europe 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told of cheneys 
criticism said bush was not informed in advance about the decision 
but does support it 
the commerce department said the administration will propose to 
the 17nation coordinating committee on multilateral export controls 
cocom that export restrictions be lifted against the soviet bloc 
nations 
the restrictions are based on multilateral agreements but the 
allies generally follow the united states lead in these matters 
the cocom committee based in paris consists of australia 
belgium britain canada denmark france west germany greece 
italy japan luxembourg netherlands norway portugal spain 
turkey and the united states 
the committee is scheduled to take up the question this week 
although restrictions will remain on some sophisticated computers 
and the portable laptop computers cheney said would prefer that 
exports be permitted for only a lower level of technology 
my concern is that it will give them a computer capability that 
has military applications that should be avoided the secretary 
said 
he said he disagreed with allowing the east bloc to obtain 
computers with a higher data processing rate and storage capacity 
the reason we have the cocom is to make sure you dont transfer 
militarily sensitive or significant information or tech and my 
concern is that im not satisfied that we are protecting that 
technology under that decsion cheney said 
the commerce department said there were about 6 million 
atcompatible desk top personal computers sold worldwide by us 
companies in 1988 of those 27 million valued at than 1 billion 
were sold outside the united states
