a polar bear attacked and killed a man 
as he walked with his girlfriend through a tiny eskimo village on 
the arctic coast officials said 
officials later tracked down the bear and destroyed it said 
us fish and wildlife service spokesman bruce batten he said 
officials were speculating that the bear attacked the man because 
it was hungry batten said 
an autopsy on the victim 28yearold carl stalker was to be 
held in fairbanks federal wildlife officials planned to examine 
the bears remains for possible clues to the attack 
stalker was killed early saturday in point lay a village of 
about 160 residents some 200 miles southwest of barrow and 700 
miles northwest of anchorage his girlfriend who has not been 
publicly identified was not injured 
such polar bear attacks are rare batten said 
were extremely interested in finding out what we can find out 
about this particular bear he said 
polar bears migrate from east to west at this time of year and 
during the winter months their principal source of food is seal 
meat said batten unlike brown and black bears in southern 
latitudes male polar bears do not hibernate and spend most of the 
winter hunting for food 
they tend to be rather curious and will often be attracted by 
motion or activity said batten he said some polar bears have 
been attracted by smell of garbage at dumps and can create a 
nuisance in villages and larger towns

museum officials locked in a battle with 
an art critic over the authenticity of a purported selfportrait by 
van gogh say they have new proof contained in an xray of the 
painting 
the xray taken at hartfords mount sinai hospital shows the 
outlines of a sketch beneath the painting and officials at 
wadsworth atheneum say the sketch was clearly done by van gogh in 
the mid1880s 
with these scientific results we now have what i believe is 
the smoking pistol positive proof that this must be a work by 
vincent van gogh said museum director patrick mccaughey 
the xray and the picture will be exhibited sidebyside on 
tuesday at the museum 
the authenticity of the 16by13inch painting has been 
challenged repeatedly since it was donated to the museum in 1954 by 
architect philip goodwin 
museum officials have maintained it is one of a series of gaunt 
haunting selfportraits van gogh painted in 1886 through 1888 
most recently swiss art dealer and critic walter feilchenfeldt 
insisted the work is a forgery or more likely a van gogh portrait 
painted in tribute by another artist he said the painting is not 
van goghs style 
the painting is to be included in an international exhibition 
next year 
the international exhibition is what really propelled us into 
saying lets sort this painting out once and for all 
mccaughey said lets see if it is worth 17 million or 170 
170 being the value of the frame 
the museum said the xray disclosed a sketch of a fleshy woman 
in a bonnet the woman looks much like the figures in van goghs 
series of pictures of dutch peasants such as the potato 
eaters mccaughey said 
when the xray was turned upside down there indeed was mrs 
potato eater or miss potato eater seated at the pail peeling her 
spuds he said 
impoverished artists like van gogh painted over earlier works or 
painted on both sides of a canvas to save money 
mccaughey said it is extremely unlikely a forger would have gone 
to the trouble of forging an additional van gogh underneath the 
portrait 
feilchenfeldt said of the findings this is of course 
exciting news about the xray which i have not seen but i am 
more inclined to believe that these images found underneath could 
also be forgeries 
the critic has also challenged the authenticity of van gogh 
selfportraits owned by the metropolitan museum of art in new york 
and norways national gallery in oslo

in the season of christmas 
pilgrimages by christians from around the world the town where 
jesus was born has nothing but room at its inns 
mayor elias freij looks out the window of his office onto the 
deserted square at the church of the nativity 
tourists what tourists he asks rhetorically sweeping an 
arm toward the emptiness this is the worst situation in my 
memory 
with the drums of war beating in the saudi desert and the 
large armada assembling in the persian gulf people are simply 
too scared to come here says freij a greek orthodox palestinian 
who has been mayor for 18 years 
he said the last straw was israels decision in october to 
distribute gas masks in case of an iraqi attack would you go on 
holiday to a country where you need a gas mask freij asked 
israel has suffered an overall loss in tourism because of the 
gulf crisis bethlehem and arab east jerusalem are especially 
affected because the crisis accompanies what usually is their 
busiest season 
the government had predicted a record year in tourism 
surpassing the previous high of 15 million visitors in 1987 
instead tourist arrivals have declined by half since iraq seized 
kuwait on aug 2 said tourism ministry spokesman yossi shoval he 
said the 1990 total would be 13 million at best 
shoval said the ministry still was trying to woo jewish 
religious groups and christians pilgrims but that israel had 
canceled its overseas television advertising until the gulf 
situation improves 
there will be christians here for christmas he said the 
question is how many 
on a recent morning in bethlehem a single tour bus was parked 
in manger square its seven italian passengers were alone in the 
underground grotto of the church of the nativity kneeling at the 
silver star that marks the site of christs birth 
in normal times pilgrims would be elbowtoelbow in the church 
and the tiny grotto 
things are so bad that i am not earning enough to feed me and 
my wife said issa elboyaji a man in his 70s who usually makes 
his living shining the shoes of pilgrims outside the church 
he has set aside his brassinlaid shoeshine box and directs 
drivers into parking places around manger square hoping they will 
give him small change for his efforts 
traditional religious ceremonies are scheduled for the holidays 
they will begin on christmas eve with the ceremonial arrival of the 
roman catholic patriarch of jerusalem and end with masses and 
anglican chorale services 
for the fourth year bethlehem will forgo street decorations and 
holiday receptions in sympathy with the palestinian uprising in the 
west bank and gaza strip freij said 
the revolt against israeli occupation which began in december 
1987 has taken the lives of more than 770 palestinians and 53 
israelis 
with the confrontations with the desperation there is 
nothing to celebrate the mayor said 
the drop in tourism has taken its toll on the economy of 
bethlehem a town of 40000 people 
freij says only one of the six hotels is operating and nearly 
all the 80 restaurants are closed scores of craftsmen have been 
laid off at the 400 workshops that produce olive wood carvings and 
motherofpearl jewelry 
tax collections have fallen off so much freij said that 
municipal workers could not be paid in november 
fahmi nashashibi secretary of the arab hotels association in 
jerusalem and bethlehem said he had closed two of his three hotels 
for pilgrims in east jerusalem because more than half the christmas 
bookings were canceled

the fbi investigation into who leaked tapes of 
manuel noriegas prison phone calls focuses on a political opponent 
who might testify against the deposed panamanian dictator 
newspapers reported 
the fbi believes the source of the leak appears to be jose 
blandon once an intelligence officer in panama for noriega and the 
countrys former consul general in new york the miami herald and 
the washington post reported quoting unidentified sources 
blandon denied leaking the government tapes in an interview 
published sunday in the post blandon said someone in the us 
government who wants to sabotage the noriega trial must have been 
responsible 
somebody in the government was leaking them blandon said 
drug enforcement agents were present whenever he had access to the 
tapes and he was allowed to make only written notes blandon said 
blandon also said he provided prosecutor patrick sullivan with a 
written summary of the tapes at sullivans request that summary 
referred to several calls between noriega and his lead defense 
attorney frank rubino blandon said 
i mentioned everything blandon said including a 
conversation in which noriega and rubino discussed how to deal with 
luis del cid a former noriega aide who has pleaded guilty in the 
case and promised to testify against his former boss 
the fbi is trying to determine who gave the tapes to cable news 
network which aired some of noriegas conversations from prison 
over the past month the broadcasts were halted briefly while a 
federal judge decided whether noriegas right to a fair trial would 
be jeopardized after reviewing the tapes the judge decided to let 
cnn broadcast them 
a spokesman for the us attorneys office in miami said 
prosecutors have not listened to any of the tapes and would 
neither confirm nor deny that prosecutors received blandons 
summary of the tapes he reviewed 
fbi agents searched blandons home in houston on thursday night 
looking for telephone logs and documents both newspapers reported 
unidentified sources said blandon played portions of the tapes 
for two officials of the panamanian government in a miami hotel 
room in march the herald said saturday 
if the fbi can prove blandon leaked the tapes or if the court 
determines that prosecutors have been tainted by exposure to 
privileged conversations between noriega and his attorneys the 
governments efforts to try noriega on drug charges could be 
hampered 
blandon has been considered a key government witness since he 
testified before a senate committee in 1988 that noriega protected 
usbound cocaine shipments 
blandons role in reviewing the tapes was revealed after the 
government confirmed publicly for the first time in court documents 
friday that dea agents had studied noriegas phone calls 
noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking 46 million in 
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade passing through panama from 
colombia to the united states

in the persian gulf by talking out their differences south african 
archbishop desmond tutu said saturday

continue its economic sanctions against south africa until the 
process of dismantling apartheid is irreversible 
apartheid is south africas official police of racial 
segregation and discrimination against nonwhites

for some reform the pillars of apartheid still stand firmly in 
place tutu said

scholarship money for south african students abroad and for 
american indian students in montana 
tutu heads the 26 millionmember anglican church of southern

twentythree americans headed for home 
sunday after flying out of baghdad as the first to depart since 
iraq announced it is freeing all foreign captives one of the 23 
shouted jubilantly were outta here 
the group was headed for houston early sunday after a brief 
stopover in shannon ireland aboard a boeing 707 jetliner 
chartered by former treasury secretary john connally according to 
airport officials in shannon two british hostages also on the 
plane that left baghdad on saturday got off at shannon 
the plane was expected to arrive in houston early sunday 
it was not clear whether the departure of connallys mission had 
been arranged before the iraqi parliament on friday approved 
president saddam husseins call to free the hostages the exodus 
was expected to get under way in earnest on sunday 
president bush in venezuela welcomed the move to free the 
captives but said iraq still must get out of kuwait which it 
overran aug 2 
when you dont have americans there and if force is required 
thats just one less worry ive got bush said 
iraqi authorities meanwhile called on the public saturday to 
renew their vigilance in the face of a possible threat from the 
usled international forces 
the interior ministry had instructed civil defense groups and 
provincial officials to prepare for any eventuality said the 
nightly television news broadcast posters warning the population 
not to panic in case of attack appeared on walls of buildings 
in downtown baghdad 
in london the observer newspaper reported sunday that iraq has 
redrawn its border with kuwait and could withdraw as early as next 
month the observer in a story from washington said iraq was 
laying claim to an area of the rumaila oilfield and the islands of 
warba and bubiyan in the persian gulf 
the report citing unidentified arab sources in washington said 
iraq has erected a barbedwire fence around the southern tip of the 
oilfield which extends into northern kuwait iraq has long claimed 
the area 
iraqi officials said saturday all the departing detainees still 
need exit visas us officials have asked them to expedite the 
processing 
americans who had been held at strategic installations as 
human shields began arriving in baghdad saturday many said 
they would not feel safe until they were out of iraq 
i still think of myself as a hostage because i cannot leave 
the hotel said edward smiley of los angeles 
smiley who said he was moved around to six different locations 
described conditions as very bad 
he said the hostages were forced to sleep in bugridden beds and 
to eat fish heads for much of the time 
about 8000 westerners had been detained since iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait including about 600 who were held at stratgic 
sites in an effort to deter any us attack the hostages included 
about 900 americans as well as other westerners eastern europeans 
and japanese 
the first group of 17 american hostages was led through passport 
control at baghdads saddam airport by iraqi officials 
were outta here shouted a delighted american 
the airport departure area was littered with broken suitcases 
clothes and other debris left over from a group of at least 200 
vietnamese workers flown to hanoi earlier in the day 
a witness who did not want to be named described how iraqi 
customs officials tore through their luggage pulling out food 
carpets and other items 
the 23 americans on the flight arranged by connally also 
included members of the us embassy staff in kuwait and three 
people who had taken refuge at the ambassadors refuge in baghdad 
connally went to baghdad on a private mission to obtain the 
release of hostages 
a group of 41 japanese men whose release was approved before 
sadams announcemnt also flew to amman jordan on saturday aboard 
an iraqi airways plane they later left for tokyo 
nur eldin alsafi the head of iraqi airways said the airline 
was prepared to fly out all of the hostages within three days if 
their travel documents are ready he said that no foreign carrier 
would be allowed to transport them out of iraq 
alsafi said us officials had chartered one of the airlines 
boeing 707s to fly to kuwait sunday to pick up americans the 
united states had also chartered a 747 jumbo jet to fly those 
americans and others in baghdad to frankfurt germany later 
sunday he added 
meanwhile the official iraqi news agency said iraq rejected the 
dates the united states has suggested for secretary of state james 
a baker iiis trip to baghdad for talks with saddam 
iraq proposed jan 12 as the date for the baker trip the news 
agency said the state department had suggested he visit on dec 
20 dec 21 dec 22 or jan 3 
a jan 12 date would come only three days before the deadline 
set down in a un resolution demanding an iraqi withdrawal from 
kuwait the security council measure authorizes use of all 
necessary means to dislodge iraq after that 
at the united nations the security council late saturday

international peace conference on the middle east 
the council voted 94 to adopt a soviet motion to postpone 
consideration of the resolution until monday the united states 
voted in favor of postponement while france and china abstained 
a us veto would outrage washingtons arab allies in the

poles voted sunday for their first 
popularly elected president choosing between a national icon lech 
walesa and an emigre businessman who didnt live in poland until 
two months ago 
opinion polls showed the solidarity chief and former shipyard 
electrician far ahead of the newcomer stanislaw tyminski 
but tyminskis surprise elimination of prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki in the first round of voting on nov 25 was so 
unexpected that few were willing to count him out entirely 
tyminski 42 who owns a toronto computer and communications 
business and leads the fringe libertarian party of canada began 
campaigning in october after 21 years in toronto and iquitos peru 
walesa 47 voted after leaving mass in his hometown gdansk 
where auxiliary bishop zygmunt pawlowicz had greeted him as our 
dear mr president 
the roman catholic church openly endorsed walesa in the 
campaign 
polls opened at 6 am and were to close at 8 pm 2 pm est 
reliable projections of results were expected within minutes 
afterward based on exit polls conducted throughout the day by state 
television and the german polling service infas 
temperatures were around the freezing mark and snow covered the 
ground in the southern part of the country more than 27 million 
poles are eligible to cast their ballots at 22000 polling stations 
nationwide 
spending freely and railing against the economic treason of 
the mazowiecki government tyminski turned the campaign on its head 
in the first round of voting 
but he has been hurt recently as new information surfaced 
regarding his links to members of the former communist party his 
advocacy of nuclear weapons in a campaign tract and his reported 
use of hallucinogenic drugs in the amazon jungle 
the president will succeed gen wojciech jaruzelski the former 
communist party chief who imposed martial law on solidarity nine 
year ago this week 
the new president who will serve a fiveyear term will be in 
office while poland drafts its new constitution next year 
no date has been set for the swearingin if no challenges are 
raised to the official results it could happen by the end of this 
week 
historically polands presidents were always elected by 
parliament 
polls last week showed walesa leading tyminski by more than a 
31 margin 
out of 13 people interviewed after polls opened in warsaw not 
one said they voted for tyminski however he was believed to have 
more support in rural areas 
the presidency would cap an astonishing personal voyage for 
walesa who rose from his origins in a poor peasant family to 
become a shipyard electrician then led the solidarity trade union 
movement in the first peaceful revolution to dump a communist 
government 
should walesa win goes a joke circulating here poland would 
become a true communist state with a worker as president

in the united states early sunday to the cheers of nearly 200 
relatives and supporters 
the chartered jet touched down at ellington field south of 
downtown houston at 440 am cst 
the crowd some waving small american flags applauded and 
cheered as the hostages started down the stairway onto the tarmac 
once off the plane they were escorted to the nearby us coast 
guard hangar 
god bless america said former hostage scott nelson of los 
angeles he said he was held at a munitions plant about 35 miles 
south of baghdad and was treated well

american architectural firm in kuwait said we were treated fine 
once you accept the fact that youre being held against your 
will 
the iraqi parliament on friday approved president saddam 
husseins call to free all foreign captives the exodus was 
expected to get under way in earnest on sunday 
the hostages flew to houston with john connally a former us 
treasury secretary and former texas governor and houston oilman 
oscar wyatt the two flew to baghdad last week with 500000 worth 
of medical supplies as a goodwill gesture 
seven of the hostages relatives and three us embassy 
employees were also on board the corporate jet a 22nd hostage was 
also on board when the plane left iraq peter mccleod a british 
subject who got off during a refueling stop in ireland 
connally who had tears in his eyes as he watched the former 
hostages greet their relatives said that he and wyatt did not tell 
state department officials about their planned trip to baghdad nor 
did they ask for their assistance in securing the hostages release 
we knew they would try to discourage us connally said we 
didnt want to be discouraged connally noted that state 
department officials had discouraged hostages relatives from 
traveling to baghdad 
wyatt is chairman of coastal corp which provided the jet and 
paid for the medical supplies the oil company also arranged

flights home for the entire group said coastal spokesman jim 
bailey 
none of the hostages works for coastal bailey said 
wyatt and connally secured the captives release before saddam 
announced that all foreigners would be released 
connally said he and wyatt advised saddam that a release of 
hostages at christmastime would be a show of compassion connally 
said saddam replied you will not go home with an empty plane 
but filling the plane became difficult because of bureaucratic 
delays in obtaining exit visas connally said that the hostages 
that accompanied him made it on this flight only because they were 
able to get clearance first 
wyatt said that the iraqi government had donated 30000 worth 
of fuel to fly the plane home because wyatt was forbidden by us 
economic sanctions to buy fuel directly from the iraqis 
about 8000 westerners had been detained since iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait including about 600 who were held at strategic 
sites in an effort to deter any us attack the hostages included

and japanese 
former hostage bill rodebush of mcalester okla said he was 
treated as good as they could but added he was moved six times 
during his captivity he refused to say where he was held till 
all my friends get out

frank sinatra onetime idol of bobbysoxers 
who became a show business legend evokes nostalgia these days but 
as he turns 75 hes still doing it his way 
known as the chairman of the board ol blue eyes the voice 
just plain frank or simply sinatra the crooner is belting out 
standards for still another generation of pop music fans 
on tuesday the eve of francis albert sinatras 75th birthday 
celebration the entertainer returns to an arena near his new 
jersey hometown of hoboken to begin a yearlong world tour designed 
to fulfill a lifetime yearning performances in the soviet union 
and possibly china 
after kicking off his diamond jubilee world tour at the 
meadowlands brendan byrne arena sinatra will gather with his 
family at a hotel for a private birthday celebration 
there are no words that can truly describe frank sinatra 
magic charisma and talent they still dont accurately capture 
the aura about him said his former longtime publicist lee 
solters 
sinatra who first became popular in the 1940s continues to get 
under our skin whether hes performing before sellout audiences or 
singing from recordings including two new boxed sets just released 
for christmas 
fly me to the moon strangers in the night you make 
me feel so young the lady is a tramp new york new 
york summer wind ive got you under my skin and my 
way are sinatra classics 
hes won grammys and emmys he collected a special academy award 
in 1945 for the house i live in a short about religious and 
racial tolerance and the supporting actor oscar for his role as 
pvt angelo maggio in from here to eternity 
hes appeared in more than 50 movies including anchors 
aweigh on the town guys and dolls the tender trap 
high society pal joey the manchurian candidate and 
von ryans express 
his hairline has receded over the years and his waist has 
thickened but his light baritone has only grown deeper and richer 
the blunt aggressive son of immigrants has ld a lavish 
lifestyle and associated with people whose names could be found in 
fbi files but for each story of him punching someone who had 
offended him there was a story of loyalty and generosity to 
friends and strangers 
he exudes vitality these days still sinatra may be thinking 
about his age during a toast on an upcoming tv special he lifts 
his glass and says may you all live to be 400 years old and may 
the last voice you hear be mine 
tina sinatra his daughter who helped edit the cbstv special 
sinatra 75 the best is yet to come to be broadcast next 
sunday conceded she was overwhelmed after going over details of 
her fathers life 
i was pretty well educated pretty well aware of his career 
because ive known him all my life of course she said but 
when you do it in a consolidated time it is quite something its 
emotional its fascinating its overwhelming 
sinatra who refuses most interviews has had good press and bad 
press over the years 
asked about the entertainers wellpublicized runins with the 
media solters explained he doesnt cater to the press but at 
the same time hes not rude to them intentionally hes his own 
man hes much maligned the press will take something and blow it 
out of proportion 
the press can take a thread and make a garment 
sinatra isnt bashful and doesnt hesitate to speak his mind 
most recently after george michael complained about the tragedy of 
fame sinatra wrote an open letter to the pop star telling him to 
stop whining 
frank is a tiger afraid of nothing ready for anything 
robert mitchum once said hell fight anything heres a frail 
undersized little fellow with a scarredup face who isnt afraid of 
the whole world 
sinatra has been married four times a romance with ava gardner 
led to the end of his marriage to longtime sweetheart nancy 
barbato who married him in 1939 and bore three children nancy 
frank jr and christina 
his tempestuous onagain offagain marriage to gardner ended 
in 1953 his name was linked with lana turner and lauren bacall 
and he was engaged briefly to juliet prowse but he did not marry 
again until 19yearold mia farrow came into his life more than a 
decade later 
by that time he was the firmly established head of the rat 
pack or the clan a group including dean martin joey bishop 
sammy davis jr and peter lawford 
in 1971 saying he wanted room for reflection he gave his 
farewell concert in los angeles but his retirement ended two 
years later with a tv special ol blue eyes is back in 1976 
he married barbara marx former wife of zeppo marx among those 
attending ronald reagan 
people often remark that im pretty lucky i dont think luck 
as such has much to do with it sinatra said in a 1957 interview 
with the new york times youve got to have something more 
substantial the competition is too fierce 
the lyrics to my way his signature song express it all for 
sinatra ive lived a life thats full i traveled each and every 
highway and more much more than this i did it my way

an iranian minister was quoted as saying 
sunday that the death sentence against author salman rushdie is 
still valid and is irrevocable 
mohammad khatami minister of culture and islamic guidance made 
the comment in an interview with the islamic republic news agency 
carried by tehran radio 
the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini passed islams sentence 
against salman rushdie and this decree and under no circumstances 
can this be revoked khatami was quoted as saying 
rushdie has been in hiding since khomeini called for his death 
in february 1989 for allegedly defaming islam in his novel the 
satanic verses 
last week rushdie made a brief appearance at a london bookstore 
to sign copies of haroun and the sea of stories a childrens 
book he wrote while in hiding 
tehran and london restored ties in september 18 months after 
relations were broken over the rushdie affair 
khatamis pronouncement was an apparent jab at president hashemi 
rafsanjani whose success in downplaying khomeinis fatwa or 
religious edict led to the restoration of tehranlondon ties 
while the rest of rafsanjanis cabinet favors his pragmatic 
policies khatami is one of the few ministers whose sympathies 
extend to the rival antiwestern radical faction 
the radicals led by parliament speaker mehdi karrubi and former 
interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi want to continue to use the 
rushdie affair to block normalization of ties with the west 
the society of combatant theologians which groups various 
hardliners together also said in a statement sunday that the 
death decree against rushdie was irrevocable

the effects of the weakening housing industry 
are trickling through the economy touching not just carpenters and 
contractors but thousands of others not directly involved in 
building houses 
for builder dan pincus the downturn means slowing his brick 
nj operation from three or four houses under construction at one 
time to just one 
for doug brackett of the american furniture manufacturers 
association in high point nc it means slower furniture sales 
when housing starts are down furniture sales are down 
explains irene kleeberg of the national retail federation in new 
york that includes rugs and washing machines dishwashers and 
mattresses 
houses are not being sold and this affects retail sales 
she continued if you buy a new house you want new furniture 
even if your old furniture is ok 
the commerce department says housing starts plunged 6 percent in 
october to their lowest level since the 198182 recession starts 
were down 124 percent during the first 10 months of the year 
sales of new homes also were off 35 percent in october 
matching the 198182 recessionlevel decline in housing starts for 
the year sales have fallen 158 percent from the same period of 
1989 
and the labor department reported on friday that 62000 more 
construction jobs were lost in november over the last six months 
construction employment has dropped by about 250000 the 
government said 
robert villanueva director of forecasting for the national 
association of home builders said the impact of a weakening 
housing industry spreads far beyond the construction industry 
for every 1000 houses being built the total number of jobs 
involved is 1759 manyears he said that means for one house 
its almost 18 years if one man built the house 
but villanueva added actual construction represents less than 
half of those jobs in fact construction manyears account for 
just 627 of the total including 525 manyears involved in onsite 
work the guy actually out there with a hammer 
other industries including manufacturing building products 
transportation and selling services represent another 897 
manyears he said manufacturing alone accounts for about 23 
percent of the total 
land develoment clearing the land trenching it putting in 
the sewers and other utilities accounts for yet another 235 
manyears 
at the same time slackening demand has brought down prices 
and presumably profits in various industries 
for example gypsum prices showed about a 6 or 7 percent 
decline over the past year villanueva said gypsum is a primary 
material for interior walls of houses 
lumber and wood prices also seem to be sliding over the 
last six months villanueva added 
he said sales of basic construction supplies peaked last 
february and have declined 55 percent since then sales of home 
furnishings such as appliances and air conditioners and furniture 
have declined 53 percent since their march high 
nevertheless economist sandra shaber with the futures group in 
washington says replacement demand is softening some of the effect 
of the housing slowdown 
for certain demographic and economic reasons replacement 
demand is somewhat stronger than it might otherwise be she said 
thats both because theres a very large group of aging baby 
boomers and the difficulties of the affordability of moving 
while this in no way is going to save the appliance or 
furniture businesses from suffering during a recession it can 
cushion some of the blow she added appliances and furniture 
might have been even weaker had it not been for a certain amount of 
demographically and economically related replacement demand 
in fact mary gillespie of the association of home appliance 
manufacturers in chicago says her organization has been 
hardpressed to put together a close correlation with appliances 
and the downturn in housing 
ms gillespie admitted that appliance sales have slowed 
although that was anticipated because of the overall economic 
sluggishness but the downturn has not been in the areas usually 
closely related to housing she added 
for example ranges she explained ranges are the first 
appliance the primary appliance thats tied to new housing while 
housing is down that in fact has not been the case for ranges 
either gas or electric dishwashers are usually closely tied to 
new housing dishwashers are up 14 percent for the year

the unfolding story of pentagon bungling in 
the a12 stealth aircraft program has revealed more than just new 
details about the secret navy attack plane thats been under wraps 
for more than six years 
emerging evidence of mismanagement in the 50 billion program 
also has shown clearly that defense secretary dick cheney has 
failed to break a longstanding and embarrassing pattern of waste 
and deception in weapons procurement 
the pentagon inspector general and a navy internal report last 
week said technical problems in producing the first prototype plane 
were papered over to keep the contract fees flowing 
excessive secrecy limited normal program reviews that may have 
tipped off navy managers early on to the planes problems 
now the plane is over budget overweight and overdue there is 
some doubt it ever will get off the drawing board 
the a12 isnt just any plane its the navys no 1 aviation 
priority envisioned as the latest us warplane to be built with 
composite materials that limit radar reflections and thereby make 
it especially difficult to detect by enemy radar 
it is supposed to replace the navys venerable a6 carrierbased 
attack planes in the mid1990s 
but the navy report last week confirmed for the first time that 
the plane may be nearly 8000 pounds heavier than the original 
specifications required the main problem it said is weight 
growth due to the thickness of the construction material needed 
to make the plane strong enough for landings on aircraft carriers 
the house armed services committee was scheduled to hold a 
public hearing monday on the a12s problems with navy secretary 
h lawrence garrett iii to testify 
cheney back from a european trip also was expecting a report 
monday from his top deputy on corrective recommendations 
one of the key executives cheney recruited to help reform the 
armsbuying process john betti a former ford motor co vice 
president was singled out by the pentagon inspector general as a 
culprit in the a12 fiasco 
we find mr bettis failure especially troublesome the 
inspector general wrote in a report to congress 
betti still has his job but vice adm richard c gentz the top 
navy officer overseeing the program was ordered to retire after 
the internal navy report said navy managers had failed to tell the 
top brass of mounting financial and technical problems in the a12 
program 
two other senior navy officials were transferred to other jobs 
and formally censured 
a major review of the program in april by highlevel pentagon 
officials including betti failed to disclose the problems betti 
shrugged off a warning from one of his own staff members that the 
contractors were stumbling and that development costs were at least 
1 billion over the projected 48 billion 
betti chose to believe the overly optimistic assessments of the 
contractors mcdonnell douglas corp and general dynamics corp 
both of st louis 
after being briefed on the program reviews conclusions and 
not knowing they were misleading cheney publicly assured congress 
that the a12 was on track and within budget 
he urged that 620 of the planes be bought for 52 billion 
just a few weeks later on june 1 the contractors dropped their 
bombshell the work was a year behind schedule and far over budget 
and the plane could not meet certain performance standards 
shortly afterward general dynamics took a 450 million 
writeoff on the program and both contractors are pursuing claims 
with the pentagon to recover some unanticipated expenses they also 
want to restructure the contract 
al spivak a general dynamics spokesman said the company had no 
comment on the navy report in which both contractors were accused 
of concealing information that would have tipped off the navy 
leadership to the projects problems 
were still reviewing it and we have nothing more to say at 
this time spivak said friday 
mcdonnell douglas did not return a call seeking comment last 
week 
the navys a12 investigation said excessive secrecy helped hide 
the problems 
for example an internal progress report normally provided to 
the office of the navy secretary was not written because there were 
too few people available with the necessary security clearances 
in her report inspector general susan j crawford said the 
pentagon gave the contractors too much latitude citing a pentagon 
inspector teams january visit to the general dynamics a12 plant 
in fort worth texas 
the inspectors agreed at the end of their visit to turn over 
their notes which general dynamics reviewed for security 
classification one set of notes was lost it later was determined 
to have contained no secret information 
we question any procedure by which a contractor obtains access 
to and control over the work product of government personnel 
engaged in oversight duties ms crawford wrote

two decades ago when richard nixon 
was still a relative newcomer in the white house he said the 
united states needed a more mature partnership with latin 
america four presidents later nixons goal may finally have been 
achieved 
after spending eight of the past 13 days in latin america two 
in mexico and six in south america bush can boast that there is 
probably less tension in the relationship than at any time over the 
past generation 
there is general agreement between the united states and latin 
america on shared objectives particularly on achieving prosperity 
through increased trade and investment these are key elements of 
the enterprise for the americas initiative that bush promoted 
throughout his travels 
the crowds greeting bush were generally friendly but not huge 
as bush headed home on saturday he could take comfort in the fact 
that the angry mobs that used to stalk visiting american leaders 
were largely absent the yankee go home mentality nowadays is 
largely limited to student fringe groups 
nixon himself was witness to what was perhaps the angriest 
antiamerican demonstration in latin american history it happened 
right here in 1958 when nixon was like george bush used to be 
vice president nixon barely escaped with his life eleven years 
later when nixon wanted to send nelson rockefeller to venezuela as 
part of a factfinding mission the venezuelans told rockefeller to 
say home 
bush was able to spend 24 tranquil hours here friday and 
saturday venezuelans who look upon the united states as the enemy 
are diminishing in number and the more benign view of washington 
extends elsewhere in the region 
in his visits to brazil uruguay argentina and chile there was 
a relaxed camaraderie at almost every stop as opposed to the cold 
formal encounters us officials were accustomed to during periods 
of friction over such issues as human rights abuses 
bush was able to speak to the national legislatures in four 
countries almost without incident underscoring the more laid back 
approach bush went to rodeos in mexico and argentina and took a 
dip at an uruguayan beach resort the past week would have been 
almost care free were it not for the repeated intrusions of the 
persian gulf crisis 
there are a number of factors contributing to bushs ability to 
breeze through one of the most ambitious latin american tours ever 
undertaken by an american president 
one is the end of the cold war during which the united states 
and latin america rarely saw eye to eye on how to deal with the 
issue of marxism beyond that few latins now look on cuba as the 
answer and the us as the problem 
another is the historic embrace of democracy in the region at 
times in the past the united states seemed to waver in its support 
for democracy but no longer and most latins applaud the change 
in addition a remarkable consensus has emerged throughout the 
hemisphere that latin economic stagnation is attributable to closed 
economic systems which in bushs words have smothered growth 
and benefited only those with the right political connections 
the new breed of leaders bush said here saturday understands 
that the road to growth jobs and rising income is through new 
investment expanded trade and unleashing the energy of 
entrepreneurs 
bush brought little with him except encouragement at each stop 
he reaffirmed his policy of trying to induce the latins to stick to 
their new policies by offering them incentives in the areas of 
trade investment and debt 
his ultimate goal is a hemispherewide free trade agreement 
us officials wonder whether the latins have the political will to 
carry out the reforms they agree are necessary the latins wonder 
whether bushs trade goals will be thwarted by protectionist 
sentiment back home how these issues are dealt with will have a 
bearing on both hemispheric harmony and prosperity

lung cancer rates have climbed so sharply in the 
united states that the death rate from the disease among 
nonsmoking women is now higher than the total lung cancer death 
rate in women 30 years ago a study shows 
cancer is increasing in industrial countries above and beyond 
that due to cigarette smoking or aging alone said devra lee 
davis an author of the study and one of the editors of a 
collection of studies exploring the recent increases in cancer 
the increased rate of lung cancer among women who dont smoke 
could reflect exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke as well as 
exposure to radon asbestos and possibly air pollution said davis 
a researcher at the national academy of sciences in washington 
according to national cancer institute figures the lung cancer 
death rate among all women in 1955 was 51 deaths per hundred 
thousand women davis and her collaborators calculated that the 
death rate in women nonsmokers by 1985 was 61 per hundred 
thousand the total reported lung cancer death rate that year for 
women was 264 
sharp increases are also occurring in brain cancer a blood 
cancer called multiple myeloma and the dangerous skin cancer called 
melanoma davis said and the increases are occurring in many 
industrial countries not just the united states 
the changes ar so great over such a short time in so many 
countries in men and women that we need to look carefully for their 
causes she said these could be very important as clues for 
prevention and its better to prevent cancer than to cure it 
although the studies emphasize occupational and environmental 
exposure smoking remains one of the single most important causes 
of cancer davis said in many industrial countries it is 
responsible for 40 percent of all cancer deaths in men and 30 
percent in women 
smoking kills an estimated 3 million people each year around the 
world and if current trends continue that will climb to more than 
10 million per year by 2020 she said 
the new studies are collected in trends in cancer mortality in 
industrial countries which will be released by the new york 
academy of sciences later this week a copy was obtained by the 
associated press 
in addition to the increase in lung cancer among women 
nonsmokers davis mentioned these other examples of cancer on the 
rise 
multiple myeloma appears to be increasing in industrialized 
countries possibly as a result of increasing exposure to benzene 
in gasoline although that is not yet scientifically proven 
if i had to bet id bet it was true said dr bernard 
goldstein of the university of medicine and dentistry in new 
jersey whose study suggested the link i thought that 
communicating this would be of value because it would alert other 
investigators to look at their myeloma cases 
melanoma is increasing in men much more rapidly than in women 
suggesting some occupational exposure melanoma has been 
associated in some groups of workers with exposure to pcbs said 
davis 
there are a number of cancers where men have higher rates than 
women she said for example more men than women die of 
colorectal cancer and their deaths from colorectal cancer are 
increasing faster for men than women she said when you see it 
elevated in men you have to consider whether occupational factors 
are involved 
brain cancer in men and women and breast cancer are also rising 
dramatically davis said 
the rise in the cancer rates and death rates is clear davis 
said but she emphasized that the links to benzene pcbs and other 
environmental carcinogens remain speculative 
many factors could play a role in the cancer increases she

they include a genetic predisposition to cancer lifestyle 
including drinking and smoking the rate of consumption of 
anticancer foods like fresh fruits and vegetables exposure to 
xrays and infectious agents and other occupational and 
environmental factors she said

sen john glenn last week derided the 
administrations persian gulf policy went to secret intelligence 
committee briefings on the crisis and warned about a shortage of 
combat medical personnel 
what the ohio democrat didnt do was attend the senate ethics 
committee hearing investigating the ties he and four other senators 
had with savings and loan executive charles h keating jr 
i have a job to do glenn said why waste time sitting 
down there 
in fact the ohio democrat has skipped nearly every ethics 
committee session dealing with the socalled keating five instead 
he relies mainly on briefings from his lawyer 
his last appearance was nov 16 when he issued a defiant 
defense john glenn does not peddle influence period 
the five senators intervened with federal banking regulators on 
behalf of keating former head of the failed lincoln savings and 
loan they also received 13 million in political donations for 
their campaigns and causes from keating and his associates 
all the senators have denied that the contributions influenced 
their intervention and say their discussions with federal 
regulators on keatings behalf amounted to routine help for a 
constituent the special counsel prosecuting the case has 
recommended that glenn and sen john mccain rariz be dropped 
from the case 
glenn is hardly alone in skipping the televised hearings 
mccain and sen dennis deconcini dariz have made brief 
appearances to watch testimony by their aides and a character 
witness 
sen donald riegle dmich last attended nov 20 and is said 
by a spokeswoman to be monitoring testimony from his office where 
hes planning an agenda for the senate banking committee which he 
chairs 
sen alan cranston is in california undergoing radiation 
treatment for prostate cancer 
but glenn has been the most conspicuous by his presence 
elsewhere on capitol hill 
with the massive troop deployment and threat of war in the 
persian gulf his committee assignments and longtime interest in 
nuclear proliferation have given him plenty to do 
i think my first responsibility is doing whatever i can right 
here glenn said 
i have a background in the military and i think on the armed 
services committee people do listen to what i have to say he 
said i dont know why people think we should be sitting down in 
that ethics room all the time when we could be going to war 
last week while the ethics committee hearing was being 
televised live on one cable channel glenn could be seen on two 
other channels 
from his perch in the senate armed services committee hearing 
room glenn peered down at defense secretary dick cheney and 
criticized the bush administration policy in the persian gulf 
he called it a chicken little approach the sky is 
falling and the only option is war 
cheney had told the committee that economic sanctions alone 
might not be enough to force saddam hussein from kuwait 
glenn also asked lt gen william odom former director of the 
national security agency about munitions supplies and troop 
rotations and whether the american people are willing to support 
going to war 
a few days later on abctvs nightline program he sounded 
alarms about severe shortages of combat doctors and nurses 
throughout the department of defense 
look this nation may be going to war glenn said in an 
interview can anyone tell me any more important thing to be 
doing than making whatever input i can thats what ive been 
doing 
the military manpower subcommittee glenn heads is looking into 
whether the persian gulf buildup will require a change in the 
nations longterm plan for reducing the number of people in 
uniform 
hes an expert on nuclear arms and he puts out a newsletter 
proliferation watch this month the publication annotated 
current knowledge on iraq which the bush administration claims is 
trying to build a nuclear weapon 
glenns reserved seat at the ethics proceeding also was empty 
while he conducted a classified intelligence hearing in which we 
looked into the nuclear claims of the administration 
glenn who hasnt announced what his political plans will be 
when his term expires in 1992 says hes aware of how much is at 
stake for him but he also says he would deserve to be criticized 
if he dropped everything to attend the entire ethics proceeding 
that began nov 15 
to think you have to sit there every second of every day 
thats not what a senate job is about glenn said thats not a 
good use of my time

the kgb said sunday it had uncovered plots to 
divert food from empty stores and hungry soviet people and said it 
was filing criminal charges against those responsible 
soviet media meanwhile said donated foreign food was waiting 
in cargo ships on the east and west coasts because of port 
congestion and was piled up at moscow railway stations due to a 
shortage of trucks and drivers 
the kgb created a special unit last month to control 
distribution of donated food supplies and prevent their theft 
after the government put it in charge of the battle against 
economic sabotage 
the official tass news agency reported sunday that the kgb had 
exposed and stopped the actions of some officials aimed at 
obtaining personal advantages at the expense of state interests 
during the storage transportation and selling to the population of 
foodstuffs and consumer goods 
some western donors had expressed fears that their food aid 
could be diverted to the black market siphoned off by corrupt 
officials or left to rot because of inefficient soviet 
transportation and storage facilities 
we held moscow against the nazis in late 1941 but now it 
seems we have given it up to our home predators who have caught 
their prey in their mafia trade net stanislav kondrashov a 
respected soviet commentator wrote in the government newspaper 
izvestia 
tass said the kgb discovered that a warehouse in the novgorod 
region southwest of leningrad planned to trade more than 160 tons 
of powdered milk for furniture from an unnamed foreign firm 
the warehouse received the furniture worth 55000 and sold it 
to its employees instead of distributing it to local stores tass 
said the kgb stopped the other half of the exchange the illegal 
export of the milk worth 250000 tass said 
the kgb also discovered that three to five tons of meat were 
being diverted daily from a meat plant in the ukrainian city of 
kharkov to a factory where it was made into sausages for sale on 
the black market 
in addition it found about seven tons of rice buried in the 
karakalpak autonomous region of the uzbekistan republic tass 
said 
numerous other cases of incomplete deliveries concealment of 
imported and sovietmade foodstuffs and manufactured goods as well 
as speculation with those goods were exposed tass said 
criminal proceedings are being instituted against the 
offenders it said 
soviet officials maintain that food production is no lower than 
last year and many blame the barren store shelves on a crumbling 
distribution system and panicked consumers 
many republics and regions across the nation have halted 
shipments of food and consumer goods to moscow and other areas to 
protest policies of the central government and keep scarce goods 
for themselves 
hundreds of tons of food and medicine have been arriving in 
moscow in recent weeks from the united states germany italy 
israel britain switzerland and elsewhere much of the donations 
have come from private groups 
tass reported sunday that congestion at ports on the east and 
west coasts was delaying the unloading of foreign food ships 
containing flour sugar meat and other food from germany belgium 
and cuba were backed up at leningrads port 
the situation at far eastern ports is especially difficlt 
tass said without elaborating 
the communist party newspaper pravda quoted nikolai gavryushin 
head of container and commercial traffic in the railways ministry 
as saying the organization of unloading goods at moscow railway 
stations was catastrophic 
he said as of saturday there were 20000 cargo containers and 
300 railway cars with consumer goods and industrial equipment 
waiting to be unloaded he said 101 rail cars with foreign meat 
have been standing at the moscowtovarnaya cargo station since nov 
25 
gavryushin blamed a shortage of trucks drivers and storage 
space 
all warehouses of trading establishments are packed to 
capacity he said on the other hand shop shelves are empty

hindus and moslems fought sunday with 
knives and swords in a dispute over a mosque and police opened 
fire on rioters authorities said at least 14 people were killed 
a curfew was imposed on the southern city and policemen were 
ordered to shoot violators said police officials who cannot be 
named under briefing rules 
they said 105 people had been killed since the wave of violence 
began on friday in the city of 2 million people 
police opened fire six times during sundays street battles 
killing at least one person and wounding 10 others the officials 
said they said 28 people were hospitalized with stab wounds 
the rioting came as hindu fundamentalists made new attempts to 
destroy a 16th century mosque in the remote northern indian town of 
ayodhya nearly 700 miles from hyderabad and replace it with a 
temple 
there also was renewed violence over the issue in the northern 
town of aligarh 250 miles west of ayodhya where police said at 
least 29 people were killed on friday and saturday 
hindus first targeted the mosque of babar in october during 
that month and november more than 380 people died nationwide in 
violence related to the dispute 
thousands of hindus have been congregating in ayodhya for nearly 
a week staging generally peaceful demonstrations near the small 
mosque which hindu fundamentalists claim was built on the ruins of 
an ancient temple 
united news of india said paramilitary troops foiled an attempt 
to blow up the mosque about midnight saturday 
a 23yearold hindu man was arrested when he approached the 
mosque with three packages of dynamite attached to timed 
detonators the news agency said 
murlidhar reddy a hyderabad police commissioner said at least 
30 people were killed on friday and 60 more died on saturday 
residents said the trouble started thursday night when a hindu 
crowd stoned the house of majeed khan a leader of the babri masjid 
action committee which is trying to save the ayodhya mosque 
moslems retaliated by attacking hindus and both sides 
eventually began fighting each other with knives swords and 
sticks the residents said they also spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
hindu fundamentalists say the mosque of babar was built on the 
ruins of a temple that they claim was razed by moslem conquerers 
moslems say the mosque was built on a vacant plot archaeologists 
and historians are divided on the issue 
the dispute brought down the government of prime minister vp 
singh last month singh lost support when he stopped hindus from 
destroying the mosque and said he wanted the issue settled in 
court 
singhs successor prime minister chandra shekhar has been 
meeting with moslem and hindu leaders in an effort to defuse the 
problem 
moslems who make up 12 percent of indias 880 million people 
fear the destruction of one mosque would lead to the demolition of 
many other islamic shrines and structures across the country 
india is officially secular but the top government ranks are 
dominated by hindus whose make up 82 percent of the population

he talks about the need to turn the racism in our country to 
justice

nomination was elected a shadow senator or lobbyist for the 
district of columbia 
holmes said jackson was criticized in a recent television 
editorial as having the right message but being the wrong 
messenger 
that is the way people often react to a prophet the preacher 
said the message gets under our skin 
god has always used imperfect messengers he said if we 
focus on the imperfections then we block out the message 
holmes is assistant pastor of the church which bush often 
attends on the infrequent sunday mornings he is in washington 
the rector the rev john c harper gave thanks for the release 
of the hostages in iraq and kuwait and prayed for bush the

like many an affluent tourist on an exotic and 
expensive jaunt toyohiro akiyama took in the sights kept his 
handheld video camera ever at the ready and sent off plenty of 
dispatches to folks back home 
but akiyama made history while he was at it becoming the first 
journalist and the first japanese in space 
akiyama comes back down to earth monday eight days after 
blasting off into space with two soviet cosmonauts in a soyuz space 
capsule that linked up with the orbiting space station mir 
his employer the tokyo broadcasting system paid the soviets 
12 million for the roundtrip ticket and spent an additional 25 
million on the project 
taking along a paying passenger was an important step in the 
soviets effort to commercialize their space program and akiyamas 
trip has been a relentlessly commercial affair 
japanese corporate sponsors including a diaper maker and a 
toothpaste company displayed them around the launch pad in remote 
soviet central asia and even plastered them on the rocket itself 
tbs japans largest private broadcaster has made akiyama the 
center of its universe throughout the course of the mission airing 
nightly primetime specials and extended weekend coverage of his 
expoits 
viewers saw the 48yearold akiyama get bear hugs from the 
soviet cosmonauts when he arrived at the mir space station on 
tuesday unfurling a banner reading the first japanese in 
space 
akiyama did not hesitate to share with viewers such details as 
his space sickness upon experiencing weightlessness 
i feel things in my stomach are coming out he reported 
in a more poetic vein viewing the earth from space moved him to 
recite some japanese haiku 
under the thick cloud there is my country approaching i see 
my country in a morning sunshine behind me is the space in pitch 
dark sad is africa with no cloud or forest 
at one point akiyama was filmed trying to drink tea from a tube 
in zero gravity he was clearly startled when some drops of tea 
that missed his mouth began floating away 
much of akiyamas commentary had to do with the pollution on 
earth visible from the spacecraft the skies over japan and the 
united states looked dirty and gray he said 
im not trying to make a big fuss calling for environmental 
protection but i honestly think it is beautiful to see where 
nature is still preserved he said 
he also took six japanese tree frogs into space for experiments 
on how they adapt to the weightless environment tbs said videotape 
of these experiments may be shown later 
tbs which celebrates its 40th anniversary next year created a 
special department in 1986 to develop the space project it sent a 
staff of 120 camera operators technicians correspondents and 
producers to the soviet union to cover the flight 
the company expects to lose 74 million on the project even 
after accounting for advertising revenues and proceeds from 
documentaries and lectures by akiyama 
tbs had exclusive rights to cover the eightday flight the rest 
of japans media prominently covered the blastoff but have since 
been relatively quiet about the rest of the mission

the serial murder trial of arthur j 
shawcross sometimes seems more like an episode of televisions 
twin peaks than a reallife courtroom drama 
throughout the 10week trial spectators crowded into the 
courtroom to hear watch videotaped hypnosis sessions and hear 
testimony on everything from multiple personalities to cannibalism 
and the meaning of truth 
among the cast of characters in the monroe county courtroom 
drama a sharpwitted judge a expert witness who kept wandering 
off the topic and jurors sporting matching bow ties the jury is 
scheduled to begin deliberations wednesday 
shawcross 45 is charged with the murders of 10 women over the 
past two years the burly grayhaired defendant made an unlikely 
centerpiece for the hoopla surrounding him 
he sat motionless between his lawyers throughout the trial 
staring impassively at the floor 
shawcross confessed in january to the 10 slayings and to an 11th 
murder in neighboring wayne county his lawyers have conceded that 
he killed the women but say he was insane when he did it 
jurors watched 12 hours of videotapes in which shawcross was 
purportedly under hypnosis 
on the tapes he switched in and out of a highpitched womans 
voice and told defense psychiatrist dr dorothy lewis that he was 
once a cannibal in medieval england 
the tapes also show shawcross speaking as his mother bessie 
his sister jeannie his childhood self and a character he 
identified as aramus who he said helped him meet girls 
in sometimes graphic detail he described incestuous relations 
with his sister as a child and wartime atrocities and cannibalism 
in vietnam 
in the most dramatic portion of the tapes shawcross appeared to 
relive an incident in which he was sexually abused by his mother 
he told lewis his mothers voice told him to kill his victims and 
that she helped him strangle and mutilate one of the women 
but in videotaped interviews with prosecution psychiatrist dr 
park dietz shawcross said he never heard voices or had different 
personalities 
dietz accused lewis of creating shawcross other personalities 
by asking leading questions 
but lewis said shawcross was suffering from posttraumatic 
stress disorder that arose from severe childhood abuse and brain 
damage she said the combination caused shawcross to lose touch 
with reality at the time of the slayings 
but dietz testified that shawcross faked mental illness 
modeling himself after the character norman bates in the movie 
psycho 
he said shawcross lied about everything from the murders to his 
claim that he had used rubber baby bottle nipples as gun silencers 
in vietnam 
the psychiatrist said he tested that claim with a semiautomatic 
weapon at the rochester police departments gun range 
it didnt silence anything the report was equally loud with 
and without the baby bottle nipple he said with slight smile 
that was a departure from his normally stern demeanor 
dietzs efficient testimony contrasted sharply with the 
streamofconsciousness testimony of lewis her answers frequently 
wandered onto topics like sigmund freuds use of hypnotism and the 
history of psychiatry 
judge donald wisner frequently admonished her saying she would 
have to restrain herself in order to complete this trial before 
spring 
lewis inability to give simple yes or no answers as well as 
her apparent difficulty remembering dates times and facts 
provoked a series of standoffs with prosecutor charles siragusa 
i cant chew gum and walk at the same time lewis told a 
chuckling jury as she shuffled through the stack of papers on her 
lap trying to find an answer to one of siragusas questions 
is the extent of your organization indicated by the file on 
your lap siragusa asked sarcastically 
in another exchange lewis and siragusa had a lengthy 
philosophical debate over the meaning of truth as the psychiatrist 
attempted to distinguish between intentional and unintentional 
falsehoods 
are you saying that fantasy can be the truth an exasperated 
siragusa finally asked 
im saying that having a fantasy can be the truth lewis 
retorted im sure you have them 
and you do as well is that right siragusa asked 
probably very similar lewis said 
i doubt that siragusa snapped back 
can we get back to the case now asked the judge as the 
jury and spectators laughed 
the jury made its own contribution to the bizarre proceedings 
showing up one day in football jerseys and a week later in 
matching bow ties

scholars are having trouble putting 
francisco vasquez de coronado on the map 
they want to add the 16th century spaniards route through the 
southwest to the national trails system but they arent getting 
much help from the explorer and his party 
coronado and his men had no idea where they had gone they 
were marching off the end of the known world said don blakeslee 
wichita state university anthropology department chairman 
blakeslee and betty romero director of the rice county 
coronadoquivira museum in lyons are coordinating the project for 
the coronado trail association 
theyve been combing historical documents including letters 
coronado wrote the king of spain and accounts by participants in 
hopes of determining which of 30 proposed routes is the right one 
there are plenty of people who have a pet idea where he 
went blakeslee said every little town anywhere near where he 
might have gone would like to be able to claim coronado 
in 1540 coronado and his entourage 300 soldiers and some 
1500 indian guides and camp followers set out from mexico to 
search for the legendary goldrich seven cities of cibola 
for two years together and in separate groups they explored 
arizona new mexico texas oklahoma and kansas though they found 
no gold they helped open the region to colonization 
romero says she wants her museum to become an interpretative 
center for the trail in april the museum will sponsor a symposium 
for scholars to view exhibits of armor and weapons used by the 
conquistadors and debate where coronado and his men traveled 
were going to try to throw out as many wrong ideas as we can 
in a short period of time blakeslee said but we havent yet 
gotten all of the people together who need to be in one room 
arguing with one another and we havent done all of the field 
work which is absolutely critical 
blakeslee said the field work could quickly eliminate some 
routes 
one proposed path the anthropology professor checked out was 
obviously wrong he said he crossed the cimarron river where the 
routes proponent said coronado crossed but the canyon the 
explorers described was not there 
coronados letters and the other texts offer clues but few 
definite directions 
these records really werent written to tell anybody how to 
get to the places mentioned blakeslee said 
ambiguities in the texts also have frustrated scholars 
blakeslee said 
in one passage the explorers wrote about eating nuts growing in 
the area they were traveling through but did not say what kind of 
nuts one person assumed the nuts were pecans and based a proposed 
route on that assumption blakeslee said 
you cant base your arguments on assumptions he said you 
have to base them on something in the texts then you can make an 
assumption if there is any way to test it 
romero and blakeslee are hoping new information on indian trails 
may play a big role in assembling the jigsaw puzzle that previously 
had critical pieces missing 
coronado had indian guides who apparently knew the country 
because they were able to lead the hundreds of soldiers to good 
water every night of their travels in august in southwestern 
kansas blakeslee said 
by using historical accounts old maps letters and other 
documents blakeslee has established locations for many indian 
trails in the great plains 
just about everything important in the early history of the 
plains happened along established trails he said 
most of the eight trails already in the system including the 
santa fe trail in kansas were established along precisely known 
routes blakeslee said some trails are still marked by wagon ruts 
or other physical features 
but delineating coronados trail hasnt been so simple the 
national park service was unprepared for the task when ordered by 
congress to study the feasibility of establishing a coronado trail 
blakeslee said 
it takes a lot more effort more manpower and entirely 
different techniques he said

some florida jews suffer a stereotype as cranky 
yankees who head south for the low taxes and cheap condos and 
have little regard for their cultural heritage 
professor henry green head of judaic studies at the university 
of miami hopes to change all that 
when you think of florida and jews you basically think of 
condo commandos searching for earlybird specials green said 
but the jews have been here since the beginning contributing 
since the beginning 
the history of florida jews has been compiled into an exhibit 
entitled mosaic jewish life in florida it is on display at 
miamis historical museum of southern florida through jan 6 then 
it will travel the state for two years and head to israel in 1993 
about 90 percent of floridas 750000 jews live in the three 
south florida counties of palm beach broward and dade making it 
the region with the third largest population of jews in the world 
after israel and the new york area 
the exhibit began as a grassroots project for a jewish

people from two dozen jewish communities around the state 
it has become an official project of the christopher columbus 
quincentenary in two years which marks the 500th anniversary of 
the italian explorers arrival in the western hemisphere 
green director of mosaic believes at least five crew members 
on columbus first voyage were conversos jews who converted to 
christianity in an attempt to save their lives during the spanish 
inquisition 
we have survived for so long but you cant perpetuate unless 
you know your own history said beverly kaiman of pensacola 
where the states first sephardic jews settled in 1763 
her relatives first came to pensacola located in the florida 
panhandle from russia at the turn of the century the family 
donated a russian teapot a yahzheit which is a record of 
debts owed by relatives and several photographs to the exhibit 
jean leibert has lived in miami since 1956 she said the exhibit 
showed her ties to the state she didnt know she had 
its given me more of a strong feeling of being a part of 
florida like i have roots here she said 
leibert said she was surprised to learn that levy county was 
named after one of the first jewish families in florida 
moses levy fleeing antisemitism in morocco landed in central 
florida in 1819 and bought 52000 acres of land near gainesville a 
strict zionist he intended to create a new jerusalem

out of the country through turkey weinkle eventually moved to 
moffit fla where he opened a lumber mill 
stephen whitfield a professor of american studies at brandeis 
university in waltham mass said the exhibit was important 
because south florida was the best hope for the future of the 
jewish south 
its the only spot in the south where jewish life will be 
vibrant so the caliber and character of that community is 
crucial he said 
the exhibit also could help improve ethnic relations in south 
florida said joseph mensch a trustee of the historical museum 
miami is a multiethnic society that must learn to get along 
with each other mensch said this adds to the melting pot that 
helps us live together

for people who think weather forecasts 
are worthy of more than idle elevator chatter the national weather 
service had opened a museum dedicated to the long and proud history 
of meteorology curators say 
the national weather service science and history center opened 
last month in suburban washington 
weather is always a fascinating subject because we are 
helpless in nature we are in awe of its turbulent state said 
bill stanley a federal historian who designed the museum 
the museum located in the new offices of the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration occupies only 1100 square feet 
has no staff and is open only on weekdays 
a wall near the entrance displays photographs of cars bobbing 
down a flooded street lightning in a turbulent sky and a funnel 
cloud descending on a field 
a dripping sound comes from simulated rain in the window of a 
model 1891 weather office and a voice drones on with the latest 
data from the national weather radio 
television monitors near the entrance show the weather all over 
the country 
the museum also chronicles names and dates in weather recording 
which dates back at least 200 years in the united states stanley 
said 
originally intended to help farmers weather forecasting became 
popular in 1870 through the army signal corps and the us 
department of agriculture 
thomas jefferson is said to have requested a break while working 
on the declaration of independence on july 3 1776 to take his 
thermometer outside and check the temperature 
since 1940 the weather service has operated under the us 
department of commerce and the oceanic and atmospheric agency 
the museums displays show how the science of meteorology has 
progressed from simple weather vanes barometers rain gauges and 
record books to hightech devices like geostationary operational 
environmental satellite imagers stanley said 
david ruth a meteorologist under contract with the national 
weather service visited the museum recently he said it was good to 
finally see a memorial to his profession 
well he said its certainly a lot nicer than what we had 
before

some diplomats and other observers 
can see the rough outlines of a peaceful solution to the persian 
gulf crisis emerging 
but any facesaving formula that induces iraqi president saddam 
hussein to withdraw from kuwait leaves a longterm question what 
to do about his large and powerful military 
we cant accept being next to a country ready to invade any 
morning said a senior saudi diplomat who like his colleagues 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
a saudi source knowledgeable on military affairs said sunday 
that the release of hostages by saddam may signal a planned 
withdrawal from kuwait and that chances of peace are better than 
those of war 
so far saddam has shown no inclination to pull his 460000 
troops from the kuwait theater and reinstate the kuwaiti ruling 
family two key un demands 
but he has agreed to release foreign hostages which the 
security council has repeatedly called on him to do the first 
group of them flew out on sunday 
the united states is pouring troops into saudi arabia and 
expects to have a force of more than 400000 ready for offensive 
action by jan 15 that is the deadline the united nations security 
council set for an iraqi withdrawal authorizing all necessary 
means to get him out after that 
on the heels of the resolution saddam accepted president bushs 
offer to send secretary of state james a baker iii to baghdad and 
agreed to send iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to come to 
washington 
then on friday the iraqi parliament approved saddams call to 
release all foreign hostages 
washington for its part announced it would withdraw all its 
diplomats from the embassy in kuwait but not officially close the 
mission iraq had ordered all missions in kuwait shut declaring 
the country its 19th province 
both sides then can save face by pointing to diplomatic gains 
while downplaying what they conceded 
you leave something vague and one party presents it as a gain 
on their behalf and the other party can too said a middle 
eastern diplomat 
on sunday britains observer newspaper reported that iraq has 
redrawn its border with kuwait in what could signal plans to 
withdraw as early as next month a newspaper reported sunday 
the report said iraq was laying claim to an area of the rumailah 
oilfield and the islands of warba and bubiyan in the persian gulf 
which it has long coveted 
saudi officials denied the report but one saudi diplomat said 
persian gulf leaders might be willing to pay saddam money to 
assuage him he claims that kuwait stole billions of dollars in oil 
revenues from iraq 
in any event an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait is seen as only 
the first step in stripping saddam of his military capabilities 
if you dont get rid of him now youll have to do it two 
years from now or three years from now or five years from now 
and youll have to pay a much higher price said the saudi 
source 
saddam has threatened to use his chemical arsenal and some 
observers believe he could develop a nuclear bomb during this 
decade with that firepower he could dictate his neighbors 
actions without necessarily moving troops 
but it would be difficult to send us soldiers into action now 
on the basis of a possible future war 
is it worth american lives to prevent a hypothetical 
situation said a western diplomat 
some saudi officials also are reluctant to push for the total 
destruction of iraq worried about who might emerge in saddams 
place 
the immediate need diplomats believe is to concentrate on 
winning a withdrawal from kuwait without an allout fight 
if to want to get saddam out of kuwait without a war make it 
clear to him that you will kill him on jan 15 said the saudi 
source 
then the alliance could look for a formula to contain saddam 
that might involve iraqi guarantees of no more aggression some 
economic and military sanctions on baghdad and a multinational 
presence in the region for up to four years while saudi arabia 
builds a military 
its like cutting the leaves of a plant that climbed over the 
wall said the middle eastern diplomat the root is still 
there you have to cut the tree or at least the branches

former president jimmy carter says us 
officials should be flexible and not simply issue ultimatums in 
upcoming talks with iraqi leaders so as to avoid the likelihood of 
war in the persian gulf 
if the exchanges are to be genuine it will be necessary not 
to lay down patently unacceptable preconditions or unalterable 
demands carter said in an essay to be published in the dec 17 
issue of newsweek magazine 
meetings just to deliver an ultimatum warns carter will 
not be productive they will likely lead to war 
we must have some flexibility he said 
us and iraqi officials are currently considering when to 
schedule facetoface talks between president bush and iraqi 
foreign minister tariq aziz in washington and secretary of state 
james a baker iii and president saddam hussein in baghdad 
the united nations has authorized the use of force against 
saddam if his troops arent out of kuwait by jan 15 
carter warned that some of the goals of both sides have to be 
considered in any talks to obtain a peaceful resolution of the 
persian gulf crisis 
saddam must withdraw iraqi forces from kuwait and return the 
kuwaiti regime to power as stipulated by the united nations said 
carter 
he noted that saddam already has agreed to one of the three 
basic un demands the release of foreign hostages but the 
united states and its allies must also make some concessions 
carter said 
there may need to be what carter called an independent 
settlement of differences possibly an international conference 
to address the israelipalestinian question 
carter acknowledges however that strong political reasons 
make it impractical for such a conference to be linked with the 
kuwait issue israel opposes such a conference 
additionally carter suggested the allies might forgive iraqs 
debt and offer a longterm land lease that would give the nation 
access to the persian gulf 
on the question of war carter said president bush will be 
forced to convince the american public that kuwaits liberation 
will justify the casualties of a major war 
and he said most of the major arab allies would not join in an 
attack on iraq making the military action an american 
operation

religious chants echoed off the walls of kgb 
headquarters sunday as thousands of human rights demonstrators 
prayed and wept at a nearby monument to the victims of soviet 
repression 
led by three russian orthodox priests bearing icons marchers 
carried wreaths placards denouncing president mikhail s 
gorbachev and photographs of human rights activist andrei 
sakharov who died one year ago this week 
the 3000 to 4000 protesters came from near red square where 
they had rallied to mark mondays international human rights day 
they shouted repeatedly for gorbachev to resign and heard radical 
politicians deride him as his majesty mikhail the bloody 
the fivehour demonstration reached a more somber climax across 
the street from the lubyanka the secret police headquarters and 
former prison where a monument has been erected to the millions of 
innocents who perished under communist rule 
more than 10 million people are believed to have been shot or 
died from hunger cold or hard labor in labor camps under previous 
soviet leaders 
lord take the souls of these innocent victims under your 
protection a small choir chanted as a priest clad in gold robes 
and carrying incense walked around the monument 
their requiem amplified through megaphones reverberated off 
the pink gray and yellow granite facade of the kgb building 
the 8footlong and 3footwide rock monument hewn from the 
solovetsky islands in the white sea the site of a famous labor 
camp was dedicated in october 
lighted candles flickered in the hands of participants who 
stood stoically around the flowerstrewn stone in 23degree 
temperatures as dusk fell organizers released dozens of doves 
which circled dzerzhinsky square 
the rev alexei vlasov whose branch of the russian orthodox 
church was formerly forced to operate underground told the crowd 
of josef stalins repression of the clergy 
he said the kgb harassed believers and the church ceased to 
become a sacred place or refuge for people where they could confess 
their sins 
as he spoke tears rolled down the cheeks of lydia terekhov wax 
from her candle dripped onto a sign held against her chest the 
sign with a photograph of her 19yearold son igor said the 
young kgb border guard was killed in armenia in april 
mrs terekhov is one of dozens of mothers who have become 
fixtures at several antigovernment demonstrations in moscow this 
year protesting the deaths of their sons and demanding the 
government explain how they died 
other marchers mourned the loss of sakharov the nobel peace 
prize laureate and father of the soviet unions human rights 
movement who died on dec 14 1989 
nobody can possibly replace sakharov said lyudmilla 
kocheyeva when asked whether any current political figure can take 
up the late nuclear physicists role as the nations conscience 
he has very many supporters and many who follow his path 
she said waiting to place her candle on the memorial stone 
organizers of the rally sent a delegation of lawmakers to place 
a wreath on sakharovs grave in a southwest moscow cemetery 
during earlier speeches to the demonstrators near red square 
radicals accused gorbachev of trampling on the human rights of the 
countrys many diverse ethnic groups 
nikolai ivanov who was fired as government prosecutor while 
trying to expose corruption said gorbachev was a czar who came 
to power by being chosen by 1520 senile politburo members 
today we can call him his majesty mikhail the bloody 
because for decades the country hasnt experienced such 
bloodshed ivanov said 
who bore responsibility for pogroms in sumgait fergana baku 
osh and many other places ivanov asked referring to the sites 
of recent ethnic violence its gorbachev himself who is leading 
the country to civil war 
therefore if we want to defend human rights we must unite 
around such democratic forces as the russian parliament headed by 
boris nikolayevich yeltsin he said referring to the president 
of russia the largest of the 15 soviet republics

some of the americans freed by the baghdad 
government on sunday had spent four months hiding from iraqi 
occupation authorities in kuwait living by their wits and by the 
kindness of kuwaiti friends 
thomas kreuzman 38 of holiday fla who was a contractor in 
kuwait before the aug 2 invasion said he spent 23 days hiding in 
an airconditioning duct with his dog they lived on dry spaghetti 
and sneaked out at night for water he said 
about 80 americans flew from kuwait to baghdad sunday later 
joining a group of about 175 americans who left the iraqi capital 
for frankfurt germany 
they spoke to reporters at the baghdad airport 
lyonell hoffman 51 of melbourne fla who was also contractor 
in kuwait said he hid out in an apartment complex 
i am stunned and still cannot believe it it seems like a 
miracle he said of his release 
the departing americans described the systematic looting of the 
small wealthy emirate that had been their home 
it was not an invasion it was robbery said kreuzman all 
that wasnt tied down was taken away 
the iraqi occupation authorities threatened kuwaitis who 
sheltered foreigners with death but the americans said kuwaitis 
repeatedly risked their lives to help them 
i feel guilty for leaving my kuwaiti friends behind said 
kreuzman 
several of the americans said they had heard gunfire in the city 
every night since the invasion including their last night there 
saturday 
some of the hostages who were detained in iraq celebrated their 
last night in the country with a party at the downtown almansour 
melia which was known as the hostage hotel because many were 
held there 
one american who was held in iraq said now that he was free he 
wanted to go to kuwait not to the united states dr clem j hall 
of newark nj said he wanted to go back to the emirate for his 
yugoslav girlfriend 
thousands of westerners were stranded by iraqs invasion of 
kuwait and iraqi president saddam hussein refused to let them 
leave 
in recent months saddam had freed hostages on a piecemeal 
basis sometimes in large groups and sometimes after a foreign 
dignitary made an appeal on their behalf 
on thursday he announced he was ready to free all foreigners 
and the decree was approved by the iraqi parliament on friday

opposition candidates accused the 
government of cheating sunday as the two communistruled republics 
held elections that could decide whether yugoslavia remains united 
in serbia the countrys largest republic the top nationalist 
party said it might not accept the election results the serbian 
renewal movement accused the ruling socialists of permitting 
illegal voting and most ethnic albanians boycotted the election 
the socialists formerly communists faced an array of 
centerright nationalists in serbias first free elections in more 
than 50 years 
in montenegro the smallest republic 10 parties were 
challenging the ruling marxists 
polling stations in both republics opened at 7 am 1 am est 
and were closing 12 hours later results were expected late monday 
at the earliest 
the outcome in serbia could shape the entire countrys future 
the nationalist serbian renewal movement led by novelist vuk 
draskovic wants to establish freemarket capitalism and return the 
republic to its oncedominant role in the yugoslav federation 
the western states of croatia and slovenia where centerright 
parties replaced communists in spring elections want more 
independence from the federation and have threatened to secede 
serbias current socialist leader slobodan milosevic has 
refused to discuss the possibility of secession with slovenia and 
croatia 
draskovic his opponent says he wants to keep the country whole 
but is prepared to negotiate with other republics that favor 
separation or confederation 
observers say the tensions between serbia and the slovenes and 
croats could increase if milosevic is kept in power while a 
draskovic presidency could reduce tensions 
in montenegro the ruling marxists also oppose independence for 
slovenia and croatia 
the conflict is only one of many based on ethnic and political 
differences among yugoslavias six constituent states and two 
provinces the cia has predicted that the country could break up 
within 18 months and has warned of the possibility of civil war 
serbian voters were also choosing a 250member parliament from 
among 44 vying parties 
draskovic accused the government of allowing some voters to cast 
their ballots on saturday he said his party protested the alleged 
illegality to the electoral commission but the complaint was 
rejected

chatichai choonhavan was renamed prime 
minister sunday one day after he resigned amid increasing 
criticism of his government 
the maneuver saturday was apparently an attempt to revamp his 
cabinet 
king bhumibol adulyadej signed a royal decree reinstating 
chatichai as prime minister channel 7 television reported 
chatichai 68 a former army general told reporters sunday that 
he had not been pressured by the military into resigning he said 
he has been in close contact with military leaders 
all the cabinet ministers automatically lost their positions 
with the prime ministers resignation saturday chatichai now will 
choose a new cabinet but it remained to be seen whether he would 
drop members who had been sharply criticized by the powerful 
military 
there have been increasing attacks on chatichais squabbling 
sevenparty coalition for corruption ineptitude and internal 
squabbling 
the former cabinet is continuing to serve in a caretaker 
capacity 
chatichai who came to power in august 1988 is the first prime 
minister since 1976 to be an elected member of the parliament 
the generally popular prime minister has proved a skillful 
political player especially in neutralizing the military which 
for decades intervened by force but the military has also insisted 
on being a watchdog over state and society 
criticism mounted in recent months with critics pointing to 
allegedly massive corruption within the highest levels of his 
government and parties within the coalition some have also 
complained of the governments poor record of helping the countrys 
poor while allowing entrepreneurs free rein 
recently pamphlets have circulated that accuse chatichai and his 
family of corrupt dealings and nepotism 
army chief gen suchinda kapayoon armed forces chief gen 
sunthorn kongsompong and others have made tough statements and 
threats in recent months 
their focus has been on corruption and certain cabinet members 
including interior minister banharn silapaarcha communications 
minister montri pongpanich and deputy minister of education chalerm 
yumbamrung 
anharn is secretarygeneral of chatichais own chart thai 
party and montri holds the same post with the social action party 
the outspoken chalerm had angered the military by criticizing 
its seizure in june of a governmentowned radio truck that officers 
said was eavesdropping on military communications 
there was a major cabinet shuffle on aug 27 but military 
commanders demanded even more changes and threatened unspecified 
intervention if chalerm and others were not ousted 
another change came nov 22 but proved minor chalerm who had 
been a minister in the prime ministers office was merely demoted 
to the education ministry slot

president lech walesa looking at the 
peasants son seeing the hut in the potato field where he was 
born recalling polands last four decades of communism the title 
would not seem possible 
but then this is lech walesa 
love him or fear him he epitomizes the contradictory forces 
that led poland out of communism and forever changed the eastwest 
equation 
he has uncanny political intuition and personal courage and he 
wants to take the future of his country into his hands he is 
devoutly catholic and disinterested in the trappings of power or 
prestige 
with workers and rulers alike he woos with his greatest asset 
he is always himself 
that includes saying one thing in the morning and another at 
night and then warning others not to pay too much attention to 
either walesa he frequently refers to himself in the third 
person 
his charisma edges toward egotism his selfconfidence toward 
the autocratic as fervently as he has fought for democracy he 
believes he must reserve my own voice as the final one 
that voice comes from a mudandmarsh hamlet northwest of warsaw 
where in 1943 as world war ii raged across the polish flatlands 
walesa was born in a tiny threeroom hut the road leading to it is 
unpaved to this day 
walesas father died in 1945 his health ruined by forced labor 
under the german occupiers and his mother married her late 
husbands brother a year later with too little land to survive 
the impoverished clan rented out the boys to work for other farmers 
and sent young lech to learn tractor repair at a local trade 
school 
it was not until 1967 that the 24yearold walesa out of the 
army and depressed by a broken love affair sensed time was 
wasting he left home for gdansk 
working at the lenin shipyard a showpiece of peoples poland 
walesas life was changed in 1970 by christmas food strikes during 
which dozens of laborers were killed by security forces 
already angry about poor working conditions he was chosen to 
lead the shipyard strike committee walesa was dismissed in 1976 
for criticizing the yards communist union and he began organizing 
underground free unions 
in august 1980 he made his famous jump over the shipyard fence 
to lead the strike that gave birth to the east blocs first free 
trade union 
martial law ended solidaritys rocky 15month existence and 
walesa was imprisoned until november 1982 
he received the nobel peace prize the following year but because 
he was afraid to leave the country it was accepted by his wife 
danuta 
walesa vowed that solidarity would survive underground and 
after strikes in 1988 the union reemerged as polands main 
political force 
walesa forced the communist party to the negotiating table and 
finally to the dismay of skeptical allies to give up power he 
picked tadeusz mazowiecki as the east blocs first noncommunist 
government leader and then watche from gdansk as revolution swept 
eastern europe 
last spring walesa started to agitate again this time to 
remove a nagging vestige of the old regime president wojciech 
jaruzelski and speed up reforms to stave off popular unrest 
at first his allies in the government shook their heads but 
soon it was evident that again walesa was onto something they 
began talking about acceleration too 
within months jaruzelski announced an early end to his term 
and the first fully democratic nationwide elections in five decades 
were scheduled to pick a new occupant for belweder palace 
but mazowiecki regarding walesas campaign as a rejection of 
his own cautiousbutdetermined path refused to bow to his 
political sponsor and decided to oppose him for president 
their bitter falling out created a split in solidarity that is 
bound to linger after the election 
walesa seems sorry but ready to move on 
i am playing as a chess player five or six moves ahead he 
said recently

a judges decision to close the 
investigation into the massacre of six jesuit priests could mean 
the masterminds will never be punished a roman catholic archbishop 
said sunday 
there was not just one mastermind there are more monsignor 
arturo rivera damas the archbishop of san salvador told reporters 
after sunday mass 
judge ricardo zamora on friday closed his investigation into the 
nov 16 1989 murders of six jesuit priestprofessors their 
housekeeper and her 15yearold daughter 
he ordered col guillermo benavides three lieutenants and four 
soldiers to stand trial 
judicial sources say closing the investigation makes it highly 
unlikely anyone else will be prosecuted for the crime 
the jesuits roman catholic leaders and members of the us 
congress who have been monitoring the inquiry contend benavides is 
not the only one behind the killings 
rep joe moakley dmass and the rev jose maria tojeira head 
of the jesuits in central america have accused members of the 
salvadoran army command of obstructing the investigation covering 
up evidence and lying to the judge 
tojeira said the united states and the armed forces had 
pressured the judge into closing his inquiry before anyone else was 
implicated benavides he said acted at the behest of a powerful 
group within the armed forces 
rivera damas said everyone involved in the massacre should be 
brought to justice he said moving the case into the trial phase 
is an error because there are others who should also be 
punished 
i think the jesuits are right to disagree with the judges 
decision i disagree too rivera damas said 
benavides is the highestranking salvadoran officer ever charged 
with a human rights crime 
no officer has been convicted of a human rights crime throughout 
a decade of civil war in which human rights groups estimate that 
30000 people died at the hands of death squads linked to the 
military and the rightwing 
the jesuit case has put us policy in el salvador in the 
spotlight 
critics say washington which has poured billions of dollars 
into el salvador since the war with leftist rebels began in 1980 
has tolerated massive human rights abuses by the armed forces 
the far right including many army officers despised the 
jesuits for their support for a negotiated end to the war and their 
belief that it stemmed from repression poverty and injustice 
rather than an international communist conspiracy 
two of the lieutenants accused in the case have testified that 
benavides ordered the slayings and the elimination of any 
witnesses benavides denies the charges

the 3dayold caretaker government is 
considering sending ousted president hussain muhammad ershad into 
exile politicians said sunday 
the major opposition parties demanded on friday one day after 
ershad left office that the expresident be tried on charges of 
corruption and misusing power during his eightyear rule 
but shahabuddin ahmed the caretaker president has approached 
the party blocs for their reaction to the idea of letting ershad 
leave the country a political source said on condition of 
anonymity 
the public response from the main political alliances was 
negative 
ershad a former general who seized power in 1982 resigned 
following a sevenweek campaign for his ouster led by university 
students and the opposition political parties 
he remained secluded in his wellguarded home sunday several 
other members of his government were in hiding fearing they might 
be attacked if they appear in public 
sheik hasina head of the awami league reacted cautiously to 
the suggestion of sending the president into exile the man or 
institution which has done the wrong thing must get punishment but 
it must be by law she told foreign reporters 
when pressed about ershads case however she added if he 
leaves the country at least our people will be relieved 
khaleda zia leader of the bangladesh nationlist party insisted 
on prosecuting the deposed president 
there should be charges against him the interim government 
should start the procedings it should arrest him said mrs 
zia in an interview 
i dont think the people will allow it she said when asked 
if ershad should be exiled 
shahabuddin the former chief justice of the supreme court has 
said his job as acting president is to maintain law and order and 
set up elections he said he would take no major policy decisions 
moudud ahmed ershads vice president accused the political 
groups of pushing for immediate trials to block ershads jatiya 
party from contesting the elections 
i dont mind facing charges if there is a fair trial on 
specific charges but not if it is to intimidate he told a 
reporter at his luxurious dhaka home i believe this is being 
done for political purposes 
moudud also said corruption trials should be extended to civil 
servants and to members of previous administrations that governed 
bangladesh after it won independence from pakistan in 1971

as a mystery reader i found myself reading mysteries by women 
written with strong women characters she said to a certain 
extent i like to write those books i like to read 
if there is any pattern to female detective fiction it is that 
while male hardboiled detectives are loners even single female 
detectives have some kind of family around them although its 
not a traditional husband and kids barnes said 
its more the way that women live that friendships are 
important she said carlotta is not concerned with justice as 
maintaining relationships shes concerned about whats going to 
happen after the books end

the narrow defeat of a referendum designed to help 
minorities win city council seats could throw the issue back to a 
federal judge who has vowed to impose either the same plan or a 
similar one officials say 
voters on saturday rejected by just 369 votes a referendum that 
would have created a system to elect 14 council members by 
individual districts and elect the mayor at large 
under the current system instituted in 1975 eight council 
members are elected by voters in individual districts and another 
three including the mayor are elected by voters citywide 
proponents of the plan rejected saturday said they would seek a 
recount because of the slim margin the final vote was 45255 in 
favor of the plan and 45624 against it 
supporters said the proposed voting system would have helped 
ease racial inequities that make it difficult for minorities to get 
elected 
opponents said the system would have resegregated dallas they 
backed a plan voters approved in august 1989 calling for 10 
candidates to be elected by district and four by region and for the 
mayor to be elected by voters citywide that earlier proposal never 
was implemented because a federal judge suggested he would rule it 
unconstitutional 
now that voters have rejected the plan us district judge 
jerry buchmeyer could call a may election to institute the same 
plan or a similar one in which 15 council members would be elected 
by individual district and the mayor would be chosen from among the 
council 
i assume the judge is going to do what he said he would do 
which is call the election dallas mayor annette strauss told the 
dallas morning news 
mrs strauss was quoted sunday as saying the judge had indicated 
he could make the ruling as early as january 
it was unclear what the council would do 
were waiting for buchmeyer to make a ruling said 
councilman jim buerger we have no alternative but to wait for 
the judge this issue has been unresolved for decades 
the referendum was held as part of the settlement of a 1988 
federal lawsuit brought by roy williams and marvin crenshaw who 
failed in their atlarge council bids 
the men both black charged the existing election system made 
it difficult for minorities to win election 
black and hispanic leaders nationwide have long charged that 
atlarge elections dilute minority candidates political power and 
make it difficult for them to win office

secretary of state james a baker iii took the 
soviet foreign minister to his hometown sunday and predicted they 
would make progress on a wide range of issues including the search 
for a treaty to cut longrange nuclear weapons 
while the crisis in the persian gulf demands their attention 
baker and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze hope to 
clear roadblocks to a strategic arms reduction treaty 
i have no doubt that our talks here in houston will be 
productive and that we will continue to tackle some difficult 
issues in a constructive spirit baker said 
he and shevardnadze plan two days of talks on the treaty the 
gulf situation and other ussoviet issues they also intend to 
visit the johnson space center and talk to the columbia astronauts 
aboard the shuttle through a special telephone hookup 
but if the mission is cut short because of poor weather or 
trouble with disposing of liquid waste that colorful interlude may 
have to be scratched 
baker in an arrival statement at ellington air field praised 
the soviets for cooperating with the united states in trying to 
force iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
on no issue has ussoviet cooperation been more necessary 
than on resolving the crisis caused by iraqs brutal aggression 
baker said 
a few hours before baker and shevardnadze arrived on separate 
planes a group of hostages were brought home by former texas gov

they never should have been taken hostage in the first 
place baker said so while we are heartened by their return 
we will not rest until all hostages from all nations are safely 
home 
the treaty to reduce us and soviet longrange nuclear bombers 
missiles and submarines by about 30 percent is nearly finished the

imposed 
when it is finished president bush plans to go to moscow to 
sign the treaty at a summit meeting with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
shevardnadze in a brief statement said in russian it seems

lech walesa the shipyard worker who 
helped lead his country out of communism swept to a landslide 
victory in polands first popular presidential vote sunday 
according to partial returns 
walesa defeated emigre businessman stanislaw tyminski a virtual 
unknown before the campaign by 75 percent to 25 percent according 
to the first official results from 165 of the countrys more than 
22000 polling stations the television said 
full official results were expected late monday but earlier 
exit polls predicted a similar outcome 
there are terribly difficult tasks waiting for us walesa 
said as he sipped a congratulatory glass of champagne before the 
television cameras and supporters in gdansk where his solidarity 
movement began in august 1980 
i hope that we will be building polands future together i 
want to behave firmly i want to firmly correct everything that is 
wrong and make firm accounts for everything that has not been 
accounted for yet 
outside thousands gathered and chanted his name over and over 
they sang sto lat a song that means may you live 100 
years 
tyminski declined to concede defeat immediately saying he did 
not trust the polls he said he would remain active in polish 
politics 
outgoing president wojciech jaruzelski who sent walesa to jail 
under martial law nine years ago sent his congratulations he 
wished the new president fruitful activity for the good of our 
homeland 
turnout was estimated at 53 percent compared with about 60 
percent in the first round last month according to preliminary 
results 
the solidarity leader and 1983 nobel peace prize laureate had 
asked voters to give him a broad mandate to lead the country to a 
market economy and a europeanstyle democracy 
the exit polls showed that he did well among all social groups 
nearly doubling the 40 percent he got in the first round in 
november 
tyminski who performed well in the first round appeared to 
have been damaged by numerous questions raised about him at the end 
of the campaign 
im surprised but i wont make any comments at the moment 
tyminski told reporters after inspecting the returns posted at his 
home voting district in pecice outside warsaw 
walesa had split the solidarity movement when he opposed prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki in the first round of voting nov 25 
but this time he ran with the backing of the powerful roman 
catholic church and virtually all political and social 
organizations 
i voted for walesa how could anyone vote for a clown said 
jan grzesiak 52 a warsaw building superintendent walesa is a 
worker he went through hardship and he is an honest man contrary 
to tyminski 
tyminski a selfproclaimed millionaire beat mazowiecki in the 
first round based on his promise to bring western business knowhow 
to poland and improve the economy in a month 
although he returned to poland in september after 21 years in 
canada and peru there were reports that he had ties with former 
communist and police operatives 
tyminskis political tract sacred dogs was cowritten with 
an excorrespondent for a communist party daily and he 
acknowledged that several ranking campaign aides were party members 
or secretpolice veterans 
also he failed to clearly explain how he would carry out his 
promise to improve the economy and questions were raised about his 
claimed mystical experiences in the amazon jungle 
tyminski 42 who owns computerrelated and communications 
businesses and leads the fringe libertarian party of canada had 
railed against the economic treason of mazowiecki 
he appealed especially to young voters not under the spell of 
the solidarity legend and eager for financial success he also 
found votes among farmers miners and others threatened by the 
governments tightmoney and profitorperish market policies 
the winner could be inaugurated for a fiveyear term as early as 
this weekend if the results are not contested 
the presidents early tasks include nominating a prime minister 
to succeed mazowiecki who has asked to resign and overseeing the 
countrys first fully free parliamentary elections since world war 
ii next year 
walesa said sunday night he is considering seven candidates to 
succeed mazowiecki and expects to decide by wednesday 
for walesa 47 the victory culminated an astonishing personal 
voyage from the child of a dirtpoor peasant family to a shipyard 
electrician dismissed for union organizing from union leader to 
political prisoner to presidential candidate 
walesa has promised to carry out the same basic aims as 
mazowiecki but he says he will change the nations tough economic 
reform program to ease problems of farmers and to try to create 
jobs for the unemployed 
he says he would be faster and more effective than mazowiecki 
because he is able and willing to talk to common people 
i am not afraid to confront the masses when i am right i may 
even confront the whole of poland he said like it or not i 
do not want to please everybody

after four months hiding from iraqi 
soldiers in kuwait joseph lammerding of california said monday he 
would like to join american forces in saudi arabia 
lammerding 35 was the first of 175 americans leaving a 
uschartered iraqi airways jumbo jet after it landed in 
frankfurt it left baghdad on sunday with the first americans to 
depart under an iraqi order to release all foreigners 
now i just want to see mom and dad said lammerding a 
native of sacramento calif i hope to be back in saudi arabia 
next month 
he said he would like to be part of the effort to push iraq out 
of kuwait 
a slight bearded man in jeans who carried only a small canvas 
bag lammerding identified himself as an adviser to the kuwaiti 
military who had lived in the oilrich nation since 1983 
lammerding three other americans and one briton fled at night 
to a villa outside kuwait city after the iraqi invasion aug 2 
they remained there for more than four months 
the group learned they were free to leave saturday night one 
day after the iraqi parliament approved a decree by president 
saddam hussein allowing all foreigners to go home 
recalling his experience lammerding described iraqi brutality 
accompanied by a low level of military professionalism 
sometimes they iraqis would shoot one member of a family 
sometimes the entire family they raped and plundered literally 
he said of the treatment of kuwaitis 
he said kuwaitis did their best to hamper iraqi efforts to keep 
control of the country by tearing down street signs and house 
nubers making it difficult for the iraqis to get around 
nighttime visits by kuwaitis with food and medical supplies 
helped his group survive when their own food supplies ran out 
several weeks after the invasion 
the small band of foreigners refused to answer the door when 
iraqi soldiers who had moved into a neighboring villa rang the 
bell we played kind of dumb said lammerding 
lammerding gave high marks to us policy in the persian gulf 
many of us feel the us government has done a good job 
especially utilizing the united nations lammerding said he said 
washington should keep up the pressure on saddam

soldiers bombed and captured the main 
base of colombias biggest rebel group sunday as former guerrillas 
won a national election for a constitutional assembly at least 11 
people were reported killed in the attack 
about 400 soldiers backed by israeli kfir fighter planes and 
us blackhawk helicopter gunships invaded the main base camp of 
the revolutionary armed forces of colombia known as the farc an 
army report said 
the attack came the same day colombians voted in a national 
election to choose 70 members of an assembly to rewrite the 
countrys 104yearold constitution 
in a humiliating setback to colombias two traditional political 
parties the former m19 rebels led by antonio navarro had an 
insurmountable lead late sunday with 49 percent of the total votereported 
the national elections office said m19 had 486599 votes or 32 
percent of the total 
the national salvation party a conservative party splinter 
group led by former presidentital candidate alvaro gomez had 
324997 votes or 21 percent 
the rest of the votes were spread thinly among 800 candidates 
the elections office said that only about 25 percent of voters 
went to the polls it was the lowest voter turnout for a national 
election in more than a quarter of a century 
it was also the first time in colombias history that neither 
the liberal party nor the conservative party had dominated voting 
the results are likely to underscore the possibility of social 
upheaval unless the government urgently attends to the needs of the 
poor 
the m19 laid down its arms nine months ago in exchange for 
government pardons and the right to form a political party 
the attack on the farc headquarters called casa verde left 
seven soldiers and four air force officers dead the army 
communique said the air force men were killed when their 
helicopter crashed the army said 
the report did not say how many guerrillas if any were killed 
at the base about 160 miles south of bogota a report by the rcn 
radio network said as many as 40 insurgents died 
officials said sunday that six rebels and four soldiers were 
killed in earlier clashes between the army and other guerrilla 
groups 
sundays vote will result in a 70member constitutional assembly 
empowered to make major structural reform to government changes 
expected include revamping colombias battered court system adding 
safeguards to curb congressional corruption and establishing new 
civil rights in this country wracked by drug violence 
few people doubt that colombias powerful cocaine cartels are 
donating money to assembly candidates but it is difficult to 
measure the traffickers involvement candidates rarely mention the 
governments 15monthold war on drug traffickers 
we are at the doors of the most exceptional opportunity to 
transform colombia said president cesar gaviria in a nationally 
televised speech saturday evening 
we colombians can finally devise a way to bring our country 
the peace which has been so elusive he said 
many voters blame old party bosses for corruption and failing to 
curb violence that has killed tens of thousands of people in the 
past decade 
navarros got my vote not because i like him but because i 
cant stand the others said patricia sanchez a bogota educator 
politicians have dredged up the m19s violent past to discredit 
the group among voters particularly its 1985 takeover of the 
palace of justice in bogota that action turned into a battle with 
the army that left about 100 people dead including 11 supreme 
court justices 
the m19 became a legitimate party nine months ago after laying 
down its weapons in exchange for a government pardon 
some colombians fear the army which has been fighting guerrilla 
insurgencies for three decades would stage a coup if the m19 took 
over the constitutional assembly 
navarro a 41yearold engineer has tried to convince voters 
that his party has never been marxist and will help guarantee civil 
rights 
leftist guerrillas disrupted balloting in several isolated 
incidents officials said sunday 
army and police reinforcements were stepped up in major cities 
sunday and the government provided free transportation to polling 
stations 
colombias cocaine bosses were blamed for assassinating three 
candidates before presidential elections in may including m19 
leader carlos pizarro navarro replaced him

angeles kissed wyatt and connally on the cheek and said god 
bless you i cant thank you enough were so grateful 
nelson who was held at a munitions plant south of baghdad 
said god bless america theres nothing like it these people 
are marvelous they have done things our government cant do and 
wont do 
as the exhostages got off the plane former hostage jim vines 
voice rang out above the other he was seeing his infant son for 
the first time 
oh my god he shouted as he rushed to throw his arms around 
his wife donna and son evan the baby was born sept 6 barely 
one month after iraq invaded kuwait 
connally and wyatt said they met with saddam for 45 minutes in 
the presidential palace 
we made an impassioned plea to him saying to him in effect 
that we thought he should release all the hostages connally 
said mr wyatt said that if indeed theres an armed conflict 
the presence of a few hundred hostages would not in any way deter 
the armed conflict 
they also told saddam he was being portrayed as a vicious 
brutal man compared to hitler and i said the release of the 
hostages before the christmas season would clearly show a concern 
and a compassion connally said 
the men also donated 15 tons of medical supplies valued at 
500000 to fellowship on reconciliation an iraqi humanitarian 
group in amman 
saddam replied as they parted you will not go home with an 
empty plane according to connally 
that statement touched off a bureaucratic nightmare in which 
hostages scrambled to get exit visas and be transported hundreds of 
miles from the strategic locations at which they were held to 
baghdad 
connally described how one british subject peter mccleod of 
london arrived on the plane in his shirtsleeves with two 
pillowcases containing his entire possessions 
some hostages who hoped to ride home with connally and wyatt 
whos done business with the iraqis for 19 years were forced to 
remain because of delays in getting exit visas none of the 
hostages are connected with coastal 
the plane left baghdad saturday morning stopped in shannon 
ireland to refuel and drop off mccleod and flew on to houston 
wyatt and connally secured the hostages release before saddams 
proposal thursday to release all hostages 
later sunday in austin connally said he opposed a us military 
attack on iraq 
if we become involved in a shooting war in that distant land 
it will be tragic indeed he said in a speech to more than 12000 
people at a graduation ceremony at the university of texas the 
encounter will be fierce with staggering casualties on both 
sides 
the united states could defeat iraq in battle but lose the 
war he said 
meanwhile the first americans to be freed under the decree 
arrived sunday in frankfurt germany on a uschartered flight 
from baghdad about 175 americans were among some 325 people aboard 
the jumbo jet

the first americans freed under saddam 
husseins order releasing all foreigners arrived in germany early 
monday other former hostages prepared to leave iraq after more 
than four months under guard or in hiding 
some of the 175 americans on the uschartered iraqi airways 
jet that landed in frankfurt were expected to go to a us air 
force hospital in nearby wiesbaden most planned to return to the 
united states on monday 
lorin hubbard 66 a boeing co executive held as a human 
shield at an ammunition plant 35 miles west of baghdad iraq 
said he had waited for bombs to fall 
we were hoping theyd blow the place up we had no idea 
when wed get out he said nobody knew where we were as far 
as i know 
now i just want to see mom and dad said joseph lammerding 
35 a native of sacramento calif 
he said he would like to return to the region to help the 
usled military effort against iraq i hope to be back in saudi 
arabia next month said lammerding who added that he had worked 
as a kuwaiti military adviser 
this is the first time i have had shoes on in over three 
months said construction worker randal warren 49 of 
charleston mo who said he hid in the top floor of a kuwaiti 
apartment building and went barefoot to keep quiet 
the flight also carried more than 90 britons about 30 
canadians and former hostages from ireland greece austria 
argentina denmark italy the netherlands and switzerland said 
airport officials in baghdad 
in all 324 people were on the airplane and more than 250 of 
them had been stranded since the aug 2 iraqi invasion of the tiny 
oilrich emirate of kuwait the rest included family members and 
others 
the iraqi parliament on friday approved a decree by iraqi 
president saddam to free all foreigners in kuwait and iraq 
robert vinton 58 of santa fe nm said he was picked up in 
baghdad on aug 18 and held at a refinery south of the city 
it was like a gulag he said after arriving in frankfurt 
asked what he wanted most vinton replied i think a 
hamburger 
us officials said they planned to charter another flight in 
three or four days to evacuate the rest of the estimated 750 
americans in iraq and kuwait 
other flights being arranged included british charters to leave 
monday and tuesday to london and a flight to moscow airport 
sources also said hundreds of vietnamese workers were at the 
airport awaiting departure 
the first foreigners to leave baghdad under the decree issued by 
saddam were a group of about 200 hostages mostly italians who 
arrived in rome on sunday aboard an italianchartered jet 
western diplomats complained that iraqi authorities had thrown 
up some lastminute bureaucratic roadblocks to the exodus 
for example foreigners in cities other than baghdad were told 
they must obtain exit visas from those cities those who had been 
under work contracts were told that iraqi law requires them to 
present a letter releasing them from their obligations 
iraq has refused us requests to waive visa requirements for 
freed hostages and the processing of the visas alone had been 
expected to delay some departures for days 
however diplomats said iraqi officials were working quickly 
sunday processing an estimated 80 exit visas an hour 
twentyone former american hostages landed in houston early 
sunday after flying out of baghdad a day earlier aboard a jet 
chartered by former treasury secretary john connally who was in 
iraq on a private hostagefreeing mission 
their release was arranged prior to iraqs decree freeing all 
foreigners 
god bless america said one of the arriving americans bill 
nelson of los angeles 
three us embassy employees in iraq also were on the flight 
along with relatives of the former hostages 
about 8000 westerners had been detained since iraqs invasion 
of kuwait including about 600 who were held at strategic sites in 
an effort to deter an attack 
voice of america broadcasts advised americans in kuwait 
including those who have been in hiding since iraqs invasion that 
they could leave on sundays charter flights 
but diplomats said it was not immediately clear if americans who 
had taken refuge in the us embassy in kuwait would be allowed to 
leave iraqi troops have sealed off the embassy since it refused to 
close in august 
us officials said friday they would evacuate the embassy after 
all americans were out of kuwait 
meanwhile a london newspaper reported that iraq has redrawn its 
border with kuwait in what could signal plans to withdraw as early 
as next month the observer said iraq was laying claim to an area 
of the rumailah oilfield and the islands of warba and bubiyan in 
the gulf 
the report said iraq has constructed a new international line by 
building a barbedwire fence around the southern tip of the 
oilfield which extends into northern kuwait 
saudi arabian officials denied the report 
iraq has repeatedly linked a resolution of the gulf crisis 
including any withdrawal from kuwait to the palestinian issue 
but on saturday night the un security council facing the 
threat of a us veto postponed until monday discussion of a 
resolution calling for an eventual international peace conference 
on the middle east 
in another development jordans king hussein proposed that a 
compromise settlement of the gulf crisis could be reached through a 
conference of arabs in a speech he welcomed president bushs 
offer to talk with iraq and criticized arab states for refusing to 
do so 
the bush administration has said the talks are not meant to be 
negotiations but are merely aimed at underscoring the demand that 
iraq go along with un resolutions on kuwait

time is running out for saving the 
dwindling hardwood forests of sarawak 
all virgin timber will be gone in 11 years at the present rate 
of cutting according to the latest report on logging in the rich 
malaysian state in northern borneo 
no cry of alarm from outraged environmentalists for a change 
this warning comes from inside the industry experts of the 
international tropical timber organization blame excessive cutting 
pollution and recklessness by inept loggers 
the organization represents 19 timber producing nations and 25 
consumer countries formed in 1986 and based in yokohama japan it 
is often caught in the middle it has been rebuked by 
conservationists for favoring consumers and by producers for taking 
a narrow technical approach to the problem of deforestation 
the 207page report has been circulating privately since may it 
has drawn criticism from malaysian officials and international 
environmental groups for not delving into the distress caused by 
loggers to nomadic tribes and other jungle dwellers in a 
disclaimer the study said those who drafted it were neither 
qualified nor empowered to judge on such matters 
nearly half of sarawaks 16 million people are from some 20 
upland native ethnic groups commonly known as dyaks they 
traditionally lived with informal systems of land tenure often 
without legal titles 
the state remains the ultimate land owner and officials have the 
power to change ownership and convert land from communal to 
individual control some jungle communities are unaware of their 
changed status until new leaseholders arrive to start felling 
trees 
chief minister abdul taib mahmud says logging has upgraded the 
skills of natives and helped them prosper however an earlier itto 
report in 1988 said that timber concessionaires and others who 
control the industry glean most of the wealth from sarawaks 
forests 
the current annual cutting rate of about 13 million cubic meters 
should be reduced by about 4 million cubic meters the latest 
report suggests to prevent erosion and protect stream beds from 
silting up logging would have to stop on many steep slopes 
it faults the state for not having enough forest managers and 
says the present system of issuing logging concessions tends to 
reward companies that damage the forest in their haste to get the 
wood out 
malaysia supplied twothirds of the worlds tropical hardwood 
logs last year and half of them came from sarawak where forests 
cover almost 70 percent of the land area in a state that is half 
the size of france 
most of the logs are shipped to japan where many end up as 
disposable chopsticks or are converted into plywood and used only 
once as forms for pouring concrete 
western environmentalists accuse the government of allowing the 
indiscriminate cutting of rain forests they charge that polluted 
rivers devastated wildlife and displaced tribes are left when the 
chain saws and bulldozers finish 
what remains behind is virtually wasteland said a report by 
sahabat alam the malaysian branch of friends of the earth 
describing the deforestation as catastrophic the european 
parliament in strasbourg recently urged the european community to 
impose with immediate effect a moratorium on imports of tropical 
hardwood from sarawak 
timber is the backbone of sarawaks commercial economy fetching 
about 1 billion a year in export earnings the industry generates 
almost half the state governments revenue and employs more than 
50000 
all forest area is under state government control about 114 
million acres is designated permanent forest estate which can 
be selectively logged but not converted to other uses an 
additional 632583 acres is set aside in national parks or wildlife 
sanctuaries 
a study completed late last year by the worldwide fund for 
nature formerly world wildlife fund said sarawak could retain 
large tracts of rain forest only if it acted promptly to enforce 
conservation measures 
among other things it said loggers seemed to lack procedures to 
ensure environmental protection for their concessions and the 
social welfare of the people who dwell in them 
for more than a year prime minister mahathir mohamad has hit 
back at foreign critics as illinformed or selfserving 
the thinning of the ozone layer is blamed on logging of 
tropical forests he said the fact that the burning of fossil 
fuels and release of cfc chloroflurocarbon into the atmosphere 
occur largely in the rich countries are significantly ignored

the nomads of sarawak hate bright light 
bruno manser shares their antipathy after six years under the 
jungle canopy squinting and squirming as the tv lights flash for 
another interview 
manser went native in 1984 leaving the safe streets and 
clockwork predictability of his native switzerland to share the 
perils of life with the penan of sarawak one of the worlds last 
nomadic tribes 
he downplayed the rain forests dangers and isolation in an 
interview in the austrian capital before jetting to paris and a 
meeting with danielle mitterrand wife of the french president on 
how to save the sarawak jungle from loggers 
a taxi driver in new york or los angeles lives more 
dangerously than i did he said dismissing the bounty set on his 
head by several logging companies and about the only thing i 
missed in the forest was getting together with swiss friends and 
singing in threepart harmony 
his flight from civilization initially took him to lonely swiss 
alpine pastures there he tended cattle and made cheese but not 
for long 
even the smallest mountain village has a road the wiry 
45year old said and that road serves as the path for things 
that we dont need things that we are forced to consume 
manser never thought hed leave the rain forest now six months 
into reacquainting himself with civilization and near the end of 
his exhausting crusade it seems clear hed rather be back in the 
jungle 
the hunter who could melt into the trees has become the hunted 
as he tours the worlds capitals to gather support for a moratorium 
on sarawak logging theres no place to hide from reporters 
questions 
im not here of my own choosing he said im here because 
my penan friends asked me to be here 
environmental organizations say about 70 percent of the forest 
in malaysias sarawak state has been destroyed since largescale 
logging began in the early 1970s 
environmental pressure has slowed denuding of the rain forest in 
brazil and elsewhere but largescale logging in sarawak on the 
northwest coast of borneo continues unabated the organizations 
say about 60 percent of the hardwood harvested goes to japan the 
rest to other industrial countries 
approximately 360 square miles of sarawak rain forest disappear 
each year the environmental groups estimate 
they say a particularly diverse environment is being lost 
harboring 2000 species of flowering plants 475 different birds 
and 200 different mammals 
but rain forest still covers millions of square miles of the 
earths surface thus say logging advocates the sarawak harvest 
contributes relatively little to environmentally harmful global 
warming thought to be accelerating because of the disappearing 
jungle 
the malaysian government denies that the loggers cause permanent 
damage asserting that trees are cut down selectively 
but environmentalists and the penan say that because of the 
jungles tangle one large tree falling takes most of the 
surrounding vegetation with it bulldozers further mutilate the 
forest as they drag logs away leaving the denuded soil to erode 
approximately 300 penan still roam the woods holdouts against 
malaysian government pressure 
after a series of jungle confrontations in the early 1980s with 
government forces more than 5000 other penan have exchanged their 
nomadic ways for what the malaysian government says is a better 
life of farming 
manser disagreed describing the settlements as tinroofed 
refugee camps seared by the hated tropical sun and with inadequate 
and dirty drinking water 
hunters and gatherers are illsuited for a life as rice farmers 
and belong in the jungle he argued 
you really experience a sense of joy and you see hear or 
smell that someone has come back from the hunt with prey he 
said everybody is happy everyone talks and tells stories its 
a lttle bit like paradise

a federal judge said he will confirm 
wheelingpittsburgh steel corps reorganization plan this week 
ending five and a half years of litigation and allowing the 
steelmaker to stay in business 
us bankruptcy judge warren bentz in overruled the final 
objections of the at a hearing saturday wheelingpittsburgh which 
employs about 7100 people has six major plants in western 
pennsylvania ohio and west virginia 
a lawqyer for the company m bruce mccullough called the 
approval long overdue 
denys cronin representing the reorganized companys principal 
investor said the plan provides a fair result for creditors and 
shareholders alike now its time to get back to concentrating on 
the companys business 
the proposed reorganization plan calls for cash distribution of 
about 600 million to creditors plan proponents say the 
reorganization is viable and will allow the company to compete 
the plan creates two corporations a holding company chaired by 
new york investor ronald lebow who bought up 86 percent of the 
companys secured debt and an operating arm 
wheelingpittsburgh corporation will be the holding company and 
wheelingpittsburgh steel corp will be the operating subsidiary 
james t gibbons the companys reorganization planning 
director estimates that the company as an ongoing enterprise is 
worth at least 11 billion to 12 billion 
gibbons said operating income over the next five years is 
expected to drop somewhat because of the impact of oil price 
increases in spite of that he said the company plans an 
aggressive 454 million capital improvement program 
the confirmation came after bentz overruled final complaints 
from the us farmers home administration that came after 
proponents of the confirmation plan agreed to set aside enough cash 
and securities in a separate account to satisfy the maximum amount 
of their claim plus interest should the maximum be awarded later 
fmha and equibank together hold about 442 million in loans to 
wheelingpittsburgh they also claim interest on that sum 
earlier bentz overruled environmental protection agency 
objections to the confirmation saying any penalties to be imposed 
later for environmental violations could be worked out in the 
normal course of the companys business

in the auto industry 10day sales reports have 
long been considered a necessary evil 
theyve even been likened to foultasting medicine or income tax 
forms but one of the big three automakers chrysler corp has 
decided the necessary evils are perhaps unnecessary 
beginning jan 15 chrysler will no longer will issue sales 
results three times a month in moving to put out sales figures 
only once a month chrysler breaks a nearly 50yearold tradition 
of reporting sales of north americanmade vehicles every 10 days 
the old american motors corp which chrysler bought in 1987 
broke the tradition once before but returned to 10day statements 
after numerous leaks came out and corporate officials frequently 
made low estimates for sales that would be easy to make 
after chrysler announced it would abandon 10day sales reports 
general motors corp said it was studying the move and ford motor 
co said it would continue with the current system for now at 
least 
no 3 chrysler said producing the reports was too costly and 
they serve no major purpose that isnt covered by a monthly 
report 
but theres much more to it than that 
since production of japanese nameplate cars is expanding in the 
united states yeartoyear sales results of those cars look good 
with increases sometimes topping 100 percent meantime the big 
three are wrestling with excess factory capacity and sales are 
sliding 
so chrysler with retiring chrysler motors chairman bennett 
bidwell heading the charge has been moaning about unfair 
comparisons gm and ford while sympathetic to chryslers 
arguments havent complained nearly as much 
there have been some arguments that if the japanese companies 
reported sales of all cars and trucks no matter where they are 
made every 10 days chrysler quickly would jump back on the 
reporting bandwagon 
but there appears to be no chance the japanese companies will do 
that they say sales results can be skewed simply by a delay in a 
couple of ships coming over from japan 
in january folks who collect the 10day numbers including 
other automakers wall street analysts and reporters will have to 
become statistical dentists trying to yank out numbers as 
accurately as possible 
industry observers are now trying to come up with computer 
models that can spit out chrysler numbers based on productionpast 
sales rates market shares incentives and perhaps even weather 
all of those can affect sales during a given 10day period 
those in favor of scrapping the 10day reports say they are of 
questionable value to begin with 
they say incentives move in and out of the marketplace like 
pistons cash rebates can inflate sales in one period and make it 
look considerably better than the same period a year ago no matter 
what the underlying demand may be 
in addition 10 days of selling provides too little information 
to draw meaningful conclusions or detect trends 
others say the figures can show a lot for instance theres no 
restriction on using the numbers only for yeartoyear comparisons 
if a company slaps a big incentive on one of its slowselling 
vehicles and sales shrink in a 10day period the company may start 
wondering whether it has a turkey on its hands 
the bottom line for a lot of numbercrunchers is this sure the 
10day numbers may not be the most significant in the world but 
theyre data that give a picture of an important industry

business week magazine cbs news and the wall 
street journal close news bureaus and lay off workers 
employees at the new york post take a big pay cut to keep the 
paper running the sports daily the national quits publishing a 
sunday paper murdoch magazines closes the highly touted mens life 
magazine after a single issue 
the weak economic environment in which media companies have 
operated the past year is no longer just a worry for the business 
office it has produced a marked decline in advertising led to 
tighter travel and expense budgets and forced layoffs at some 
companies 
the downturn seen as the worst in 20 years is expected to be 
the main topic of discussion this week at a conference for industry 
analysts sponsored by the investment firm painewebber inc in new 
york 
most observers see few signs that conditions will improve soon 
especially if the economy worsens 
analyst john morton said newspapers are in a recession and 
things continue to get worse broadcast industry analyst 
jessica reif said she doesnt foresee a turnaround in broadcasting 
for another year at least 
magazine consultant martin s walker said it appears 1991 will 
be the second consecutive year of flat to declining ad growth for 
magazines which also face higher postal costs 
there is no evidence yet of an upturn painewebber analyst 
j kendrick noble said about the media business in general it 
wont improve until 1992 
capital citiesabc inc whose abc television network is making 
a strong bid to overtake nbc in the primetime audience ratings 
said in october that ad spending at the network and its seven tv 
stations was significantly weaker than a year ago 
cbs inc chief executive laurence a tisch said in midnovember 
that the company will have a rare loss in the fourth quarter and 
lower earnings in 1991 the cbs television network third in the 
primetime ratings is expected to have an operating loss in 1991 
tisch said 
advertisers spending in newspapers was up a slim 07 percent 
for the first nine months of the year according to recent 
estimates from the newspaper advertising bureau 
morton who works for the brokerage lynch jones amp ryan in 
washington dc said newspapers can expect to see advertising 
demand get even softer he said helpwanted advertising for 
instance will contract as unemployment rises and real estate ads 
will slump further as the economy sags 
magazine ad pages were off 37 percent for the first 10 months 
of the year in the 170 consumer magazines surveyed by the magazine 
publishers of america publishers face the prospect of postal rate 
increases of 20 percent or more next year 
no immediate recovery is in sight walker said 
the media companies are trying to cope by imposing hiring 
freezes curbing expenses and in some cases laying off workers 
some of them are boosting ad rates or cover prices and are trying 
to be more creative about attracting ads 
cbs has cut 40 to 50 employees from its 1000person news 
division in the past few months closed bureaus in chicago and 
denver and slashed payments to its affiliated stations by 20 
percent or 30 million next year 
the new york post persuaded its editorial staff earlier this 
year to accept 20 million in pay cuts which meant many staffers 
are working fourday weeks the newspapers managers told the staff 
the alternative was to close 
the national the 10monthold sports newspaper that now 
publishes editions in 10 major markets axed its sunday edition 
earlier this month and dismissed 18 news employees including its 
circulation manager 
the wall street journal recently announced it was closing its 
philadelphia bureau and would dismiss some of the 10 employees who 
worked there the first such layoffs in many years the journal is 
cutting back space devoted to news reducing the number of planned 
special reports and cutting down on transfers 
business week magazine recently said it would close its denver 
and sao paulo brazil bureaus and eliminated 10 jobs from its 
staff of about 250 
others have gone much further murdoch magazines closed mens 
life magazine in october after one issue saying it was too costly 
in the current economic environment to build sufficient advertising 
and readership 
media companies are trying to raise revenue in a variety of 
ways 
the journal has raised its cover price by 50 percent to 75 
cents lifted subscription prices by 78 percent and hiked national 
ad rates by 6 percent usa today has boosted its national ad rates 
by 55 percent while rates at the new york times are going up 65 
percent 
national ad rates also were raised at the three newsweeklies

mca inc has seen how bright the 
future can be with its new owner because the entertainment 
conglomerate knows how gloomy the past was without it 
for more than 20 years an mca subsidiary labored to perfect the 
technology behind the laser disc mcas discovision associates 
developed 1400 patents at the heart of the compact disc and video 
disc players 
but for lack of a hardware partner like pending new owner 
matsushita electrical industrial co mca and partner international 
business machines corp were forced last year to sell discovision 
for 200 million 
buyer pioneer electronics corp of japan took the discovision 
technology and ran with it that probably wouldnt have happened if 
the matsushita deal had taken place earlier mca president sidney 
sheinberg said in an interview 
either we would have been convinced that the laservision 
system wasnt going to be the system of the future or else we 
would have had in the family the kind of technology the kind of 
skills and the kind of support that we would have needed to launch 
it he said 
mca is banking that its new 66 billion marriage to matsushita 
will yield a company poised to exploit any future new technologies 
i once told somebody that the first step in planning for the 
future is to be sure that youre part of it sheinberg said 
and i think by this transaction we have tried to ensure that we 
are part of the future 
mca chairman lew wasserman agreed i obviously think that 
there are many synergisms a greater expansion of opportunities 
or i wouldnt have recommended the deal to the board he said 
if recent blockbuster hollywood mergers are used as a benchmark 
however mca is not guaranteed to become an overnight world power 
time warner inc strapped with close to 11 billion in debt 
has not become as dominant as some believed it would and there are 
rumblings the companys music division might be for sale to the 
right buyer 
australias news corp which owns 20th century fox is 
suffocating under 81 billion in debt and may sell assets sony 
corps 34 billion buyout of columbia pictures entertainment in 
1989 hasnt rattled hollywoods rafters either with columbia and 
sister studio tristar pictures lagging 
pathe communications corp has sold off so many movie rights to 
finance its 13 billion purchase of mgmua communications co that 
theres scarcely any money left for growth 
the distinct benefit of the mca deal is that it leaves the 
company with no shortage of cash 
this one has got one enormous advantage which is rare and 
that is that there is no financing involved sheinberg said 
this isnt like a deal with giancarlo parretti the head of 
cashpoor pathe 
where will the mcamatsushita money go 
i think the global potentials are awesome wasserman said 
you certainly have a population of something like 800 million 
people in europe now that the curtains have come down with very 
little filmed entertainment 
he said the music business at the moment growing modestly in 
the united states but its exploding overseas 
wasserman and sheinberg both under new fiveyear contracts to 
matsushita declined to say what companies they might pursue to 
broaden the conglomerates reach but it seems certain the company 
will pursue highdefinition television 
it could very well be that the product will be distributed in 
a different fashion and instead of film prints arriving it could 
very well be that it comes from a big satellite and its projected 
on highdefinition television sheinberg said 
asked if he would be interested in companies such as warner 
music or polygram a division of dutch giant phillips nv 
wasserman replied very definitely 
there are some bothered by the trend to merge giant companies 
with capacities to make the hardware equipment and software such as 
movies music and television shows 
arizonas govideo filed an antitrust lawsuit to block the 
merger of mca and matsushita claiming they are conspiring to 
sabotage sales of its videocassette recorders 
if they have control of the software they can control what 
kind of format its released on govideo lawyer joseph alioto 
said if you dont own their hardware you wont be able to see 
the pictures

opec is facing the unexpected as it 
meets this week plunging crude prices brought on by prospects of 
an oil glut and reduced military tensions in the persian gulf 
region 
but analysts doubt the ministers of the 13nation organization 
of petroleum exporting countries will be anxious at a strategy 
session opening wednesday to do much to try to hold down production 
and lift prices higher 
everybody is going to wait for the crisis to finish before 
taking any concrete measures said peter bogin associate 
director for oil markets at cambridge energy research associates in 
paris 
theyre going to be worried that prices are falling but no 
one is going to take action about it he said 
in late august the ministers gave the goahead for higher 
production to make up for the loss of about 4 million barrels of 
crude pulled off the market after iraq invaded neighboring kuwait 
both are opec members 
in the four months since the occupation speculation about the 
outbreak of war in the oilrich gulf region sent prices as high as 
41 a barrel the cartels benchmark of 21 a barrel was surpassed 
with a basket of crudes monitored by the group averaging 3704 a 
barrel last month 
but in recent days with the easing of tensions prices have 
tumbled to levels not seen since august at weeks end prices for 
north sea brent blend the most widely traded international crude 
were trading in the range of 25 to 26 a barrel the benchmark 
american brand slipped below 28 a barrel 
with surging opec production storage tanks have been filled to 
the top but demand has weakened partly because of 
warmerthanexpected weather in the united states and other 
oilimporting nations 
even so it was unlikely that opec ministers would be quick to 
reimpose their quota system and call a halt to overproduction 
during their winter conference at cartel headquarters in vienna a 
monitoring panel will begin work on tuesday 
they couldnt put the quota system back in said pierre 
terzian editor of the parisbased newsletter petrostrategies it 
would mean the crisis has ended 
said bogin were expecting very little but we think there 
could be a lot of backroom conversation about getting 
production levels down 
terzian predicted though that the ministers would signal their 
intent to nail production caps back on the producers once the 
crisis has ended they must make the market understand that there 
will be a halt to the glut if there is a settlement he said 
indonesias oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita acknowledged 
the difficulty the cartel would face in slowing down pumping 
it is not easy to persuade all opec members to cut output 
after spending a lot to pump oil as much as they could to meet an 
emergency he said in jakarta last week 
with the suspension of their quota system the oilproducing 
nations turned up the taps led by heavyweight saudi arabia the 
opec nations supplied nearly 23 million barrels of oil a day to the 
market in november according to the international energy agency 
saudi arabia the worlds largest crude exporter pumped an 
estimated 79 million barrels a day last month according to the 
agency an arm of the organization for economic cooperation and 
development 
private analysts predicted the saudis will go even higher in 
december possibly reaching as much as 85 million barrels a day 
before the crisis the kingdoms production quota was 54 million 
barrels a day giving the cartel an overall supply ceiling of 225 
million barrels daily 
in addition to saudi arabia analysts said venezuela the united 
arab emirates iran nigeria and libya have lifted output to help 
make up for the loss of iraqi and kuwaiti crude 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela
