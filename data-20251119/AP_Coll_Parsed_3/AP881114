an undertaker who grappled with an airline 
stewardess when she told him to stop smoking was ordered monday to 
spend 15 days in prison by a judge who said he wants to protect the 
flying public 
james j tabacca 34 who was convicted of interfering with a 
flight crew said he never meant to upset anyone and pleaded for 
probation 
but us district judge wallace tashima said he wanted tabaccas 
sentence to have a deterrent effect on other passengers who might 
take the law into their own hands 
he then imposed a suspended sentence of 18 months with the 
provision that tabacca spend 15 days behind bars his attorney was 
given three weeks to appeal and tabacca was ordered to report to a 
federal prison dec 4 
tabacca also was placed on two years probation fined 500 and 
ordered to perform 100 hours of community service in restitution to 
the public 
the confrontation dec 30 on a twa flight from boston to los 
angeles occurred when flight attendant pamela martinez tried to stop 
tabacca from lighting a cigarette in the nosmoking section of the 
jetliner 
tabaccas ticket was for the smoking section but most seats on 
the flight were converted to nonsmoking because of government 
regulations requiring airlines to provide nosmoking seats for all 
passengers who arrive on time and want them 
tabacca twisted ms martinez arm and shoved her across the aisle 
into the bulkhead shouting obscenities at her when she tried to 
stop him from smoking said assistant us attorney robin scroggie 
a jury convicted him sept 6 of interfering with a flight crew 
but acquitted him of assault 
he had faced a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a 
250000 fine 
for the safety of the flying public it is necessary that all 
passengers abide by the law of flying conduct and not take the law 
into their own hands tashima said 
because of the nature of the offense and the public nature of 
the offense some custody time is required he told tabacca 
the defendant an undertaker from north hollywood pleaded for 
leniency 
sincerely i am sorry that such an incident has ever taken 
place he said i cant believe this has happened to me i never 
meant any interruption or to upset anyone my family and i have 
suffered greatly from this 
deputy public defender kerry bensinger suggested that prison time 
was an excessive penalty 
mr tabacca is now a convicted felon he said his name has 
been published in the papers we believe that is all the 
punishment mr tabacca needs to receive

west german chancellor helmut kohl honored simon 
wiesenthal at the nazi hunters 80th birthday party monday and 
warned against minimizing nazi crimes through comparison with other 
killings 
we germans have to live with the terrible fact that under the 
national socialist nazi tyranny untold suffering was inflicted on 
the jews in particular kohl said 
he called the crimes a genocide without any example 
kohl said that there were attempts to compare nazi crimes with 
the suffering of other people persecuted for political convictions 
or religious faith 
yet anyone who uses this line of argument overlooks or denies 
that the hatred for the jews was deeper the mere fact that someone 
was of jewish descent constituted a capital crime kohl said 
our century is not only marked by economic social scientific 
and technologial change that was scarcely conceivable beforehand it 
will also enter history as an era in which war and genocide brought 
forth new unimaginable atrocities kohl said 
there is a collective guilt there is a common 
responsibility for ensuring that history does not repeat itself 
he said 
wiesenthal thanked kohl for his friendship and appreciation of 
my work 
your presence here tonight is proof of your willingness to 
honor all those who did not live to see the day of liberation from 
the nazi rule wiesenthal said 
you definitely do not belong to that group that simply wants to 
put history behind them on the contrary you have always spoken 
about the responsibility for everything that was committed in the 
name of the germans he said

the black bird that became a mans obsession 
in one of the greatest movie crime dramas can now perch on top of 
any latterday sam spades desk 
there it is the gold and jewelencrusted maltese falcon 
bestowed on charles v by the crusaders in tribute for the kings 
bestowal of the island of malta the bird captured by pirates and 
taken to paris where it was found in an obscure antiques shop its 
riches hidden by black paint the bird that became the passion of 
kaspar gutman and bound together sam spade joel cairo brigid 
oshaugnessy and wilmer cook in a drama of greed and obsession 
except that this maltese falcon actually comes to your doorstep 
from mercerville nj where sculptor clifton j sheely makes 45 
reproductions of the object from the 1941 humphrey bogart movie 
the maltese falcon 
i was sitting at home one night watching the movie and i 
thought my god wouldnt this be great for people to have he 
said 
it has this mystique about it 
sheely 31 of mercerville who teaches at the johnson technical 
school of sculpture spent 2 weeks sculpting a clay prototype he 
modeled the 10inchhigh bird from movie stills measuring the 
dimensions by comparing its image to the hand of bogart who holds 
it in a picture 
sheely made a rubber mold of the bird into which he pours a type 
of gypsum cement then comes a coating with black lacquer when it 
is shipped the bird is accompanied by a history drawn from the 
movie and is wrapped in newspaper and twine just as it arrives in 
the film 
sheely who has his own decorative sculpting business said he 
has sold about 100 birds in the past month since an advertisement 
appeared in a film buffs magazine 
he also offers a 250 bronze version 
who buys the black bird diehard fans of bogie and the movie 
equally divided between men and women sheely said 
one customer told sheely that he used to watch the movie together 
with his father and knows all the dialogue the customers father 
died several months ago 
he just wanted to buy it as a remembrance sheely said 
in the dashiell hammett novel and john hustondirected film 
private eye spade played by bogart is drawn into the feverish 
attempts by gutman actor sydney greenstreet to acquire the 
falcon 
when gutmans search ends and he finally has the bird in hand he 
exclaims by gad sir now after 17 years 
but it turns out to be as fake as sheelys 
its not just any old black bird said louise duus a rutgers 
university associate dean and professor of american studies 
specializing in popular culture 
people are drawn to sheelys bird out of a sense of nostalgia for 
an age a model an ideal she said 
but could there be a deeper reason 
the movie is about fraud and greed and all those things we 
say were against ms duus said 
perhaps people are attracted to sheelys falcon as a way of 
laughing at yourself if youre greedy she said but in the end 
maybe the birds appeal cant be pinned down 
its like the pet rock how do you explain these things she 
said

dan quayle is likely to be a man on the 
outside in george bushs white house following a vice presidential 
candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity experts 
say 
encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevy 
of professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies 
quayle enters a bush administration in which he has few intimates or 
allies 
relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe gop areas 
quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional 
ceremonial role going to political gatherings and state funerals 
rather than the advisory role that walter mondale and even bush had 
some scholars feel 
dan quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about a 
decade or more one thing that political scientists have been 
talking about is just how much the vice presidency has grown 
with quayle its just going to retreat to the old days of politics 
and funerals said ryan barilleaux a professor of political 
science at miami university in oxford ohio who studies the 
american presidency 
bush rarely mentioned his 41yearold running mate during the 
campaign when asked bush employed the stock lines that quayle 
would make an outstanding vice president and had been tempered 
by steel as he weathered the early furor over his military 
service academic record and personal life 
the presidentelect told reporters quayle would have access to 
the same papers information and intelligence that is available to 
the president but he would go no further in describing what 
assignments he would give quayle 
quayle says bush has talked to him about heading a space council 
and that he assumes hell have a role in the administrations 
antidrug efforts i will be a very close adviser to the 
president quayle said 
but thats not the way everyone sees it 
both bush and mondale came to their vice presidential campaigns 
with substantial reputations and were able to place key staffers in 
important positions in the respective presidential campaigns 
barilleaux notes 
dan quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to the 
bush campaign he doesnt have his own big reputation on capitol 
hill dan quayle has no friends in a bush white house except 
george bush barilleaux says 
theyre going to give him a lot of window dressing a space 
council drug task force but hes going to be a man on the outside 
not a man whos going to be consulted in a crisis except on a 
pro forma basis 
but eddie mahe jr a gop consultant who worked with the bush 
campaign says bush is likely to give quayle a more active role in 
the administration than he had in the campaign 
vindication demands that both of them will want to prove how 
right the decision was mahe says 
democrats portrayed quayle during the campaign as a lightweight 
a man with little or no legislative accomplishments untested and 
unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency even some 
members of quayles own party were dismayed at bushs choice 
quayle didnt help his case by making a number of celebrated 
gaffes during the campaign perhaps the worst being his garbled 
explanation of the holocaust and his declaration i didnt live in 
this century 
norman ornstein of the american enterprise institute says 
quayle while not the worlds leading intellectual is not a 
complete dummy he was simply thrust into a situation for which he 
was unprepared ornstein says 
i think hes immature hes not stupid ornstein says 
but quayle comes to the white house with a very damaging 
stereotype thats developed about him thats widely believed in the 
political community and thats believed by a large segment of the 
electorate ornstein says 
thats going to give him a good deal to overcome its going to 
give him an enormous impetus to prove himself thats going to be 
difficult given the office 
both barilleaux and stephen hess of the brookings institution see 
parallels in quayles vice presidency and those of richard nixon and 
spiro agnew the choice of nixon was viewed as a move by dwight 
eisenhower to appease the partys right wing and agnew was seen as 
a political nonentity 
the natural response is to use him quayle sparingly as nixon 
did with agnew in 1968 hess says however quayle has four 
years to prove himself and i think youre going to see stories in 
two years about how much hes learned how much hes acted 
responsibly how far hes come from the campaign of 1988 
quayle admits the campaign was a learning process after the 
controversies subsided quayle declared his independence from his 
bush handlers saying he would be his own man he became more 
accessible to the media but continued to adhere to the schedule 
handed down from washington and to deliver the partys scripted 
message soon he dropped off the front pages 
and although he occasionally spoke out in frustration at having 
little control over his schedule and at ceasing to make national 
news he played the role of loyal no 2 and even trumpeted his new 
anonymity 
we have arrived as being a traditional vice presidential 
nominee because we are either on the back pages or either not on the 
pages at all thats what were supposed to be he told reporters 
that willingness to be a team player could serve him well in a 
bush white house mahe feels since bush wants a private adviser 
whose experience and opinion he respected who has never had 
another agenda 
dan quayle owes his political life to one man and one man 
alone mahe says youre never going to see dan quayle telling 
tales out of school

world shipping leaders have given the goahead for 
the introduction of new automatic communications that will mean the 
end of the morse code for ships at sea 
the global maritime distress and safety system transmits and 
receives automatically so morse will no longer be a requirement for 
ships shipowners are expected to phase out radio operators when the 
new equipment is installed in ships starting in 1993 
some parts of the new technology which includes satellite 
communications are already in use on british ships and from 1999 
they will be compulsory on ships worldwide 
the decision was taken friday during a twoweek london conference 
of the international maritime organization a united nations agency 
for the safety of shipping and preventing ships polluting the seas 
the 66 countries represented accounted for about 97 percent of 
the worlds ships said spokesman roger kohn 
a statement afterward called the decision one of the biggest 
advances in maritime communications since the introduction of 
radio 
the new system allows the crew to send a distress signal by 
pushing a button which should prevent ships disappearing without a 
trace when messages cannot be sent in time 
ships will also carry a radio beacon which will give the ships 
position and must be able to float free if the ship sinks suddenly 
kohn said morse has great romantic connotations with the 
gallant radio operator sending off distress calls as the ship sinks 
but we are bringing in something that will be much better and which 
should save even more lives 
the morse code invented by american samuel morse and first used 
in 1844 has been the foundation of ships distress and safety 
messages since the turn of the century it is a series of long and 
short electronic dots and dashes representing letters of the 
alphabet 
morse code was used to inform an incredulous world that the 
supposedly unsinkable oceanliner titanic was sinking in the north 
atlantic in 1912 the titanic sank swiftly and 1500 people perished

former attorney general john n mitchell was 
laid to rest at arlington national cemetery after a service attended 
by former president richard nixon and many members of his 
administration 
mitchell who won the silver star for gallantry in the world war 
ii navy was buried with full military honors on saturday three 
days after he suffered a heart attack on a washington street and 
died 
a neighboring grave holds the remains of gregory pappy 
boyington a medal of honor winner whose life mitchell is credited 
with saving and nearby are the graves of heavyweight boxing 
champion joe louis actor lee marvin and maxwell d taylor a 
fourstar general 
nixon escorted mitchells longtime companion mary gore dean 
down the aisle at st albans church but did not take part in the 
service the pallbearers included mitchells five grandsons by two 
children from his first marriage 
among the mourners was robert mardian one of mitchells 
codefendants in the watergate coverup trial in which mitchell was 
convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice he became the first 
attorney general to go to prison serving 19 months of a 2to8 
year sentence 
hr haldeman and john d ehrlichman nixons top lieutenants in 
the white house did not attend the funeral nixon was one of 18 
unindicted coconspirators in the watergate scandal 
there was only one reference to the scandal that brought the 
nixon administration down 
what he went through was the most unfair cruel treatment of a 
public figure in the history of this cynical city said former 
nixon aide richard a moore in the eulogy 
it is said that you judge a man by the friends he makes and the 
friends he keeps said moore he made friends in every phase of 
his life in law in government in politics in washington and in 
new york john was not one who attracted fairweather friends

schools museums librarians prominent 
politicians and even a television quiz show are teaming up this week 
to draw attention to the need to know where we and others are 
a variety of programs are planned for geography awareness 
week in the united states a land of people who came from other 
places 
without geographically literate citizens america cannot 
compete in global markets or take the lead in meeting international 
political economic environmental social and military 
challenges said gilbert m grosvenor president of the national 
geographic society 
yet americans ignorance is illustrated by a recent gallup survey 
which found that 18 to 24yearold americans know less about world 
geography than residents of other nations do 
less than half could find central america on a map 
only one in three could locate vietnam 
just onequarter could find the persian gulf 
and when asked to locate new york state on a map respondents 
picked 37 different places across the nation 
continued ignorance of geography other cultures and foreign 
languages places the united states at a disadvantage in matters of 
business politics and the environment says sen bill bradley 
dnj 
how to solve the problem 
the national geographic society the association of american 
geographers educators librarians and others are giving it a try 
perhaps with the potential to reach the most people quickly is 
the quiz show jeopardy which will include special geography 
categories during the week 
national geographic society head grosvenor and us education 
secretary lauro f cavazos will teach a geography class in dallas 
texas several state governors will serve as honorary teachers 
during the week 
in many cities weathercasters will include a bit of extra 
geography in their broadcasts during the week as well as lecturing 
in local schools 
grosvenor also announced that his society will donate a copy of 
its new historical atlas of the united states to every school in the 
nation with a ninth grade or higher 
the census bureau which spends lots of time worrying about where 
people are will send workers to a dozen or more schools in the 
washington area to make classroom presentations on maps and 
locations 
the geography of environmental hazards will be the focus of 
lectures at western washington university in bellingham the 
university of maryland in college park villanova university in 
villanova pa vassar college in poughkeepsie ny and others 
at george mason university in virginia the geography of the 
spread of the disease aids will be reported by geographer william b 
wood of the state department 
tshirts celebrating the week will be on sale from the geography 
club at the university of nebraskaomaha and by students at 
appalachian state university in boone nc 
at montana state university in bozeman a bake sale of 
geographic delights is planned while a high school in louisville 
ky has created cookie cutters in the shape of states and will hold 
a decorating contest to add appropriate topographic features

nearly a year and a half after ptl filed 
for bankrupty reorganization a judge is expected to decide this 
week who gets whats left of the religious empire 
us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds may choose from four bids 
for the theme park and other property near fort mill about 70 miles 
north of columbia 
two bids considered serious are from canadians stephen mernick 
and peter thomas two other bids came from groups known as lexalt 
university and holy celebration 
lawyers for the bidders creditors ptl contributors and people 
still involved in the ministry and concerned about its future are 
planning to pack the courtroom for the hearing wednesday 
ive been calling it a potential zoo ptl lawyer r bradford 
leggett said late last week 
ptl trustee mc red benton predicted the hearing will 
continue at least until thursday but he expects a buyer will be 
chosen 
its a matter of finances benton said it has to be sold 
ptl filed for protection from its creditors in june 1987 three 
months after founder jim bakker admitted having a sexual encounter 
with church secretary jessica hahn and stepped aside 
the bakkers tried to buy the assets but their bid fell through 
they are now trying to raise money for a new tv ministry 
earlier this month reynolds ordered the bakkers and a former top 
aide to pay 77 million to ptl who filed a lawsuit against them 
the judge determined the bakkers and the aide were overpayed during 
their last four years with the ministry 
last summer the television ministry was separated in a nonprofit 
organization known as heritage ministries the remaining forprofit 
organization including the theme park hotel and shopping mall at 
heritage usa has been under the courts guidance pending the sale 
the future of heritage ministries and of the heritage village 
church based at heritage usa depends largely on which buyer is 
chosen 
thomas of samoth capital corp in vancouver british columbia 
has submitted a 113 million bid he has said he would keep the 
theme parks family orientation and would consider allowing the 
ministry and church to lease facilities and stay at heritage usa 
mernick a toronto businessman who has offered 115 million has 
not said whether he would allow the ministry and church to stay 
benton recommended in october that mernick be allowed to buy the 
assets 
the 116 million bid from lexalt university was made by the rev 
edward j brown of atlanta who has said no university actually 
exists he has said he would return bakker to heritage usa 
the fourth bid was for 120 million by a christian business 
association known as holy celebration its trustees are herbert t 
nelson a lawyer from greenbelt md and sandi kalez of seattle 
benton said he has yet to see proof that the lexalt or holy 
celebration groups can back their offers he called the mernick and 
thomas bids the only viable offers so far 
terry steen chief financial officer for heritage ministries 
said the 135 people who work for the television ministry and church 
and the 250 workers remaining at the forprofit operations at 
heritage usa are anxiously awaiting a decision on a buyer 
but he added weve gone through so many deadlines in the last 
18 to 20 months that were kind of immune to it

voter turnout fell in all but two states in 
this years presidential election from four years ago and voters in 
12 states cast more ballots in statewide races for senator and 
governor than in the race for president a research group says 
overall 913 million americans half of those eligible to vote 
cast ballots in the presidential race turnout declined in 48 
states and the district of columbia from the 1984 election said the 
committee for the study of the american electorate 
the turnout was the lowest since 1924 when an estimated 489 
percent of eligible americans voted the nonpartisan research group 
said 
except for a slight increase in 1984 national turnout has 
declined steadily since 1960 when 628 percent of eligible voters 
cast ballots according to the committees study this years 
turnout was down from 927 million or 531 percent of eligible 
voters who cast ballots in 1984 
continuation of the trend will pose a serious threat to the 
political health of the american nation curtis gans director of 
the committee said sunday 
turnout dropped from 1984 by more than 1 percentage point in 46 
states and the district of columbia and by 09 percent in colorado 
and 05 percent in nebraska it rose in two states nevada by 19 
percentage points and new hampshire by 07 percentage points 
some political analysts blame the declining turnout on 
registration procedures that present barriers to voting but gans 
said the study found registration was not the problem 
in north dakota which does not require voters to register 
turnout has declined 174 percentage points since 1960 compared 
with a national decline of 128 percentage points during the same 
period according to the study 
in wisconsin and minnesota both of which established election 
day registration in 1976 turnout has dropped below what it was in 
1972 before the sameday registration began 
also while nevada colorado arizona and the district of 
columbia had significant increases in registration this year only 
nevada of the three had a higher turnout than in 1984 the committee 
said 
the problem isnt registration he said while easing of 
registration procedures might help some the problem is the conduct 
of our campaigns the decline of political parties the rise of 
political consultants and the abuse of television advertising 
gans also said the partisan turnout figures show the republican 
revolution is running out of steam and that what slim hopes they 
have had for a realignment in their favor will depend very strongly 
on the success of the bush presidency 
republican turnout fell five percentage points nationally 
dropping in every state and the district of columbia from the 1984 
election he said democratic turnout however was up 09 
percentage points from the previous election gaining in 38 states 
and dropping in 12 and the district of columbia he said 
gans said the committees estimate of a 50 percent turnout of 
eligible voters this year is based on incomplete tallies in some 
places but he believes the final number will be within twotenths 
of a percentage point of his estimate 
turnout was lowest in the district of columbia where 366 
percent of the eligible voters cast ballots followed by south 
carolina with 382 percent georgia 383 percent hawaii 426 
percent and alaska 428 percent 
the highest turnout was in minnesota where 653 percent voted 
for president followed by wisconsin 613 percent south dakota 
611 percent montana 610 percent and maine 610 percent 
turnout of registered voters also has been steadily declining 
except for an increase in 1976 this year an estimated 705 percent 
of registered voters cast ballots in the presidential election 
the study also said that in 12 states more people voted in 
statewide races for senate and governor than in the presidential 
race this year those states were maine minnesota mississippi 
montana nebraska nevada north carolina north dakota utah 
vermont washington and wyoming 
turnout rates for other states were 
north dakota 609 percent utah 588 iowa 584 vermont 
582 idaho 572 connecticut 571 massachusetts 567 nebraska 
552 missouri 546 ohio 545 colorado 542 new hampshire

concluding 7 years as the reagan 
administrations point man on civil rights william bradford 
reynolds is leaving government the same way he came in as a target 
of civil rights groups and a champion of conservatives 
reynolds is resigning effective dec 9 from the job of assistant 
attorney general in charge of the justice departments civil rights 
division he served longer in the post than anyone else 
one can only hope its the end of an era said william taylor 
of the leadership conference on civil rights who is an adjunct 
professor at georgetown university law school and a former director 
of the us commission on civil rights 
the post of civil rights chief in the justice department 
traditionally has carried with it a certain set of expectations 
until 1981 the head of the division had been someone on whom 
civil rights leaders usually could rely to reflect their views all 
of that changed when reynolds arrived 
the naacp would like the justice department civil rights 
division to be an arm of the naacp said clint bolick a former 
special assistant to reynolds and now director of the landmark 
center for civil rights a conservative litigating organization 
when he believes a civil rights violation has occurred theres 
never been a more tenacious enforcer of the law than brad reynolds 
but if he believes a violation has been cured or if theres no 
discrimination he will not use the arm of the government to 
effectuate somebody elses agenda and thats what really rankles 
them said bolick 
the reagan administration has sought an end to affirmative action 
hiring and promotion programs and to forced busing to achieve school 
desegregation 
neither goal has been realized by the administration but by 
raising these and other issues over and over again in court briefs 
speeches and interviews reynolds has reopened debate on matters 
which the civil rights movement thought had been settled long ago 
laws prohibiting discrimination in employment voting 
education housing and the funding of federal programs all were the 
targets of mr reynolds attempts to turn back the clock on civil 
rights enforcement said ralph neas executive director of the 
leadership conference on civil rights fortunately a bipartisan 
congress and the supreme court repeatedly rejected the extremism of 
the meesereynolds department of justice 
but conservative patrick mcguigan of the free congress foundation 
said reynolds has an absolute intensity and dedication to 
eradicating real instances of racial bias and yet has had to 
suffer the likes of sen arlen specter questioning his commitment 
to civil rights 
specter rpa cast a key vote against reynolds nomination as 
associate attorney general the no 3 job in the justice department 
the senate judiciary committee rejected his nomination reynolds was 
accused of failing to enforce civil rights laws and of lying to the 
committee accusations he denied 
the theme sounded constantly by reynolds during his tenure at the 
justice department was that affirmative action goals and timetables 
whether instituted in the private sector or among federal 
contractors have all too frequently become rigid hiring quotas 
instead of mandatory busing to achieve school desegregation 
reynolds favored use of magnet school programs to attract students 
from all parts of a school system bolick said that approach has 
worked breathtakingly well but civil rights groups say such 
steps have usually been inadequate to desegregate schools 
however even civil rights lawyers such as morris dees of the 
southern poverty law center give reynolds and his division high 
marks in at least one area 
the reagan justice department has done a better job enforcing 
the civil rights laws against racial violence than any 
administration that ive dealt with in the past 30 years dees a 
critic of the administrations policies on affirmative action and 
other issues said in a speech last march in new york city at a 
regional conference on prejudice and violence 
in an interview friday dees also praised reynolds personally for 
having his division move aggressively against incidents of police 
brutality aimed at minorities

two decades after soviet tanks stopped his 
prague spring reforms alexander dubcek says czechoslovakia is 
in such a sore state that it has no choice but to launch another 
drive for democracy 
wiping away tears the 66yearold dubcek received an honorary 
degree sunday for the efforts that provoked the 1968 sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia and his ouster as the countrys communist 
party leader 
his trip to italy to accept the political science degree from the 
university of bologna was his first outside czechoslovakia in 18 
years during those years he lived in obscurity holding a routine 
administrative job in the forestry department in bratislava 
after receiving his degree and a minute of thunderous applause 
dubcek read excerpts of his 11page acceptance speech in which he 
denounced the 1968 invasion of his country and the hardline 
government the soviets installed 
it is my firm conviction that without the external intervention 
in the situation of our party and our czechoslovak society our 
endeavor would have been crowned with success he said in the 
speech 
saying that now every form of dialogue is virtually barred in 
czechoslovakia dubcek declared in his native slovak that his nation 
cannot help but push for democracy 
just last week communist authorities arrested more than a dozen 
dissidents in prague according to the opposition 
in 1968 there was a process of democratization with words and 
acts before the eyes of all the people dubcek said in his speech 
today it is not possible to do anything else so much more 
because the 20 years that have passed have been marked by 
economic stagnation sterility and incalculable moral losses 
dubcek told italian state television in an interview broadcast 
sunday night that he insists on being politically rehabilitated 
by his party not so much for myself but for the people who 
believed in his reforms 
in interviews earlier this year in czechoslovakia in which he 
broke years of silence dubcek praised soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev for working to reform the soviet economy and liberalize 
politics to some degree 
several italian newspapers on sunday quoted dubcek as commenting 
at an encounter with university officials on saturday that gorbachev 
is our hope that great man 
in the televised discussion dubcek said that gorbachevs reform 
campaign could help nations and people to come closer together 
he added that if gorbachevs policies fail the return will be 
much worse than you can imagine a neostalinism that you could 
not imagine 
one italian newspaper il resto del carlino quoted dubcek as 
saying during the visit i want to return to my country i think i 
will be more useful there than outside 
before leaving czechoslovakia on friday dubcek said he feared 
that communist authorities might not let him return home 
his wife anna was also granted an exit travel visa but 
announced at the last minute that she was staying behind because of 
illness 
posters reading welcome comrade dubcek decorated many of the 
streets in bologna a communist stronghold in italys northcentral 
red belt

us ambassador mike mansfield one of japans best 
foreign friends announced monday he is retiring at age 85 
mansfield whose service to the united states started at 14 when 
he was an underage enlistee in the navy told a packed news 
conference at the american embassy that he and his wife maureen had 
waited until after the us presidential election to make their 
decision 
we decided it was time for me to resign at the will of the 
president and that has been done he said 
mansfield a montana democrat set longevity records in his 16 
years as us senate majority leader and in his 11 years as envoy in 
the crucial tokyo post under presidents jimmy carter and ronald 
reagan 
in january he had coronary bypass surgery causing a renewal of 
speculation that he might retire but he returned to the tokyo 
embassy last spring 
he said he would leave tokyo before the first of the year 
mansfield said he had waited for the resolution of the issue of 
us rice imports to japan as well as the presidential election 
before making his decision 
washington has decided not to make an immediate attempt to force 
the opening of the japanese rice market a position endorsed by 
mansfield who has long touted the usjapan relationship as the 
most important to washington bar none he always says 
the situation is stable now between the two countries he said 
and he and his wife can leave with our heads held high and our 
arms swinging 
but he said he was leaving with regret after an exhilarating 
experience 
to the japanese the appointment of mansfield in 1977 was a happy 
one because of his immense prestige in the us congress and his 
long advocacy of japan and east asia as of great importance to the 
united states 
there were rumors later however of splits in both the us 
state department and the tokyo embassy into pro and antimansfield 
camps with the latter arguing he was too soft on japan and had 
failed to counsel firm stances on the trade issues that caused 
friction in the washingtontokyo relationship 
but mansfield argued in his defense that japanese markets had 
opened in many ways during his tenure and japan has taken on a 
significant portion of the security burden in asia 
he was in favor of negotiating a wideranging trade agreement 
with japan an idea that now is being studied but is not likely to 
materialize for years 
what we ought to do is sit down get away from this nickel and 
diming way of conducting trade negotiations and face up to the 
issue as a whole not the 60billion deficit with japan but the 
170billion deficit with the whole world he told correspondents 
last year

the us dollar fell today against the japanese yen 
while share prices edged up on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar closed at 12300 yen its lowest point since jan 4 
when it finished at 12165 yen off 070 yen from fridays close of 
12370 yen the currency opened at 12255 yen also the lowest since 
jan 4 and ranged from 12250 to 12310 yen 
after dropping sharply the us currency recovered slightly 
toward the end of trading because of dollarbuying by the bank of 
japan and by speculators said yukuo takahashi vice president of 
chemical bank 
he said the dollars fall was due mainly to investors pessimism 
about the united states ability to reduce its trade deficit 
the next president has been elected but many investors doubt 
if he has a potential remedy to reduce the deficit takahashi said 
but he added the dollar was not likely to decline much further 
ahead of the release of us trade figures for september which is 
due wednesday 
takamasa yamasaki of daiwa bank attributed the dollars decline 
to speculative dollarselling 
market players are likely to buy the dollar only when the bank 
of japan intervenes but their dollarselling trend is so strong 
otherwise he said 
the central bank was reported to have bought dollars shortly 
after the market opened the bank does not publicly comment on its 
activities but bank of japan gov satoshi sumita said it was 
willing to take concerted measures with other nations to prevent the 
us currency from falling further 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa also said the foreign exchange 
rate needs to be watched closely and there would be aggressive 
intervention if the rate becomes un stable 
meanwhile the 225issue nikkei stock average which reached a 
record high 2848957 points friday added another 3133 points or 
011 percent to close at 2852090 the index lost 8301 points in 
early trading but gradually recovered 
this proves the tokyo market is stable said a trader with a 
major securities firm speaking anonymously he said trading was 
thin due to uncertainty in the foreign exchange market 
a nomura securities analyst also said many market players were 
in a waitandsee mood ahead of the release of the september trade 
figures 
financial issues attracted participants in thin trading with 
first section volume estimated at 550 million shares

it was the only alternative make that 
altarnative for 16 residents at a public housing project after 
police told the eight livein boyfriends to get married or get 
moving 
so on sunday eight brides dressed in pink gowns donated by a 
local dressmaker and eight grooms wearing black tuxedos provided 
by a formal wear store tied the knot 
after a sept 20 police raid to combat gang violence in the 
rockwell gardens housing project overnight guests were banned 
meaning the boyfriends were forced to choose between walking down 
the aisle or walking out the door 
the blunt dictum became a big impetus for some couples 
i just love it said the former tammy grigsby 20 who 
married eugene young 54 we had been planning to get married but 
since they went on and pressed the issue we was all for it 
the couples beamed as the rev louise reed pronounced them 
husbands and wives at a makeshift altar at the nearby malcolm x 
college auditorium 
i love it said theoauther bower 36 who married linda 
jackson 31 it came out real beautiful mighty fine 
robert johnson 26 and linda hardy 28 are the parents of seven 
children but their wedding day was no less a cause for celebration 
when they raided my house that was wrong said johnson 
but today is the best day of my life im ready to party 
chicago housing authority chairman vincent lane whose agency 
arranged the wedding said the nuptials represent a step in the 
right direction for the residents involved 
the agency also will work with the husbands all unemployed to 
help them find jobs he said 
these people are models and i have high hope for them said 
lane who attended the brief ceremony i think a great deal of 
what happens in public housing in chicago is riding on their 
shoulders 
people will say the only reason theyre getting married is 
because of the raids he said i dont think thats true 
but if nothing else the marriages mean a number of the men wont 
have to violate a police order to visit their children 
i was really upset because cedric couldnt come see the kids 
and i couldnt see him for a couple weeks said marie woods 24 
about her new husband cedric smith 
we were taking our time she said but all this came up 
with the gangs so we decided we was going to get married 
smith 25 said the gang situation has improved since the raids 
i was glad they did it he said the situation that was 
over there with the gangs you was running for your life 
and if the newlyweds were pleased their parents were ecstatic 
i think its great said jesse hardy father of the new mrs 
johnson i tried to get her to marry a long time ago

presidentelect george bush and vice 
presidentelect dan quayle may be more than just running mates a 
genealogist who specializes in the lineage of presidents says bush 
and quayle are 10th cousins once removed 
the two are also related to abraham lincoln and the man thought 
to be marilyn monroes father said gary boyd roberts a genealogist 
at the new england historic genealogical society in boston 
bush a yankee and quayle from a wealthy indiana newspaper 
publishing family both have 17th century roots in new england 
roberts said 
roberts has spent almost a decade researching bushs ancestry 
which will be included in his upcoming book on presidential lineage 
timed to coincide with the 200th anniversary of george washingtons 
inauguration april 30 
roberts is director of publications at the genealogical society 
the nations oldest and second largest 
part of my mission is to show how one goes out from ones self 
to ones family to the community and to various groups around the 
nation roberts said if you look at pedigree you can tell 
about patterns in culture 
bush he said is only the third of what he calls social 
register presidents the first two republican theodore roosevelt 
and democrat franklin delano roosevelt who were distant cousins 
were closely connected to new york society 
both bush and quayle are wasps white anglosaxon protestants 
with a twist they both have strong ancestral ties to the south as 
well as new england roberts said 
according to roberts bush is distantly related to 10 american 
presidents including franklin pierce the nearest relation fifth 
cousins four times removed lincoln ulysses s grant rutherford 
b hayes grover cleveland william howard taft calvin coolidge 
franklin roosevelt richard nixon and gerald ford the most distant 
relation 11th cousins once removed 
bush also is descended from british royalty going as far back as 
12th century king henry i the son of william the conqueror said 
roberts 
quayle almost certainly has some royal ancestry but roberts 
has not thoroughly researched his family tree and he had ancestors 
on the mayflower including miles standish and john alden quayles 
father is a member of the mayflower society 
but that honor as roberts explains it is not uncommon there 
are an estimated 20 million to 30 million people descended from the 
23 families who survived passage on the mayflower roberts said 
bushs and quayles common ancestor was james hamlin who died in 
barnstable in 1690 bush and nixon as well as former presidents 
hayes and taft are descended from robert foote of shalford in the 
english county of essex who died in 1608 
bush and franklin delano roosevelt share an ancestor in anne 
marbury the noted religious reformer heretic and a founder of 
rhode island who was killed by indians on long island in 1643 
roberts discovered one of both bushs and quayles more 
celebrated relatives marilyn monroe through another genealogist 
affiliated with the society richard brenneman brenneman has 
documentation to show that bush and quayle share a common ancestor 
with monroes supposed father charles stanley gifford who was born 
in rhode island in 1888 and died in california in 1965 
most monroe biographies cite gifford as the man monroes mother 
claimed was her father monroes mother never married gifford but 
monroe and gifford made contact with each other over the years

graffiti spraypainted along a 
hilly street in this west bank city gave a message of intransigence 
to the palestinian leaders meeting in algeria 
it is disgraceful for a hand to shake hands with the one who 
kills our own people said the slogan signed by a prosyrian plo 
faction 
while many in the occupied territories are looking to the 
palestine national council session in algiers to declare palestinian 
independence on tuesday thus granting implicit recognition of 
israels existence a significant number strongly reject such a move 
the slogan in nablus was signed by the popular front for the 
liberation of palestine a syrianbacked plo faction long opposed to 
softening the palestinian refusal to recognize the reality of israel 
40 years after its founding 
already other small syrianbacked leftist plo factions such as 
saiqa the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command and fatah uprising have declared a boycott of this weeks 
session of the palestine council 
moslem fundamentalists who command an even larger following than 
the leftists also object to any move toward recognizing israel in 
a leaflet distributed in the occupied lands last week the 
fundamentalist group hamas or zeal called on the plo not to 
capitulate 
we are against all the positions that are calling for the end 
of armed struggle for peace with the murderers for 
recognition of a zionist state on even one inch of our land it 
said 
fundamentalists have repeatedly disputed the plobacked 
leadership of the 11month uprising against israeli occupation of 
the west bank and gaza strip 
the plo which includes the palestinians 20 percent christian 
minority as well as majority moslems wants palestine to be a 
secular nation while fundamentalists demand an islamic state 
the differences were recently patched up but the rift apparently 
is reopening over the issue of recognizing israel 
the declaration of independence expected to be accepted by the 
palestine council is based on the united nations 1947 partition 
plan calling for arab and jewish states sidebyside in palestine 
or what has become israel and the occupied territories 
moderate palestinians argue this implies recognition of the 
jewish state and hope a council declaration based on the socalled 
twostate solution would open the way for peace talks 
but moslem fundamentalists argue the plodominated palestine 
national council has no right to speak for all palestinians 
the pnc palestine council does not take islamic stands 
said ahmed a lecturer at annajah university in nablus who refused 
to give his last name i dont think the islamic movement is 
represented in the pnc 
sheik said bilal a fundamentalist leader in nablus said that 
before adopting a declaration of independence the palestine council 
should consult islamic religious leaders throughout the world 
he named a halfdozen such leaders in countries from egypt to 
pakistan which is not an arab country 
palestine is an islamic land and the entire islamic nation 
should decide whether the partition plan would be a good step he 
said 
other nonfundamentalist palestinians see the disunity over the 
issue as reason enough to hold off on any new stance toward israel 
bassam shakaa the hardline exmayor of nablus who lost his legs 
in a car bomb set by jewish underground members said any 
declaration of independence should have the backing not only of 
palestinians but of most arab nations

drugdealing gang members are killing in 
record numbers this year with no end to the deadly violence in 
sight despite police claims that they are not losing a street war 
waged against the gangs 
the battle is being won in target areas such as southcentral los 
angeles police said but those successes are not reflected in the 
numbers 
we arent losing the war we just arent winning in the data 
department spokesman cmdr william booth said friday but he 
conceded the data does tell us we are a long way from winning the 
war 
police department figures show gangrelated homicides rose 
threefold in october compared with the same month last year from 11 
to 33 for the year through oct 31 they were up nearly 25 percent 
from 166 in 1987 to 207 
that total already surpasses the record 205 gang killings for all 
of 1987 
and during the weekend four more people were slain in gangstyle 
attacks 
in los angeles county areas where the sheriff enforces the law 
79 gangrelated murders were recorded by late october matching the 
total for all of 1987 
meanwhile the crackdealing gangs called the crips and bloods 
the deadliest gangs in the nations secondlargest city continue to 
surface in towns and cities across the western united states 
in april mayor tom bradley a former police lieutenant vowed 
during the first 1000officer gang task force sweep we are going 
to take these terrorists off the streets of los angeles 
more than 21000 people 12000 of them gang members have been 
arrested by the departments gang task force since february most of 
them during the highly publicized sweeps including one saturday 
night that netted more than 175 people police said they do not know 
at this point how many arrests resulted in convictions 
in late october gang violence took an especially heavy toll a 
football star at california state university long beach had a 
kidney removed after using his body to shield a child from a bullet 
at a halloween party and 10 people were wounded outside a birthday 
party the same weekend including a 15monthold child who later 
died 
booth said that despite the rising gang murder rate its too 
early to call those sweeps ineffective 
you cant jump to conclusions that nothing is working booth 
said i think were making some impact overall and were going to 
make more impact 
in southcentral los angeles where the gangs are worst and task 
force sweeps most frequent homicide is down 17 percent robbery 
down 4 percent and rape down 5 percent in october compared with a 
year ago the police figures show 
gangs however are simply moving into other areas of the city to 
ply their drug trade booth conceded 
on the citys west side for instance there have been 20 murders 
through october compared with 17 for the same period last year in 
the san fernando valley there have been 26 deaths compared with 
eight through october 1987

former prime minister takeo miki who was in the 
peace camp when it was unpopular in the 1930s and worked to keep 
monied interests from exerting undue influence in politics died 
today of acute heart failure he was 81 
miki hospitalized since june 1986 when he suffered a cerebral 
hemorrhage died this morning at mitsui memorial hospital his aides 
said 
mr miki was a politician who consistently carried out his work 
with integrity before during and after world war ii prime 
minister noboru takeshita said in a television interview his 
creed toward political ethics was a strong leadership ideal 
miki served in the house of representatives for a record 51 
consecutive years beginning in 1937 and was prime minister from 
1974 to 1976 
eishiro saito chairman of the powerful federation of economic 
organizations keidanren said in a statement that miki was a 
walking dictionary of modern japanese politics 
his death comes at a time when the issue of trust in politics 
is being asked now saito added referring to a stock scandal now 
rocking japanese politics that involved scores of politicians and 
political aides who made huge profits by selling unlisted shares in 
a real estate firm before they were offered to the public 
miki had a longstanding reputation as a pacifist he earned by 
speaking out against the possibility of war with the united states 
in 1938 at a time when militarists were ascendant in government and 
such sentiments were suppressed 
throughout his career he fought for political reforms most 
prominently when he was the compromise choice for leadership of the 
liberal democratic party and the premiership after the 1974 crisis 
caused by the resignation of prime minister kakuei tanaka 
tanaka had resigned over burgeoning financial scandals and public 
criticism of the partys money politics 
mikis selection was largely intended to refurbish the partys 
tainted image because he was a stern foe within the party of 
tanakastyle politics and he had the least ties to vested business 
interests 
he did not earn favor with all in the party and he was once 
called the man closest to the opposition camp by yasuhiro 
nakasone a political rival who later became prime minister 
while premier miki faced such major problems as the recession 
triggered by the 1973 oil shock and the socalled lockheed 
scandal 
in february 1976 a us senate subcommittee disclosed 
multimilliondollar payments allegedly made by the usbased 
lockheed corp to japanese business and government figures to 
promote sales of its aircraft in japan 
miki vigorously pursued the investigation and tanaka eventually 
was tried and convicted for taking a bribe tanaka who has since 
suffered a stroke and has appeals before the courts has not gone to 
prison 
mikis campaign split the liberal democrats into pro and 
antimiki camps which campaigned separately for the house of 
representatives elections in december 1976 the liberal democrats 
fell seven seats short of the 256 neeeded for a majority and had to 
enlist eight independents for a fragile majority 
miki resigned to accept responsibility for the poor showing but 
retained his seat until the end 
a native of the southern island of shikoku where he was born 
march 17 1907 miki studied at the university of california at 
berkeley and at meiji university in japan 
his major government positions included minister of international 
trade and industry in 196566 and foreign minister in 196667 
miki is survived by his wife mutsuko two sons and one daughter 
buddhist funeral services will be held thursday at the zojoji temple 
in tokyo

stage director yuri lyubimov stripped of his 
citizenship four years ago will return to moscow for a lengthy 
visit in january to direct two plays at his avantgarde taganka 
theater official media said today 
ill come for a long time since ive received an official 
invitation even though ill work under a contract lyubimov was 
quoted as saying 
although i have commitments under contracts in the west im 
longing to come home to the taganka theater he was quoted as 
saying 
the government news agency novosti quoting the upcoming edition 
of the news weekly new times said the 70yearold lyubimov would 
stage the play alive written by boris mozhayev in the 1960s 
and a work by fyodor dostoyevsky probably the possessed 
the report did not say how long lyubimov will remain or whether 
his visit might turn into a permanent stay 
it quoted lyubimov as saying in stockholm where he is staging 
mikhail bulgakovs masterpiece the master and marguerita that 
he has found life difficult in the west he has settled in israel 
but has directed plays in the united states and throughout western 
europe 
some people think life here is like heaven ill put it bluntly 
life here is very very hard to live a normal life without any 
luxuries a producer should make at least four plays a year in good 
theaters this is very difficult you have to work very hard 
lyubimov was quoted as saying 
lyubimov returned to moscow briefly last spring after indications 
officials were taking a conciliatory attitude toward him 
many plays art works and publications that were banned in 
previous years now are being published under soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater openness 
lyubimovs avantgarde productions in his 20year career at the 
taganka theater often ran into trouble with communist party and 
government officials 
the novosti report quoted him as saying alive was one of the 
productions he tried several times to stage in moscow without 
success 
in 1983 lyubimov went to london to stage dostoyevskys crime 
and punishment amid speculation that he would not be allowed to 
return 
he extended his stay in london demanding assurances that he 
would be allowed artistic freedom in the soviet union but in march 
1984 he was fired from his job and expelled from the communist 
party four months later he was stripped of his citizenship

the battle for control of the countrys 
largest teamsters local and its 8500 members pits the powerful and 
corrupt former regime against its old enemies 
members of local 560 will be voting in the first election since a 
judge ruled the local was dominated by the mob and then deposed its 
executive board in favor of a trustee 
michael sciarra was removed as the locals president and joseph 
sheridan as vice president in 1986 because of their alleged ties to 
organized crime both deny any wrongdoing but have been barred from 
running for union office 
it was the first time a unions leadership had been ousted by the 
government for corruption 
while some felt that helped pry the corruptionplagued local from 
the grip of organized crime others perceive one slate of candidates 
as trying to wedge that influence back in 
danny sciarra michaels brother and mark sheridan josephs 
nephew are on the teamsters for liberty ticket running for 
president and vice president respectively 
i think he killed himself at that nominating meeting former 
teamster george d hansen said of michael sciarra who nominated his 
brother 
any talk that they werent corrupt went down the drain when 
danny sciarra and mark sheridan were nominated thats exactly 
what happens under mob rule theyre just trying to perpetuate it 
if daniel sciarra wins the race for president its because mob 
influence still reigns said libero marotta a lawyer who advises 
opposing candidate ray carney a third slate is not running a 
president 
carney was a friend of a rival union leader who was slain 27 
years ago during a power struggle with former local president 
anthony tony pro provenzano who is in prison for racketeering 
and murder convictions 
carney could not be reached for comment several messages left at 
his campaign headquarters were not returned 
with the local you have a history of outright bossism and 
gangsterism its not a secret that michael sciarra was a part of 
that whos naive enough to believe danny sciarra wont be 
marotta said 
ballots were to be mailed today to members and must be returned 
by dec 6 
danny sciarra admits hes running in place of his brother and 
plans to let michael in on some of the decisionmaking at the local 
but he adamantly denies either of them are involved with the mob 
and says michael looked out only for the interests of the membership 
michael sciarra said there was no intimidation when he was 
president and there will be none if his brother wins he scoffed at 
suggestions the membership wouldnt vote for danny because of the 
allegations against him 
i think theyll vote for him all the more because of whats 
happened to me michael sciarra said 
ed stier the trustee who has worked to rid the local of 
corruption said he would not object if danny sciarra wins the 
election 
my job isnt to try to call this election stier said my 
job is to create a democratic process in local 560 by which the 
membership has a chance to elect who they want 
you cant overcome 25 or 30 years of dictatorship in a couple 
years but i think weve started that process

gov ray mabus persuaded state lawmakers in 
august to adopt anticorruption changes in county government and 
now voters in more than half of the states 82 counties have taken 
the reforms even further 
it was a vote on how much mississippi is willing to change 
said mabus who led a group of young reformminded democrats into 
office last november with county government reform as one of the 
hallmarks of his campaign 
voters in 48 counties agreed last tuesday that their countys 
system for constructing and maintaining roads should be changed 
they approved a ballot issue to streamline the corruptionplagued 
road operations 
the county government reorganization bill passed by lawmakers was 
inspired by an fbi corruption investigation that snared dozens of 
public officials 
mabus as state auditor assisted the fbi in the crackdown on 
corrupt county purchasing practices that resulted in charges ranging 
from mail fraud to extortion against 57 county supervisors in 25 
counties 
prodded by mabus the state legislature in august approved a bill 
restructuring the states centuryold system of county government 
but left the the road issue up to voters 
at the time 22 of the states counties had already abandoned the 
beat system which gave the five supervisors in each county 
control over policy and daytoday operations in the district that 
elected them 
mabus claimed the beat system invited officials to steal 
under the new system the parttime supervisors set the policy 
and hire an administrator to oversee consolidated county operations 
the state bill also requires counties to establish central 
purchasing receiving and inventory control systems with separate 
clerks for each 
many of the supervisors vocally opposed the changes the 
410member mississippi association of supervisors had placed 
estimates for the switch at more than 36 million statewide for 
property purchases and personnel 
mabus and the mississippi economic council the statewide chamber 
of commerce however had predicted a statewide savings of 27 
million by eliminating duplicated equipment and services 
while instigator of the changes mabus is reluctant to claim the 
voter approval of the road changes as a personal victory 
i dont think its a referendum on you unless your name is on 
the ballot mabus said while adding that he was very happy with 
the outcome 
others disagree 
overall it was a victory for political reform in the state and 
since the governor really took the lead it was a victory for him 
said steven shaffer a political science professor at mississippi 
state university 
house speaker tim ford said he viewed the outcome of the 
referendum as a victory for the citizens of the state regardless 
of who proposed it he added however certainly for those in 
favor of the unit system which included the governor i think it is 
a victory 
every urban county in mississippi which is largely rural to 
begin with voted to adopt the unit system but mabus shuns any 
division of the vote along urbanrural lines some of the counties 
that voted in favor of the switch are as rural as you get he 
said

us ambassador mike mansfield a lean montanan who 
spent much of his lengthy political career promoting better 
relations between the united states and asia announced today that 
he is retiring at age 85 
foreign minister sosuke uno reacted to the imminent departure of 
japans much valued friend with deep regret a ministry official 
said mansfield said he would leave tokyo before jan 1 
mansfield a democrat who set longevity records during his 16 
years as us senate majority leader and in his 11 years as envoy to 
the crucial tokyo post told a packed news conference at the 
american embassy that he and his wife maureen had decided it was 
time to retire 
we decided it was time for me to resign subject to the will of 
the president and that has been done mansfield said 
mansfield said he delayed announcing his retirement plans until 
after congress had adjourned until a resolution had been reached on 
us demands that japan import american rice and most importantly 
until after last weeks presidential election 
describing bilateral relations as excellent mansfield said 
the situation between japan and the united states was stable enough 
that we can leave with our heads high and our arms swinging 
mansfields service to the united states started at 14 as an 
underage enlistee in the navy for the duration of world war i he 
subsequently served with the army and later with the marine corps 
for whom he worked in asia 
before mansfield began the first of his five terms as a 
representative from montanas first district in 1942 he taught far 
eastern and latin american history at montana state university 
in 1944 mansfield was sent on a foreign policy mission to china 
at president franklin d roosevelts request prior to his tokyo 
appointment he returned to china several times at the invitation of 
the beijing government 
mansfields assignment to tokyo in 1977 made many japanese happy 
because of his prestige in congress and his long advocacy of east 
asias great importance to the united states the usjapan 
relationship he often said is the most important to washington 
bar none 
it is our hope that we will work together in the next century 
which will be the century of the pacific mansfield said today 
following mansfields announcement uno expressed appreciation 
for the ambassadors efforts to improve relations between tokyo and 
washington it was truly fortunate that we had a person like 
ambassador mansfield in tokyo for a long time ministry officials 
quoted him as saying 
mansfields calls for patience in dealing with the japanese in 
trade negotiations generated rumors however of splits in both the 
state department and the tokyo embassy into pro and antimansfield 
camps the latter argued he was too soft on japan and had failed 
to counsel firm stances on the trade issues that caused friction 
between washington and tokyo 
mansfield argued in return that japanese markets had opened in 
many ways during his tenure and japan has taken on a significant 
portion of the security burden in asia he spoke out in favor of a 
wideranging trade agreement with japan an idea that is unlikely to 
materialize for years 
what we ought to do is sit down get away from this nickel and 
diming way of conducting trade negotiations and face up to the 
issue as a whole not the 60 billion deficit with japan but the 
170 billion deficit with the whole world he said last year 
in january mansfield had coronary bypass surgery renewing 
speculation he might retire but he returned to the tokyo embassy 
last spring 
washingtons decision not to make an immediate attempt to force 
the opening of the japanese rice market a position endorsed by 
mansfield freed him to retire convinced of the excellent

ammonia gas seeped from a coldstorage building 
during a blaze that sent three fightfighters to the hospital and 
resulted in the evacuation of about 100 people from their homes 
officials said today 
the multialarm fire was burning out of control early today at 
the rainier cold storage and ice building said deputy fire chief 
steve bailey he said the buildings walls are packed with sawdust 
and the sawdust was smoldering 
this is a fire we dreaded occurring and it occurred bailey 
said we could be here for days 
the back wall of the fourstory turnofthe century building 
originally built by the rainier brewing co collapsed as flames 
shot out its windows 
the cause of the fire which broke out sunday night had not been 
determined bailey said 
about 4000 pounds of ammonia were in the lines that supply the 
buildings refrigeration said mike roberts rainier vice president 
of marketing and warehousing the bottom floor was an ice plant he 
said 
roberts said 22room structure contained about 13 million pounds 
of fruits vegetables meats and seafood 
the odor of ammonia was evident in the area near the blaze

way its going to go he said

throat and lungs and can be fatal

condition said nursing supervisor pamela fanton a firefighter with

discrimination language problems and poverty are 
as much at the heart of the aids epidemic as drug abuse and 
promiscuity says us surgeon general c everett koop 
if you just look at the numbers in aids the numbers that have 
died youre missing the whole story koop said sunday at a news 
conference before an address at a meeting of the association of 
american medical colleges 
minorities poverty discrimination access to care all 
these are part of the whole story 
he said the fight against the deadly disease has failed to convey 
aids information effectively to blacks and hispanics who have been 
stricken with aids in numbers disproportionate to their populations 
of the 77994 aids cases reported since june 1981 in the united 
states 26 percent were among blacks and 15 percent among hispanics 
blacks make up about 14 percent of the overall population and 
hispanics make up 7 percent 
koop said higher rates of illiteracy in the black and hispanic 
communities may be part of the problem in conveying information 
about the disease 
a related problem is lack of access to health care among 
minorities and groups at high risk for contracting aids such as 
prostitutes and intravenous drug users he said 
we have to make sure that they get it koop said but often 
they dont know where to get it and many times the medical 
profession doesnt feel comfortable treating them 
koop said the government aids education campaign has employed 
black and hispanic public relations firms to reach those groups 
so its very difficult to understand where these black and 
hispanic groups are making their errors

the devils disciple is the most melodramatic 
of george bernard shaws comedies a play in which the hero spends a 
good deal of the last act with a noose around his neck waiting to 
be hanged 
it requires a swashbuckler of an actor a daring doer who can 
physically dominate the stage charm the other characters as well 
as the audience and at the same time negotiate some of shaws 
wittiest and trickiest dialogue 
fortunately circle in the square has found such an adep 
performer for its revival of the play which opened sunday on 
broadway his name is victor garber and he pretty much lifts this 
production out of the ordinary all by himself 
television audiences may know garber as liberace ii he was the 
king of piano glitz in the second of two recent tv movies based on 
the entertainers life 
new york theateregoers have had a better chance to appraise his 
talent in such diverse offerings as deathtrap sweeney todd 
little me and wenceslas square in most of them the actor 
played supporting roles 
now garber comes into his own as the star of this production he 
portrays dick dudgeon a selfprofessed follower of the devil who 
ends up a man of god by the time the curtain falls 
the setting is revolutionary war new hampshire and the 
playwright is concerned with the hypocrisy of war and peace dicks 
opposite number is the rev anthony anderson a yankee minister who 
also undergoes a conversion of sorts he trades his pulpit for 
pistols before the story is over 
the transformation occurs after the neerdowell is mistaken for 
the minister and is sentenced by the british to hang dick readily 
goes along with the mistake willing to die for another man his 
ultimate act of sacrifice is disrupted by the reverends wife 
judith who at least in this production becomes smitten with the 
imposter 
their romantic attachment is more than hinted at in director 
stephen porters swiftly paced production roxanne hart overdoes the 
emotion as the ministers loyal but bewildered wife she swoons a 
bit too much at the dashing dudgeon 
but then one can sense her disinterest in her minister husband 
played with diffidence by remak ramsay his conversion from boring 
pastor to mighty warrior is unconvincing and seems unexpected 
garbers only real support in what is a large cast comes from 
philip bosco a veteran circle in the square performer bosco plays 
the british gen burgoyne its a small but pivotal role and the 
actor has the wit urbanity and stage presence to carry it off the 
general is shaws voice of common sense a realist who sees what 
will happen to the american colonies and what dudgeon is trying to 
accomplish by his masquerade 
the physical production is respectable if unexciting zack 
browns turntable settings slammed up against one wall are spartan 
a flooring of wooden planks cover the elongated playing area with 
the audience on three sides 
respectable is a good word for the entire production porters 
professional direction never slips even when his two most 
interesting actors are off stage still the play becomes even more 
than that when bosco and particularly garber are on stage its 
these two performers who put this revival of the devils 
disciple on the side of the angels 
other critics such as newsdays leo seligsohn lamented the 
unevenness of the evening for all the stylishness of the production 
at its best porter hasnt wrung the same highquality acting from 
everyone 
howard kissel of the daily news applauded the work of garber and 
hart but complained that the production starts shakily and 
features heavyhanded acting by other principals 
frank rich of the new york times said the work of both stars is 
exemplary just as mr porters staging is largely above reproach 
but this time the gathering of our most lustrous shavian ensemble 
seems a frivolous waste of valuable resources 
clive barnes of the new york post said the production was 
worthy but a little commonplace its pleasures proving all as 
predictable as a fastfood hamburger with most of the trimmings

president chaim herzog asked prime minister 
yitzhak shamir today to form israels next government and shamir 
pledged to make a tremendous effort to advance peace with the 
arabs 
the president called on israels two major parties shamirs 
rightwing likud and the rival leftleaning labor to try to form a 
national unity government 
but it appeared most likely shamir would form a government with 
small rightwing parties and three religious parties 
shamir speaking at the presidential mansion after being summoned 
by herzog agreed to try to explore a unity government but made it 
clear he alone would lead the government and would not share power 
with labor as he did after the 1984 stalemated elections 
shamir promised to include in his cabinet all the parties that 
would agree to be part of a likudled government 
however labor party secretarygeneral uzi baram said labor 
would accept nothing less than an equal partnership with likud 
after the 1984 elections shamir and peres agreed to divide 
cabinet posts equally and both served as premier for two years this 
time however likud has the ability to form a government with small 
religious and rightwing parties and was unlikely to grant labors 
demand for equality 
herzog referred to the growing tension between secular and 
religious jews in israel and the orthodox and nonorthodox abroad 
that emerged after religious parties demanded major concessions as 
the price for backing shamir 
based on thousands of telegrams and letters to his office the 
president said there is a wish for unity to confront the dangers 
from outside and the separation threatening us from within 
ultraorthodox parties have demanded legislation giving them 
final say over conversions to judaism marriage and divorce 
this puts them on a collision course with reform and conservative 
jews who constitute a majority in the united states they warned 
such moves would undermine identification with israel and could 
ultimately threaten political and financial support 
many secular israelis who make up threequarters of israels 35 
million jews have protested religious demands to close pubs 
restaurants and soccer stadiums on the jewish sabbath and enforce a 
law banning the sale of pork 
in a radio interview shamir appeared to hold out a peace feeler 
to labor he said government guidelines on negotiations with the 
arabs had not yet been composed and hinted labor would have a say in 
formulating such policy if they agreed to his leadership of th 
government 
but four years of conflict between shamir and peres left 
bitterness that would be difficult to overcome political 
concessions would also be difficult for labor to accept especially 
an expected likud demand that labor give up its support for an 
international peace conference 
the government i put together will with the help of god see 
as its first goal to make a tremendous effort to advance the peace 
process and achieve friendship and understanding with our 
neighbors shamir said in the radio interview 
according to israeli law shamir has 21 days to put the 
government in place if necessary he can request an extension of 21 
days 
rafi edri who headed a labor delegation that met with herzog 
earlier today conceded the leftleaning partys defeat 
this morning its clear that shamir will form the next 
government we did what we could and we did not succeed but we did 
not compromise our principles he told reporters 
even though shamir seemed assured of being able to muster a 
majority in parliament the battle over posts in the 25member 
cabinet could at least delay and possibly sabotage his efforts to 
form a government 
the agreements with one religious party agudat israel also 
remained to be finalized 
likud legislator david levy angrily denounced the agreement with 
agudat israel and another religious party shas that yielded 
crucial cabinet portfolios to the ultraorthodox in exchange for 
their support 
i think a very serious mistake was made here and i can only be 
sorry about it said levy adding he thought the party gave away 
too much 
to woo shas and agudat israel into the coalition shamir promised 
what labor and its staunchly secular allies would not the 
amendment to israels who is a jew or law of return which 
guarantees automatic citizenship to all jews and converts 
other concessions included a promise to shas party leader rabbi 
yitzhak peretz that he would hold the key portfolios of deputy prime 
minister and interior minister the jerusalem post said

nearly 25 years have passed since bugler 
keith clark missed the sixth note of taps at the funeral of john f 
kennedy 
clark recovered and completed the song but the note that broke 
offkey stays with him 
i missed a note under pressure he said its something you 
dont like but its something that can happen to a trumpet player 
you never really get over it said clark now 60 and retired 
clark as lead trumpeter in the army band when kennedy was 
assassinated on nov 22 1963 was assigned the task of sounding 
taps at the presidents funeral at arlington national cemetery in 
virginia 
clark had played taps daily for four years giving hundreds of 
flawless performances at arlington and adjacent fort myer 
at kennedys funeral clark swallowed hard as the 21 guns fired 
then took his cue on the sixth note he faltered 
it is like the speaker of the house saying ladies and 
gentleman the president of the united states that is not at all 
hard to say clark said but to do it then and to do it there 
thats when the pressure comes thats when it becomes difficult all 
of a sudden a lot of people can sing in the shower you know 
in the aftermath the crackling note assumed a lore of its own 
it was widely believed that the break was intentional a ripple of 
sadness left to the mourners 
for a month after the funeral buglers missed that note like 
crazy at arlington clark said we all thought it must be 
psychological he said 
after the service clark confronted the commanding officer who 
had given him the assignment angrily thrusting the bugle at him 
here you take it he said you play it next time 
clark retired from the army in 1966 and teaches trumpet parttime 
at a community college the bugle is on display at the smithsonian 
institution

populist leader benazir bhutto drew 
about 20000 people to her final rally in the northwest frontier 
city of peshawar today as parties ended campaigns for pakistans 
nov 16 national elections 
in the eastern city of lahore her rightwing rivals of the 
islamic democratic alliance scheduled a campaign finale later in the 
day 
at peshawars jinnah park ms bhutto said her pakistan peoples 
party was a champion of workers and farmers while the nineparty 
alliance which contains loyalists of late president mohammed zia 
ulhaq has become an opposition alliance against the peoples 
party 
as one of the only women in the election campaign she alluded to 
moslem fundamentalists who oppose the prospect of a woman leader 
as a woman i am your sister you are my force your success is 
my success she told the crowd which had waited up to three hours 
for her 20minute speech 
election officials have ordered all campaigning to cease at 
midnight in order to establish calm and the government said 
thousands of security forces had gone on alert to quell any 
political violence 
federal and provincial authorities announced the mobilization of 
police army and paramilitary forces to head off any trouble during 
the lengthy voting period which ends with provincial assembly 
elections on saturday 
at stake wednesday are 217 elected seats in the national assembly 
and on saturday 483 seats in the four provincial legislatures 
the party that takes the most national assembly seats will have 
the first chance at forming a government 
no reliable polls have been taken during the campaign 
the election is seen mainly as a contest between ms bhuttos 
leftleaning party and zia loyalists led by the pakistan muslim 
league of former prime minister mohammad khan junejo and punjab 
state chief minister nawaz sharif 
ms bhutto is the daughter of former prime minister zulfikar ali 
bhutto who zia ousted in a 1977 coup and had hanged two years later 
for conspiracy to kill a political rival 
zia died in an aug 17 plane crash that investigators said 
appeared to be sabotage also killed were the us ambassador and 28 
other people 
wednesdays vote is expected to be the first democratic election 
in the nation of 107 million people since the 1973 polls that swept 
the elder bhutto to power bhutto was reelected in 1977 but zia 
nullified the results after the coup saying the vote was rigged 
despite their differences the battle between the two largest 
parties has been more one of symbols than of issues 
ms bhutto has abandoned her fathers disastrous economic policy 
of nationalizing industry and has pledged to continue close us 
ties and support for afghanistans anticommunist guerrillas zia 
loyalists also pledge support for the guerrillas and close us ties 
both sides favor pakistans nuclear research program for peaceful 
purposes 
army convoys began moving troops today around islamabad the 
capital and adjacent rawalpindi however officials said security 
forces would be most vigilant in the southern cities of hyderabad 
and karachi where nearly 300 people were killed in ethnic clashes 
with a political undertone in september 
iftekhar rashid deputy police inspectorgeneral for sind 
province said about 50000 military and police personnel would be 
deployed in voting districts there in addition to the sindhi cities 
of sukkur and larkana 
tension in the province has been mainly between sindhi 
separatists and indian moslem immigrants known as mohajirs 
otherwise the campaign has seen sporadic incidents of gunfire 
and rockthrowing but no episodes of major political violence 
pakistans 48 million eligible voters threefourths of them 
illiterate will be required to present a government identity card 
to cast their ballots officials say about 93 percent had been 
issued cards but ms bhutto claimed the percentage was far less 
she has called on party supporters without cards to demonstrate 
at polling stations but to remain peaceful

hundreds of spotlights illuminated the soviet space 
shuttle today as experts made final preparations for the second 
attempt to launch the buran the tass news agency said 
the soviet shuttle was scheduled to blast off on its first 
unmanned flight at 6 am moscow time tuesday 10 pm tonight est 
from the baikonur cosmodrome in soviet central asia 
workers labored overnight under nearly 700 spotlights to prepare 
the buran meaning snowstorm the official tass news agency said 
liquid fuels were to be added to its giant booster rocket 14 hours 
before the flight tass said 
the buran is to make two orbits on fully automatic control and 
then return to a 27milelong concrete runway a few miles away from 
the launch site 
the communist party newspaper pravda today ran a frontpage 
picture of the shuttle attached to the rocket being transported to 
the launch site 
the first launch was scrubbed on oct 29 when an access arm did 
not pull far enough away from the spaceship in the final minute 
before blastoff 
computers automatically stopped the launch when the arm did not 
retract 
v filin the deputy chief engineer for the booster rocket 
blamed the failure on overcomplicated construction of the joint 
between the access tower and the spacecraft 
filin said an analysis showed it would take not three seconds to 
fully retract the access arm as had been expected but 38 seconds 
as a result of the analysis access arm became simpler but 
more reliable and that has been confirmed by experiments filin 
said

the supreme court today agreed to judge the 
constitutionality of a connecticut law aimed at assuring that beer 
sold in the state costs no more than it does in three neighboring 
states 
the court said it will review a ruling that the 1984 law 
regulating beer prices unduly interfered with interstate commerce 
the justices in 1983 voted 53 in striking down as 
unconstitutional a similar connecticut law 
the earlier law prohibited brewers from selling its brand of beer 
in connecticut at a price higher than the lowest price which it sold 
beer in new york massachusetts or rhode island under that law the 
controlling price was adjusted each month 
the retail price of beer generally has been higher in connecticut 
than in its neighbor states and many connecticut consumers buy beer 
in one of the three neighboring states 
the earlier law was struck down because it was deemed to affect 
the price of beer outside connecticut by locking beer prices in all 
four states for onemonth periods to the level posted in connecticut 
the 1984 connecticut law however stated that the posted 
connecticut beer prices only had to reflect the lowest prices being 
offered at the time of the posting 
the law did not prevent brewers from lowering prices in the three 
neighboring states at any time during the calendar month covered 
by such posting 
beer brewers immediately challenged the 1984 law but a federal 
trial judge upheld it 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last june 13 reversed the 
judges ruling and struck down the law 
the realities of beer price regulation in the border state area 
show that connecticuts statute inevitably exercises control over 
the prices set for sales occurring wholly outside its territory 
the appeals court ruled 
accordingly we hold that the amended connecticut beer price 
affirmation provisions directly regulate interstate commerce in 
violation of the constitution it added 
the 2nd circuit courts ruling was appealed by state officials 
and instate beer wholesalers 
the cases are healy vs beer institute 88449 and wine and 
spirits wholesalers vs beer institute 88513

branch and could impair the independence of judges 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled last february in 
favor of blacks seeking to apply the voter rights law to the 
election of louisiana judges 
the black registered voters said their voting power was diluted 
unlawfully by a system in which two louisiana supreme court justices 
are elected atlarge from a district comprised of four parishes 
the state court has seven justices five of whom are elected from 
singlemember districts the remaining two are elected at large from 
a district comprised of orleans st bernard plaquemines and 
jefferson parishes 
orleans parish has a black population of 55 percent and accounts 
for more than half the population of the fourparish judicial 
district 
the black voters filed a lawsuit to split the four parishes and 
create two singlemember districts thus enhancing the chance that 
orleans parish could elect a black justice to the state court 
the blacks said the atlarge system violates the voting rights 
act of 1965 which is designed to prevent dilution of black voting 
strength 
louisiana officials argued that the law covers only 
representatives of the people namely members of the legislative 
and executive branches of government 
the state officials headed by gov buddy roemer said 
judges should not be representatives the larger the 
constituency the less parochial pressures can be brought to bear 
an advantage to atlarge elections for judges is that judges can 
make the difficult decisions without undue fear of dissatisfaction 
in the electorate 
they added judges have but one constituency the blindfolded 
lady with scales sword and shield 
but the 5th circuit court said the voting rights act is intended 
to be a broad attack on racial discrimination in voting 
clearly judges are candidates for public office the appeals 
court said the act must be interpreted in a broad and 
comprehensive manner in accordance with congressional intent to 
combat racial discrimination of any kind in all voting practices and 
procedures 
judges are elected in most states the louisiana officials said 
there are only eight states delaware hawaii massachusetts new 
hampshire new jersey rhode island vermont and virginia where 
judges are appointed 
the reagan administration supported the 5th circuit courts 
interpretation of the voting rights law 
the natural reading of the term representatives does not 
exclude elected judges in the context of the voting rights act 
the justice department said 
eight states urged the supreme court to hear louisianas appeal 
and decide the issue they are alabama arkansas florida georgia 
illinois mississippi north carolina and texas 
the case is roemer vs chisom 88327

dozens of notaries are duping 
immigrants into paying thousands of dollars for flawed immigration 
papers by posing as legal advisers a state commission has found 
most of floridas 350000 notaries are abiding by their duty as 
official witnesses to legal transactions but some are preying on 
immigrants especially hispanics who need help changing their 
immigration status said several members of the governors study 
commission on notaries public 
these notaries capitalize on the fact that the spanish notario 
publico refers in most latin american countries to a highranking 
public official qualified and licensed to give legal advice the 
commission said 
although these notaries charge high prices for their work they 
often provide nothing but worthless sheets of paper easily spotted 
by immigration officers who can have the immigrant deported 
commission members said 
this is absolutely the worst kind of fraud on the public 
because its aimed at the people who are least able to fend for 
themselves said robert sondak a commission member and miami

southwest africa also known as namibia which has been under south 
african control for 73 years 
one south african official speaking on condition of anonymity 
described progress in the latest round as glacial things are on 
track but on a very slow track

the supreme court today agreed to hear an 
appeal by trucking companies seeking refunds from arkansas of taxes 
they paid under a levy that was declared unconstitutional 
the court said it will review a ruling that denied the companies 
the refunds on grounds that doing so would require an unfair 
retroactive application of decisions that invalidated the tax 
at the same time the court also agreed to study the refund issue 
in a case from florida involving taxes on alcoholic beverages the 
justices said they will hear an appeal by mckesson corp a 
wholesale liquor distributor seeking a refund for taxes paid under 
a state levy that allegedly favored instate companies 
in the arkansas case the truck tax was declared unconstitutional 
last march by the state supreme court 
that court based its ruling on a us supreme court decision in 
june 1987 that struck down a similar tax in pennsylvania on grounds 
it discriminated unlawfully against interstate truckers 
the arkansas court ordered state officials to refund to 
interstate truckers 49 million that had been held in a special 
escrow fund created in august 1987 
but the state court said the truckers were not entitled to 
additional refunds on taxes the state collected but had not placed 
in the separate fund 
the state court said it would be unfair to apply the 1987 us 
supreme court ruling retroactively and award the interstate truckers 
the additional refunds 
the equities favor disallowing refund of the tax money already 
paid into the state treasury the state court said 
the us supreme court in 1987 struck down a socalled flat tax 
that pennsylvania had imposed on all truck companies that used its 
highways the justices said the tax favored pennsylvania companies 
because they paid the same amount of money as interstate haulers 
even though the trucks owned by interstate companies traveled far 
fewer miles on pennsylvania highways 
the american trucking association which successfully challenged 
the pennsylvania tax noted that the arkansas legislature repealed 
that states flat tax in october 1987 and replaced it with one that 
imposed a rate of 25 cents per mile on all users of arkansas 
highways 
but the new law allowed arkansas officials to collect the 
invalidated tax for another year 
the trucking association did not specify the size of the 
additional refunds it sought for its members but the invalidated 
arkansas tax produced some 23 million in annual revenue 
the case are mckesson corp vs division of alcoholic beverages 
and american truck associations vs smith 88325

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev today 
convened an unusual gathering of the communist party and 
governments top officials and told them the countrys farm problem 
is the most critical one they face 
the tass news agency said gorbachev addressed a gathering in the 
industrial city of orel about 230 miles south of moscow that 
included national party and government leaders officials of the 
staterun media and provincial communist party chiefs 
the soviet leader called the soviet unions food supply 
difficulties the most important problem of the internal policy of 
the soviet union official radio moscow said 
although gorbachev frequently goes on trips outside of moscow to 
push his reform effort it was rare for him to call a large 
gathering of top national and regional officials outside of the 
kremlin 
the inclusion of media officials and regional party leaders 
indicated the importance of the gathering among the kremlin 
officials who attended the gathering were politburo member yegor k 
ligachev formerly regarded as the no 2 leader but shifted at the 
end of september to the agriculture portfolio 
ligachev had not attended a midoctober meeting in the central 
committee on agriculture 
gorbachev said improvements in the orel regions agricultural 
production in the past three years prove the value of his drive for 
greater local control tass said 
the improvements indicate much depends on the initiative and 
independence of local organs of power to rule and decide practical 
problems of the agricultural sector tass quoted him as saying 
the communist partys policymaking central committee will meet 
in february to discuss plans to let families and other small groups 
of farmers rent land from giant collective and state farms on 
longterm leases gorbachev said 
the lead article of the government newspaper izvestia this 
evening said the orel region had increased its sales of meat by 
onethird and milk by 17 percent in the past three years it ran its 
story under a headline lease contracts return the land to its 
master 
tass said the orel conference will consider pressing issues 
of gorbachevs reform effort primarily what the communist party 
must do to improve food supplies 
the participants will familiarize themselves with the 
experience of introducing new relations of production and economic 
relations and expediting social progress in the countryside which 
has been gained in the orel region tass said 
soviet farming is plagued by low productivity frequent disregard 
for the land and machinery waste in shipping and storage and few 
cultural and social amenities in the countryside 
soviet food stores are frequently empty of anything but basic 
goods 
gorbachev has said that improving the food supply is one of his 
top priorities and is pushing for a shift to lease contracts in 
farming 
officials say such a system instills in farmers greater care for 
the land and makes them more efficient than other farmers

massachusetts highest court will review an 
extraordinary ruling by a judge who threw out a jury verdict of 
guilty of murder declared the defendant innocent and alleged 
possible misconduct by the prosecution 
a superior court jury last month convicted charles w doucette 
jr 28 of killing a fellow mechanic who owed him money in 1987 
two days later judge john t ronan declared doucette innocent 
and he was freed although he is awaiting trial on a charge of 
intimidating a witness his former fiancee in the trial

an inquest into the 1982 killing 
of three unarmed guerrillas by police opened today with its scope 
sharply narrowed by a government order citing national security 
an 11member inquest jury in craigavon 19 miles southwest of 
belfast was to establish the circumstances surrounding the shooting 
deaths of gervase mckerr eugene toman and sean burns the irish 
republican army has acknowledged the three as members 
a detective told the inquest that police had been told before the 
shootings that the ira was planning to kill a member of the security 
forces and that toman and burns both 21 were thought to be armed 
one hour after the hearing began a lawyer for the family of 
mckerr 31 walked out in protest when the coroner heading the 
inquest refused to summon three officers to testify 
attorney pat finnucane said he would ask the northern ireland 
high court to order the officers to answer questions at the inquest 
the three ira men were shot dead in a police ambush on nov 11 
1982 as they drove through county armagh a hotbed of guerrilla 
activity geared primarily toward assassinating police officers 
three more unarmed roman catholics two of them guerrillas and 
one a teenager died in two other police ambushes in county armagh 
over the next month 
at first police said all the deaths occurred in the normal 
course of antiterrorist warfare but subsequent evidence suggested 
the killings were deliberate and avoidable and that police were 
operating an alleged shoottokill policy in the british 
province 
the overwhelmingly catholic ira is fighting to rid 
protestantdominated northern ireland of british rule and unite it 
with the irish republic 
northern ireland secretary tom king britains top official in 
the province has barred the inquest from investigating certain 
circumstances of the shootings which he considers would be 
detrimental to the national security 
kings order signed last week expressed concern about 
jeopardizing present and future counterterrorist operations 
a screen heavily guarded by policemen concealed the identities 
of police officers giving testimony 
allegations that police systematically distorted the 
circumstances of the killings culminated in a 1986 police inquiry 
which uncovered evidence that at least 11 police officers were 
involved in a conspiracy to pervert justice 
the investigating officer john stalker deputy chief constable 
of the manchester police force was abruptly dismissed from the 
twoyear inquiry in may 1986 and suspended for disciplinary 
offenses 
the allegations of misconduct turned out to be trivial and a 
police watchdog panel cleared stalker but he was not restored to 
the northern ireland inquiry into the royal ulster constabulary the 
provinces overwhelmingly protestant police force 
critics say it reaffirms the belief that british rule in northern 
ireland is unjust toward the catholic minority 
inquests into the three other killings are expected to be held at 
the end of the first inquest

george bush seeking to calm world 
financial market fears about his forthcoming presidency said today 
that he will continue the reagan administration policy of 
coordinated intervention with us allies in exchange markets when 
major currencies rise or fall too quickly 
the presidentelect sought to minimize the weakening of the 
dollar against the japanese yen and german mark and the plunge of 
the stock market since his election last tuesday saying these 
gyrations happen 
exchange market stability is the key nobody is going to peg 
the dollar to any existing currency he said in an informal 
meeting with reporters on the beach 
questions about the markets behavior have dogged the vice 
president during his postelection florida beach vacation the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials fell almost 80 points last week 
including a 47point drop friday that was partially triggered by 
fears over erosion of the dollars value abroad 
asked if he would favor lowering the dollar against foreign 
currencies as has been suggested by his sometime economic adviser 
martin feldstein bush said the policy in effect is the 
administration policy built around policy coordination and exchange 
market stability thats the policy of the administration 
for the past three years the united states and its economic 
allies have had a policy of coordinated intervention in exchange 
markets when major currencies rise or fall too rapidly the central 
banks of the major industrial countries buy or sell dollars 
depending on whether they are trying to counter a rise or a fall in 
its value 
between september 1985 and february 1987 the policy was to push 
the value of the dollar down since february the policy has been to 
maintain stability of exchange rates through a managed float 
within established unofficial trading ranges 
earlier the cochairman of bushs transition team said that 
cutting the federal budget deficit would be priority one for the 
incoming administration 
i do think weve got to turn first to the deficit problem as 
soon as we undertake a new administration craig fuller bushs 
chief of staff said from washington on the nbctv today program 
fuller asked in the interview about investors concerns said 
the bush white house is moving quickly to address the deficit 
weve already had some good contacts with the house speaker 
james wright dtexas i expect to have further contacts with the 
speaker i think youll have people who have a great deal of 
experience working with each other willing to sit down early and 
talk about these concerns fuller said 
investors should understand he said that no major differences 
in spending priorities from the reagan administration are planned 
i think i have to emphasize that priority one is going to be 
getting this deficit under control that suggests that were not 
going to rush out with large spending programs and i think both 
republicans and democrats understand the significance of that 
fuller said 
wright without mentioning the deficit said in a separate 
interview on the same program 
i think we can find a lot of common ground with bush and that 
there are many areas in which we can work together and should 
and we ought to reach out to seek those opportunities in every way 
we can 
bush also hinted today that he might have announcements on 
appointees to his administration when he returns to washington this 
week 
he rejected a report suggesting that james a baker iii whom 
bush has selected as secretary of state would wield power as a 
deputy president 
you havent heard that here he told reporters he said baker 
is a close confident but i simply would look here for guidance on 
whos going to be calling the shots other than the new president 
on reports that a threeperson chiefofstaff arrangement was 
under consideration bush said stay tuned ill have 
announcements on that pretty soon 
he revealed that new hampshire gov john sununu would join bush 
this evening at the presidentelects oceanfront vacation spot 
no other political associates have visited bush here since he 
arrived thurday but bush laughlingly cautioned reporters dont 
read into it anything about sununu 
fuller said sunday that bush plans to name his top economic 
advisers later this week 
treasury secretary nicholas brady is widely expected to stay on 
with bush and former deputy treasury secretary richard g darman has 
been reported to be the choice for budget director 
bush sidestepped a question about whether he would name a woman 
to his cabinet saying he did not want to impose quotas but that 
i will anticipate there will be representation in the cabinet 
on another matter bush rejected allegations that the 
governments foreclosure warning to 80000 farmers was held up until 
after the election 
i dont believe theres any political motivation related to 
agriculural policies at all he said 
he declined to comment on the merits of the foreclosure action 
saying i will get briefed on that when i get back 
bush is scheduled to return to washington early tuesday his 
schedule for the week includes meetings with west german chancellor 
helmut kohl and british prime minister margaret thatcher

a man who shot to death one person and 
wounded three others before killing himself wanted revenge for his 
firing as an administrator of a home for the retarded state police 
say 
he knew his victims by their first names and asked for them 
specifically when he came to their home state police spokesman 
steve mccausland said of alan matterson 36 of cumberland 
he was broken man as a result of the investigation that 
prompted the state to seize control of the group home and which led 
to mattersons dismissal in 1987 mccausland said sunday night 
matterson was fired from his job at the former androscoggin 
community home in mechanic falls a home for 14 mentally handicapped 
adults it is now called main street mechanic falls and is under new 
management 
police said matterson shot the homes former bookkeeper two 
state officials who had been involved in regulating such homes and 
one of their relatives one victim remains hospitalized in serious 
condition 
the series of shootings spanned about 100 miles in new hampshire 
and maine in less than four hours saturday night and early sunday 
mccausland said 
matterson posed as a police officer during at least one of the 
shootings he said a police hat handcuffs flashlight and other 
items along with two pistols were recovered from mattersons car 
the shootings began in milton mills nh where the former 
bookkeeper howard hedegard 43 and his sisterinlaw patricia 
collins 27 of derry nh were shot at hedegards home 
hedegard said he peered out the window saw matterson at the door 
and knew something was wrong 
he asked me to come outside and i refused said hedegard 
then matterson turned and fired through the window wounding 
hedegard in the chin a second shot took off the tip of his finger 
collins received a slight leg wound and both were treated at 
frisbee memorial hospital in rochester 
mccausland said the next stop was in poland maine about 50 
miles east where william twarog 44 a regional administrator for 
the state mental retardation bureau was shot dead at his home 
it was twarogs job to monitor private group homes such as the 
one matterson had administered 
after that mccausland said matterson drove to topsham maine 
where he shot louis t dorogi 46 director of licensing for nursing 
homes in the state human services department in the kitchen of his 
home 
dorogi underwent emergency surgery at brunswick regional memorial 
hospital and is in serious condition in his state post he was in 
charge of inspection of stateaffiliated homes for compliance with 
medicaid standards said susan parker commissioner of mental health 
and retardation 
parker said management and financial problems came to light at 
the group home while matterson was administrator alan had trouble 
keeping track of the finances she said 
the search for the gunman began after new hampshire state police 
issued a report on the first shootings 
a gardiner maine police officer spotted his car and two state 
police cruisers took up the chase at speeds to 90 mph 
state troopers said they saw him brandish a gun and shoot 
himself said mccausland that sent his car careening off the road 
where it became briefly airborne before it landed in a field 
state officials were at a loss for an explanation 
i am totally shocked said parker the unfairness of it all 
makes me furious 
others said they had thought matterson might one day seek 
vengeance against those he held responsible for his dismissal 
people thought there would be some attempt to hurt people but 
not physically most people thought he would sue said peter 
kowalski executive director of john f murphy homes the nonprofit 
organization in lewiston that took over the facility

the supreme court today refused to give 
husbands the legal power to prevent their wives from having 
abortions 
the justices without comment let stand an indiana supreme court 
decision that a husband has no right to interfere with his wifes 
constitutional right to abort her pregnancy 
the court also told deposed philippine president ferdinand marcos 
and his wife imelda they must turn over subpoenaed records to a 
federal grand jury 
the state courts ruling in the abortion case last july was based 
directly on past rulings by the nations highest court 
erin andrew conn of elkhart ind went to court early last 
summer in an attempt to prevent his estranged wife jennifer from 
having an abortion she was about six weeks pregnant at the time 
a state trial judge issued a temporary order barring mrs conn 
from having the operation performed but a state appeals court threw 
out that order 
erin has no right to veto jennifers decision as such 
decision concerns only her the appeals court ruled 
the indiana supreme court acting on conns subsequent appeal 
then adopted the appeals court ruling as its own 
the state courts said conns attempt to block his wifes abortion 
was prohibited by prior supreme court rulings dating back to 1973 
when a landmark decision by the justices legalized abortion 
in 1976 the court struck down a missouri law requiring spousal 
consent before a woman could obtain an abortion during the first 12 
weeks of her pregnancy 
after the state supreme court ruling conn sought emergency help 
from chief justice william h rehnquist and justice john paul 
stevens both denied his request and the injunction prohibiting 
mrs conns abortion was lifted last july 22 
she subsequently obtained an abortion the conns are in the midst 
of divorce proceedings conns attorney james bopp of terre haute 
said a decree is expected within days 
in the appeal acted on today conn said the 1973 and 1976 rulings 
did not preclude state courts from taking a husbands rights into 
consideration on a casebycase basis 
the father has fundamental rights and interests in his unborn 
child which should be judicially considered on the facts of this 
case along with the rights and interests of his wife in aborting 
their child lawyers for conn argued 
the appeal which did not directly attack the courts previous 
abortion decisions said consideration of a husbands objections is 
justified by the traditional balancing approved by this court 
where competing rights collide 
lawyers for mrs conn called the appeal entirely without 
merit 
every appellate court to consider the issue has held that a man 
does not have the right to a court order enjoining a woman from 
exercising her abortion right they said this has been true in 
cases where the man seeking the court order was the womans 
husband 
the case is conn vs conn 88347 
in other cases the court 
denied the marcoses emergency request that they not be 
compelled to abide by a grand jurys demand for financial and other 
records related to an investigation of the couple charged with 
looting their nations treasury of more than 100 million 
a federal judge in new york where the grand jury is meeting 
ruled aug 11 that the marcoses must honor the subpoenas and no 
longer have immunity as ruler and first lady of a foreign country 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld the judges ruling oct 
19 
let stand an appellate ruling that the federal voting rights 
act designed to prevent racial discrimination applies to state 
judicial elections 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by louisiana 
officials who said the law is not intended to cover the judicial 
branch and could impair the independence of judges 
agreed to consider the constitutionality of a connecticut law 
aimed at assuring that beer sold in the state costs no more than it 
does in three neighboring states

opposition parties today 
demanded an inquiry into why the staterun television company helped 
finance an anticommunist film on which president pw bothas 
daughter was production coordinator 
the film back to freedom opened in south africa last week 
and has been panned by critics as an amateurish propaganda exercise 
the farright conservative party called for appointment of a 
commission to investigate the south african broadcasting corps 
involvement in the production 
parliament member dave dalling spokesman for the liberal 
progressive federal party said the film company involved was owned 
by a friend of president bothas dalling asked who authorized the 
sabc to provide more than 1 million to finance the film 
bothas daughter rozanne was production coordinator of the 
film but in the credits her last name is given as both instead 
of botha the films scriptwriter a university professor also used 
a pseudonym 
the controversy over the film was sparked by reports in sunday 
newspapers that the cabinet minister formerly in charge of the sabc 
alvyn schlebusch had recommended the corporation withhold the final 
installment of its payment to mimosa films more than 200000 
because the film was substandard 
according to the reports president botha overruled schlebusch 
and ordered the payment be made 
schlebusch subsequently resigned the cabinet minister who now 
oversees the sabc stoffel van der merve said the broadcasting 
companys involvement in the film was legitimate 
the sabc in return for its financing was to get all profits 
from domestic boxoffice receipts and half of overseas profits 
the movie plot is based loosely on the current civil war in 
angola in which south africanbacked rebels are fighting the 
soviet and cubansupported troops of angolas marxist government 
south african military equipment was used in the film and dozens 
of soldiers reportedly served as extras the sunday times newspaper 
said the script was believed to have been submitted to angolan rebel 
leader jonas savimbi for approval

the supreme court ruled 63 today that the 
state of arkansas can hold a second sentencing trial for a man 
mistakenly sent to prison as a habitual offender 
the court said a second trial would not violate the fifth 
amendments double jeopardy clause which protects a defendant from 
undergoing trial more than once for any single offense 
in this case johnny lee nelson pleaded guilty in 1982 of 
burglary and theft for taking 45 from a vending machine 
a jury sentenced him to 20 years in prison after prosecutors 
introduced evidence of four prior felony convictions four felony 
convictions triggers arkansas habitual offender law which allows 
sentences of 20 years to 40 years compared to 5 years to 20 years 
for nonhabitual offenders 
unbeknownst to the prosecutor or defense one of nelsons 
convictions had been pardoned but it wasnt until more than three 
years later after a petition filed by nelson from prison that a 
courtordered review discovered the error 
a lower federal court invalidated the habitual offender sentence 
and the 8th us circuit court of appeals affirmed the ruling which 
barred a retrial under the habitual offender law 
the state appealed seeking to have the sentence reinstated by 
introducig evidence of another conviction not introduced at the 
previous trial 
the majority opinion written by chief justice william h 
rehnquist reversed the lower courts rehnquist said it has long 
been settled that the double jeopardy clause does not prevent a 
retrial when a defendant wins a reversal due to some error in the 
proceedings leading to conviction 
permitting retrial in this instance is not the sort of 
government oppression at which the double jeopardy clause is aimed 
rather it serves the interest of the defendant by affording him a 
fair adjudication rehnquist said 
he added our holding today thus merely recreates the situation 
that would have been obtained if the trial court had excluded the 
evidence of the conviction because of the showing of a pardon 
in a dissent justice thurgood marshall said a retrial is 
squarely foreclosed in the case he noted that the high court 
ruled in 1978 that states may not retry defendants when prosecutors 
initially failed to present sufficient evidence of guilt 
he said if the state had offered proof of three convictions and a 
blank piece of paper to prove a fourth no one would doubt that 
arkansas had produced insufficient evidence and that the double 
jeopardy clause barred retrial 
joining rehnquist in the majority were justices byron r white 
john paul stevens sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony 
m kennedy marshall was joined by justices william j brennan and 
harry a blackmun 
the case is lockhart vs nelson 871277

along with congratulations the nations roman 
catholic bishops sent presidentelect george bush a reminder today 
they will speak out firmly on national issues and not only in 
praise and appreciation of white house policies 
as their annual meeting got under way the bishops also showed 
frustration bordering on irritation on an intrachurch matter a 
late intervention by the vatican that will keep them from voting on 
guidelines for resolving disputes with theologians 
the vatican action based on an objection that the guidelines 
suggest equality between theologians and bishops might be 
perceived as confrontational or as belittling the episcopal 
conference of bishops which i know is not intended said 
cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago he and other bishops said the 
complaint should have come much earlier 
the vote on the guidelines was put off until next june but the 
bishops will get another chance this week to publicly discuss their 
notalwaysharmonious relationship with the vatican a vote is 
scheduled for wednesday on a proposal concerning the authority of 
bishops conferences 
at the beginning of todays opening session the president of the 
national conference of catholic bishops archbishop john may of st 
louis declared they would stand with pope john paul ii in 
denouncing injustices and actions which foster disrespect for human 
life from abortion to the death penalty 
the reference is a pointed one since presidentelect bush 
campaigned for the presidency as a vigorous defender of capital 
punishment portraying rival michael dukakis as weak for taking the 
other side as well as a foe of abortion 
in recent years several of the bishops major statements have 
stirred controversy outside as well as inside the church 
particularly as they took issue with reagan administration policies 
on nuclear arms latin america and the us economy 
we are sometimes criticized for being too concerned about the 
world of pursuing an agenda that in the minds of some critics is 
secular leftist or in some way ideological may said but he 
said actions and statements by the pope have shown the bishops it is 
not possible to have too much social consciousness 
the bishops this week will consider a number of seemingly secular 
proposals including one calling on congress to ease a 1986 law and 
give legal standing to many more undocumented hispanic workers 
may indicated that if us catholics once kept quiet out of fear 
they would be accused of disloyalty to their government such 
attitudes are gone 
catholics in america have long since passed the time when we 
must prove ourselves to this country which we love he said now 
is the time to translate our teaching into action to build a more 
just nation and a more peaceful world 
may took a considerably more conciliatory stance on the main 
intrachurch matter the bishops will debate and vote on this week 
a proposal that they reject a draft vatican document that appears to 
undercut the theological authority of bishops organizations such as 
theirs 
the bishops proposed response uses such phrases as rigid and 
confusing and overly defensive and negative to describe the 
vatican draft and says it seems to be pretending to be a study but 
with its conclusions already determined 
still may said the bishops response has been portrayed 
incorrectly by the news media as if it signaled some sort of 
struggle with the holy see with all due respect for the creative 
imaginations of certain writers this is simply false 
may said the bishops were simply responding to the vaticans 
invitation for comment 
he said it is always a thankless office to give criticism 
even when asked and he said there has been no action by the body 
this year that is more profoundly obediential and respectful than 
the work on this document 
the pope has publicly supported the bishops national pastoral 
letters on nuclear arms and the us economy but there also has 
been criticism from top officials in the vatican who ask for whom 
the bishops were speaking and on what authority other critics have 
suggested the bishops were taking on issues that were none of their 
business 
but may said our people need to hear that the work we have 
begun on social issues whether on nuclear policy human rights 
or advocacy for the unborn the poor and the homeless will 
continue 
noting that the 300 or so bishops were meeting in the nations 
capital may said it was appropriate to congratulate bush and to 
assure him of the bishops continuing commitment to the 
commonweal 
but our voices will not be heard only in praise and 
appreciation he said 
among specific issues this week the bishops will 
hear a report from a special committee drafting a statement on 
aids an earlier document drew fire from some bishops partly 
because it seemed to approve condoms as a way of preventing the 
deadly disease 
call for greater religious liberty in eastern europe saying 
that despite the emergence of soviet glasnost or openness 
intimidation of religious dissenters continues

plo leaders today drafted a historic 
declaration to be presented to the groups parliamentinexile that 
implicitly recognizes israels right to exist 
several conference sources said they expected up to 85 percent of 
the 450 members of the palestine national council to endorse the 
document 
the councils political committee met behind closed doors to 
debate the wording of another part of the declaration a commitment 
distancing the palestine liberation organization from terrorism 
conference sources said 
the source who are on the drafting committee said they did not 
expect any differences over the draft but would not elaborate they 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the declaration sets out a new political strategy by endorsing 
un security council resolution 242 which recognizes israels 
right to exist thus satisfying one of washingtons key conditions 
for dealing with the plo the resolution also calls for israels 
withdrawal from territories occupied in the 1967 middle east war 
in washington president reagan said today that if the council 
does accept resolution 242 that would be some progress but he 
said there are other problems that remain to be solved before a 
breakthrough in the arab stance toward israel would be achieved he 
did not elaborate 
apparently there has been an indication theyre willing to 
abide by 242 reagan said in response to a reporters question 
i hope that is true because that would be some progress 
on tuesday the council is expected to end its extraordinary 
fourday meeting with a declaration of independence for the west 
bank and gaza strip where palestinians have for 11 months been 
revolting against israels 21year occupation 
in a radio interview today plo chief yasser arafat called the 
council meeting a turning point in the course of the palestinian 
struggle that will also influence events and developments in the 
arab world 
he praised the council for what he called its democratic 
spirit and criticized opponents of the latest palestinian moves 
towards peace without mentioning any specific names or groups as 
swimmers against the current of history the radio monte carlo 
interview was monitored in nicosia cyprus 
the independence declaration plo spokesman ahmed abdulrahman 
and other officials said already has been drafted another draft 
document proposes the formation of a provisional government to 
negotiate peace 
in closeddoor committee meetings there had been strong 
opposition to resolution 242 from the plos marxistoriented groups 
particularly george habashs popular front for the liberation of 
palestine 
but habashs faction the secondlargest of the eight groups 
comprising the plo agreed sunday to go with the rule of the 
majority a spokesman said 
arafat had hoped for a consensus on resolution 242 to avert 
further splits within his guerrilla movement and in the national 
council which first assembled in 1964 
president reagan asked if he was pleased with the plo leaders 
action said sunday in washington were still looking at that 
thats all i can say 
in another development abul abbas the palestinian who 
masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the italian cruise ship achille 
lauro made light of the killing of new yorker leon klinghoffer 
during the ordeal the new york times reported in todays editions 
klinghoffer a 69yearold wheelchairbound passenger was shot 
and pushed overboard 
maybe he was trying to swim for it the times quoted abbas as 
telling reporters outside the hall where the council is meeting 
abbas compared the hijacking to driving a car and said you have an 
accident on the way accidents happen 
arafat is hoping political moderation coupled with increasing 
sympathy for the palestinian cause brought on by the palestinian 
uprising will eventually lead to an international peace conference 
on the arabisraeli conflict 
the conflict in the occupied territories has left at least 311 
palestinians and 11 israelis dead since it began dec 8 
the national councils acceptance of resolution 242 would meet 
one of the conditions for us recognition of the plo 
previously the plo had explicitly rejected resolution 242 which 
calls for israels withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967 and 
for the right of all states in the region to live in peace within 
secure and recognized borders an implicit recognition of israel

democratic rep kenneth buddy mackay the 
loser by a narrow margin to republican connie mack in the race for 
the us senate has demanded a recount in five of the states 
biggest counties 
the protest filed sunday was accompanied by charts showing that 
in the contested counties a much larger percentage of people than 
usual voted for president but cast no vote in the senate race nov 8 
the recount is being sought in hillsborough dade broward 
orange and palm beach counties where mackay contends about 170000 
votes were not reported mackay won all five counties but by smaller 
margins than his staff anticipated 
attorneys for mack said they will ask the canvassing boards in 
the five counties to reject mackays request 
mack attorney gregg thomas said the dropoff in voters 
participating in the senate race could have been caused by the 
position of the race on the ballot people being turned off by the 
hotly contested race or confusion over the similarity in the 
candidates names 
mackay attorney steve uhlfelder said the congressman isnt yet 
alleging fraud 
nearly complete but unofficial returns compiled by the associated 
press show mack with 2044575 votes and mackay with 2014924 
the panama city newsherald reported sunday that bay county the 
last county remaining had completed counting absentee ballots 
giving mack 2048356 votes to 2016828 votes for mackay a margin 
of 31528 for mack 
if the recounts disclose potential fraud or gross irregularities 
uhlfelder said mackay has until 10 days after the election to file 
a lawsuit contesting the vote 
mack campaign spokesman mark mills said further pursuit of a 
recount by mackay looks like sour grapes and could tarnish his 
good reputation in the state

wearing a button proclaiming life 
begins at 40 prince charles celebrated his 40th birthday today 
with the innercity young people whose cause he has championed 
during his long wait to ascend the british throne 
obviously enjoying the daylong public celebrations the prince 
launched a nationwide appeal to raise 72 million for the princes 
youth business trust which helps unemployed young people establish 
their own businesses the government has agreed to match donations 
up to that level 
to cheers and laughter charles delivered a parody of some of his 
own more eccentric interests particularly the notion that he 
regularly consults the plants in his gardens 
he said that before he came to birmingham an entire bed of 
oldfashioned roses were forced to listen to my demented 
ramblings on the meaning of the universe as i sat crosslegged in 
the lotus position on the gravel paths in front of them 
charles said the life begins at 40 button was a present from 
his two young sons prince william 6 and prince harry 4 
as he crosses into middle age the heir to the british throne 
who has no constitutionally defined job has carved his own role 
as crusader for the underprivileged and protector of the environment 
on the eve of the princes birthday one of his close associates 
tom shebbeare said charles is irritated by the news medias 
obsession with peddling what he called tittletattle and fiction 
about charles private life which he said distracts from the 
princes serious work 
hundreds of wellwishers cheered and sang happy birthday dear 
charlie when the heir to the british throne arrived in birmingham 
later today he was to attend a glittering buckingham palace ball 
as charles was en route to birmingham the defense ministry 
awarded him the double promotion the ranks are ceremonial the 
prince ended his active career with britains armed services in 1976 
charles chose the princes trust which he established in 1976 
to help disadvantaged youths find jobs to organize his public 
birthday celebration in birmingham britains secondlargest city 
shebbeare director of the princes trust said in an interview 
published sunday in the observer newspaper that the prince had 
decided not to give an interview himself because he didnt want to 
get involved in the hype surrounding his birthday 
he is now pretty determined that he has departed on an 
interesting and useful role as the prince of wales and that his 
interventions into areas of public life are things that he can do 
usefully for the nation shebbeare was quoted as saying 
after years of being picked on by the tabloid press which has 
accused him of everything from eccentricity to failing as a husband 
charles has recently been lauded as charismatic and a great 
communicator 
the new media appraisal followed a 70minute television attack on 
modern architectural development including central birmingham 
which charles said had been turned into a monstrous concrete maze in 
which only cars could find their way people didnt stand a 
chance he said 
the prince has been expressing his views with greater 
determination on other issues as well the creation of jobs and 
businesses the building of homes that people would like to live in 
the protection of the environment and a united europe where 
individual countries retain their own languages and culture 
but there are other sides to the 21st prince of wales 
theres the action man who loves polo and skiing who plummetted 
into the ocean in a tangled parachute and who skied clear of an 
avalanche that killed one of his best friends 
theres the father who played at the seaside in the spanish 
resort of majorca with his sons and who took them to their first 
fox hunt on saturday enraging animal rights activists 
theres the husband whose relationship with his wife diana 
repeatedly named one of the most beautiful and bestdressed women in 
the world is chronicled daily in the tabloid press regardless of 
any factual basis 
charles birthday ball was to be attended by 300 guests 
including members of the royal family and king olav of norway

forklifts laden with cases of new beaujolais rushed 
across the tarmac at charles de gaulle airport monday to load the 
wine onto cargo jets bound for bon vivants around the world 
under french law beaujolais primeur is not to be uncorked 
until 1201 am thursday and customs officials kept an eye on 
loading operations to make sure not one drop was consumed before its 
time 
pallets weighing four tons each were lifted through the open nose 
of the air france boeing 747 bound for new york about 72000 
bottles were on a 10 am flight that was delayed two hours because 
of a mechanics strike 
other cartons were destined for portland ore phoenix san 
francisco los angeles ketchum idaho and dozens of other american 
cities 
the us market represents about 10 percent of all beaujolais 
sales west germany switzerland and britain combined take about 60 
percent of the new wine the fastest growing market is japan 
a japan air lines cargo plane was prepared for takeoff carrying 
the pride of dozens of beaujolais vinters while workers rushed to 
load a korean airlines jet parked between the jal and air france 
planes 
for their compatriots far from home air france flights were also 
carrying wine to french overseas territories such as the island of 
reunion 
a delay of a day or two is disastrous according to air 
france spokesman raymond courtat who said the airline would ship 
330 tons of wine on monday and a similar amount tuesday the most 
difficult part is moving fast yet safely 
trucks from the beaujolais region began arriving about 4 am at 
the airport while other trucks carried wine to ports on the english 
channel for shipment to england and still others hit the highway for 
european points 
beaujolais vintners in central france will produce an estimated 
79 million gallons of the simple fruity and relatively inexpensive 
wine 
unlike aged wines primeur beaujolais is ready for drinking about 
six weeks after harvest and meant to be consumed in the months 
immediately after its midnovember release after that it rapidly 
loses its flavor 
the early selling wine accounts for about 55 percent of the 
beaujolais crop this year compared with about 6 percent two decades

the environmental community backed by polls 
showing americans want cleaner air water and soil is looking to 
george bush to put presidential substance behind his proenvironment 
campaign pledges 
proclaiming himself an environmentalist is not enough says 
robert sangeorge the national audubon societys vice president for 
public affairs now is the time for action hes got a lot to 
prove 
bush declaring that i am an environmentalist set himself a 
broad environmental agenda during the campaign promising action 
against global warming air and ocean pollution toxic waste and 
loss of wetlands 
if he specifically proposes to congress half of what hes 
promised in the campaign hell have a hell of an environmental 
record says gaylord nelson counselor to the wilderness society 
bushs statements represented a repudiation of many of the 
policies that kept the reagan administration and the 
environmentconservation lobby fighting for eight years his 
campaign ads about the filthy waters of boston harbor put 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis on the defensive 
both candidates ran as environmentalists elevating the issue to 
a higher level than in previous presidential races as they played to 
an increasingly popular cause 
a gallup poll released two days before bushs election said 65 
percent of the respondents republicans and democrats said 
proposing laws to increase protection of the environment should 
be the next presidents top priority 
the reason bush got so many votes was because he did eliminate 
some of the skepticism about his earlier environmental stands 
said nancy light of the sierra club 
she and other environmentalists said in interviews last week with 
the associated press that the skepticism came from bushs role early 
in the reagan years directing the effort to scrap federal 
regulations including some sacred to the environmental movement 
bush worked to overcome this by strong although mainly 
generalized statements in favor of a better environment 
in many ways bush set up the expectation hes going to be the 
best environmental president since teddy roosevelt said rick hind 
of us public interest research group but his past leaves us 
puzzled as to whether he will live up to this expectation 
he made a lot of promises and commitments said dan becker of 
environmental action it would be cynical for him to turn his back 
on them 
they and others say the nation wont have to wait until bush 
assumes office jan 20 to get a sense of his environmental direction 
the clearest indications will be the appointments he makes to 
the key environmental posts said brent blackwelder of the 
environmental policy institute 
these jobs are the secretaries of the interior and energy and the 
administrator of the environmental protection agency 
he needs to put in people who are not like the james watt 
wrecking crew said david baker of friends of the earth referring 
to president reagans first and highly controversial interior 
secretary 
fred krupp executive director of the environmental defense fund 
praised bushs first cabinet choice james a baker iii as secretary 
of state he said that as treasury secretary baker was instrumental 
in pushing international lending agencies to pay attention to the 
environmental consequences of their third world loans 
krupp sees the top job at the state department as a post growing 
in environmental importance because of worldwide problems such as 
global warming the greenhouse effect overrides all other 
environmental problems it is in a class with preventing nuclear 
war 
environmentalists ticked off a long list of items they say needs 
leadership from the new administration better toxic waste control 
protection of ground water a strengthened clean air act a national 
energy policy that puts conservation and safe clean alternatives 
ahead of petroleum and coal cleaner oceans and rivers better 
management of public lands 
nelson a former democratic senator from wisconsin says what 
bush does about the environment could be the most important legacy 
of his presidency 
it could put him down in history as a great leader nelson 
said 
after its struggles with the reagan administration the 
environmental community is taking a deep breath and looking ahead 
even if bush wasnt the first choice of many of its leaders 
after ronald reagan said sangeorge it cant get any worse

the supreme court on monday agreed to hear 
arguments on whether all investors claims against brokers must be 
settled by binding arbitration 
seventeen firsttime investors brought the case to challenge 
standard brokerage contracts that order arbitration to settle all 
disputes unless the clauses can be enforced investors could sue 
their brokers in court 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the arbitration 
language a decision that reversed a lower federal court in 
brownsville texas the lower court said some of the claims could 
not be arbitrated 
the investors some of whom could not understand english 
included minors widows and people dying of cancer 
they opened securities accounts in 1982 and 1983 with the 
shearson lehman hutton office in brownsville doing business with 
account manager jon grady deaton 
the investors claimed deaton mismanaged separate accounts 
totaling some 190000 and conducted unauthorized transactions to 
generate commissions and profits 
shearson filed a motion in federal court to enforce the 
arbitration agreements in the contracts but the district court 
cited a 1953 case in which the supreme court ruled an agreement to 
arbitrate certain claims was unenforceable under a 1933 securities 
law 
the company appealed on ground that in a 1987 case the high 
court ruled that claims against brokers could be arbitrated in a 
1934 law the appellate court agreed with shearson 
the investors then appealed to the supreme court shearson agreed 
that the high court should hear the case to clear up conflicts among 
appellate courts on the issue 
the case is de quijas ofelia r et al vs shearson american

prince charles donned a life begins 
at 40 button and poked fun at his eccentric image monday as he 
celebrated his birthday with 1500 youths he has helped overcome 
poverty and unemployment 
youve given me one of the best birthday parties i could ever 
have hoped for the heir to the throne declared after a day that 
included champagne toasts birthday cakes renditions of happy 
birthday and a princely bit of disco dancing with three of his 
guests 
a ball at buckingham palace for friends and family was scheduled 
for the evening 
charles used his 40th birthday to launch an appeal for 70 
million for the princes youth business trust a charity that gives 
seed money and professional advice to unemployed people aged 18 to 
25 who want to start their own business 
he chose birmingham britains secondlargest city and spent the 
day visiting projects partly financed by his various charities 
he went to handsworth an inner city district torn by race riots 
in 1985 to inspect grove lane baths which is being converted into 
a community center 
then he continued to the old tram depot which has been made into 
a transport museum it was festooned with flags balloons and 
antique gaslamps an old doubledecker bus bore the number 40 and 
the words happy birthday prince charles 
in the cavernous tram depot the prince was serenaded by calypso 
and rock bands and by hundreds of young people singing a specially 
composed paean to charles thank you for showing where the road 
can lead if we put our mind to it in time we will succeed 
his mother queen elizabeth ii is in good health at 62 and he 
expects a long wait before being crowned king charles iii 
meanwhile his search for a meaningful role has transformed him into 
a compelling spokesman for britains needy youth and a critic of 
environmental neglect 
he also has a penchant for alternative medicine vegetarianism 
talking to his plants and sojourning among the bushmen of the 
kalahari desert he regards this simply as a measure of his 
openmindedness and is known to be angry at the way some newspapers 
here have exploited his foibles to question his sanity 
his speech in birmingham was a carefully crafted riposte 
frequently interrupted by laughter and cheers 
only the other day i was inquiring of an entire bed of 
oldfashioned roses who were forced to listen to my dementing 
ramblings on the meaning of the universe as i sat crosslegged in 
the lotus position on the gravel path in front of me he said 
and i was inquiring of them what they thought would happen on 
my birthday in a birmingham tram shed a tram shed they all 
replied totally aghast at the thought yes i said a tram shed 
at this point a row of prize welsh leeks cocky little things 
which were lurking in a nearby vegetable patch chipped in to say 
that they expected the shed would be filled with groups of 
seminaked kalahari bushmen and also a troupe or two of tibetan 
buddhist monks armed with advance copies of the tabloid 
newspapers which would be strewn in my path in a form of ancient 
buddhist greeting 
but looking around here ladies and gentlemen i see those 
idiotic plants have got it wrong again i knew they would instead 
youve given me one of the best birthday parties i could ever have 
hoped for 
gesturing to his lapel button which he said was given to him by 
his two small sons he said im not sure i ought to be reminded 
of it but my children reminded me of it just this day 
of the charities he runs he said i never imagined for one 
minute that they would become big enough to start giving expensive 
birthday parties like this one but its all i can assure you 
extremely rewarding and encouraging if you can see just one persons 
life transformed by this means

president reagan welcoming andrei d sakharov 
at the white house said today human rights will remain an irritant 
in ussoviet relations until all political prisoners are released 
weve had great success reagan said as he praised soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev as more cooperative than any kremlin 
leader before him 
but reagan said we can only wait and see if gorbachev makes 
good on a promise to release all political prisoners 
sakharov told the president as they posed for pictures that 
there are only individuals left in jails the nobel laureate and 
human rights activist spoke through an american interpreter 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that during their 
meeting sakharov was very thankful to reagan for what he had 
done on behalf of human rights and for him and his wife 
sakharov however also voiced concern about the impact that 
reagans star wars missile defense program would have on efforts 
by the superpowers to negotiate a cut in longrange nuclear missile 
stockpiles 
these statements led reagan to talk about the insurance 
policy concept behind development of the strategic defense 
initiative according to fitzwater who also said that the president 
told sakharov that while there is a treaty to ban chemical weapons 
we still keep our gas masks 
sakharov says the west should worry more about the possibility 
that gorbachev will fail in his bid to transform soviet society and 
less about whether the changes will strengthen the communist nation 
sakharov the soviet nobel peace prizewinning physicist and 
longtime spokesman for political prisoners and dissidents told 
those honoring him sunday at a national academy of sciences banquet 
that the effects of perestroika the ambitious economic 
restructuring pursued by gorbachev will ripple throughout the 
world 
he said some have suggested that the soviet union could pose an 
even greater threat to the west if the soviet economy is 
strengthened 
i always answer that question this way he said through an 
interpreter the threat to the west of perestroika doesnt 
consist of its success but of its bloody failure this would be a 
total calamity 
the program pushed by gorbachev the soviet general secretary 
includes greater freedoms and movement away from a centrally 
controlled economy 
i believe we are undergoing historic events whose significance 
extends beyond our country to the whole world said sakharov 
sakharov 67 was sent to internal exile in the soviet city of 
gorky in 1980 after criticizing the soviet invasion of afghanistan 
and the immigration policies of his country gorbachev freed him two 
years ago 
sakharov first made his mark as a physicist whose original 
concepts in subatomic particles attracted world attention among 
scientists he is considered the father of the soviet hydrogen bomb 
frank press president of the national academy of sciences told 
the banquet guests that sakharov was inducted into the american 
academy in 1973 as an associate member but unlike other members 
sakharov had never been allowed to come to the united states to sign 
the membership book 
while guests applauded the soviet scientist strolled to the 
large redbound ledger and signed his name 
sakharov said that during his long years of exile the american 
academy members supported me unequivocally 
this is a fact i can never let myself forget he said 
the 100 guests who attended the banquet included other soviet 
scientists noted american physicists physicians arms control 
negotiators human rights advocates and government officials 
sakharov is in washington to attend the first meeting of the 
international foundation for the survival and development of 
humanity the foundation was organized by us and soviet scientists 
to address social and scientific problems that affect mankind

a yearlong review of the militarys treatment 
of its female personnel ended monday with the army announcing it was 
opening 11138 new jobs to women pentagon officials said 
the decision when combined with previous moves by the navy air 
force and marine corps brings to more than 24000 the number of 
previously closed positions opened to women since the review began 
in october 1987 
i think the overall message is that the secretary of defense 
is firmly committed to opening all positions to women that are 
compatible with existing laws and statutues said dr david j 
armor the principal deputy assistant secretary for manpower 
armor said the decision indicates the pentagons commitment to 
maximize womens opportunities in the military 
currently women comprise 104 percent of the us armed forces 
or about 217400 enlisted personnel and officers of the 21 million 
total 
armor declined to predict whether opening additional positions to 
women might attract more female recruits in the army for 
example we have 50 percent of the army positions open to women but 
i dont think well ever have 50 percent of those positions filled 
by women because it requires the people to volunteer 
armor appeared at a pentagon briefing to announce completion of 
the work of the dod task force on women in the military a panel 
formed in october 1987 after another advisory committee reported 
strong evidence of sexual harassment and abuse in the navy and 
marine corps 
defense secretary frank c carlucci in reviewing task force 
findings last january ordered a new educational effort to attack 
sexual harassment he also ordered all four services to adopt the 
same risk analysis rule for determining if particular jobs 
should be closed to women 
the task force found that while roughly 50 percent of military 
personnel were assigned to combat positions which by law must be 
filled by men and roughly 50 percent were in noncombat support 
jobs there were thousands of jobs in the middle that required 
judgment calls that frequently went against women 
each of the services had a way of designating positions 
armor said that led to situations where a reconnaissance aircraft 
in the navy was closed but it was open in the air force so what 
weve really done here is adopted the same value in evaluating 
risk 
the new rule specifies that a particular job or military 
occupation should be judged not on the basis of the skills involved 
or the unit to which it is now assigned but on whether the position 
would expose an individual to the same risk of hostile fire as a 
combat job 
applying that standard the navy previously had opened new jobs 
to women aboard logistic support ships the air force had opened 
positions in its red horse civil engineering units and surveillance 
aircraft like the tr1 and u2 spy planes and the marine corps had 
opened slots within its embassy guard force and base security forces 
the army positions opened on monday include jobs within a 
specialty that involves constructing electrical power systems to 
support rear headquarter units some additional jobs in the engineer 
combat support equipment companies and many new positions within 
the headquarters staff of combat units 
such headquarters operations would be set up well behind the line 
of fighting where the risk of combat exposure is not that great the 
army decided

doctors are attacking heart disease with a 
variety of tiny new devices that shave sand or burn away fatty 
deposits that clog the arteries according to reports monday 
this is in its infancy said dr george beller of the 
university of virginia progress is being made by leaps and 
bounds we are starting to see the first trials in patients 
all of the gadgets being developed are intended to burrow through 
plugged heart arteries and blast away the fatty buildups that choke 
off the flow of blood and cause heart attacks 
they were described monday at the annual meeting of the american 
heart association an estimated 30000 people are attending the 
fourday meeting 
all of the devices are intended to replace or improve balloon 
angioplasty this treatment performed on 184000 people last year 
is one of the nations most common medical procedures 
during angioplasty doctors thread a tiny balloon through an 
artery into the heart there its inflated squeezing open the 
narrowed blood vessel however in about 30 percent of cases the 
vessel soon closes shut again 
doctors hope the new tools will solve this problem the devices 
have been tested on numbers ranging from about 50 to more than 200 
patients while these initial results show they can open up clogged 
arteries more followup will be necessary before doctors know 
whether the longterm success is any better than with balloon 
angioplasty 
the new devices include 
shaver catheter this device works something like a miniature 
electric razor anything on the vessel walls that contacts the 
catheters whirling blades is sliced off and removed 
rotablator this is a diamondcoated burr similar to a dentists 
drill it literally polishes and sands the inside of a diseased 
vessel said dr robert ginsburg of stanford university 
hottipped laser this metal point is heated by a laser it 
burns away the fatty deposits 
smart laser this approach uses a laser beam directly to burn 
the deposits earlier attempts failed because the pinpoint beam 
burned holes in the artery now doctors are marking the fat first 
with specific colors then using lasers that only attack those 
colors 
laser and balloon in this technique doctors open up the artery 
with a balloon then they use relatively low levels of laser heat to 
seal off tears in the vessel wall and they hope prevent it from 
squeezing shut again 
in addition several reports at the meeting describe the use of 
mesh tubes that are pushed into the newly opened blood vessels the 
goal is to hold the blood vessels open after angioplasty 
of the devices described the shaver catheter has been tested 
most widely used on about 230 heart patients at several hospitals 
its developer dr john b simpson of sequoia hospital in redwood 
city calif predicted that it will be approved for widespread use 
in about a year doctors working with other devices said as much as 
five years more testing may be required before they can be employed 
routinely 
several experts said they doubt the devices will replace the need 
for coronary bypass surgery a common technique in which blood is 
detoured around plugged arteries

the 45 yearround residents of this 
rockbound island are putting their highly prized privacy on the line 
and allowing telephones in their homes in an effort to guarantee 
their future 
the survival of the communitys at stake here said belvia 
macdonald who led efforts to bring phones to the island but wont 
get one herself i like the quietness and theyre going to put in 
a phone booth i can use 
macdonald who has lived with her lobsterman husband on the 
rugged island for more than three decades said isle au haut needs 
new residents to keep businesses viable and the post office and 
oneroom schoolhouse open 
telephones could be an incentive for people considering living on 
isle au haut one of about 2000 islands along maines jagged coast 
and perhaps the last new england town without service 
while there have been only minor fluctuations in the islands 
population residents are getting concerned about an impending loss 
as the core of yearround residents ages a few older people already 
have moved off the island over the last couple of years to be closer 
to medical facilities 
rocky and guarded at one end by 500foot cliffs isle au hauts 
residents are proud of their spirit of selfreliance required for 
the sometimes harsh environment and isolation 
people out here enjoy this remote living without the worries 
and hassles of a more normal environment said louis bud 
blaisdell a town selectman 
while some do not relish the arrival of phones they prefer that 
intrusion to the prospect of losing their way of life 
crime is unheard of virtually every adult pitches in with some 
civic service such as volunteer firefighter or town selectman in 
summer practically everyone from the youngest child to elderly 
folks join in evening softball games 
any problem of any sort people will cooperate and help 
theyre very sensitive to others problems blaisdell said its 
like a large family 
electrical service was introduced only 18 years ago to the 
fishing community also as a hedge against population loss the 
islanders power cooperative hooked up to the mainland grid by an 
undersea cable in 1982 
to a visitor the utility poles running and a car or pickup truck 
that occasionally rolls by are the only clues that the 20th century 
has arrived on the six by threemile isle au haut french for high 
island 
it may be the last town in maine and possibly new england to be 
without telephone service said bill black of the maine public 
advocates office which was involved in efforts to bring phone 
service to the island 
efforts began two years ago when a telephone committee found 
that 88 percent of the residents wanted the service initial efforts 
to find a supplier failed companies said the project would be too 
expensive but in june jeffrey v webber founder and president of 
the tiny island telephone co came forward 
webber set up a similar service a few years ago for the maine 
island of frenchboro and can provide it to isle au haut for an 
estimated 180000 
the microwave towers are to be erected this week 
sixteen homes have been connected to phone lines and can 
communicate among themselves and webber said full service off the 
island should be in place by thanksgiving if they dont get it 
with their turkey theyll get a bow on it this christmas he said 
im pretty much against the phones though were going to get 
one said lori jablon a teachers aide you cant pretend they 
dont exist 
the islands more than 300 summer residents are likewise split 
but have supported community efforts to provide service 
blaisdell a retired engineer who made due for years without 
running water welcomes the new technology to call his son in 
florida he now must drive to the dock and board the mailboat for a 
40minute ride to the island of stonington to the nearest pay phone 
tina tully one of the first islanders to get a phone described 
her first call as wonderful 
her federally licensed radio phone has been the islands only 
dependable telecommunications link with the world but she said her 
neighbors have always respected her familys privacy and seldom 
asked to use it 
citizens band radios used sometimes in the past are impersonal 
and their signals are often drowned out by static residents say 
none of the islanders interviewed could recall a situation in 
which a phone would have made the difference between life or death 
and no one knows how life will change when the full system is up 
but so far tully said it hasnt done anything but make life 
easier

in one corner dozens of sudanese 
dervishes stand ready to defend khartoum against british cavalry 
nearby are abyssinian tribesmen poised to fight off mussolinis 
invasion 
and just around the corner zulu warriors armed with shields and 
spears fight boer settlers for the plains of south africa 
all in new jersey where about 1000 collectors of military 
miniatures gathered sunday to trade sell or admire detailed 
replicas of armies and weaponry 
there seems to be less interest this year in mainstream armies 
like the british and french mused tom fallon a clinical 
psychologist from boston who paints the intricate uniforms on the 
tiny armies he sells during weekends id say the english civil 
war and the boer war are the most popular this year 
fallons wares included a regiment of imperial chinese troops 
from the boxer rebellion of the 1890s and belgian soldiers from 
world war i 
in many ways the more obscure the conflict the greater the 
value to the collector he said but we that is collectors are 
not militarists we do this so that we can remember the mistakes of 
the past so that we do not repeat them 
bill lango a collector and vendor from north bergen said he 
began collecting miniatures in 1965 
i wanted to get the toys i had as a kid back from my parents 
but we moved around a lot and they threw the stuff out along the 
way he said so my wife and i started going to antique shops on 
the weekends and it kind of became a habit 
but its peaceful habit he said we think of ourselves more 
like people who trade baseball cards than warlike 
collecting soldiers according to vincent vernon of bardstown 
ky can be traced to ancient egypt louis xiv had an army of toy 
soldiers as a child and napoleon used toy soldiers to plan 
conquests

police today found a sixth corpse 
buried in the yard of a treeshaded victorian rooming house whose 
landlady is suspected of killing the elderly boarders for their 
social security checks 
investigators believe seven or eight bodies may have been buried 
based on the number of residents missing said homicide lt joe 
enloe 
detectives sought dorothea montalvo puente 59 for investigation 
of murder enloe said the landlady was interviewed friday by police 
after the first body was discovered but was released for lack of 
evidence 
the woman apparently had been regularly cashing some of the 
victims social security checks for several months he said 
sgt bob burns said the sixth corpse was found under a metal 
shed wrapped in clothing police used picks and shovels today and 
will use a backhoe to dig up the rest of the yard burns said 
puente was convicted in 1982 of grand theft and imprisoned for 
drugging three elderly people and taking their possessions after 
meeting them in bars police said she served 2 years of a 
fiveyear sentence before being paroled officials said 
the boardinghouse is not a nursing home and did not require a 
license 
the first body was discovered friday and was followed by the 
unearthing of two more bodies saturday and two others sunday 
after uncovering the fifth body police arrested john mccauley 
59 on suspicion of being an accessory to the homicides mccauley a 
resident at the boardinghouse was arrested after he gave 
conflicting information enloe said 
we do not believe that this could have been done solely by 
herself enloe said we know shes had people help her dig the 
holes 
police were unable to determine the identities of the victims or 
how they died because four of the bodies were wrapped in cloth or 
plastic investigators said they were able to determine the sex of 
only the first body wrapped like a mummy and described as a 
grayhaired woman 
the bodies all found in the fetal position showed no signs of 
trauma according to police who said autopies would be performed 
enloe said evidence was discovered in the graves linking puente 
to the deaths but he declined to elaborate 
part of the reason we have probable cause for her arrest is 
because weve been digging for two days and weve discovered 
things he said 
an allpoints bulletin was issued for puente and she remained at 
large today she had not been charged but enloe said an arrest 
warrant was being prepared for her for investigation of murder 
investigators also were seeking access to her bank records 
until we get a search warrant until we get in her bank 
account find out whats in there identify who these people are and 
try to show she changed their money its still guesswork enloe 
said 
on saturday investigators cordoned off the twostory home and 
yard in the citys northeast section about one mile from the state 
capitol and used picks shovels and an earthmover to excavate the 
yard 
for months neighbors had complained of a stench coming from the 
site and were told a fish emulsion had been used there as a 
fertilizer police said 
the first time was about the middle of last may said 
neighbor will mcintire we couldnt stand it it definitely was 
something dead it had a sweet sickly smell 
neighbors said puente often shouted at passersby to stay off her 
lawn 
if somebody walked on her lawn shed cuss at them in language 
that would make a sailor blush mcintire said 
police went to the house last monday after neighbors reported 
former tenant bert montoya had been missing since august puente 
told investigators montoya had moved back to his home in mexico 
officials said 
puente was very cooperative with police enloe said 
we came over and asked her if we could dig in her yard he 
said we said you dont have to let us dig in your yard she 
said dig in the yard i dont know whats out there

four mornings a week without a word 
or glance mario haro and alejandra arellano munoz exchange a 
2yearold girl who has become a symbol in the controversy over 
surrogate motherhood 
critics point to their case as an example of how third world 
mothers can be exploited as breeders for people from affluent 
countries 
ms arellano munoz 22 a single mother of three from a small 
town near mazatlan mexico and haros wife nattie are cousins 
when the haros couldnt conceive a child they brought her cousin 
from mexico to help them 
arellano munoz impregnated artificially with haros sperm says 
she believed she would carry the embryo just three weeks and then it 
would be transplanted to mrs haro 
when she found out otherwise she vowed to keep the child lydia 
michelle a handwritten surrogacy contract paying 1500 far below 
the market 10000 surrogacy payment was discredited a judge 
awarded joint custody 
its only a matter of time before we start crossing more borders 
and start hiring third world breeders for families in this 
country said matt pawa legislative liaison for the national 
coalition against surrogacy a washingtonbased advocacy group that 
has followed the case 
the haros also born in mexico live in a fourbedroom house in 
chula vista he is a 35yearold teacher she is a former bank 
employee 
i think their the haros position has been that they have 
more money theyre more educated and therefore they have better 
parenting skills said lawyer harvey e berman who represented 
arellano munoz in court last year fortunately we dont rate 
parents abilities by how much money they have 
arellano munoz a former cleaning woman has a thirdgrade 
education she supports her two other children with 50 a month from 
the haros and charitable gifts she shares an apartment here with 
several other women 
another court hearing is scheduled after lydias third birthday 
in july to determine her immediate future 
i think she lydia needs to be in a stable home not bounding 
around said mrs haro 38 who has a 20yearold daughter from a 
previous marriage i wish that she would just give us custody 
she has two other children to keep her occupied 
arellano munoz declined to be interviewed in an interview last 
year she complained i am ignored as the mother 
they would like her to disappear said gena corea a boston 
author and critic of surrogate motherhood she was supposed to be 
a breeder a package that would just deliver this baby and 
disappear so its really inconvenient that theres this human being 
here

an animal rights activist accused of 
planting a bomb in an attempt to kill the head of a surgical 
instruments company may have been supplied with the explosive device 
by a terrorist group a newspaper reported 
the activist fran stephanie trutt 33 of new york city was 
arraigned in superior court today on charges of attempted murder 
possession of explosives and manufacturing a bomb she was being 
held on 500000 bail 
trutt did not enter enter a plea or speak during the appearance 
and was scheduled for another hearing nov 29 judge edward leavitt 
refused to lower bail 
trutt was arrested friday and accused of hiding a powerful 
radiocontrolled pipe bomb packed with roofing nails in bushes at 
the headquarters of us surgical corp near the vacant parking 
space of chairman leon hirsch 
the sunday advocate of stamford quoted an unidentified source as 
saying that police and the fbi are convinced that ms trutt could 
not have made the sophisticated bomb herself and that they believe a 
terrorist group supplied the device 
three more bombs were discovered in trutts apartment after her 
arrest 
theyre not nuclear weapons a source told the newspaper 
but the bombs are unique for their electronics 
the new york city police departments terrorist task force has 
joined the fbi in the investigation into the manufacture of the 
bombs said spokeswoman sgt diane kubler 
assistant states attorney harry katz had no comment today on the 
published reports 
animal rights activists have disavowed trutt saying that she is 
not a member of their groups 
the norwalk company manufactures surgical staplers which close 
incisions without stitches and demonstrates the devices on 
anesthetized dogs 
trutt had a remotecontrol device in her hands that was to be 
used to detonate the footlong pipe bomb when she was arrested 
police said about 200 people were working in the plant overnight at 
the time 
the three nailwrapped bombs found in trutts basement apartment 
were fashioned from plumbing pipes and certainly would have 
destroyed the entire building and damaged surrounding houses said 
police deputy inspector vincent tarone 
the new yorkbased fund for animals filed a complaint over the 
experiments with the state department of health services which 
rejected the complaint last month 
trutts parents mary and harry trutt of new hyde park ny 
said their daughter told them in a telephone call from the jail 
saturday that she was set up by friends who then tipped police 
in an interview with newsday the trutts said their daughter who 
graduated from adelphi university and has a teaching certificate 
had no mechanical schooling and couldnt possibly have assembled the 
bombs 
she cared deeply about animals often picking up strays and 
nursing them back to health the trutts said she would never 
never under any circumstance hurt anyone or do anything to harm 
anybody mrs trutt said

opposition parties monday 
demanded an inquiry into why state television helped finance an 
anticommunist war film for which president pw bothas daughter 
was production coordinator 
the film back to freedom opened in south africa last week and 
has been panned by critics as an amateurish propaganda exercise 
the farright conservative party called for a commission to 
investigate the south african broadcasting corps involvement in 
the production 
parliament member dave dalling media spokesman for the liberal 
progressive federal party said the film company involved was owned 
by a friend of president botha dalling asked who authorized the 
corporation to provide more than 1 million to finance the film 
bothas daughter rozanne coordinated production of the film 
but in the credits her last name is given as both instead of 
botha the films scriptwriter a university professor also used a 
pseudonym 
public controversy was sparked by reports in sunday newspapers 
that alvyn schlebusch the cabinet minister formerly in charge of 
the corporation had recommended that the final 200000 installment 
of its payment to mimosa films be withheld because the film was 
substandard 
according to the reports president botha overruled schlebusch 
and ordered the payment 
schlebusch subsequently resigned his successor stoffel van der 
merve said the broadcasting companys involvement in the film was 
legitimate 
in return for its financing the corporation was to get all 
domestic box office profits and half of overseas profits 
the movie plot is based loosely on the civil war in angola where 
south africanbacked rebels are fighting the soviet and 
cubansupported troops of angolas marxist government 
south african military equipment was used in the film and dozens 
of soldiers reportedly served as extras the sunday times newspaper 
said it was believed the script was submitted to angolan rebel 
leader jonas savimbi for approval

police army and paramilitary forces to guard against violence

party winning the most will have first chance at forming a 
government on saturday voters will chose the 483 members of the

it will be the first democratic election since the one that swept 
zulfikar ali bhutto to power in 1973 he was reelected in 1977 but 
zia nullified the vote after the coup declaring it rigged

nationalizing industry and like the islamic alliance pledges 
continued close relations with the united states and aid to 
anticommunist guerrillas in afghanistan 
both favor pakistans nuclear research program which the 
government says is for peaceful purposes 
pakistans 48 million eligible voters threefourths of them 
illiterate must present government identity cards in order to cast 
ballots officials said about 93 percent of eligible voters had 
cards but ms bhutto claimed the percentage was far lower

secretary of state george p 
shultz said today latin american nations should close ranks behind a 
new diplomacy aimed at pressuring the regions dictatorships 
into making democratic reforms 
the time is right for a new diplomacy a diplomacy based on 
democractic solidarity and on the aggressive advocacy of democracy 
by democratic states shultz said in a speech to organization of 
american states foreign ministers 
in comments while en route here for an eighthour visit shultz 
said democracies in the region should consider ways to make 
nicaragua feel a sense of isolation as a means of promoting 
democratic reform 
president jose napoleon duarte convened the weeklong oas meeting 
with a condemnation of leftist guerrillas battling waging a 
9yearold war against his usbacked government he also urged 
debt relief for the hemispheres nations 
duarte also called upon delegates to provide moral support 
for an eventual summit meeting of central american presidents that 
would try to breathe new life into a regional peace process begun in 
august 1987 
what is at stake is not just peace in central america but the 
security of the entire continent he said 
in shultzs comments he singled out paraguay and cuba as 
countries which have not been part of the democratic trend in the 
hemisphere 
shultz criticized the oas for what he regards as its indifferent 
attitude toward the hemispheres democratic development 
this organization has not always been out front on issues 
concerning democracy shultz told the delegates too often it 
has been one step behind when it has needed to be one step ahead 
he suggested the oas has been negligent in not insisting that 
nicaragua live up to its 1979 commitment to a pluralistic political 
system 
agreements exist promises have been made he said the 
dictators and the totalitarians must be told they are not free to 
subjugate their peoples 
a return trip to washington is planned for tonight 
in an interview last week assistant secretary of state elliott 
abrams said the sandinistas have been so unyielding on democratic 
reform that theyve disappointed people who are even moderately 
sympathetic to them 
he said there has been an increase in repression in nicaragua 
this year including the continued detention of about 40 persons 
involved in an antigovernment protest last june 
the sandinistas contend us efforts to destabilize nicaragua are 
continuing despite the military aid cutoff to the contras they cite 
a statement two months ago by house speaker jim wright dtex that 
the administration was trying to disrupt peace talks in nicaragua by 
having the cia provoke a clampdown by the sandinistas 
shultz has been a frequent visitor to el salvador over the years 
and the officials said todays speech was to include numerous 
expressions of esteem and affection for duarte who is dying of 
cancer 
duarte who is in the last year of a fiveyear term has been 
perhaps the closest ally of the united states in the hemisphere and 
his government is the biggest recipient of us aid in the region 
there are diplomats from at least two oas countries with whom 
shultz had no plans to meet panama and nicaragua reagan 
administration policy forbids substantive contact with officials 
from either government

six educational testing organizations on monday 
unveiled a new code of practices that commits them to strive for 
fairness in tests given students of different races sex or ethnic 
backgrounds 
the voluntary code also commits the test makers to review and 
revise questions to avoid potentially insensitive content or 
language and to offer appropriately modified forms of tests 
to the handicapped 
the code of fair testing practices in education bears the 
endorsement of six companies whose tests are taken by millions of 
american students each year from first grade to graduate school 
the signers of the new code are educational testing service the 
college board the american college testing program ctbmcgraw 
hill the psychological corp and the riverside publishing co 
the code lays out 21 standards for both test developers and test 
users in four areas developing and selecting tests interpreting 
scores striving for fairness and informing test takers 
on fairness it says test developers should strive to make 
tests that are as fair as possible for test takers of different 
races gender ethnic backgrounds or handicapping conditions 
it commits them to investigate the performance of test takers of 
differents races sex and ethnic backgrounds when samples of 
sufficient size are available and to set up procedures to 
ensure that differences in performance are related primarily to the 
skills under assessment rather than to irrelevant factors 
on test selection the code says the test makers should make 
available to qualified users either representative samples or 
complete copies of test questions directions answer sheets 
manuals and score reports 
robert schaeffer a spokesman for fairtest a cambrige mass 
group that is critical of standardized testing said the code 
sounds good in principle but it lacks teeth 
whats needed is public oversight and control of the 
billiondollar testing industry schaeffer said 
everyone wants fair tests he added the question is how do you 
make them fair and who is to judge and who punishes those whose 
tests are nor fair 
the college board sponsors the scholastic aptitude test which is 
made by ets the american college testing program makes the act a 
rival collegeentrance exam ctbmcgraw hill makes both the 
comprehensive test of basic skills and the california achievement 
test the psychological corp makes both the stanford and the 
metropolitan achievement tests riverside publishing makes the iowa 
tests of basic skills 
copies of the code are available from the national council on 
measurement in education 1230 17th st nw washington dc 20036

bad weather forced the air force 
to postpone a plan to explode nearly a half million pounds of 
explosives monday to test a new ordnance storage bunker a base 
spokesman said 
len barry said the enormous blast to test the new hayman igloo 
design could not be conducted during overcast weather because cloud 
cover would reflect the force of the explosion and possibly damage 
buildings in populated areas 
a storm front over northern utah produced heavy cloud cover and 
several inches of snow monday barry said he did not know when the 
test would be rescheduled 
the air force had planned to detonate the explosives on the test 
and training range west of the great salt lake 50 to 60 miles from 
populated areas 
plans had called 450000 pounds of explosive in one igloo to be 
detonated to test the effects on four other igloos built nearby 
the purpose of the test is to determine how far apart the igloos 
should be spaced to prevent an explosion in one from setting off 
others 
the hayman is designed to channel the force of explosion upward 
through the roof and away from other storage bunkers or buildings 
barry said 
the air force has said that under the proper weather conditions 
the test would pose little risk to the public directly or through 
environmental problems 
the state bureau of air quality issued an openburning permit for 
the test after concluding it would not create significant air 
pollution 
barry said the hayman igloo developed by hill air force base 
industrial engineering technician lowell hayman costs only 100000 
to build compared to 500000 for current ammunition storage 
bunkers 
the hayman igloo is made of concrete and steel as is the current 
bunker however the hayman is cheaper because the walls and roof 
are prefabricated and assembled onsite it can be completed in only 
two weeks while the current design built entirely on site 
requires four months

us congressmen told president 
corazon aquino on monday that washington will honor a pledge of more 
economic aid and urged manila to extend an agreement on us 
military bases after 1991 
mrs aquino told the americans her government must achieve the 
widest consensus among filipinos for entangling foreign 
commitments 
the sixmember delegation led by senate minority leader robert 
dole met with mrs aquino and philippine officials on the first 
stop of a fournation tour of southeast asia 
the other members of the delegation were sens james mcclure 
ridaho arlen specter rpa franck murkowski ralaska and reps 
lawrence coughlin rpa and william lehman dfla 
dole said presidentelect george bush will honor a commitment 
made by president reagan to support a multinational aid package to 
bolster the philippine economy 
its not just some statement some rhetorics its going to 
happen dole told reporters 
last month reagan pledged in a letter to mrs aquino to work 
with japan south korea west germany and other us allies to 
develop the aid plan 
the letter was delivered shortly after the united states and the 
philippines concluded an agreement oct 17 that guarantees us 
military use of six bases through 1991 in exchange for 962 million 
in american aid 
any extension of the agreement beyond that year must be approved 
by twothirds of the 23member philippine senate where opposition 
to the bases is strong 
it is in the interest of both countries that we work out 
appropriate arrangements fully consistent with philippine 
sovereignty that would permit continuation of access to the bases 
facilities the congressmen said in a statement 
us officials have said privately they would like to begin talks 
on a new treaty early next year the pact expires sept 16 1991 
mrs aquino told the delegation that as democracies the 
philippines and the united states need the widest consensus and 
the most willing support for entangling foreign commitments she 
made no direct reference to the us bases 
foreign secretary raul manglapus told reporters he briefed the 
delegation on the results of a recent survey that showed about 75 
percent of the 1200 people polled favored extending the bases 
beyond 1991 about 25 percent of the supporters however wanted 
better financial terms from washington 
the delegation also will visit bangkok thailand singapore and

a periodical that summarizes unpublished 
opinions from kentuckys court of appeals and supreme court is being 
marketed by two appeals court judges who say there is nothing 
unethical about the venture 
about 50 subscriptions at 200 a year for law firms and 160 
for sole practitioners have been sold since the publication began 
in september said judge michael mcdonald who started the 
kentucky legal practitioner with judge john p hayes 
mcdonald said he and hayes view the venture not as a moneymaker 
but as a good way to get more of the work of kentuckys appellate 
courts into the hands of busy practicing attorneys 
the opinions summarized in the publication are ones the state 
supreme court has decided are not worth having published in law 
books unpublished opinions cannot be cited as precedents in other 
cases 
experts on judicial ethics said they knew of no similar 
periodical elsewhere in the country published by appellate judges 
some lawyers and legal ethicists questioned the propriety of the 
judges venture but mcdonald said such questions were absolutely 
the most absurd thing i have ever heard of 
the code of judicial conduct says a judge shall refrain from 
financial and business dealings that tend to exploit his 
judicial position or involve him in frequent transactions with 
lawyers or persons likely to come before the court on which he 
serves 
judges may manage investments and engage in other remunerative 
activity but should not serve as an officer director manager 
advisor or employee of any business 
another portion of the code however says judges may speak 
write lecture or teach on legal subjects if in doing so they 
dont cast doubt on their impartiality 
mcdonald said he believes the summaries of unpublished opinions 
will be extremely useful research tools 
kentuckys appellate courts issue hundreds of decisions each year 
but most by court order are not published in law books when the 
court of appeals decides they offer no new guidance on legal issues 
but some of the appellate judges have bridled under rules that 
allow the supreme court to veto the lower courts decision that an 
opinion should be published 
in their first issue the judges said they started the periodical 
because the state supreme court had frustrated moves to allow 
lawyers to cite such unpublished opinions as precedent in arguing 
cases 
experts on legal ethics said they believe it is improper for 
judges to produce such a publication 
professor stephen gillers of new york university said lawyers who 
appear before the judges might feel pressure to subscribe to the 
service and that litigants represented by lawyers who dont 
subscribe might question the judges impartiality 
professor geoffrey hazard of yale university said he thinks the 
publication is improper because it requires the judges to summarize 
decisions of their colleagues you cant neutrally summarize 
opinions he said 
however another leading ethicist professor roald rotunda of the 
university of illinois said judges wouldnt automatically violate 
the code in producing such a publication as long as it doesnt take 
up too much of their time 
mcdonald said he spends less than an hour each week on the 
periodical and former and current staff attorneys of the court of 
appeals write the summaries at home in their spare time he said no 
court equipment or supplies are used 
the hayesmcdonald enterprise offers subscribers the full text of 
opinions for 75 cents a page such opinions may be obtained directly 
from the supreme court and court of appeals by mail for 30 cents a 
page

mike mansfield announced his retirement monday after 
11 years as us ambassador to japan and a public service career 
that began at age 14 when he lied about his age to enter the navy 
during world war i 
the 85yearold former senate majority leader has worked 
tirelessly for strong usjapanese relations which he described as 
excellent with most problems resolved he said he would leave his 
post before jan 1 
mansfield said he and his wife maureen made the decision 
together 
we decided it was time for me to resign subject to the will of 
the president and that has been done the democrat from montana 
told reporters at the us embassy he said they would divide their 
time between washington and his home state spending winters in 
florida 
senior japanese officials expressed appreciation for mansfields 
years of effort for improved relations 
it is very regrettable that ambassador mansfield is 
resigning aides quoted foreign minister sosuke uno as saying 
he was a good friend who understands japan quite well 
it was truly fortunate that we had a person like ambassador 
mansfield in tokyo for a long time his warm personality has 
earned everyones respect and love 
mansfield set records for length of service with 16 years as 
senate majority leader and 11 as ambassador to japan 
the japanese welcomed his appointment to the tokyo mission by 
president jimmy carter because of mansfields prestige in congress 
and his belief in the importance of east asia to the united states 
he has called the next century the century of the pacific 
basin and often said the relationship with japan is the most 
important to washington bar none 
speculation arose that mansfield would retire after coronary 
bypass surgery in january but he returned to work in the spring 
the ambassador said monday he and his wife agreed at the time to 
delay retirement until after major trade issues were resolved and 
the us presidential election was over 
the recent us decision with mansfields support against 
trying to force the opening of the japanese rice market at this time 
helped clear the way for his retirement he said 
trade problems are the major cause of friction between the united 
states and japan but relations generally are in excellent shape 
mansfield said 
in the field of politics and diplomacy we work very well 
together he told the news conference in the field of security 
the relationship couldnt be better and in the area of investment 
things are going very nicely 
some people both in and outside the us government have 
criticized mansfield as being too accommodating toward the japanese 
he says in response that japanese markets have opened in many 
ways and japan has assumed a significant part of the security burden 
in asia he advocates a broad trade agreement to ease friction and 
the idea is being studied but is unlikely to materialize soon 
mansfield said monday he treated the japanese as he would wish to 
be treated and they responded in kind he called the tokyo years 
the most enjoyable in our lives 
after beginning seven decades of service to the united states 
with the navy enlistment at 14 mansfield served in the army and the 
marine corps he was in asia with the marines 
before his election to congress in 1942 he taught far eastern 
and latin american history at montana state university in missoula 
the school since has been renamed the university of montana 
in 1944 mansfield was sent on a foreign policy mission to china 
at the request of president franklin d roosevelt before his 
appointment to tokyo he had returned to china several times at the 
chinese governments invitation

latin american democracies have 
been too permissive of dictatorships in their midst and should 
vigorously promote constitutional rule secretary of state george p 
shultz said monday 
the time is right for a new diplomacy a diplomacy based on 
democratic solidarity and on the aggressive advocacy of democracy by 
democratic states he told a meeting of organization of american 
states foreign ministers 
on what is expected to be the last of his many trips to latin 
america during six years in office shultz challenged the 
democracies to go out on a limb to pressure nondemocratic 
neighbors to open up we need to confront these states with a 
diplomacy by democracies for democracy 
shultz said the oas had not led the struggle for democracy even 
though the organization is based on democratic principles 
the remarks appeared to reflect shultzs frustration over the 
lack of hemispheric backing for a stronger stand against nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government 
reagan administration support for nicaraguan rebels known as 
contras has been given little approval and sometimes has created 
hostility 
the secretary made only a passing reference to nicaragua 
asserting that the sandinista government has not fulfilled a 1979 
pledge to the oas to establish a democratic system the leftist 
rebels overthrew the prous government of the late president 
anastasio somoza in july 1979 
on the plane from washington shultz said paraguay and cuba also 
have have not joined a trend toward democratic rule that began nine 
years ago and now encompasses about 90 percent of the hemispheres 
people 
in his remarks to reporters he offered no specific suggestions 
about what the oas might do to promote democracy in nicaragua but 
said it should consider ways in which nicaragua would feel a sense 
of isolation 
he said nicaragua has become an economic basket case but 
continues to be a threat to its neighbors because of its large army 
and continued military support from the soviet union 
shultz said the reagan administration has differences with 
president oscar arias of costa rica but he commended arias for 
forthright comments on the lack of progress toward democracy in 
nicaragua 
thats what everybody should do shultz said 
arias won last years nobel peace prize for devising a regional 
peace plan 987for central america that was signed aug 7 1987 by 
arias and the presidents of nicaragua el salvador honduras and 
guatemala 
nicaragua has said it is committed to a democratic system and 
accuses the united states of continued efforts to undermine the 
sandinsta revolution despite the cutoff by congress in february of 
aid to the contras 
in his speech to the oas shultz said 32nation hemispheric group 
has not always been out front on issues concerning democracy 
too often it has been one step behind when it has needed to be one 
step ahead 
as we challenge others to adopt democracy we need to hold them 
to their promises and commitments no one is fooled by empty 
promises he declared

president reagan said monday the united states 
inevitably will have a woman president and i welcome it 
but during a questionandanswer session with a group of school 
children in the state dining room of the white house reagan also 
said he thought a woman would likely get to the oval office only by 
serving first as vice president 
asked whether there would ever be a woman chief executive he 
replied i dont know believe im certainly not against it 
as a matter of fact the statesman in the world that i have 
met that i respect the most is the prime minister of england 
margaret thatcher and shes done a remarkable job for england 
the president said 
reagan will play host to mrs thatcher for an official visit and 
state dinner at the white house later this week the british prime 
minister has been his closest friend and ally in the western 
alliance during his nearly eight years in office 
as for a women president reagan said the idea would take a 
little getting used to on the part of some people but i think its 
inevitable that in this country there will be a woman president 
because theyve come up in so many different fields 
he added its just my feeling that probably rather than one 
of them just entering the fray to run for president to begin with 
that maybe it would probably start with one of them as we did in 
the election in 1984 running for vice president she didnt 
make it but that might be the start of it and i welcome it 
reagan was referring to thenrep geraldine ferraro dny who 
had the second spot on the democratic ticket headed by thenvice 
president walter f mondale 
reagan swept to a 49state landslide over the ticket with the 
mondaleferraro team carrying only mondales home state of minnesota 
and the district of columbia 
reagans appearance before students from five washingtonarea 
junior and senior high schools was the first of four such talks the 
president plans to give before leaving office on jan 20 
before taking questions from the pupils reagan told his audience 
that he would look to young people to carry forth the message of the 
american revolution to the rest of the world but as the world goes 
through rapid technological and social change he said the 
permanent truths which give meaning to our lives dont change

house speaker jim wright dtexas and other democratic leaders 
including rep mary rose oakar of ohio a potential rival 
that all but assures his selection as chairman when the house 
democratic caucus meets dec 6 
gonzalez will be taking over at the start of a critical year for 
the committee regulators estimate as much as 50 billion is needed 
to clean up the sampl mess and analysts agree nearly uniformly that it 
will require government help 
the committee also is expected to take another try at a 
fundamental restructuring of the financial system allowing greater 
mingling of commercial banks and securities firms third world debt 
is likely to get attention too 
both the sampl crisis and new bank powers have been divisive issues 
and congress couldnt agree on legislation this year sen donald w 
riegle dmich is expected to succeed the retiring william 
proxmire dwis as chairman of the senate banking housing and 
urban affairs committee meaning both chambers of congress will have 
new banking leaders in 1989 
its hard not to believe this is going to slow momentum said 
r dan brumbaugh a savings industry consultant and former chief 
economist of the federal home loan bank board 
the changeover in congress means the new bush administration 
likely will take the lead in forging a solution to the sampl problem 
he said however nothing of a significant magnitude can get done 
without the concurrence of the house committee he said 
gonzalez has generally opposed permitting banks to get involved 
with securities underwriting but he said recently that he also 
takes a pragmatic view and recognizes that the financial system is 
changing and congress must change with the times 
last summer gonzalez said he favored an immediate 50 billion 
loan from the treasury to quickly resolve the sampl crisis he has 
also expressed sympathy for sampls in his home state where most of 
the industrys losses are concentrated arguing they were victimized 
by the drop in oil prices and the consequent decline in southwestern 
real estate prices 
he has strong feelings about the industrys inability to pay 
and thats encouraging said frederick webber the newly appointed 
president of the savings industrys largest trade group the us 
league of savings institutions 
webber said the industry will not be sorry to see the departure 
of st germain who was defeated following disclosure of justice 
department allegations that he accepted thousands of dollars in 
entertainment and meals from sampl lobbyists 
i know the allegations have been that the industry was in bed 
with freddy but look at his record the chairman did not go out of 
his way to help the industry not by a long shot webber said 
gonzalez gets high marks from colleagues for personal integrity 
and his willingness to speak his mind they also say he is a 
likeable man despite a temper that caused him two years ago to slug 
a man who called him a communist 
however many question gonzalezs ability to rein in his own 
views enough to ride herd on a committee with more than 50 members 
and nearly as many factions 
he is not a dumb man hes bright he understands problems and 
he can be very direct with what he says but its one thing to be 
able to make cogent comments and its another thing to be able to 
forge a legislative compromise that may be where he has problems 
said bert ely a financial institutions consultant in alexandria va 
in 1977 gonzalez was appointed to chair a special committee to 
investigate the assassinations of president kennedy and martin 
luther king jr but after holding the position for only weeks he 
fired the chief counsel and then quit leaving the committee in 
turmoil 
as chairman of the banking subcommittee on housing since 1981 
gonzalez has shown a confrontational style he once called housing 
and urban development secretary samuel pierce the only black member 
of the reagan cabinet a stepin fetchit 
he also had advocated the impeachment of former federal reserve 
board chairman paul volcker who was pushing up interest rates in 
the early 1980s to fight inflation 
but former rep henry a reuss a wisconsin democrat who preceded 
st germain as banking committee chairman says gonzalez may do 
better than many expect 
under the reagan administration it just has not been possible to 
pass housing legislation reuss said adding that gonzalez has 
shown a capacity to learn and grow and i think that will stand 
congress in good stead 
gonzalez addressing the national association of mortgage brokers 
on monday answered his critics saying ive never considered 
myself an ideologue no matter how ive been labeled you cant 
last in politics unless youre in the traditional american vein of 
pragmatism 
after the speech he told reporters that much of the criticisms 
circulating were hobgoblins calculatedly set forth by those who 
have ambitions themselves 
ely said if gonzalez proves to be a weak chairman it could tip 
control of the committee to various senior democrats depending on 
the issue or to the republican minority 
if the democrats split a lot that puts the republicans in the 
drivers seat they may in effect decide which faction among 
the democrats wins out he said what were going to see is a 
more tulmultuous committee

they thought about chopping off sybil 
luddingtons head and they thought about boring holes into her 
skull but so far theyve contented themselves with putting a gasbag 
over her head 
sybil was the 16yearold heroine who rode through the 
countryside warning colonists that the british were burning danbury 
conn in 1778 
she has been memorialized in a song a poem a postage stamp and 
a statue put up in 1961 on the shore of lake gleneida in carmel 
but the statue has been acting up lately acquiring the 
unbecoming habit of foaming at the mouth 
suggestions were made to decapitate it to examine what was 
causing the foaming and boring holes to see what was inside 
but on sunday metallurgist terry lowe put a plastic bag over the 
head of the statue and pumped it full of gas 
he said he had identified the foam as calcium sulphate or 
gypsum and believes it was part of a plaster mold left behind when 
the statue was made he thinks the residue is seeping from the pores 
in the bronze 
lowe said he will watch the bag for signs that the gas is 
escaping into the statue which would confirm that there are such 
pores

tamil rebels ambushed a bus in 
northeastern sri lanka and opened fire on the passengers killing at 
least 27 people police said 
three people also were injured in the morning attack on the 
staterun public bus near pinkatiya village about 146 miles 
northeast of colombo said a police official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
soldiers were searching the area for at least 15 attackers who 
fled after the killings he said 
the victims are believed to be sinhalese including several women 
and children 
in colombo president junius r jayewardene called a meeting with 
the powerful buddhist clergy who have been calling for him and his 
cabinet to resign government sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said no agenda has been fixed for the monday night 
meeting 
the island nation off the southern coast of india is facing two 
violent uprisings the lingering tamil rebellion in the northeast 
and a backlash by radical sinhalese in the south 
the mostly buddhist sinhalese claim government peace overtures to 
the predominantly hindu tamils grant too many concessions to the 
minority community 
the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest tamil militant 
group say the governments offers fell below expectations to end 
alleged discrimination in jobs and education they are continuing 
their 5yearold war for an independent homeland 
the ambush came six days before local elections in the 
tamildominated northeast province 
the tigers have vowed to disrupt the election of the first 
provincial council with limited autonomy it was sanctioned by an 
indianbrokered peace accord in july 1987 and was meant to appease 
tamil demands for selfrule 
radical sinhalese mainly from the peoples liberation front 
have stepped up demands for jayewardenes resignation and called a 
fourday strike last week 
it caused severe food and fuel shortages especially in the 
sinhalesedominated south and crippled the tourism industry that 
brings in 67 million a year 
armed with broad new powers to combat the sinhalese threat the 
sri lankan army went on television monday warning it will crush any 
group that tries to bring down jayewardenes government 
the armed forces have been vested with enough power by the 
government to deal with any group or movement which threatens the 
sovereignty independence and the very existence of the democratic 
form of government said a statement read by an unidentified army 
officer 
the government says the peoples liberation front has killed at 
least 550 people mostly sinhalese government officials and 
supporters since the peace accord was signed 
on wednesday the army got orders to shoot antigovernment 
demonstrators on sight the following day soldiers killed at least 
18 people when they opened fire on protesters in three southern 
towns 
on friday jayewardene issued an emergency decree providing a 
maximum sentence of death by hanging for anyone convicted of 
instigating a strike 
seventyfive percent of sri lankas 16 million people are 
sinhalese who control most government and military jobs 
tamils comprise 18 percent of the population

the next first lady of the united 
states had one request for the news media on monday please dont 
take pictures of me swimming 
my children are complaining all across the country barbara 
bush laughingly told photographers and television crews who staked 
out the beach near the vacation home where she and her husband are 
staying 
presidentelect george bush chimed in with his daughters 
reaction to photographs of her mother swimming in a modest one piece 
bathing suit i could tell you exactly what dorothy said when she 
called in but i dont use those kinds of words in front of the 
national press corps 
mrs bush is an avid swimmer sometimes doing a mile at a time 
both she and the presidentelect have been seen daily since thursday 
in the balmy waters off the oceanfront home of their friend william 
stamps farish iii 
the bushes traded quips with reporters at the conclusion of a 
questionandanswer session on the beach photographers told bush 
that if he planned to fish as usual that afternoon he should try to 
do so a little closer to the line behind which secret service agents 
require the film crews to stand 
barbara says if you dont take pictures of her swimming ill 
fish here bush joked 
he also said noted that he has taken to wearing a tshirt when he 
swims so nobody can snap revealing pictures of him 
talking about how he has enjoyed his few days at the beach he 
said 
i think my mental attitude is in much better shape i know my 
body is im sure everybody can attest to that to these long 
lenses these long penetrating lenses which cause us to wear 
tshirts when we go swimming and all this kind of thing because we 
dont want to be analysed by the doctors from the new york times 
reflecting further on the vacation time at the end of a long 
political campaign bush said you get to clear your mind you get 
to think a little bit about the future you see these tremendous 
problems but you just get refurbished in your desire to do the best 
job you can 
he said he has run and fished every day 
i love the fishing it doesnt matter what you catch its the 
fact youre out there and fishermen know that 
and so im still of the isaac walton school that the days i 
spend fishing should not be deducted from the time i spend on

aspirations of his oldest son george w bush 
in a beachfront questionandanswer session a reporter 
questioned bush on speculation that his 42yearold son would run 
for governor of texas

time for his fathers white house bid

alexander dubcek said monday he expects a 
rebuke from the czechoslovak regime for his outspokenness during his 
first trip abroad in 18 years 
addressing 300 political science students dubcek repeatedly 
invoked soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms as 
justification for his own failed democratic moves in 1968 
since his first day in italy on saturday dubcek has praised 
gorbachev and criticized current leaders in czechoslovakia and those 
who saw him ousted as party chief shortly after soviet tanks took 
over prague streets on aug 21 1968 
the moscowled invasion ended his attempt to ease censorship 
allow political freedoms and improve the economy during his few 
months as czechoslovak leader 
dubcek spoke animatedly about the soviet blocs past and future 
in an overcrowded lecture hall at the university of bologna which 
awarded him an honorary degree sunday for his defense of personal 
liberties 
referring to his partys version of events leading to the 
invasion dubcek told applauding students when i reject these 
what do you think they will tell me when i return home they will 
say that i am helping western propaganda he then joined in the 
subsequent applause 
dubcek had believed after a meeting with soviet leaders aug 3 
1968 that he could continue his reforms the official version says 
he was warned of the possible consequences 
in all his appearances dubcek 66 has been intent on convincing 
the world he was right to implement his liberalization policy 
after recounting for his young audience the years of violence 
during the stalinist era dubcek said 
gorbachev is trying to put distance from that system of so many 
things that didnt work 
many ask why despite all the enormous difficulties i continue 
to insist that socialism is reformable 
the idea of reform continues to live today the 20 years 
that have passed have confirmed the rightness of our idea as you see 
what is happening in the soviet union and other countries 
dubcek said western support is important for socialisms new 
direction and gorbachevs perestroika campaign to reform 
political and economic policy he dismissed as unfounded the 
speculation that he submitted to some kind of censorship when he 
read only excerpts from his highly critical speech at sundays award 
ceremony he said he cut out parts to save time since the text had 
been published the previous evening 
dubcek was expected to spend at least another day in bologna 
venice and florence also are on his itinerary before his return 
sometime next week to bratislava czechoslavakia near the austrian 
border where he lives in retirement after years of working at a 
lowly forestry department job assigned to him after he was stripped 
of party membership in 1970

the financially strapped 
organization of american states opened its general assembly on 
monday with a warning from its secretarygeneral that it could 
become merely a bureaucratic contrivance 
joao baena soares the brazilian head of the 31member oas also 
said that a new reality must be created within our hemisphere 
that will find the oas to be an effective political forum between 
the americas north and south 
baena soares spoke just before salvadoran president jose napoleon 
duarte who formally opened the weeklong session duarte who has 
terminal cancer energetically condemned leftist guerrillas battling 
his government and called for support for the stalled central 
american peace process 
us secretary of state george shultz attended the inaugural 
session 
in his speech baena soares addressed two fundamental criticisms 
leveled at the oas since its foundation in 1948 that it is an 
ineffective essentially bureaucratic forum and that it is 
dominated by the united states 
over this session of the general assembly there looms a central 
issue that must be settled said baena soares the member 
governments must decide what they want to do with the oas at this 
critical juncture in the life of the americas 
he also lamented the organizations extremely difficult 
financial circumstances 
the oas is nearly bankrupt because most member nations are far 
behind in their dues the united states which provides the lions 
share of the budget as well as the oas headquarters in washington 
owes 41 million 
the financial situation has been insurmountable because of a 
failure to comply with the legal obligations that establish the 
member states commitment to contribute their quotas baena soares 
said 
baena soares said in september the us arrears severely 
affect the functioning of the oas house speaker jim wright said 
at the time that latin nations interpreted washingtons retention of 
funds as an effort to reassert its domination of the forum 
an oas commission has recommended that the organization cut its 
66 million budget by 30 percent and fire a fourth of its staff of 
1004 the foreign ministers and heads of delegations meeting here 
will decide whether to accept the recommendation 
shultz said in a speech that the reagan administration will ask 
for full funding of our assessed contribution to the oas in 1990 
baena soares declared it is often said that the oas is too 
costly indeed it is if all its diplomaticpolitical potential is 
not used if it subsists as merely a bureaucratic contrivance 
he also called for joint action on latin americas foreign debt 
the united states the largest hemispheric creditor has tried to 
discourage tentative efforts by debtor nations to form a block that 
would give them more weight in debt negotiations 
duarte 62 called on the oas delegates to approve a resolution 
that emphatically condemns terrorism and delegitimizes those who 
seek political power by violence and terror 
he accused leftist rebels waging a 9yearold war against the 
usbacked government of resorting to terrorism 
duarte is suffering from liver cancer because of weight and hair 
loss during chemotherapy he appeared haggard but he spoke 
emphatically in a clear strong voice 
doctors said when the cancer was diagnosed in june that duarte 
had between six and 18 months to live 
duarte asked delegates to provide moral support for an 
eventual summit meeting of central american presidents that would 
try to breathe new life into a regional peace process begun in 
august 1987 
what is at stake is not just peace in central america but the 
security of the entire continent he said 
diplomats from the five central american countries guatemala 
el salvador honduras nicaragua and costa rica have been trying 
without success for months to set a date and place for a summit 
there has been talk in recent days of a summit before the end of the 
year but nothing has been formalized

agreed to a second unforeseen day of meetings 
cuba angola and south africa continued to search for a 
breakthrough in closeddoor bilateral talks mediated by us 
assistant secretary of state chester crocker 
south african spokesman roland darroll said the latest round 
originally set for three days ending sunday would continue tuesday 
but he added it seems the more time there is the more people 
take their time 
negotiators agreed to extend the talks after a us delegate in 
an upbeat assessment cited progress on the issue of a cuban troop 
withdrawal from angola in washington state department spokeswoman 
phyllis oakley echoed his optimism were hopeful that agreement 
can be reached she said 
but a senior south african diplomat cautioned monday theres 
still a lot of ground to cover 
we are waiting for more complete replies from cuba and angola 
on a us peace plan put forward in october said the official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
he described progress as glacial 
things are on track but on a very slow track he said 
the main remaining issue in the peace effort begun in may is 
setting a timetable for withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops backing 
angolas marxist government against south african and 
ussupported unita rebels the other component is a framework to 
end south africas 73year control of southwest africa or namibia 
in new york the un general assembly took up a resolution 
monday condemning pretorias rule of namibia passage of the measure 
was considered certain 
it calls on south africa not to link namibian independence to 
irrelevant and extraneous issues particularly the presence of 
cuban forces in angola 
debate was expected to last until wednesday last year a 
virtually identical resolution passed with no opposition the united 
states western europe and nordic countries abstained 
the resolution calls on all nations to obey international 
boycotts against south africa including the mandatory arms embargo 
it urges member states to increase aid to the southwest africa 
peoples organization the guerrilla movement which the united 
nations recognizes as the sole representative of namibia 
the united states considers swapo a terrorist organization and 
withholds a small part of its un dues that would be used to fund 
swapo activities 
in geneva on sunday a senior us delegate said negotiators have 
never been closer to agreement

see a rapid change of atmosphere 
a us proposal reportedly calls for a gradual twoyear 
withdrawal cuba seeks a 2year timetable 
target date for the start of the pullout is said to be jan 1 
the same day a unsupervised process for bringing independence to 
namibia would begin

prime minister yitzhak shamir said monday his 
rightist likud bloc would consider forming a coalition with the 
centerleft labor party but he ruled out giving the rival party an 
equal share of power 
shamir who was chosen by president chaim herzog to form a new 
government also tried to defuse concern over the far rights 
hardline stance on the peace process pledging to make a 
tremendous effort to achieve dialogue with the arabs 
in parliamentary elections nov 1 neither likud nor its rival 
the centerleft labor party won enough parliament seats to gain a 
majority in the 120member body according to israeli law the 
president calls on the party with the most support to try to form a 
governing coalition 
shamir has six weeks to form a coalition and he was expected to 
get the needed 61seat majority by forming a coalition with small 
religious and rightwing parties two of those parties endorsed him 
sunday 
herzog however urged shamir to include the labor party in a 
broad coalition similar to the national unity government that has 
been in power since inconclusive elections in 1984 
the president said his office had been flooded with thousands of 
calls urging a unity government many israelis most of whom are 
secular fear the religious parties will force the passage of laws 
that will restrict their daily lives 
the public is worried herzog said there is a wish for 
unity to confront the dangers from outside and the separation 
threatening us from within 
later monday shamir invited labor leader shimon peres for 
coalition talks tuesday said shamir aide avi pazner peres accepted 
the invitation pazner said he refused to elaborate 
a unity government would not only blunt the power of the orthodox 
parties but would relieve shamir of pressure from the extreme right 
which demands annexation of the west bank and gaza and the expulsion 
of 15 million palestinians who live there 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
shamir agreed to try to form a coalition with labor but he made 
clear he could not share power equally with peres as he has for the 
past four years during which each was prime minister for two years 
and cabinet posts were divided 
the government that exists today cannot continue there can not 
be a government that speaks with two voices shamir said on israel 
radio 
the labor party is divided on joining a likudled coalition and 
the dispute could rekindle the rivalry between peres and defense 
minister yitzhak rabin who told the radio a likudled government 
should be prevented at all costs 
shamir sought to appease international concern that his 
government would be intransigent toward the arabs 
the government i shall be able to form if with gods help i 
succeed will see as one of its primary aims making a tremendous 
effort to advance the peace process and reach a dialogue and 
agreement with our neighbors shamir said 
there was also squabbling within likuds ranks shamirs likud 
rival housing minister david levy was disgruntled over reports he 
would not get the foreign ministry post and protested that shamir 
gave too many concessions to the religious parties 
proposals for a new unity coalition have gained popularity as 
concern has grown over promises made to ultraorthodox parties 
which have demanded control of influential cabinet posts in 
education interior and housing as well as controversial legislation 
secular israelis who make up threequarters of the nations 35 
million jews expressed fear that rabbinical control of marriage and 
divorce would be increased and coercive laws passed to close pubs 
restaurants theaters and soccer stadiums on the sabbath 
abroad us jews protested shamirs agreement to religious 
demands for a limit on which converts to judaism would be granted 
automatic israeli citizenship under the socalled law of return the 
religious demand it be given only to those converted by orthodox 
rabbis 
most of americas 5 million jews belong to the more liberal 
reform or conservative strains and thousands are in mixed 
marriages the legislation would be a slap in the face that could

the creator of the pet rock says he 
has spent the last 13 years avoiding publicity and dealing with a 
bunch of wackos 
in 1975 gary dahl was a typical advertising executive from los 
gatos when he came up with the idea of selling the rocks the pet 
rock vanished by valentines day 1976 but not before dahl had sold 
15 million of them at 4 each 
no one will ever do it again said dahl referring to the 
phenomenon that swept the country 
dahl 52 is still in advertising but wont say where he avoided 
interviews for years because of what he called a bunch of wackos 
appearing out of nowhere with threats and lawsuits 
i really dont know how they find me but they do he said 
it makes me a lot more cynical he said it made me too 
high profile theres a bizarre lunatic fringe who feel i owe them a 
living i dont know if its been an asset or a liability 
sometimes i look back and wonder if my life wouldnt have been 
simpler if i hadnt done it he said

president corazon aquino vowed monday 
to tighten prison security after a communist rebel commander and his 
wife escaped when they were released temporarily from military 
detention to attend a party 
mrs aquino said the government cannot allow its efforts to crush 
the 19yearold communist rebellion to go wasted 
romulo kintanar and his wife escaped from camp crame 
headquarters of the philippine national police force after 
attending a party saturday in another part of the compound 
kintanar 41 had commanded the 25000member communist new 
peoples army when he and his 38yearold wife gloria were 
arrested in march he is believed to be the chief organizer of 
assassination squads responsible for killing scores of police 
officers and soldiers 
officials said kintanar and his wife slipped away from a birthday 
party for lt col robelito comilang a former prison warden 
comilang said he invited kintanar his wife and other prisoners 
to the party at his home at camp crame 
kintanar was released from his cell about noon and escorted to 
comilangs home according to brig gen pantaleon dumlao 
kintanar and the guard left the party about two hours later and 
returned to the prison compound dumlao said kintanar his wife and 
another rebel prisoner then returned to comilangs party 
accompanied by the guard then slipped away 
landrito said he did not give permission for kintanar to leave 
his cell the second time because i was in my office sleeping 
relatives of kintanars wife claimed the military may have 
murdered the couple and fabricated the story as a coverup 
because of the escape comilang was placed under house arrest he 
also was relieved of his military duties as was gen renato de 
villa the military chief acting warden maj benjamin landrito and 
camp commander col percival adiong according to police spokesman 
lt col cresencio maralit he said three prison guards were 
arrested 
i will give instructions that we have to have stricter rules 
there mrs aquino told reporters we cannot allow all of our 
efforts to go wasted simply because of the laxity 
kintanar who was held in the maximumsecurity section of the 
camp was the third prominent opponent of the government to escape 
custody since april 
there has been more damage in this case to the credibility of 
the entire government machinery because you can imagine soldiers and 
policemen in the field reacting why will we risk our lives 
catching these people its so easy for them to escape from 
confinement said sen ernesto maceda chairman of the senate 
defense committee 
about 160 communist rebels and soldiers arrested in coup plots 
are held at camp crame

a new group has been formed to press for 
multiparty elections with noncommunist candidates and to demand 
that hungary renegotiate its ties with the warsaw pact official 
media reported monday 
the federation of free democrats was launched sunday at a meeting 
of a network of independent political ecological religious and 
youth groups according to a participant at the session in 
budapests jurta theater 
the network which was established in may on sunday split into 
two groups the new federation and a second group that will take a 
less active political role said the participant speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the formation of the new group also was reported by the 
government daily magyar hirlap and the state news agency mti 
last week the government approved a draft law that would 
legalize independent groups and trade unions and could pave the way 
for a multiparty system the communist party has been hungarys only 
political party since it assumed power in 1948 
however justice minister kalman kulcsar said that a new law 
governing alternative political parties probably would not be ready 
until 1990 when a new constitution is to be issued 
the network of democratic groups formed in may was a loose 
organization of about 1500 individuals who supported democracy but 
was not organized as a purely political group or the nucleus of a 
new political party 
the federation of free democrats intends to give its members 
some kind of organizing framework with a clear political purpose 
said the participant 
the federation of free democrats is headed by a ninemember 
committee including the dissident ferenc koeszeg sociologist 
ottilia solt historian miklos szabo pastor gabor ivanyi and a 
worker istvan vass 
the new group is calling for the democratic right of association 
the organization of alternative political parties and representation 
in parliament according to a draft program 
the group also demands that hungary renegotiate its ties with the 
sovietled warsaw pact military alliance and the withdrawal of the 
soviet unions estimated 65000 troops from hungary 
another group that has said it intends to support candidates for 
parliament is the hungarian democratic forum which was established 
in september

iraqi president saddam hussein said monday 
his country and iran could sign a peace treaty in 10 days if tehran 
is willing the official iraqi news agency reported 
the phase of interference in the internal affairs of others is 
over ina quoted hussein as saying 
in 10 days everyone iran and iraq could be at peace if the 
will and decisions were there he told soldiers in baghdad 
receiving medals for valor 
peace talks between iran and iraq stalled aug 25 five days 
after a united nationssponsored ceasefire halted fighting in the 
8year gulf war 
talks in geneva recessed friday and are expected to resume soon 
both sides blame the other for a deadlock over troop withdrawals 
to the prewar border 
iran insists the southern border is the middle of the 
shattalarab waterway as defined by a 1975 treaty 
iraq abrogated the treaty a few days before it invaded iran in 
september 1980 and insists the border runs along the eastern 
iranian bank 
tehran radio reported monday that the two countries agreed to 
repatriate more than 1500 sick or disabled prisoners over a 
threeweek period starting sunday 
the exchange will be organized by the international committee of 
the red cross which is waiting for iran and iraq to provide lists 
of all other disabled prisoners for another exchange beginning dec 
5 
the red cross estimates there are more than 100000 prisoners 
hussein said iraq has been seeking peace since 1985 and would 
have accepted the un ceasefire resolution when it was approved on 
july 20 1987 
iran equivocated until july this year when it unconditionally 
accepted after a series of battlefield defeats 
we are still discussing how to fix the ceasefire hussein 
said we want the ceasefire to be fixed so that no spark could 
flare up and cause us a problem 
he did not indicate whether baghdad is prepared to soften its 
stand in the talks 
but he stressed we are continuing the way of peace and believe 
in it unless they the iranians attack us then we would mobilize 
120 army divisions but by gods will this will not happen 
iraqs military currently has 54 divisions and an estimated 1 
million men under arms 
tehran claims iraq occupies 386 square miles of iranian territory 
in the central border sector 
iran is not short of land space and free waters ina quoted 
hussein as saying let each of us live freely in his own homeland 
without interference in internal affairs 
his country already is preparing for peace in baghdad on monday 
french foreign trade minister jeanmarie rausch conferred with iraqi 
officials on bilateral trade and frances participation in iraqs 
postwar reconstruction ina reported

a federal judge declared a mistrial monday in 
a civil suit aimed at assigning blame for the aeromexico jetliner 
disaster two years ago 
us district judge david v kenyon agreed with government 
attorneys that jurors were tainted when an attorney for the pilot of 
a small plane said the pilot may have died two minutes before the 
crash over cerritos on aug 31 1986 the crash killed 82 people 
the judge noted that the trial had just begun with opening 
statements and no evidence had been presented kenyon said he did 
not want to take objecting partieskicking and screaming into the 
rest of the trial 
i see some prejudice some very genuine prejudice to certain 
parties kenyon said saying the opening statement of an attorney 
could have had a lasting effect and would be on the mind of 
jurors 
us justice department lawyer steven j riegel made a mistrial 
motion which was denied last week 
kenyon said then that trial could continue but told jurors they 
could not consider the heart attack scenario presented by attorneys 
for the family of small plane pilot william kramer 
but on monday riegel reintroduced his motion and after four 
hours of arguments the judge reconsidered and declared the mistrial 
in the new trial jurors may not hear anything about an alleged 
incapacity or death of kramer before the accident kenyon also 
ruled a pool of 100 prospective jurors will be called tuesday to 
select a new panel

amid a new wave of books tv specials and 
docudramas that have revived the specter of a conspiracy in the john 
f kennedy assassination a public television broadcast this week 
casts doubt on many of the second gunman theories 
the jfk segment of the nova series narrated by former cbs 
news anchorman walter cronkite used available evidence and in 
some cases new scientific analyses to test theories that a second 
gunman shot at kennedy and that the wounds were altered to hide 
evidence of a conspiracy 
the program which for the first time gained access to autopsy 
photos of the slain president concludes only that the available 
evidence even when put through modernday scientific testing is 
inconclusive on whether there was a second gunman 
the onehour public broadcasting service special who shot 
president kennedy was scheduled to air tuesday night one week 
before the 25th anniversary of the slaying 
producer robert richter received permission from the kennedy 
family to show 52 color and blackandwhite autopsy photos to four 
doctors who were part of the emergency medical team that struggled 
to save the president in dallas 
each of the four doctors examined the photos individually behind 
closed doors at the national archives where evidence from the jfk 
assassination is stored they concluded that the wounds looked the 
same as they did when the president arrived at parkland memorial 
hospital in dallas on nov 22 1963 
the testimony strikes directly at a cornerstone of the second 
gunman theory that kennedy was shot from the front by a gunman on 
the infamous grassy knoll as well as from behind by lee harvey 
oswald and that bullet wounds were altered somewhere between dallas 
and the washington autopsy to make it appear as though entrance 
wounds were actually exit wounds 
nova received family permission to view the original autopsy 
photos only by agreeing not to show them during the broadcast but 
the program does show for the first time several graphic autopsy 
shots of the slain president richter said they were copies obtained 
by an outside source whom he declined to identify 
richter used a computer model of dealey plaza to show how the 
muchmaligned singlebullet theory embraced by the warren 
commission could be correct 
according to richters computer model a single bullet fired from 
the sixth floor of the nearby texas school book depository where 
oswald was perched could have traveled through kennedys neck if 
he had been bending slightly forward and go through thengov john 
connally of texas 
but the surgeon who operated on connally in dallas interviewed 
on the program doubted that the bullet could have done that damage 
and remain nearly intact the bullet recovered later at the 
hospital had little damage 
nova producers also had a fuzzy photograph which some say showed 
a gunman on the grassy knoll analyzed by scientists at the 
massachusetts institute of technology and polaroid corp the 
analysis was inconclusive 
the program did not explore other theories that say oswald was 
the lone gunman but that he and jack ruby the nightclub owner who 
shot oswald were part of an organized crime or cuban plot to kill 
the president 
cronkite said additional tests on the bullet could be helpful to 
formulate a more conclusive opinion

norway is moving to outlaw exports of heavy 
water as evidence mounts that material sold for peaceful research 
has been diverted to make nuclear weapons 
foreign minister thorvald stoltenberg has told parliament he was 
drafting a bill to halt the sales charging that other countries had 
failed to control how the water was used 
our experience from the concrete events now being pursued shows 
that control systems in some countries are being circumvented 
without those responsible facing punishment stoltenberg said 
thursday 
allegations that norway had an unwitting role in producing 
nuclear weaponry proved embarrassing for a nation known as the 
distributor of the nobel peace prize 
a norwegian tv documentary last month said as much as twothirds 
of the heavy water norway has sold may have been used in reactors 
for weapons production 
the norsk hydro as chemical company has been making heavy water 
for 50 years as a byproduct of its ammonia fertilizer production it 
has sold 450 tons of the material which looks like ordinary water 
to 38 countries 
heavy water or deuterium oxide is used as a coolant in nuclear 
reactors but it also can be used to enable reactors to run on 
natural uranium rather than enriched uranium fuel and to convert it 
into plutonium for possible use in nuclear weapons 
a law banning exports would be mostly a symbolic gesture since 
norsk hydro has reduced its output of heavy water from a peak of 20 
tons annually to less than two 
the government has been under fire for losing track of its 
shipments at least three times and failing to ensure that it was 
used for peaceful purposes 
norway sold 15 tons to a west germany company in 1983 but it 
never arrived at its stated destination the norwegians traced it to 
basel switzerland then lost it 
last week investigators confirmed the shipment was flown to 
bombay where india has a nuclear facility it apparently had 
arrived at the same time as a soviet shipment making it difficult 
to find state prosecutors said 
norway refuses to sell to india which exploded its first nuclear 
device in 1974 because it refuses to sign the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty 
in 1986 romania received a shipment of 12 tons which according 
to norwegian press reports was later sent to israel romania is the 
only soviet bloc country with full diplomatic ties with jerusalem 
in 1959 norway sold 20 tons to israel for research at a reactor 
it was then building in dimona it received an additional ton in 
1970 
claims by a former dimona technician in 1986 that nuclear 
explosives were being produced at the desert facility prompted 
norway to demand its contractual right to inspect its goods israel 
refused to open the dimona plant to outsiders 
the technician mordechai vanunu told a london newspaper that 
israel had stockpiled up to 100 warheads which would make it the 
sixthlargest nuclear power in the world vanunu was sentenced to 18 
years in prison on treason charges for his disclosures 
after months of negotiation israel and norway initialed an 
agreement under which the norwegians would be allowed to inspect the 
nine tons which remain 
but some critics have suggested the agreement was an empty 
gesture even if norway could determine whether its heavy water had 
been used to manufacture bombs 
after all we cannot sent troops to israel to get the water 
back said kaare willoch chairman of parliaments foreign 
relations committee

the seven bodies unearthed from shallow 
graves around dorothea montalvo puentes neatly kept victorian 
rooming house havent been identified but detectives have a good 
idea who they may be 
puente 59 was known to open her eightbedroom home on a 
treelined street a halfmile from the capitol to retirees the 
homeless the physically or mentally disabled and others on limited 
incomes 
she was described as a shy and kindly widow willing to take the 
needy into her big house filled with candles and statues of the 
virgin mary and jesus 
puente took street people transients elderly and disabled 
people cleaned them up fed them and appeared to give them loving 
care said peggy nickerson a social worker who sent 19 people there 
over two years 
nickerson also encouraged churches to give puente money to help 
her in her good work at christmas 
most of the boarders according to neighbors were older men 
some with mental disabilities 
puente also arranged to have herself designated as payee on the 
disability checks of at least one of her nowmissing boarders 
authorities say she is suspected of collecting welfare or 
disability benefits for other boarders as well 
nickerson said she stopped sending clients to puente about three 
months ago after she heard puente verbally abusing one boarder 
nickerson said it isnt unusual for the transient clients she 
works with to move on without leaving word and she was not 
suspicious initially when boarders she had placed in puentes home 
vanished 
but it was nickersons call to police plus a neighbors 
independent report about a different missing person that brought 
detectives to the house friday 
by monday afternoon seven bodies had been discovered most 
appear to have been buried for several months and none of have been 
positively identified yet 
we may have to search for dental records medical records and 
other things to find out who these people are police lt joe 
enloe said 
to help nickerson has provided the names of her missing clients 
and peter danna district manager of the social security 
administration said his staff would search records to see if 
recipients had lived at the house or had signed benefits over to 
puente 
nickerson and danna said it is not uncommon for persons such as 
the kind of boarders in puentes home to have welfare social 
security or disability checks cashed for them by another party 
no charges have been filed against puente but an arrest warrant 
for investigation of murder has been issued for her her whereabouts 
are unknown

vice presidentelect dan quayle announced 
monday he intends to resign his senate seat in time to give his 
successor a jump in seniority over the new class of lawmakers being 
sworn in jan 3 
quayle said he had no recommendations to make on a successor 
when he met privately with indiana gov robert orr who will make 
the appointment i evaluated everyone from top to bottom he 
told reporters afterward 
orr a republican stressed that the decision would be his to 
make and said he and quayle talked about a whole lot of people 
thats confidential 
the list of possible successors includes rep dan coats a former 
aide to quayle who holds the house seat once occupied by quayle 
indiana house speaker dan paul mannweiler and mitchell daniels a 
former white house political director with close ties to sen 
richard lugar 
other names mentioned include marion county prosecutor steve 
goldsmith lt gov john mutz who was defeated in the election for 
governor last week and indianapolis mayor william hudnut 
others whose names have cropped up include former indiana 
secretary of state edwin simcox onetime environmental protection 
administration chief william ruckelshaus and rep dan burton 
quayles wife marilyn has passed up several opportunities to 
say whether reports of her interest in the seat are true although 
the vice presidentelect told reporters that she intends to issue a 
statement shortly 
speculation on a new indiana senator picked up monday as 
presidentelect george bush said in florida that he had no 
specifics yet on the duties quayle will hold in the new 
administration 
bush said his campaign pledge that quayle will head a space 
council stands but he said his wish to have quayle serve as drug 
czar has been complicated by legislation requiring that the head of 
the program not hold any other position in the government 
officials also announced that quayle would sit on on tuesday when 
bush meets with visiting west german chancellor helmut kohl 
quayle issued a statement about his senate seat after his meeting 
with orr whose appointee will serve until a special election in 
november 1990 
in a brief statement quayle seemed to raise the possibility that 
orr would designate a new senator before the post became officially 
vacant privately some republicans with ties to the state have said 
they expect an appointment well before the end of the year 
orr is expected to meet within the next several days to discuss 
the senate seat with republican sen richard lugar indianas senior 
senator 
in a brief statement quayle said he told orr he intends to 
resign his seat before jan 3 the date incoming senators are sworn 
in for the 101st congress a new senator sworn in before that date 
would have an advantage over other newcomers when it came to 
parceling out the perquisites of office 
it also could translate to better committee assignments and in 
time a larger staff 
quayles statement said the effective day of his senate 
resignation would probably be jan 1st or 2nd should governor orr 
name someone to fill the senate seat prior to the first of the year 
the vice presidentelect has pledged that he and his senate staff 
will work with the appointee to make the transition a smooth one

the likely chairman next year of the house 
banking committee said monday he will ask the treasury secretary and 
chairman of the federal reserve to push for a 50 billion loan to 
the agency that rescues insolvent savings institutions 
henry b gonzalez dtexas told the national association of 
mortgage brokers that his first priority as chairman would be the 
savings and loan crisis 
gonzalez is the senior member of the committee and has the 
backing of house leaders to take over from the current chairman 
rep fernand j st germain dri who lost his bid for a 15th 
house term 
he told the mortgage brokers that he has asked to meet with 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady to present the plan and would 
also seek a meeting with federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
under the proposal the treasury would open a 50 billion line of 
credit to the federal savings and loan insurance corp money from 
the sale of loans and repossessed property from the failed sampls 
could then be funneled back to the treasury 
gonzalez said his recommendation could be accomplished with 
little or no legislation he acknowledged that the administration 
has resisted any use of taxpayer funds in the crisis but he said 
it might be more receptive now after the presidential election 
nobody wanted much to rock the boat before the election he 
said 
the federal deposit insurance corp which insures commercial 
banks but has been tracking sampl losses estimates it will cost 65 
billion to clean up the sampl mess the most recent figures for the 
second quarter of this year show that the problem is growing by 15 
billion a year fdic spokesman alan j whitney said monday 
the fslic its broke theres no other way to put it 
gonzalez said nobody wants a taxpayer bailout but there 
are limits to what the industry can do and theyve reached those 
limits 
later speaking with reporters he said if it ever gets around 
that theres nothing insuring those accounts and deposits you could 
have chaos 
after insolvent sampls are closed gonzalez said he would preserve 
the conventional sampl system aided by a national housing trust to 
stabilize mortgage interest rates

a former miskito indian rebel 
leader accused the leftist government of reneging on a peace pact 
and refused to rule out a return to battle unless the sandinistas 
make good on their promises 
i havent received the promised political moral or economic 
support uriel vanegas 24 said in a weekend interview in this 
atlantic coast city 
slightly more than a year ago vanegas and 400 of his troops 
ended their more than 7yearold war against the sandinista 
government with an agreement that allowed the rebels to return to 
civilian life but keep their ussupplied arms 
the war along the isolated socalled miskito coast virtually 
ended with vanegas decision to stop fighting since then the 
sandinistas under the direction of interior minister tomas borge 
have signed similar pacts with other miskito sumo and rama indian 
groups 
my decision was for the best vanegas said shortly before 
meeting with borge to discuss the agreements progress 
but he charged that the government has sought to disarm and 
harass his troops failed to provide them with enough economic 
support and barred them from holding political meetings 
i cant visit the indian communities they the sandinistas 
are afraid ill have contact with the contras he said referring 
to the main usbacked nicaraguan rebel group there is a lot of 
mistrust 
vanegas said that about 100 of his men had returned to the 
battlefield during the past year 
he said the contras also have banned him from going to some 
remote villages 
they say we surrendered and consider us the enemies they wont 
let us come into their territory were caught in the middle 
vanegas said 
the indian groups received some of the millions of dollars that 
the reagan administration gave the contras but most of the money 
went to rebels operating out of honduras on the northern front and 
to a lesser extent the southern front along the costa rican border 
the sandinistas and the nonindian contra leaders signed a 
ceasefire agreement in march the sides have failed to agree to a 
permanent truce but most of the fighting has stopped 
the war wont help the poor vanegas said the war enriches 
those who have the arms and those who make the arms the miskitos 
could begin a war much stronger or there could be a lasting peace 
that depends on the policies of the government 
asked if this meant he would again take up arms he said yes 
we will fight go to war its up to the government 
borge on a trip to the atlantic coast held three closeddoor 
sessions during the weekend with vanegas and leaders of other groups 
that gave up the fight 
borge said later that vanegas aired his complaints and had 
indicated quite the opposite from intending to return to war 
several of the indians asked borge for more government money a 
request not easily filled in this financially devastated nation the 
economy suffered a severe blow when hurricane joan struck nicaragua 
last month and ravaged the southern atlantic coastal city of 
bluefields

michael dukakis would have won the 1988 
presidential election if he had followed john f kennedys example 
and embraced the term liberal early in his campaign sen edward 
m kennedy said monday 
speaking at harvards john f kennedy school of government the 
56yearold democrat maintained that the liberal tradition of the 
democratic party is alive and well and strong in america and 
this election was eminently winnable 
about 250 students and faculty members jammed a lecture hall for 
the speech one of a weeklong series of events commemorating the 
25th anniversary of president kennedys assassination on nov 22 
1963 
i know how my brother would have ridiculed the republican 
attempts in the recent election campaign to make liberal a dirty 
word they tried that trick in the 1960 election too and my 
brother rejected it out of hand kennedy said 
he embraced the liberal label without hesitation he didnt run 
away from it he welcomed it and he campaigned proudly under its 
banner 
and i believe that if he had started campaigning that way a few 
weeks earlier mike dukakis and not george bush would be taking the 
oath of office next january as the next president of the united 
states 
dukakis the massachusetts governor and democratic presidential 
nominee initially took a defensive posture toward republican 
assertions that he was a liberal whose views were out of the 
mainstream he did not call himself a liberal until the final two 
weeks of the campaign 
far from being out of the mainstream kennedy said the current 
liberal positions on issues like day care parental leaves national 
health insurance education and the minimum wage have received broad 
support in opinion polls 
i believe when the economic issues are level this country is 
basically for the democratic agenda he said 
twenty years ago kennedy added liberals had to deal with very 
tough questions like busing for racial integration withdrawal 
from vietnam and the tradeoff between jobs and environmental 
protection 
by contrast he said the current agenda consists mainly of 
family issues which are supported by 80 percent of the public 
the sixterm senator also contended that the need to reduce the 
federal budget deficit may boost support for the democratic position 
on defense 
i think youll see a dramatic change hopefully in terms of 
americans understanding of defense issues in the past the 
people who wanted to stop weapon systems were always accused of 
being weak on defense now that debate hopefully will change he 
said 
asked by a student if jack kennedy would have withdrawn us 
forces from vietnam if he had not been assassinated the senator at 
first said that its not worthwhile to speculate on it in 
terms of fairness to those that succeeded him 
but he added my own sense is we would have found a way out 
kennedy said he believed george bush was not as ideological 
as ronald reagan and would work with the democratic majority in 
congress on issues like education 
adopting a conciliatory tone in an otherwise partisan speech 
kennedy congratulated bush on being the first sitting vice president 
since martin van buren in 1836 to win election to the presidency 
ill just point out though that martin van buren turned out 
to be a oneterm president he said

associates of a former administrator of a 
group home for the retarded had feared that he might seek revenge 
for his dismissal but didnt anticipate the violent reaction that 
left two people dead 
people thought there would be some attempt to hurt people but 
not physically most people thought he would sue said peter 
kowalski executive director of john f murphy homes the nonprofit 
organization that took over the group home in mechanic falls after 
it emerged from bankruptcy 
authorities said alan matterson embittered by being fired 18 
months ago for mismanagement went on a 3hour rampage that started 
late saturday in new hampshire and ended early sunday when he killed 
himself with a shot in the head while fleeing police in maine 
also killed was a state official whose duties involved regulation 
of community care facilities and three people were wounded another 
state official a former bookkeeper for the mechanic falls home and 
the bookkeepers sisterinlaw 
the shootings which began saturday night in milton mills nh 
came on the eve of an open house marking the dedication of main 
street mechanic falls as the group home for 14 retarded people is 
now known 
kowalski said monday that advertisements for sundays open house 
had appeared in local newspapers and it was likely that matterson 
36 of cumberland was aware of the event 
that may have been the straw that broke the camels back 
said janet tillson a nursing supervisor who became interim director 
of the group home after mattersons dismissal 
i dont know whether it was coincidence or whether it was one 
of the events that might have caused him to crack that may be one 
of the questions we never know the answer to state police 
spokesman steve mccausland said 
the shootings took place at the victims homes spread over a 
distance of 75 miles as part of a methodically executed plan 
apparently motivated by a desire for vengeance mccausland said 
matterson was armed with a pair of 44caliber revolvers and had 
80 rounds of ammunition in his car said detective timothy culbert 
investigators didnt know where he was headed when a gardiner police 
officer spotted his car and gave chase but culbert said he may have 
been stalking other state officials he felt were reponsible for 
destroying his career 
he didnt have a list per se he didnt have anything written 
down culbert said 
details about mattersons activities over the past year were 
sketchy although authorities said he had been living with his 
parents in cumberland at the time of the shootings the parents 
could not be reached for comment their telephone number is unlisted 
state officials and former associates said matterson was a poor 
administrator who was forced to relinquish previous jobs because of 
his poor management skills 
kowalski said matterson was regarded by employees at the mechanic 
falls home as very very introverted a loner who did not 
associate with the people around him 
culbert said mattersons life had come apart under the strain of 
his dismissal and the prospect that he would no longer be able to 
find a job in the field in which he had been trained 
this was his whole life to run a nursing home or a mental 
retardation center he had the certification and the schooling 
culbert said when they took it away from him they took away 
everything

in a memorial by turns lighthearted sentimental 
and poignant colleagues and admirers recalled monday the career of 
joshua logan who directed produced or wrote some of americas most 
honored plays and films 
he was among the greats of the american theater president 
reagan said in a message from the white house mentioning among 
logans achievements south pacific mister roberts and my 
own favorite this is the army 
reagan had a role in a movie version of that one a 1942 gi 
show and it took him right to the white house as you all 
remember wisecracked arlene francis who read the presidents 
tribute from the stage of the shubert theater where celebrating 
josh played for an audience of about 1000 
logan died in new york on july 12 at age 79 
james stewart a classmate of logans at princeton in the late 
1920s said i will always be grateful with all my heart to josh 
because he gave me my acting career 
stewart said it all came about in a few minutes after receiving 
his degree in architecture with every intention of returning for 
graduate work but letting logan sweettalk him into spending the 
summer with the university players 
i said fine and ive been an actor ever since said stewart 
joanne woodward said her life was changed when logan hired her in 
1952 to understudy kim stanley and janice rule in the broadway 
production of picnic during which i learned more about acting 
that one time than the rest of my life she also met paul newman 
her husband who had a small role and understudied the lead 
in a film clip that opened the tribute logan called himself 
one of the worlds luckiest men 
i was lucky enough to be born at the right time so that i could 
work with the greatest composers and lyricists and book writers in 
the golden age of american musical comedy golden because you 
could understand the words of the lyrics and when you understood 
them they were worth understanding

black leaders said they were 
disappointed monday after the us supreme court refused to review a 
lawsuit filed over the composition of the leon county commission 
it would have been a precedentsetting case said henry 
lewis a pharmacology professor and the countys first and only 
black commissioner 
even though lewis said the current system revised since the 
original lawsuit was filed worked he noted that reapportionment 
was coming up in four years and there was a danger that blacks could 
be shortchanged 
anita davis president of the tallahassee branch of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people also said monday 
that currently the good outweighs the bad 
in 1983 when the naacp sued leon countys five commissioners 
were elected atlarge the lawsuit contended that system illegally 
diluted the voting strength of black residents who comprised 25 
percent of the population of leon county which is tallahassee and 
the surrounding area 
the plaintiffs urged that the commission consist of five members 
each elected from a district 
when the commissioners revamped the system in 1986 however it 
adopted a plan that provides for five commissioners from districts 
and two atlarge 
so we got part of what we wanted and it seems to be fair 
davis said monday 
but the naacp argued that the plan lacked the status of a 
legislative enactment in part because it was not approved by 
referendum it said florida law required such county reapportionment 
plans to be approved by the voters 
the thing is the county should have at least offered the 
opportunity for the electorate to decide but they did not 
davis said they just took it upon themselves 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals upheld the current plan 
and on monday the supreme court with one dissenting vote left 
that ruling intact the votes of at least four justices are required 
to grand such review and only justice harry a blackum voted to 
hear arguments in the case 
the appeals court said the plan adopted by the board of 
commissioners was legislatively enacted in effect similar to 
one approved by a state legislature 
a broad definition of legislatively enacted leaves 
reapportionment to be performed by a legislative body of the state 
rather than the federal judiciary the appeals court said 
davis said she did not know if the naacp would pursue the matter 
the new plan led to election in november 1986 of six whites and 
one black commissioners generally serve for four years although 
some members are serving twoyear terms 
gayle nelson a commissioner since 1978 said she was relieved 
the legal action was finished i think that any time you have a 
lawsuit behind you youre always glad she said 
i think its the best of both worlds she said in defense of 
the current system

sen john w warner rva met with state 
political leaders and space agency and defense officials on monday 
to coordinate efforts to funnel enough federal contracts to avtex 
fibers inc to keep its front royal va rayon plant operating 
avtex fibers the sole supplier of rayon fibers used in the space 
shuttle and several military missiles was shut down for several 
days this month idling 1300 employees avtex chairman john n 
gregg complained of foreign competition and stiff environmental 
regulations 
the plant resumed operations last thursday after the company said 
it had negotiated a longterm contract with several aerospace 
companies 
the national aeronautics and space administration reportedly 
arranged a 7 million contract last week for avtex with the promise 
of additional contracts if avtex raised 20 million by this friday 
to remain open 
warner a member of the senate armed services committee said 
after mondays meeting that nasa and the defense department are 
cooperating in trying to arrange enough contracts to solve avtexs 
shortterm cash flow problem avtex reportedly says it needs a total 
of 45 million to keep operating 
the senator said that within the next couple of days he will 
hold another meeting with avtex executives the us and virginia 
attorneys general and representatives of federal and state 
environmental agencies to discuss claims against the front royal 
plant for past safety and pollution violations 
warner said some agreement must be reached that would allow avtex 
to receive government contract payments without the threat that 
federal money would be diverted to pay off environmental and safety 
claims 
virginia attorney general mary sue terry filed a 20 million suit 
against avtex of nov 2 alleging nearly 2000 water pollution 
violations over the last eight years at the front royal plant about 
60 miles west of washington dc 
the good news is that people are looking at this thing with the 
idea of lets make it work warner said he said the rayon 
fibers produced by avtex were essential to our national security 
and the us space program 
warner said he is trying to arrangement appointment of a single 
federal official to represent such agencies as nasa the pentagon 
the environmental protection agency and the occupational safety and 
health administration and a similar official to represent state 
interests in negotiations over the plant

human rights violations have risen sharply 
this year in el salvador where both the government and guerrillas 
are to blame for an increase in bloodshed a un report said monday 
the report which echoes a similar accusations made by amnesty 
international last week said death squads linked to the military 
have stepped up their violent tactics in 1988 
an alarming number of politically motivated summary executions 
including mass executions have been carried out by members of the 
state apparatus particularly the armed forces said the un 
report 
but it also said leftist guerrillas have persisted in 
assassinating people who collaborate with the armed forces 
it said guerrilla groups have revived the equally disturbing 
practice of indiscriminate urban terrorism which seriously 
endangers the lives and physical integrity of civilians 
it said that the rebels continuing systematic attacks on the 
countrys economic infrastructure also seriously undermine the 
present and future enjoyment by salvadoran citizens of important 
economic social and cultural rights 
meanwhile guillermo ungo an opposition candidate for president 
told a news conference here monday that there is no chance to have 
a fair election when the army controls the main political 
structure 
ungo is the presidential candidate of the democratic convergence 
a coalition of three leftist parties 
he also is president of the democratic revolutionary front which 
is allied with the farabundo marti national liberation front the 
umbrella organization of five guerrilla groups fighting the 
usbacked government 
in el salvador as in chile just because there are elections 
doesnt mean there is democracy ungo said in english 
he said he agreed with some aspects of the un human rights 
report but said it did not adequately recognize the problems of war 
and that both sides not only the rebels use mines and grenades 
the increased activity of death squads comes at a time when 
president jose napoleon duarte is suffering from cancer and leftist 
leaders are reentering the country after guerrillas agreed to let 
their political wings participate in a march 1989 presidential 
election 
duarte a centrist who has vigorously opposed the death squads 
is not a candidate in the election 
the un report was prepared by jose antonio pastor ridruejo 
special representative of the commission on human rights which 
requested an investigationridruejo visited the el salvador oct 
915 
the report said that armed forces occasionally kill and injure 
civilians but that guerrillas continue to cause more civilian 
deaths and injuries than the army as a result of the explosion of 
contact mines and guerrilla fire 
in washington amnesty international usa also noted what it said 
was an alarming resurgence of death squad activity in the 
country 
it said an average of 12 death squadstyle killings per month 
occurred in el salvador in 1987 and said that figure tripled during 
the first half of 1988 according to estimates by the roman catholic 
church 
more than 60000 people have died during the 9yearold war 
between the leftist rebels and the government

opec oil ministers begin a series of 
crucial meetings this week designed to impose greater discipline on 
the cartel and end the persistent weakness in world crude prices 
however industry analysts held out little expectation opec would 
reach agreement a sentiment echoed by us oil company executives 
gathered monday at the annual meeting of the american petroleum 
institute in new york 
it might take more than one or two meetings to achieve higher 
prices by limiting production said richard m morrow chairman of 
amoco corp 
the 13member organization of petroleum exporting countries is 
under intense pressure to come up with a new production agreement to 
regain some control over the chaotic market 
the alternative is for the conference to collapse in a heap 
said london oil consultant paul mcdonald 
two of the cartels committees plan joint discussions starting 
thursday in vienna austria all 13 ministers are scheduled to meet 
next monday for their regular winter meeting 
saudi arabia and other opec members have turned up their 
production levels in recent months as they compete for market 
position in advance of the meetings 
the increased output has added more crude to an already glutted 
market pushing prices 4 or more below opecs benchmark price of 
18 per 42gallon barrel 
each 1 drop in the price of crude oil theoretically means a fall 
of 25 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices however us oil 
companies have not passed on to consumers the current price decline 
partly because of the tight supplies of gasoline coupled with high 
demand 
if the opec ministers succeeded in putting together a new 
production package oil prices should rise some in the coming 
months analysts said 
failure they said could send prices into a nosedive 
if they come up with a convincing system we could see prices 
go up a couple of dollars said david gray an oil analyst at the 
london investment firm of james capel and co if not prices could 
be below 10 quite quickly 
charles j dibona president of the american petroleum institute 
the main trade group for the us oil business said i am 
optimistic that they will reach an agreement the question is how 
soon 
the international energy agency estimated in its monthly oil 
market report that opec production soared to almost 211 million 
barrels a day in october the highest monthly output for more than 
five years 
the cartels current production quotas stemming from a december 
1986 arrangement are intended to limit total output to about 15 
million barrels a day that excludes iraq which ignored its quota 
several opec members have recommended that the cartel boost its 
output ceiling to 174 million barrels which would still require a 
sharp overall cutback by the cartel 
the vienna meetings goals are to try to come up with new quotas 
bring iraq back into the system and stop the cheating by the 
cartels members

presidentelect george bush tried to soothe 
jitters on financial markets monday by promising quick action on the 
budget deficit while his advisers signaled an early appointment of 
an economics team expected to be led by treasury secretary nicholas 
brady 
bush meanwhile fueled speculation about his white house 
appointments by inviting new hampshire gov john sununu to dinner at 
a vacation retreat in florida sununu is considered a leading 
candidate to be chief of staff so is craig fuller chief of staff 
in bushs vice presidential office 
as bush relaxed at the gulf stream home of millionaire friend 
william stamps farish iii his aides said the vice president planned 
to consider candidates this week for senior cabinet posts a list of 
three to five names was being drawn up for each post the aides said 
bush will return to washington on tuesday he is expected to 
announce that brady a longtime adviser and friend will remain as 
treasury secretary after jan 20 when the bush administration 
begins 
leaders of bushs transition team said the presidentelect wants 
to consider four or five senior cabinet choices this week they said 
he especially wants to assemble his economic team rapidly which 
also is likely to include former deputy treasury secretary richard 
darman as budget chief and stanford university professor michael j 
boskin as chief white house economic adviser 
i think that the economic team under any circumstance would 
be one youd want to pay attention to early on said robert 
teeter a codirector of the transition with fuller 
bushs words of assurance about the deficit seemed to have some 
effect the dow jones industrial average of 30 stocks which had 
lost almost 80 points since bushs election including a 47point 
drop friday steadied and ended the day monday down only 195 
points the dollar also recovered some of its losses 
bush has no timetable for making appointments and will announce 
them as decisions are made fuller said bush already has named 
former treasury secretary james a baker iii as the new secretary of 
state 
but bush said monday he will hold back on any special 
missions involving baker because he doesnt want to preempt the 
official foreign policy machinery of this administration 
asked specifically about his policy toward nicaragua bush 
speaking to reporters on the beach said those who are looking for 
radical policy shifts wont find them now if youre looking for new 
initiatives or something of that nature maybe well have something 
to say on that but in terms of reiterating my support for the 
freedom fighters im glad to keep on doing that 
bush also did nothing to dampen speculation that the white house 
would be run by a powersharing triumverate of sununu fuller and 
teeter stay tuned ill have announcements on that pretty soon 
bush said 
on his return to washington bush and vice presidentelect dan 
quayle will meet tuesday with visiting west german chancellor helmut 
kohl bush also is to meet wednesday with british prime minister 
margaret thatcher 
bush said he had not spoken to quayle since the day before he 
came to florida asked what functions quayle would perform he said 
no specifics yet i had a very good meeting with sen quayle 
but we didnt get into specific assignments 
he said that his campaign pledge that quayle would head a space 
council is a given but he said that his wish that quayle head 
the antidrug war has been complicated a little bit by the new 
legislation calling for the appointment of a fulltime drug czar 
i have to get were getting a good legal opinion i must 
comply with the law but i think that a president can have people 
report to him any way he wants but i want to know more about it 
before i can go further bush said 
meanwhile quayle said he will resign his senate seat before jan 
3 probably a day o two earlier that will allow outgoing indiana 
gov robert orr to name a republican replacement before democratic 
govelect evan bayh is sworn in 
the list of possible senate successors includes rep dan coats a 
former aide to quayle who holds the seat in the house that the vice 
presidentelect once held indiana house speaker dan mannweiler 
county prosecutor steve goldsmith lt gov john mutz who was 
defeated last week in a bid to become the states governor and 
indianapolis mayor william hudnut others whose names have cropped 
up include former epa administrator william ruckelshaus rep dan 
burton and mitchell daniels a former white house political director 
and former close adviser to sen richard lugar quayles wife 
marilyn also has been mentioned 
bushs strategists hope bradys reappointment will calm turmoil 
on world financial markets where the value of the dollar and stock 
prices have skidded because of uncertainty about the economic 
policies he will pursue 
bush minimizing market jitters said these gyrations happen 
bush pledged to follow the reagan admnistrations policy of 
coordinated intervention with us allies in exchange marekets when 
major currencies rise or fall too quickly 
trying to assure the financial community that he will move 
quickly to deal with the huge budget deficit bush said i will 
address myself to that early on in my presidency it is a matter 
of great urgency 
in washington fuller and teeter talked by telephone with the 
vacationing bush fuller said they were preparing a list of three to 
five names for each major appointment he has to make 
the vice president does want to look at a series of names 
teeter said he wants to examine some of the criteria and some of 
the issues that will be facing each of those departments so that he 
can consider people in that context but he certainly wants to look 
at a series of names for each and every job he made that clear to 
us last week 
there are four or five senior jobs in the cabinet that are all 
being looked at right now and that he is going to want to meet on 
and consider this week teeter said he said that in most cases 
bush would want to talk with candidates before picking one 
asked about the timing for naming a defense secretary teeter 
said i dont think its particularly close 
a transition source said that while some people will be appointed 
quickly others will take weeks as they undergo a full fbi 
background check that takes two to four weeks

a coroner heading an inquest 
into the 1982 slayings of three unarmed ira guerrillas refused 
monday to order testimony from three police officers involved in the 
shootings 
the inquest into the slayings opened monday before an 11member 
jury sitting in craigavon 19 miles southwest of belfast 
the jury is to establish the circumstances surrounding the 
shooting deaths of gervase mckerr eugene toman and sean burns the 
irish republican army has acknowledged the three as members 
an hour after the hearing began a lawyer for the family of 
mckerr 31 walked out in protest when coroner james elliott refused 
to summon three officers to testify 
attorney pat finnucane said he would ask the northern ireland 
high court to order the officers to answer questions at the inquest 
the officers were involved in the shooting but a belfast court 
acquitted them of murder charges 
elliott said the officers would present statements but could not 
be compelled to testify finnucane then left saying the ruling 
allowed the officers to have their cake and eat it he said the 
mckerr family had instructed him to appeal to the high court 
the three ira men were shot and killed in a police ambush on nov 
11 1982 as they drove through county armagh a hotbed of guerrilla 
activity 
three more unarmed roman catholics two of them guerrillas and 
one apparently an innocent teenager died in unclear circumstances 
in two more police ambushes in county armagh over the next month 
the overwhelmingly catholic ira is fighting to expell the british 
from protestantdominated northern ireland and unite it with the 
irish republic 
northern ireland secretary tom king britains top official in 
the province has barred the inquest from investigating certain 
circumstances of the shootings which he considers would be 
detrimental to the national security 
kings order signed last week expressed concern about 
jeopardizing present and future counterterrorist operations 
a screen heavily guarded by policemen concealed the identities 
of police officers giving testimony and up to one dozen officers 
will be identified only by letters of the alphabet 
the first to testify was a detective inspector of the royal 
ulster constabularys intelligencegathering unit called e4a 
the officer identified only as ak said that at a briefing on 
the morning of the shooting intelligence was given of a planned ira 
attack he said burns and toman were wanted for questioning about 
terrorist activity and that it was thought they were armed

mikhail s gorbachev will come to britain next 
month for his first official visit since becoming soviet leader in 
1985 prime minister margaret thatcher announced monday 
mrs thatcher said in her annual address to the lord mayors 
banquet in the city of london the capitals financial district 
that the visit of gorbachev and his wife raisa was scheduled for 
dec 1214 
i am very pleased to announce tonight that mr gorbachev has 
accepted our invitation and that he and mrs gorbachev will come 
here next month she said we shall give them a very warm 
welcome 
it will be the fifth meeting of the two leaders mrs thatcher 
issued her invitation during a visit to moscow in april 1987 and 
repeated it last december when gorbachev stopped here briefly on his 
way to a summit with president reagan 
the prime minister departing from her prepared text monday paid 
tribute to the soviet president and communist party chief but said 
soviet vested interests would prevent immediate change 
we very much welcome what mr gorbachev is trying to achieve in 
the soviet union but we shouldnt expect change to come quickly 
she said of gorbachevs plans for economic and social reform the 
vested interests opposed to it are immensely strong as mr 
gorbachev frequently reminds us after ensuring a strong defense 
in the west mrs thatcher declared it is important to encourage 
change and reform in the soviet union and eastern europe 
we want to see their countries more prosperous with their 
peoples enjoying a fuller share of lifes benefits she said we 
must do everything we can to stretch out hands across the divide

public health officials should take advantage of 
upheavals in the nuclear weapons industry to demand a full 
accounting of the plants activities members of the american public 
health association said monday 
whats happening today is very very important and is a real 
opportunity for change said anthony robbins professor of public 
health at boston university and treasurer for international 
physicians for the prevention of nuclear war 
we must not miss the opportunity to end this ever expanding but 
largely hidden public health disaster he said at a news 
conference called by the radioactive waste campaign one of several 
events in the aphas fourday meeting in boston 
concern has grown as the energy department has disclosed problems 
at some of its nuclear production plants and has wholly or partly 
closing down four of its 17 major facilities officials have 
estimated cleanup will cost 110 billion 
the three reactors at the savannah river plant a nuclear weapons 
facility near aiken sc have been shut down because of safety 
problems doe officials have said tritium gas has accidentally 
leaked from the reactors on several occasions but they added the 
amounts of the gas did not pose a danger to public health 
the savannah reactors make tritium and plutonium needed in 
nuclear weapons they will have to be reopened within six months to 
ensure a continued supply said chris west a doe spokesman 
we do not want to operate unsafe reactors or any unsafe 
facilities but on the other hand weve got the crunch west said 
he said energy department experts are evaluating the savannah 
plant and hope to have it restarted by december although that date 
is tentative 
the bottom line is that this countrys national defense is 
based on the nuclear deterrent and basically it has been since the 
truman administration west said 
last year the apha endorsed a resolution calling for a ban on 
nuclear testing 
these facilities must be phased out said jennie tichenor a 
nurse and assistant director of the new york citybased radioactive 
waste campaign she said the federal government should close them 
down undo as much as possible and never repeat it 
the panel called for appropriating money to retrain workers who 
would lose their jobs if the plants were closed down exhuming 
onsite waste making the energy department subject to public 
scrutiny and conducting epidemiological studies of workers

less than a week after california voters threw the 
insurance business into turmoil by ordering a rate rollback 
allstate insurance co announced monday it is leaving massachusetts 
because of losses and frustration over the states regulatory 
climate 
the announcement came about a week after several insurers doing 
business in california promised to leave the nations biggest market 
after voters approved a measure providing deep cuts in auto and 
other insurance rates 
kevin sullivan director of allstates group auto division told 
a news conference that allstate has lost 115 million in 
massachusetts over the past five years largely due to the unique 
regulatory environment for auto insurance 
allstate would be the third major insurer to abandon 
massachusetts following kemper group and firemans fund insurance 
cos two smaller companies also have pulled out 
allstate will not renew its license when it expires june 30 
until then it will sell new policies and follow through on current 
ones until they expire he said 
peter rice deputy massachusetts insurance commissioner reacted 
with complete surprise 
i guess our overall assessment is we think the company was 
premature in assessing the effect of the recently passed auto reform 
bill on the market rice said 
last week a bill was signed that will reduce 1989 insurance 
premiums by 16 percent or 400 million by cracking down on fraud 
and abuse reducing required coverages and limiting the number of 
auto cases that end up in court the legislation comes after 
industry court challenges and rate decisions increased massachusetts 
rates by nearly one third since 1986 to among the highest in the 
country 
sullivan said allstate saw encouraging improvements in the bill 
but he said it did not restore free markets 
massachusetts requires all companies wishing to sell any form of 
insurance in the state participate in an open highrisk auto 
insurance pool 
in addition state law forbids open competition for automobile 
insurance instead the state insurance commissioner annually 
calculates a single statewide rate for each category of compulsory 
and optional insurance only texas has a similar system 
allstate based in northbrook ill has 66 percent of the 
massachusetts auto insurance market and 52 percent of the states 
homeowners insurance market 
massachusetts accounts for some 199 million of allstates 
premiums annually or about 2 percent of the companys business in 
the united states 
in california voters last week approved proposition 103 which 
mandates that property and casualty insurers roll their rates back 
to a level 20 percent below those in effect on nov 8 1987 in 
addition drivers with good records would get an additional 20 
percent off 
however the california supreme court has delayed the start of 
the law while it considers its constitutionality 
allstate had no intention to pull out of california saying the 
key difference is that california allows open competition 
sullivan said

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said monday that 168 un workers have been arrested detained or 
kidnapped over in a oneyear period and urged member nations to 
guarantee the safety of his staff 
it is painful for me to recall the names of our colleagues 
including lt col william higgins and mr alec collett who are 
still in captivity or missing he said the united nations has 
so far been rendered unable to extend to them the protection which 
is their right 
higgins a us marine was abducted feb 17 while serving as 
chief of a 75man observer corps attached to the un peacekeeping 
force in lebanon a group calling itself the organization of the 
oppressed on earth claimed responsibility 
collett a briton was seized march 25 1985 while on assignment 
in lebanon for the un relief and works agency 
they are among 14 foreigners including nine americans missing 
in lebanon the hostage held longest is terry a anderson chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press who was abducted 
march 16 1985 
the revolutionary organization of socialist moslems believed 
linked to palestinian terrorist abu nidal claimed on april 23 
1986 to have hanged collett in retaliation for the us air raid on 
libya but no body was found 
perez de cuellar said the 168 un workers were reported 
arrested detained or abducted from july 1 1987 through june 30 
1988 in 16 member nations or territories 
more than 100 staff or members of their families still remain 
imprisoned or detained have disappeared or died or are being held 
against their will in a country said a report he submitted to the 
general assemblys fifth committee which deals with personnel 
problems 
most were members of the un relief and works agency detained in 
the israelioccupied gaza strip or west bank the report said 
adding that other members of the relief agencys staff are detained 
or missing in syria or held in lebanon by militias or unknown 
elements 
i must emphasize that it is also the responsibility of member 
states individually as well as collectively to arrange that staff 
members may perform their individual duties effectively free from 
arrest detention or abduction the secretarygeneral declared 
he said governments should guarantee arrested or detained un 
employees access to other un staff members within 24 hours and 
furnish a written explanation within 48 hours 
the report prepared by the federation of international civil 
servants associations listed 110 cases of un workers whose 
fundamental rights had been violated including some cases dating to 
the 1970s 
eight un workers were arrested or prevented from carrying out 
their duties in afghanistan in 19791984 including bismillah kamkai 
of the un development program who was put to death and tawakal 
shah of the un childrens fund imprisoned and believed dead the 
report said

more oil workers walked off the job 
monday joining a strike that has virtually paralyzed the petroleum 
refining industry in latin americas biggest country 
some workers at offshore and land wells joined the strike by 
refinery workers that began friday according to petrobras the 
stateowned oil monopoly 
petrobras spokesman lucio pimentel said 80 percent of brazils 
60000 oil workers were now on strike and our guess is that this 
percentage will keep growing 
the strike has shut down eight of brazils 10 refineries 
refineries in the amazon jungle city of manaus and in 
centraleastern belo horizonte still were operating he said 
those two refineries have a daily production capacity of close to 
135000 barrels brazils total daily production capacity is 15 
million barrels of gasoline diesel oil cooking gas and other 
petroleum products 
mauro costa of the national strike command said by telephone 
from brasilia that the manaus and belo horizonte refineries were 
being run by nightshift crews who had been on duty thursday night 
a few hours before the strike began 
they are being forced to remain at their jobs by petrobras 
which is pressuring them with threats of dismissal costa said 
petrobras would not comment on costas charges 
pimentel estimated petrobras had enough gasoline and diesel oil 
stockpiled to last 10 more days cooking gas supplies were 
sufficient for five days 
brazil consumes about 11 million barrels of fuel a day he added 
brazil has 6987 oil wells on land and 1088 offshore wells with 
a total output of 560000 barrels a day pimentel said the strike 
has cut production by about 100000 barrels 
costa said the strikers were demanding a 354 percent pay 
increase while petrobras offered close to 70 percent he said oil 
workers earn an average of about 300 a month 
inflation in brazil is running at over 1000 percent a year 
last week durval gomes of the rio de janeiro refinery workers 
union said the strikers were demanding a 154 percent increase and 
that the average wage was 1365 a month 
i dont know where gomes got those figures but they are 
completely wrong costa said

prosecutors across the country are compiling 
detailed reports on narcotics trafficking in their areas as part of 
a federal effort to focus attention on the nations drug problem 
the justice department sent a memo to us attorneys nov 4 
calling for detailed analyses spelling out the financial structure 
of narcotics trafficking the involvement of legitimate and 
nonlegitimate businesses and other details about drug 
organizations 
the directive was based on a recent speech in which attorney 
general dick thornburgh asked the prosecutors to outline the 
corporate structure of narcotics trafficking so that we can fully 
educate the american public 
the memo from laurence mcwhorter director of the executive 
office for us attorneys says that your analysis will become a 
part of a public document 
your report should be based upon matters of public record 
as well as present investigations to the extent that such 
information will not compromise sensitive ongoing investigations 
said mcwhorters memo 
you should take the extra step of circulating your report in 
draft form to the pertinent law enforcement leadership in your 
district to assure an accurate depiction of the problem and to guard 
against disclosure of sensitive information the memo added 
the attorney general wants an interim report by dec 19 and a 
final report by march 1 
the suggested format for the report includes relevant information 
regarding accounting banking financing communication money 
laundering schemes payment of mules currency and tax fraud 
it also suggests an explanation of the impact of narcotics 
businesses on crime including the nature and extent of public 
corruption if any 
in his recent speech thornburgh said he wants to drag the 
narcotics trafficking business out from under the rock where it 
lives and breeds so that the american public will better 
understand and more enthusiastically support the difficult struggle 
in which we are engaged

firefighters worked on a wet and smother 
assault monday against a tenacious underground landfill fire that 
forced the evacuation of more than 25 families 
a contractor continued digging large trenches on two sides of the 
smoldering area monday while acrid smoke poured from about two acres 
of the 17acre landfill 
when finished the 30 feet wide by 30 feet deep and 400 feet long 
trenches are to be filled in with dirt to form a firebreak similar 
to ones used in fighting forest fires emergency services officials 
have used such phrases as supply lines and establish a 
perimeter to describe tactics used against the blaze 
it sounds like the military with all these terms said paul 
lent director of emergency services for saratoga county 
the fire which started thursday night forced the evacuation of 
25 to 30 families most of the people had found lodging with friends 
or relatives and are still being urged to stay away from their 
homes lent said 
saratoga hospital reported 35 people most of them firefighters 
had been treated for respiratory problems from the smoke 
lent said more than a million gallons of water and 30000 cubic 
yards of dirt would be used in the countys wet and smother 
strategy for putting out the fire 
but we have to make sure its out before we bury it or else 
well be back and soon lent said 
lent said it would be premature to estimate when the fire would 
be completely out 
the fire chief feels hes gained on it today but theres still 
a lot of fire out there said lee palmer spokesman for the 
saratoga county emergency services coordinator 
traces of toxic polychlorinated byphenyls or pcbs were found in 
the smoke but the state department of health said the levels of the 
chemicals did not exceed federal standards more air and water tests 
were conducted monday by the health department and the state 
department of environmental conservation results from those tests 
were expected to be released tuesday lent said 
the city of saratoga springs kept in effect a health alert 
urging residents of its west side to stay inside if they have 
respiratory problems sundays overcast skies and westerly winds 
helped spread the smoke over the city but by monday it had cleared 
although a slight acrid smell remained 
lent said the dump contains plastic piping gypsum board wood 
and other building materials placed there by its owner john rock 
who has been charged with operating a dump without a permit 
rocks landfill is classified by the state department of 
environmental conservation as a construction and demolition debris 
landfill until this year permits for such landfills were not 
required if the dumps were to be in operation for less than a year 
the concern is that a large number of them are not even 
reported to us said bob phaneuf associate sanitary engineer for 
the decs division of solid waste 
he said construction debris leaves large underground air pockets 
that allow fire to spread more easily than it would in a municipal 
landfill

the dollar bounced back monday after a weeklong 
slide supported by the japanese and us central banks and calming 
statements from american officials 
last weeks slide was brought about by fears that presidentelect 
george bush and his advisers wanted the dollar to fall to make us 
goods more competitive and shrink the trade deficit 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady helped quell those 
suspicions on sunday by issuing a statement that the 
administration remains committed to exchangerate stability 
bush backed brady on monday by saying he was fully committed to 
the reagan administrations policy of coordinated actions with other 
major countries to stabilize the value of the dollar on foreign 
exchange markets 
in contrast to last weeks bearishness people werent that 
sure today if the new administration really wants the dollar down 
said peter wild a senior trader at switzerlands bank julius baer 
co in new york 
the dollar began the trading day monday in tokyo at 12255 
japanese near the jan 4 low that was the lowest since modern 
exchange rates were established in the late 1940s 
a rebound began when the bank of japan bought dollars in the open 
market traders said the dollar closed at 12300 yen japanese 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa and bank of japan governor satoshi 
sumita said japanese authorities were ready to strengthen their 
intervention efforts if the need arose 
the dollar continued to rise in europe and the united states as 
trading followed the sun and on tuesday morning in tokyo it opened 
at 12360 yen bushs statement and dollar purchases by the federal 
reserve helped counter attempts by traders to carry the currency 
lower several traders said

prime minister margaret thatcher flies to 
washington tuesday to say goodbye to president reagan a friend with 
whom she has marched in close ideological step from the day he came 
to office 
she will also be meeting presidentelect george bush to welcome 
him into the ranks of western leaders of whom she is the 
longestserving 
reagan came to office 1 years after mrs thatcher and together 
they have reinvigorated the longstanding special relationship 
between the two countries 
but while reagan is obliged to step down mrs thatcher faces no 
such constraints her present tenure lasts another four years and 
she has served notice that she will seek an unprecedented fourth 
term in the 1990s so the likelihood is that she will be working 
with bush right up to 1992 
in a speech monday night mrs thatcher thanked reagan for 
ending the wests retreat from world responsibilty for restoring 
the pride and leadership of the us and for giving the west back 
its confidence in the success of free enterprise in the 
values which guide our societies 
mrs thatcher said bush would be a worthy successor and 
added we know him as a friend we admire him as a man of 
unrivaled experience and we respect him because he stands for all 
that is best in america 
sharing a profound anticommunist ideology distaste for 
welfarism faith in free markets and belief in negotiating from 
strength reagan and mrs thatcher have managed to agree on most of 
the issues that have confronted them through the 1980s 
they have helped each other out at critical movements and at 
great political risk reagan by approving vital arms supplies and 
intelligence to britain in the 1982 falklands war against argentina 
and mrs thatcher by allowing the reagan to use us bombers based 
on british soil to bomb libya in 1986 
we must brace ourselves for a niagara of mutual admiration 
wrote columnist george walden of the conservative daily telegraph 
previewing this last journey by mrs thatcher to the reagan white 
house the personal relationship has indeed been special 
in the view of david dimbleby and david reynolds in their recent 
book on angloamerican relations reagan and mrs thatcher have 
established one of the closest personal bonds in the history of 
angloamerican cooperation and breathed new life into the special 
relationship 
mrs thatcher arrives in washington on tuesday evening and will 
have talks with reagan wednesday followed by a state dinner on 
thursday she will have talks with bush and return home friday 
a foretaste of the emotional farewells in store came in june 
when reagan stopped in london en route home from the moscow summit 
with mikhail s gorbachev 
britain had played a role in the reagangorbachev thaw mrs 
thatcher was the first major western leader to visit the soviet 
leader and on his way to washington to sign the armsreduction 
treaty gorbachev stopped in england for talks with the prime 
minister 
reagan paid lavish tribute to mrs thatchers leadership and 
mrs thatcher responded in kind 
you have restored faith in the american dream the iron lady 
told the great communicator your personal courage your gentle 
humor and your spirit of optimism are all part of the special 
quality that you brought to the presidency 
replied reagan the entire world salutes you and your gallant 
people and gallant nation 
leftwing opponents call mrs thatcher reagans poodle 
claiming she doesnt make a move without his approval 
mrs thatcher argues that the united states as leader and 
defender of the free world must be heeded and the special 
relationship is a pillar of her foreign policy 
they dont agree on everything a believer in thrifty debtfree 
housekeeping mrs thatcher worries about the us deficit but she 
does not believe in criticizing the president outright 
i think she believes that we can only hope to influence the 
united states in private and affect their judgments if the basic 
relationship is extremely good says sir anthony parsons her 
former foreign affairs adviser

californias attorney general asked the 
state supreme court on monday to allow a voterapproved 20 percent 
cut in insurance rates to take effect while the court reviews 
insurance company lawsuits 
the voters believed that they were enacting immediate insurance 
reform with the adoption of proposition 103 attorney general john 
van de kamp said in papers filed with the court that expectation 
should not be frustrated without giving the initiative a fair chance 
to work 
he asked the court to withdraw the order it issued last thursday 
blocking enforcement of proposition 103 as an alternative van de 
kamp said the court should allow all provisions of the measure to 
take effect except the 20 percent rate rollback and should require 
insurance companies to set aside enough money to lower their 
premiums if they lose their case 
the initiative backed by consumer advocate ralph nader was 
narrowly approved by state voters last tuesday 
its provisions include a 20 percent reduction in insurance rates 
from the rates in effect in november 1987 a freeze at those levels 
until november 1989 when auto insurance rates would be cut an 
additional 20 percent for good drivers exemption from the 
rollback for insurers who could show a substantial threat of 
insolvencyney needed to enter the case 
now but were starting a fundraising drive that would let them 
intervene later 
van de kamps brief by deputy attorney general timothy laddish 
asked the court to take the proposition 103 case itself rather than 
referring it to a lower court and decide the constitutional issues 
quickly 
with californians paying billions of dollars each day in 
property and casualty insurance premiums it is obviously of great 
urgency that they and those who sell the insurance know whether 
the voters will get the relief for which they voted laddish wrote 
in urging the court to lift the stay he said insurers are not 
likely to succeed in their suits and have not shown that they 
would suffer irreparable injury if proposition 103 were allowed 
to take effect while the case was pending 
laddish said the court has rejected the same constitutional 
challenge against local rentcontrol laws that rolled back rents to 
a previous period and required administrative approval for future 
increases he compared those laws to proposition 103 which allows 
the insurance commissioner to consider a companys financial 
situation in granting exemptions from the 20 percent rollback and in 
reviewing future rate increase applications 
as a fallback position laddish contended most provisions of 
proposition 103 do not threaten immediate injury to insurers and 
should be allowed to take effect while the lawsuits are pending 
those provisions include state review of future rate increases a 
repeal of the insurance industrys exemption from state antitrust 
laws and new limits on a companys authority to refuse to renew an 
insurance policy 
the current blanket order blocking enforcement of the entire 
measure hurts consumers needlessly and may prevent the state 
department of insurance from making preparations for its new duties 
under the intiative laddish said 
if the court leaves in place its stay of the rate rollback the 
state lawyer said it should require insurance companies to set 
aside the amounts of money needed to pay for the rate reductions 
plus interest if the reductions are later upheld

many of the 53 children removed from a home 
operated by the ecclesia athletic association said monday theyre

to death and that they miss the man they call big el 
nobodys as nice to us as big el said a 13yearold boy 
referring to eldridge broussard jr 36 leader of the los 
angelesbased group and father of the slain girl 
the children were taken from a sparsely furnished farmhouse east 
of portland following the oct 14 beating death of dayna lorea 
broussard juvenile authorities claim many of the ecclesia children 
were administered ritualistic beatings of up to 800 strokes with 
electrical cords or paddles 
during brief interviews with the children monday reporters were 
prevented from asking about their life in ecclesia none of the 
childrens names was revealed 
the 22 ecclesia boys ages 3 to 14 live together in a dormitory 
on the maclaren school campus in woodburn while 15 girls ranging 
in age from 4 to 16 are living in a fourbedroom ranchstyle house 
at hillcrest school the remainder of the children are in foster 
care 
the farmhouse was used by ecclesia members to train innercity 
children in athletics as part of broussards dream of a role in a 
future olympics in africa 
the children will remain in state custody until criminal 
proceedings are completed against four adult ecclesia members 
scheduled to be tried dec 12 on firstdegree manslaughter charges 
custody proceedings will begin after the trial to determine the 
childrens fate 
several of the children have had visits from their parents but 
they have not been allowed to talk to broussard said les busch who 
has designed a program to care for the ecclesia children 
broussards frequent television appearances and news stories 
about the case have been kept from the children 
we just feel its too much for them to handle at this point 
he said 
psychiatric evaluations are scheduled this week for most of the 
children busch added 
staff members say the children have shown signs of posttraumatic 
stress disorder including anxiety bedwetting and irregular 
sleeping patterns said busch 
daynas death has been discussed with the children he said 
several of the older girls wanted to attend the girls funeral and 
the boys decorated their halloween cake with a candle lighted to 
remember their playmate who would have been 9 on oct 31 
were trying to establish a safe secure shelter situation for 
these kids said busch head of the childrens psychiatric day 
treatment center at oregon health sciences university in portland 
id rather be with my coach even though he makes us work out 
i still dont mind said one 8yearold girl 
nobodys even close to being as nice as big el added a 
14yearold boy 
several girls complained they had been in state custody for too 
long 
they lied to us said one girl they told us wed be here 
overnight and its been one month and one day

arab leaders in the israelioccupied lands 
hailed tuesdays declaration of an independent palestinian state as 
the beginning of a new era of political moderation and dialogue 
palestinians in the occupied gaza strip shot off firecrackers 
flew balloons and raised outlawed palestinian flags to celebrate the 
declaration by the plobacked palestine national council in algiers 
the algerian capital 
leaders of the 11monthold palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip also called a general 
strike tuesday to mark independence day 
the declaration was expected to fuel the uprising but was not 
believed to have much effect on everyday life in the occupied lands 
the declaration and accompanying resolutions implicitly recognize 
israels right to exist meeting some of the conditions the united 
states has set for dealing with the plo in peace talks 
but israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir reiterated his position 
that israel would never negotiate with the plo 
its not a problem of definition and formulations on various 
positions shamir said monday well not negotiate with them 
because they are opposed to peace in israel 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc was entrusted monday 
by president chaim herzog with forming a coalition government and is 
likely to be israels leader for the next four years 
shamir and other israeli leaders including foreign minister 
shimon peres of the leftofcenter labor party have said they would 
not tolerate a palestinian state in the occupied lands 
shamir also opposes returning israelioccupied territory in 
exchange for peace and holding peace talks within the framework of 
an international peace conference a forum endorsed by the plo 
instead shamir favors direct talks with arab states on limited 
palestinian autonomy 
palestinians in the occupied lands were optimistic that the 
independence declaration would lead to a political breakthrough 
west bank and gaza strip palestinians repeatedly had expressed 
their frustration with plo leaders who for months were divided over 
whether to recognize israel and renounce terror the quarreling was 
blamed for the palestinians failure to translate the uprising into 
political gains 
this is the beginning of a new era for the palestinians and the 
beginning of moderation in facing our problems said lawyer fayez 
abu rahme a prominent plo supporter in the gaza strip 
it shows the palestinians are ready to coexist with israel 
that they want a state sidebyside with israel he told the 
associated press 
abu rahme said the plos new moderate stance would enable the 
united states to exert pressure on israel to be more flexible in its 
positions washington backs an international conference and a 
territoriesforpeace formula 
on monday night palestinians in some parts of the gaza strip 
broke curfews and took to the streets in anticipation of the 
declaration of independence 
in gazas jabaliya refugee camp residents set off firecrackers 
and shouted allahu akhbar god is great an arab reporter said 
elsewhere residents flew balloons and hoisted pictures of arafat 
to express their joy other gaza strip residents remained glued to 
the radio for news from algiers 
at least 312 palestinians have been killed since a rebellion 
began dec 8 1987 among the 15 million who live in the west bank 
and gaza strip which israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 
1967 war eleven israelis also have died

detectives using backhoes and steel 
probes dug up sixth and seventh bodies monday from the yard of a 
rooming house whose missing landlady once said she took in elderly 
boarders as a way to repay society 
the sixth and seventh corpses unidentified like the others 
were discovered shortly after digging resumed monday morning 
the sixth corpse was wrapped in some type of clothing and 
buried in a shallow grave under a shed said police sgt bob burns 
the seventh was found monday afternoon by searchers using a 
backhoe under a flower bed in the front yard said lt joe enloe 
the cause of death was not immediately known 
on monday 200 spectators watched from behind police lines as 
investigators worked at the grounds of the home authorities say 
there could be eight bodies buried 
burns said police are still searching for the landlady dorothea 
montalvo puente 59 our first priority is to get her into 
custody he said 
burns said investigators were told she ran a boardandcare home 
eight or nine years ago about eight blocks away and authorities 
were interviewing tenants and neighbors there there were no 
immediate plans to dig at that property burns added 
authorities issued an allpoints bulletin for puente who 
disappeared friday after detectives interviewed her for several 
hours and released her for lack of evidence 
authorities believe the victims apparently all lowincome 
elderly people and all residents of the eightroom victorian home 
downtown were killed for their social security checks enloe said 
the payments continued to be sent to them after their disappearances 
but that someone else fraudulently cashed their checks on monday 
detectives planned to examine puentes bank records enloe said 
police were led to the house after neighbors reported that a 
friend had been missing since august and a social worker said some 
of her clients were missing 
burns said police planned to get a search warrant for the home 
which is sealed later monday 
enloe said the means of death could not be determined until 
autopsies were performed evidence linking puente to the deaths was 
found in the graves said enloe but he declined to give details 
a social worker familiar with the rooming house described the 
residents as elderly people on fixed incomes with few relatives 
the case worker peggy nickerson told police that puente had 
come to her in 1986 offering lodging nickerson said she referred 
19 clients to the house during the last two years 
she puente was the best the system had to offer she said she 
was a widow and had a big house and she said it was her time to 
give back to other people that was her story and i didnt have 
any reason to doubt her nickerson said i deal with a transient 
population and its not unusual for people to be staying at a place 
and just pick up and leave 
the list of possible identities grew throughout the day we are 
getting a large number of calls from people with relatives who have 
stayed here we are trying to determine the welfare of these 
people burns said 
there are a lot more than eight names he said referring to 
the original list of occupants supplied by a social worker 
theres a big list of names weve got detectives scurrying all 
over this city 
several neighbors periodically complained of a stench from the 
yard that smelled like dead animals puente told them it was a fish 
emulsion used as fertilizer they said 
it struck me that the tomato plants in the yard were doing 
beautifully said vera smith a worker for catholic social 
services who visited a man staying at the home the whole place 
was smothered i was tempted to go and pick one 
another neighbor property manager will mcintyre said puente was 
up daily at 430 am to do gardening and used to dig in the lot 
behind her rooming house where there were 6footlong 
depressions the lot now is covered by a house that was moved in 
in 1985 
burns said police would investigate mcintyres report 
in 1982 puente was convicted of drugging and robbing people in 
bars and sentenced to a fiveyear term she was paroled after 2 
years said christine may a spokeswoman for the state corrections 
department 
a victim in that case who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified told the sacramento bee that puente came into the bar 
and gave us a pill to all three of us and knocked us out she 
stole a diamond ring from me took my wallet and wristwatch 
authorities acting on information from nickerson and others 
believe a total of seven or eight bodies may be buried at the 
house 
on sunday police arrested john mccauley 59 a resident of the 
house on suspicion of being an accessory after the fact to 
homicide he was in custody in sacramento county jail 
authorities believe mccauley assisted puente after the slayings 
and that she may have arranged for others to dig the victims 
graves police said we do not believe that this could have been 
done solely by herself enloe said

the plos parliament on tuesday 
proclaimed an independent palestinian homeland with jerusalem as its 
capital and extended an olive branch by implicitly recognizing 
israel 
plo chairman yasser arafat read the declaration early tuesday to 
a chamber filled with delegates to the 450member palestine national 
council arab dignitaries and observers who broke into long 
applause and loud cheers 
wearing the traditional blackandwhite checked headdress arafat 
read his speech in arabic in a low solemn voice 
his voice rising to a crescendo at 138 am 738 pm est 
monday he said 
the palestinian national council hereby declares the 
establishment of a palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital 
which will be for all palestinians wherever they are 
the plo leader declared the new palestinian state would be 
government by a democratic parliamentary system based on freedom 
of opinion multiple parties freedom of worship and equality 
between men and women 
the declaration of the new state did not set out its boundaries 
which the palestinians say should be determined in future 
negotiations 
it had been expected that the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip would be included in the homeland israel captured the west 
bank from jordan and the gaza strip from egypt in the 1967 middle 
east war 
algerian foreign minister boualem bessaieh announced to the 
council that algeria officially recognized the new state becoming 
the first country to do so 
the declaration came shortly after the council had endorsed a new 
political strategy implicitly recognizing the state of israel and 
renouncing terrorism 
in washington on monday president reagan said plo recognition of 
israel would be some progress but added there are other 
problems that remain to be solved 
israel rejected results of the algiers meeting in advance 
we will not negotiate with the plo said prime minister 
yitzhak shamir its not a problem of definition and formulations 
of various positions well not negotiate with them because theyre 
opposed to peace with israel 
arafat and other plo leaders consider the independence 
declaration a historic step toward creation of an independent state 
in the west bank and gaza the council meeting is called the 
intefadeh session after the 11monthold uprising among the 15 
million palestinians of the occupied lands 
the arab league formed the council in 1964 but it has assumed 
the role of plo legislature 
the approval of the new political strategy implicitly recognizing 
israels right to exist marked a major victory for arafats campaign 
for a more moderate policy that would meet some of washingtons 
conditions for dealing with the plo attempting to build on the 
uprising in the occupied territories 
the council endorsed the political declaration with 253 of 
its members voting for it 46 voting against and 10 abstaining 
reported dr assaad abdelrahman a council member from jordan 
confirming reports from council sources 
some other council members were absent because the voting session 
was called at short notice immediately after the councils 
political committee completed drafting the declaration 
abdelrahman said habash leader of the popular front for the 
liberation of palestine and others of his group who also are 
council members were among those who voted against the draft in the 
show of hands habash a radical already had said he would accept 
the rule of the majority 
habash as the leader of the opposition made a beautiful 
speech after the vote saying he was very happy about the great show 
of democracy abdelrahman said he quoted habash as saying let 
me suggest that our slogan from now on be unity until victory 
revolution until victory 
that slogan later was chanted as arafat entered the hall 
palestinians in the gaza strip shot off firecrackers flew 
balloons and raised the outlawed palestinian flag to celebrate the 
declaration 
a third resolution endorsed at the meeting empowers the plos 
ruling 15man executive committee and the central council a 
70member senatelike body to form a provisional government at a 
later stage 
the government palestinian officials say will not replace the 
plo but will act as one of its institutions with a mandate to 
negotiate on behalf of the palestinians in the framework of a un 
international conference 
the strategy drawn is designed mainly to polish the plos image 
in the west and transform the sympathy won by the revolt in the 
territories into political gains 
the council endorsed un security council resolutions 242 and 
338 as the basis for an international conference while stressing 
the necessity to guarantee palestinian national and political 
rights foremost of which is the right to selfdetermination 
resolution 242 implicitly recognizes israel by referring to the 
right of all states in the region to live in peace within secure and 
recognized borders it also calls for withdrawal from lands israel 
occupied in 1967 
the plo long had rejected the resolution as the basis for peace 
arguing that it treated the palestinians only as a refugee problem 
ignoring their quest for selfdetermination and a homeland 
resolution 338 adopted in 1973 called for implementation of 242 
the united states had demanded that the plo endorse 242 
explicitly recognize the jewish state and renounce terrorism before 
allowing the organization any role in the middle east peace process 
the council also took a stand on terrorism reiterating 
commitment to what is called the cairo declaration and endorsing 
un resolutions on the issue 
the cairo declaration mediated by egyptian president hosni 
mubarak was signed in 1985 it limited palestinian guerrilla 
operations to military targets in israel 
the new statement goes a step further restricting guerrilla 
action to military targets in israelioccupied territories

tulkarem just inside the west bank was declared a closed

firebombers soldiers blocked reporters from entering the town of 
40000 
while dozens of troops could be seen patrolling the town no one 
else was visible on the streets and all shops appeared to be 
shuttered at one point two young boys appeared on a rooftop and 
waved but they disappeared when soldiers shouted at them 
army spokesmen refused to say when or exactly how many arrests 
were made in the crackdown on underground groups announced monday 
israel radio said the announcement was meant to deter expected 
violence if independence is declared 
the army listed 54 people rounded up in five west bank cities and 
said guerrilla cells also were found to be operating in 11 other 
areas

authorities investigated but apparently 
took no action on behalf of a woman who said she was forced to live 
in an unheated shed chained to a wall while her husband lived with 
another couple in a nearby trailer 
portions of heavy chain and a padlock were attached to the 
22yearold womans waist and wrists when she sought help from a 
neighbor friday said lt norm nickerson of the spokane county 
sheriffs department deputies used bolt cutters to free the 
22yearold woman who was described as underfed and abused 
authorities apparently were told about the woman last april when 
a neighbor showed them a copy of house rules the woman was 
expected to follow including when to bathe what to wear and when 
to have sex with her husband 
neighbors and others familiar with the case said the womans 
allegations were reported to the state department of social and 
health services in april and again about a month ago 
frank mendizabal a dshs spokesman in olympia said the case was 
handled properly in april when allegations of sexual abuse were made 
he said the case was referred to the sheriffs department for 
investigation and that no criminal charges were brought because the 
woman told investigators she had willingly signed the house rules 
and was not being forced to have sex against her will 
a dshs social worker met with the woman monday to help explain 
her options and plan for the future mendizabal said 
sheriffs sgt ron ethridge said the state agency asked the 
sheriffs department to investigate in april but detectives could 
not find enough evidence to justify an arrest 
the incident is still under investigation by our officers to 
see if any criminal acts were involved nickerson said were 
still trying to get the full story we still havent been able to 
interview everyone involved were going into it quite extensively 
in the next few days 
the woman apparently is married to a sergeant stationed at nearby 
fairchild air force base who lived with another couple in a mobile 
home near the shed ethridge said he questioned a man in the mobile 
home who claimed to have married the woman in may 
the woman told sheriffs deputies that she had been chained to a 
wooden board inside an old dilapidated camper she called the 
shed ethridge said its not a place for human habitation 
ethridge said 
it appears from the preliminary investigation there is merit to 
her allegations he said 
fran pierson the neighbor from whom the woman sought help said 
the woman was wearing an air force jacket a dirty pair of mens 
long underwear and military boots that were several sizes too large 
the woman showed the list of rules to neighbor wendy white in 
april because she did not understand it 
ms white gave copies of the rules to her fatherinlaw an 
eastern state hospital psychiatrist who contacted the dshs in 
april she said she was later called and told the matter had been 
investigated 
they didnt feel she was in any danger she said they just 
said dont worry shell be taken care of 
the woman was treated at a spokane hospital and is being cared 
for at a temporary shelter nickerson said

only appropriate he said 
shortly after the initial returns came in showing wallop 
defeating vinich the democratic senatorial campaign committee 
charged that there were irregularities in the handling of absentee 
ballots in the race 
secretary of state kathy karpans office made a 
precinctbyprecinct review of ballots late last week and karpan 
said she was satisfied there were no problems 
if the canvassing board also finds no problems with the returns 
vinich will have until friday evening to decide whether to call for 
a recount he would have to pay for it which could run up to 
11500 
if the board finds irregularities the state would pay for an 
automatic recount 
any challenge the democratic senatorial campaign committee would 
want to make to the results would have to come through the courts 
according to the karpans office if the courts agreed to overturn 
the election results that would force a special election 
on saturday vinich called on wallop to join him in requesting a 
recount vinich said monday he had not received a response from 
wallop 
a spokesman for wallop said the incumbent has no interest in 
joining vinich in calling for a recount 
right now we see no reason for a recount we are pleased with 
sen wallops victory and weve followed the process carefully 
said wallop spokesman kevin bohnenblust he said however that the 
incumbent had not received vinichs letter

there was no great explosion of joy when 
yasser arafat leader and symbol of the palestine liberation 
organization proclaimed an independent palestinian state early 
tuesday 
instead hundreds of dignified people expressed their emotions 
quietly with handshakes kisses and an occasional tear 
in a jampacked seaside conference hall west of algiers arafat 
read the declaration which proclaims the establishment of the 
state of palestine 
the reading of the declaration by arafat wearing his usual 
military fatigues and blackandwhite checkered headdress was 
interrupted frequently by clapping and cheering and highpitched 
ululations from the women 
spirits were high before the longawaited session of the 
palestine national council the plos parliamentinexile to 
declare the existence of a state that once was and which they hope 
would be again 
in the lobby at the entrance to the meeting hall spontaneous 
songs and dances broke out then at about 1 am algiers time 2 
am in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip where 15 
million palestinians live they filed into the round woodpaneled 
conference hall 
as arafat entered many council members began chanting the new 
slogan unity unity until victory revolution revolution until 
victory 
the slogan was launched monday by george habash leader of the 
marxist popular front for the liberation of palestine habash had 
opposed arafats new moderate policies but ceded to the vote of the 
council majority 
the proclamation came at 138 am 738 pm est monday 
when the reading was over people filed out slowly mingling and 
talking in low voices not unlike the scene at a theater after the 
final act 
there were handshakes smiles solemn embraces and tears 
it was a dignified ceremony said council member mustafa 
hallak there was a lack of emotional demonstration perhaps 
because weve known for a week it the declaration was coming 
assaad abdelrahman another council member said he felt 
different tuesday morning after the declaration 
yes i feel more secure and more responsible abdelrahman 
said 
if anything impressed me today it was the behavior of the top 
leadership they were entirely responsible and democratic in ironing 
out differences very civilized showing a high calibre of dealing 
with differences

a meeting between department of energy officials 
and three western governors on hazardous waste storage problems at 
the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant has been postponed gov roy 
romer said monday 
romer was clearly angered at the postponement because several 
railroad cars are sitting at rocky flats filled with radioactive 
waste but have no place to go the plant has only about a 
fourmonth storage capacity 
romer idaho gov cecil andrus and new mexico gov garrey 
carruthers were to meet wednesday in salt lake city with doe 
officials to work on solutions to the storage problem 
the meeting was postponed so carruthers a republican could 
participate in a presidential transition team meeting romer said 
in late october romer rejected plans to expand the storage 
capacity at rocky flats urging the doe to expedite its search for a 
permanent facility 
a proposed site for permanent waste storage is scheduled to open 
in new mexico but that has been delayed to the annoyance of romer 
and other governors caught in a pushpull dilemma over existing 
waste 
after the new mexico sites opening was delayed indefinitely 
andrus banned further storage of waste at a site in idaho which 
forced the return to rocky flats of one rail car filled with waste 
rocky flats the argonne national laboratory near chicago and the 
lawrence livermore laboratory in livermore calif had been 
shipping radioactive rags machines parts gloves liquids and other 
debris to the idaho site where an estimated 2 million cubic feet of 
the waste is stored below ground and 24 million cubic feet is 
stored above ground in steel barrels 
romer said he is insisting on a meeting with the doe anyway 
because of pressing problems at rocky flats the agency has agreed 
to send several representatives to colorado on wednesday 
i wanted to have that meeting wednesday i called the 
department of energy this afternoon and told them i wanted to go 
ahead they said they wanted to reschedule it because they felt it 
was necessary for carruthers to be there he said 
i told them we should reschedule the meeting as soon as 
possible and i told them i wanted to meet with them on wednesday 
cindy parmenter romers press aide said the meeting will be 
closed but the participants will be available for reporters 
questions later in the day

couples unable to bear children can contract for a 
surrogate mother as long as the agreement does not provide money to 
a woman for giving up her parental rights a judge ruled monday 
the american civil liberties union said the ruling by wayne 
county circuit judge john gillis was confusing but apparently means 
some surrogate contracts are valid in michigan where the nations 
most active surrogacy lawyer practices 
the aclu had sought to have the state law against pregnancy for 
pay overturned but gillis reaffirmed his sept 19 finding that the 
law was constitutional 
this court he wrote finds that the michigan legislature 
intended to prohibit all surrogate arrangements where the surrogate 
mother is compensated other than actual medical expenses as a 
result of the pregnancy and agrees to voluntarily relinquish her 
parental rights to the child 
it is important to note that individuals may still legally 
enter into surrogate arrangements where there is no compensation 
paid to the mother other than actual medical expenses all other 
situations must be decided on a casebycase basis 
howard simon executive director of the michigan aclu said he 
wants to have gillis order clarified 
i dont think it gives much guidance he said it does 
appear however that he is adopting the interpretation that both we 
and the attorney general agreed upon 
it appears to have allowed us to accomplish what we wanted to 
accomplish he said there are many many couples for whom a 
surrogate parenting arrangement is the only realistic option to 
start a family 
at the sept 19 hearing assistant attorney general vincent leone 
said the statute prohibited any surrogate contract that included 
money being paid in exchange for the woman giving up parental rights 
to the child 
leone said the law does not address a womans right to act as a 
surrogate or receiving money for carrying the child 
simon said if gillis agreed with that interpretation the right 
to enter a surrogate contract still exists in michigan 
the legal issue is can you require a surrogate mother to 
surrender her parental rights can you pay a surrogate mother to 
give up the child she bore simon said 
thats babyselling thats what should be prohibited by law 
you can never require a woman to relinquish her parental rights the 
payment has got to be for something else 
gillis said the aclu and other plaintiffs trying to have the 
state law overturned ended any controversy when they agreed in 
september that the law was constitutional 
noel keane a dearborn attorney who arranges surrogacy contracts 
between women willing to carry a child and couples unable to 
conceive said he expected gillis ruling to be appealed 
keane said he is serving about 200 couples with surrogate 
contracts enacted in states such as new york and nevada that allow 
surrogate parenting for pay 
typically infertile couples pay 10000 to be matched with a 
wouldbe mother they pay another 10000 to the woman who agrees to 
be artificially inseminated carry the child then give up custody

a stubborn fire at a warehouse destroyed at least 
340000 frozen turkeys and millions of pounds of crab cauliflower 
and other foods 
the overnight fire which was brought under control monday 
afternoon was inside thick walls filled with dry 
turnofthecentury sawdust that helped insulate the rainier cold 
storage said fire chief claude harris 
about 80 people had to be evacuated from the plant when ammonia 
gas used in the warehouses refrigeration was released 
the residents were moved back to their homes after utility 
services were restored said lt herb brooks electricity and gas 
lines had been shut off for safety he said 
five firefighters were injured slightly in the blaze and a sixth 
was hospitalized harris said the cause of the fire was being 
investigated 
deputy fire chief steve bailey said it may have started in the 
buildings electrical system we first received a call of an 
electrical problem he said 
one wall collapsed from the heat and water harris said pumping 
water into the 4footwide walls was necessary to extinguish the 
smoldering blaze but dangerous because the weight of the water 
could cause the walls to collapse 
at least some walls on the inside of the building which was 
built before 1910 as a brewery for rainier brewing co had fallen 
in and the roof collapsed 
there was 13 million pounds of food in this building said 
bud horton owner of meats inc and crab was a big part of the 
loss he said he had lost 40000 pounds of turkeys and 20000 pounds 
of fish and another broker had lost 300000 pounds of turkeys 
bill butler office manager for rainier cold storage said the 
facility rented space to many food brokers he said he did not know 
how extensive losses would be or whether there was insurance 
coverage 
mike roberts rainier cold storage vice president of marketing 
and warehousing estimated the buildings value at 5 million 
adding that the 22room structure housed about 13 million pounds of 
fruits vegetables meats and seafood he said the value of the 
frozen foods ranged from 50 cents a pound to 8 a pound

the largest home and car insurer in 
california state farm mutual auto insurance co said monday it has 
stopped writing new auto policies because of chaos surrounding 
rateslashing proposition 103 
state farm mutual will continue to carry and renew policies for 
its more than 3 million auto insurance customers the company 
announced monday 
but new applications will be referred to an affiliated company 
that has higher rates thus shielding the company from some of the 
cuts that would be imposed by proposition 103 
in california proposition 103s author harvey rosenfield 
denounced the plan to switch new customers to a higherpriced 
affiliate as an improper attempt to circumvent the measure 
they cant get away with it rosenfield said 
the affiliate state farm fire and casualty co charges 20 
percent to 60 percent more for car insurance than does state farm 
mutual because state farm fire insures higherrisk drivers rejected 
by its affiliate spokesman jim stahly said from the companies 
bloomington ill headquarters 
state farm fire and casualty co has about 300000 auto policies 
in california and also is the states biggest homeowners insurance 
carrier 
implementation of proposition 103 approved by voters last week 
was blocked by the california supreme court but uncertainty in the 
industry has already prompted a number of companies to either stop 
writing insurance or to consider a halt 
proposition 103 orders sweeping changes of the insurance 
industry including a 20 percent rate cut below november 1987 rates 
for auto home and commercial insurance 
in massachusetts on monday allstate insurance co announced it 
is leaving that state because of financial losses and frustration 
over the regulatory climate 
kevin sullivan director of allstates group auto division said 
allstate has lost 115 million in massachusetts in five years 
we have no intention to return sullivan said making 
allstate the third major insurer to abandon massachusetts 
allstate will not renew its license when it expires on june 30 
but until then allstate will sell new policies and follow through 
on policies until they expire he said 
state farm made the switch concerning its california business 
both to reduce its continuing losses on car insurance and to have a 
vehicle to sell insurance to drivers whose own companies may quit 
the state stahly said 
our underwriting loss was 76 for each car insured in 
california during 1987 and were losing substantially more during 
1988 the company said in a news release adding that escalating 
future losses are a near certainty 
additional losses could reach 13 million in auto insurance 
premium income each day for the next year under proposition 103 
officials said 
state farm mutual owns state farm fire together the companies 
california business includes more than 3 million auto policies 12 
million homeowner policies and 420000 business liability customers

the producers of abcs growing pains could 
reasonably have expected joanna kerns to pitch stories featuring her 
own character when she asked to write an episode 
kerns stars as maggie seaver a television anchorwoman whos 
married to psychiatrist jason seaver played by alan thicke 
i think they expected maggie stories she said we pitched 
them six stories none of them about maggie 
this wednesdays episode cowritten by kerns and her writng 
partner becky ayers revolves around jasons mother played by jane 
powell and the crisis that arises when she announces shes 
remarrying 
we got the idea from a few different things said kerns 
im single and dating and its difficult to date with a child who 
has set ideas about who you should be with we applied that to 
jason a psychiatrist who should know better when his mother says 
shes getting married how does he react like a grownup or a 
5yearold 
it challenges the expectations that children have of their 
parents children tend to believe parents are around just to serve 
them its about letting go even if youre 40 years old you have 
to let go 
jasons mother has been referred to in the show but she has 
never appeared before in one episode she stops by to pick up the 
kids said kerns you hear her honking the horn then screeching 
tires as she pulls away that gave us the idea she was a little more 
daring than jason 
kerns and ayers met about eight years ago when their children 
were in nursery school together their first writing project was an 
unproduced movie script called let it rain which they said was 
similar to mr mom the hit movie that came two years later 
they also collaborated on another script american pie which 
has been optioned as a television movie 
ayers who is married to actor robert rockwell has written 
another script for growing pains on her own this one is about 
maggie i wanted to write about the stress of being a working 
mother said ayers she had once sold a script to flo but the 
series was canceled before it could be produced 
working alone kerns has written a movie script called 
freestyle that tells of two teenage sisters competing to go to 
the 1980 summer olympics in moscow which the united states 
ultimately boycotted because of the soviet intervention in 
afghanistan that script is also under option by a studio 
the younger sister thinks that if she can win a spot on the 
team shell be loved by her father said kerns the sisters wind 
up competing against each other 
the story is partly autobiographical kerns older sister is 
donna de varona who won two olympic swimming gold medals in 1964 
kerns was a gymnast who participated in the 1968 olympic trials but 
placed 14th out of the 28 vying for the team 
it was a sport i was too tall for said the actress who at 
5foot8 was a foot taller than most of her competitors i really 
wrote the story because it took me years to give myself any 
validation as an athlete my expectations for myself were so high 
when i didnt make the team i thought i had failed my friends say i 
should call the script i never swam for my father 
despite being a star of growing pains kerns found it tough 
breaking in as a writer 
if they dont know you as a writer your script may or may not 
get read she said i even had trouble getting my own agents to 
read my scripts i was just another actress who wanted to write i 
think when a writer makes a breakthrough a closet full of rejected 
scripts falls out 
kerns also costars with gary cole midnight caller in an 
nbc movie with a working title of daddy scheduled to air in 
january

ravaged by civil war for 13 years lebanon 
now has been hit by the dumping of poisonous chemical waste from 
western europe 
at least 2400 tons of italian chemical waste which lebanese 
officials said was toxic and dangerous were discovered last may in 
the mountains of kesrouan province in the christian heartland about 
20 miles north of beirut 
that discovery forced the cancellation of another shipment of 
30000 tons of italian waste destined for lebanon justice ministry 
sources reported 
the incident is one of several that have recently surfaced in 
african middle eastern and latin american countries where western 
europe has unloaded its industrial waste often passed off as 
innocent material because of the high cost of toxicwaste disposal 
at home 
amid an outcry for tighter controls several countries have 
blocked ships carrying toxic waste from entering their harbors 
leaving the vessels to roam the seas looking for a place to unload 
their hazardous cargoes 
lebanons leftist newspapers and radio stations accused the 
lebanese forces the christians main militia of allowing the 
industrial waste to be brought into the country through the port 
they control in beirut harbor 
they claim the militia was paid 10 million to dump the waste and 
alleged there was an israeli connection 
lebanon has numerous ports run by moslem and christian militias 
along its mediterranean coast through which they ship in goods and 
weapons 
the christian militia has denied involvement in the toxic waste 
affairs and diplomats dont believe it was officials of the 
londonbased international maritime bureau recently said the 
lebanese forces have helped them uncover shipping frauds 
but beiruts leftist assafir newspaper published letters and 
documents purporting to prove the militias involvement it did not 
say who provided the documents 
a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity told the 
associated press that former president amin gemayel whose term 
expired sept 23 deliberately leaked the story to polish up his 
image and discredit the militia 
the lebanese forces and gemayels katayeb militia at the time 
were battling for dominance of the 800000member maronite catholic 
community lebanons most powerful christian sect since gemayel 
stepped down the lebanese forces have won 
the case was blown up out of proportion in typical lebanese 
fashion i dont believe the lebanese forces imported the stuff 
the diplomat said 
moslem leaders fanned the flames of the scandal hoping it 
would touch off a confrontation between the christian rivals 
what happened was a stupid mistake which resulted from 
ignorance said caesar nasr head of the lebanese forces foreign 
relations department 
the manifest of the czechoslovak freighter radhost which carried 
the waste in october 1987 to the lebanese forces port known as 
the fifth basin listed the cargo as chemical residue and 
agricultural products 
nasr said that the militias customs officers at the fifth 
basin didnt have the scientific background to realize the 
significance of industrial residue 
since theres no law forbidding the entry of industrial residue 
into lebanon they allowed the barrels in he added he claimed 
that unscrupulous lebanese merchants brought the waste in 
joseph hashem lebanons health minister at the time declared 
that the waste was poisonous and harmful nasr said the militia 
later moved the waste back to the fifth basin 
attilio massimo iannucci first secretary at italys embassy in 
beirut said the drums contain solvents paint and plastics products 
its very dirty because its the residue of chemical waste 
but its not toxic explosive or radioactive he added 
nonetheless the italian authorities sent a 16man team of 
specialists to handle the waste they spent 50 days repacking it 
into 10000 new drums and 15 containers brought from italy 
toxic waste from italy has turned up in several countries and the 
government in rome has said it will ban toxic waste shipments to the 
third world 
asked why italy was going to such lengths to rid lebanon of the 
waste iannucci said it was part of italys technical assistance 
program 
lebanon was facing a problem without the means to solve it 
so we offered to help he said also these products came from 
italy 
iannucci added that the chemicals were brought to lebanon after 
the jelly wax co of milan a paraffin manufacturer that moved into 
the lucrative toxic waste disposal business made a deal with a 
lebanese company known as adonis lebanese officials said adonis was 
a fictitious company 
iannucci said adonis undertook to destroy the chemicals for a 
huge sum of money to be paid after disposal 
instead they dumped it in lebanon and presented an official 
document claiming it had been disposed of to get the money the 
document proved to be forged 
roger haddad director of maritime operations with the nassar 
shipping co and four other christian businessmen linked to adonis 
were arrested on charges of importing toxic waste that endangered 
lives they were later released on bail 
a warrant has also been issued for armand nassar owner of the 
shipping company and a relative of haddad nassar identified as the 
mastermind of the deal fled lebanon earlier this year

morning until i go to sleep im not sure about my life that i will 
be alive five minutes from now because of the war 
the old man wrapped in a blanket said he lived in kandahar 
once the capital of all afghanistan 
through the fine dust that hangs over the city the pale blue 
dome of the kalqi sharif mosque can be seen from a distance the 
mosque which embodies the islamic tenets propelling the rebel 
mujahedeen in their fight sits opposite the governors home a 
stronghold of the sovietbacked government 
the western entrance to the city is deserted but for the army and 
militia tanks and trucks civilians are not seen except at the 
bazaar at shaheedan chowk a pillared monument honoring afghans 
killed fighting the british more than a century ago 
kandahar known as the city of kings is the birthplace of 
generations of afghan royalty the ornate tomb of ahmad shah 
durrani the grandfather of afghanistans exiled king zahir shah is 
a vernerated site of monarchists who are in the majority around 
kandahar both among the mujahedeen and civilians 
the rubble of blasted buildings chokes the streets forcing 
motorized rickshaws and horse drawn tonga carriages to steer an 
obstacle course through the bazaar 
gul lalai a commander of the rebel national islamic front of 
afghanistan said the bulk of the damage near herat gate on the 
western edge of kandahar occurred when fighter jets aiming at 
guerrilla positions in a nearby suburb missed their mark 
evidence that the guerrillas have operated extensively in the 
city for years is the heavy tankfire damage to the mud homes and 
shops 
about 50000 people remain in kandahar compared to a prewar 
population of about 200000 making it second only in size to kabul 
afghanistans capital 
old men women and children crowd daily into the bazaar before it 
closes at 2 pm 
the free access of women and children is used by mujahedeen who 
employ youngsters to bring supplies to rebel bases from the city 
one of the young recruits gul mohammad said he lost his mother 
two younger sisters and a brother when a tank round hit his home in 
kandahar two years ago he was 9 years old at the time 
police once stopped him and a friend carrying turbans sandals 
and important letters to rebels he said when they captured 
me they beat me up even they broke my head 
mohammad said he spent almost a year in kandahar prison 
everyday for questioning they brought us to a room full of 
water and made us lie down and they beat us he said 
im not afraid of anything he boasted but mujahedeen said 
his forays into the city were finished

with unemployment the highest in western 
europe spains socialist government and labor unions longtime 
allies are on the verge of a serious split 
when leaders of spains 100yearold general workers union called 
recently for a nationwide strike to protest government economic 
austerity policies they took what many saw as the final step toward 
a divorce from the governing spanish socialist workers party and the 
46yearold prime minister felipe gonzalez 
the union and its erstwhile rival the communistoriented workers 
commissions have set a 24hour nationwide strike for dec 14 
the aim of both unions is to force gonzalez a former labor 
lawyer to shift his support to labor and drop policies favoring 
only moderate wage hikes and low inflation as the way to high 
economic growth 
labor minister manuel chaves decision to create a youth job 
corps was the last straw for the unions who claim the low wages 
proposed in the plan will take jobs away from older workers at a 
time when the unemployment rate has soared to 188 percent 
the youth plan calls for the creation of up to to 800000 jobs 
for unemployed youths 16 to 25 years old over the next three years 
through low wages and tax credits for businesses who must provide 
training during their sixto18 month contracts 
at least 45 percent of those in the 1625 age group are 
unemployed and many have never held a job 
apolinar rodriguez member of the general workers union executive 
committee said the program foments inequities among workers since 
youths hired under the plan will be making less than the minimum 
legal wage the equivalent of 376 a month for those aged 18 to 
25 and will be excluded from collective bargaining agreements 
economy minister carlos solchaga reponded however that the 
unions may find the majority of spaniards do not share their 
disapproval of the youth jobs program 
even before the jobs plan conflict the unions had clashed with 
the gonzalez government over wage agreements 
union leaders have denounced the governments request that 
employers reject demands for immediate wage increases until after 
the first of the year despite a recent rise in inflation to 5 
percent two points above the 1988 government target 
nicolas redondo secretary general of the general workers union 
helped propel gonzalez to the top of the socialist party during the 
bitter years of the opposition to the authoritarian regime of gen 
francisco franco but redondo quit his parliament seat in 1987 to 
protest a budget he viewed as antilabor 
the strikes are not just about money but about ideology 
redondo said recently the economic policies of this government 
instead of helping workers lean clearly to the right it should 
realize it cannot remain in power very long with just the support of 
businessmen and bankers 
the spanish confederation of employers has given its full support 
to the youth plan and backs continued government calls for moderate 
wages 
the economic policies criticized by the unions have helped end a 
decade of economic stagnation in spain and spurred a boom that has 
fueled a 5 percent annual growth the highest in western europe for 
the past two years 
a top labor ministry official alvaro espina has criticized the 
unions opposition to the jobs plan saying they appear more 
interested in politics than helping youths get jobs 
espina lamented the growing separation between the unions and the 
socialist administration which diminishes their the unions role 
in society which is absolutely necessary and which should be 
reinforced 
only 10 percent of spains active work force belongs to a union 
according to labor ministry statistics and the government appears 
confident of public support for its jobs plan 
a government poll recently indicated that 85 percent of those 
surveyed believed the administrations top priority should be 
creating jobs for youths 
an additional 77 percent said they preferred that the government 
create the jobs through incentives to businesses rather than 
directly hand out unemployment pay

editors note mix equal parts of stubbornness bureaucracy and 
economics the reaction can be explosive in the case of elmer fike 
and the environmental protection agency it blew up into one of the 
worst toxic waste sites in america 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
elmer fike was out of town the day the 
federal government not for the first time cited his chemical plant 
for recognized hazardslikely to cause death or physical harm to 
employees 
fike happened to be in chicago picking up a national safety 
council award for his outstanding commitment to safety as 
demonstrated by his zeal in promoting motorcycle helmets 
ironies abound in the decadelong contest between elmer fike and 
the federal government 
right now environmental protection agency workers wearing moon 
suits are prowling around 12 acres of rusted pipes and vats and 
tanks of fikes abandoned plant cleaning up what they consider one 
of the worst toxic waste sites in the nation 
meanwhile fike wearing stained trousers and a sweater is 
working nearby among beakers and test tubes and pipets in a house 
trailer lab still brewing chemicals 
the epa put me out of business he was saying the other day 
without apparent bitterness 
according to harold yates an epa spokesman there may be a grain 
of truth in that 
i feel sorry for elmer fike he says fike sort of fell 
through the cracks what he was doing an operation his size well 
he really couldnt afford to implement the required regulations 
elmer fikes operation which employed 75 people entailed using 
hazardous materials to make products in small volume that large 
chemical companies deemed unprofitable and too troublesome to make 
themselves 
hes still doing it as a consultant for somebody else 
i used ways that nobody else used fike says i innovated 
i know how to handle hazardous material but i am i realize a 
nonconformist 
for their part the residents of nitro who number 8000 seem 
ambivalent about fikes fight 
at the nitro lounge a gathering place for workers in west 
virginias chemical valley who know the risks most say they 
would never have worked for fike even though jobs in this state are 
scarce 
but they also call the 13 million government cleanup of fikes 
old plant a boondoggle when the epa called for evacuating onethird 
of the townspeople while they destroyed a cylinder of a lethal 
chemical they found at the plant many didnt leave 
chemicals are our livelihood says bill goff we dont like 
to announce to the world that they can kill you even though they 
can 
goff is a 35year old native of the valley who works at vimasco 
corp a paint manufacturer separated from the fike cleanup site by 
a chainlink fence corroded 
i needed a job goff says so i took the only one i could 
get i cleaned out railroad tank cars i would never do it again 
one day his rubber boots sunk through the spongy crust of asphalt 
residue in the bottom of a tank car the goo acted like chemical 
quicksand and sucked him down he had to be hauled out the hair on 
his legs has never grown back other exposures have caused itchy 
skin rashes when he goes in the sun 
elmer fike will tell you that he operated his plant for nearly 30 
years without accident or serious injury but nitro firemen will 
tell you that they once hauled fike himself out of his plant 
unconscious with his hair on fire 
elmer fike is a 70year old man with eyes the color of cobalt he 
earned his chemical engineering degree at iowa state university and 
was offered work at monsanto co in nitro 
to find nitro you drive west out of charleston along the kanawha 
river past a string of 20 chemical plants and after 15 miles 
especially on a rainy day you likely will smell it 
the town was built on riverbank farmland in 1918 to make 
munitions for world war i it was named for nitrocellulose 
smokeless gunpowder it grew overnight to 25000 people and was as 
quickly abandoned when the war ended leaving behind thick concrete 
bunkers which remain scattered about and great piles of sulphur 
which old timers testify stank even then 
in 1974 the nitro business and professional association passed a 
resolution asking the governor to keep his air polution control 
commissioner from talking about how nitro smells bad for business

nitros lowlevel emissions the resolution said voicing the 
hometown opinion which still prevails are less offensive to 
sensitive nostrils than a freshly fertilized farm 
since then industries have made remarkable deodorant progress 
but even fresh manure doesnt make your eyes smart residents across 
from fikes plant complained to the epa that whatever was wafting 
their way made the paint peel off their houses 
most dont complain says sharon pfost who writes training 
programs for union carbide co thats why they make 15 an hour 
elmer fike after 12 years with monsanto opened his own plant in 
one of those world war i bunkers and built from there by the 
mid1970s he had made quite a name for himself in west virginia 
he headed a committee fighting for school textbooks that 
reflected traditional values and free enterprise and became 
president of the west virginia safety council 
he also was in the news because of a series of explosions and 
fires at his plant in 1976 one was caused by rainwater leaking 
through one of those old bunkers onto a ton of sodium waste instant 
combustion they had to herd all the schoolchildren home because of 
the choking smoke blowing all over town for 12 hours 
but mainly elmer fike drew attention as an uncompromising foe of 
what he considered wrongheaded government regulations 
he was outspoken against the water pollution control bill and the 
toxic substance control act calling it by its acronym the 
terminate small companies act 
he took several trips to washington to argue his points and was 
noticed by a network news program 
i said sure come on down and look over my operation they 
sent a crew down i showed them everything 
before the show came on the air we had a meeting of the 
chemical manufacturers association i told everybody there to be 
sure and watch the program i guess that was a mistake 
here came lesley stahl on the tv screen and she said now we 
take you to the messiest place weve ever been and that was the 
nicest thing she had to say about me for the rest of the program 
within a week i had four government agents on my back worse 
the industry began to desert me i had become a pariah they all 
want to keep their distance from epa so they turned their backs on 
me i began to lose customers i had had for years 
i was told i had contaminated the soil the ground water the 
air they told me to dig down 20 feet test the soil incinerate 
some stuff haul it off all that kind of crap it would have cost 
multimillions of dollars so i said i wouldnt do it 
a month later i was on the superfund list that was the kiss of 
death i lost all my customers what few i had left i laid 
everybody off that was in 1982 
fike said hed clean up the operation says the epas yates 
it is our policy not to interfere with an operating business 
were sensitive to unemployment to what closing a business will do 
to a town moreover if the violator will clean it up himself it 
will save the government money 
since 1982 fike has chosen to do nothing 
on june 11 of this year the mayor of nitro informed us that the 
site had been abandoned we had no choice but to act 
the abandonment yates explains moved the site from the 
remedial category meaning the owner was endeavoring to clean it 
up himself to the removal category meaning it was an 
immediate and substantial threat to public safety 
what we had yates says was a screaming emergency 
so the epa people moved in with their moon suits after 
destroying that lethal cylinder of hydrogen cyanide they went on to 
pack more than 5000 rusted drums of chemicals into new drums to be 
identified and hauled away 
now their main concern is to empty a railroad tank car which fike 
used as a storage tank for 9000 gallons of methyl mercaptan a 
toxic and flammable chemical with a skunk odor the car its wheels 
removed sits on a slab and all its drainpipes are corroded 
if that stuff were released into the air yates says you 
would smell it in washington dc 
the biggest mistake elmer fike made is that he was too honest 
and forthright i mean it the average person would have cashed in 
in 1982 hid his assets and run like hell a lot of them did 
he chose to stand his ground and fight for his principles hes 
stubborn that way thats all 
but in the end he lost

editors note it was built by the us army corps of engineers 
five years ago to protect a small oregon town from the flash floods 
that had caused so much death and destruction in the past but from 
the start the willow creek dam has been leaking to make matters 
worse there is new evidence that chemicals in the water are eroding 
the concrete structure residents of heppner are demanding that 
something be done but what 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
thetorrent came at 530 oclock when 
most of the inhabitants were at their evening meal all were taken 
so suddenlythat nothing could be done to save those who were 
caught in the rushing waters homes stores and all buildings in 
the principal portion of the town were torn loose and driven 
onward 
that was a haunting eyewitness account of a 1903 flash flood that 
sent the swollen waters of willow creek coursing through this 
eastern oregon community 
today residents wonder if it could happen again 
the 5yearold willow creek dam looms 170 feet over the town of 
1375 mostly farmers ranchers and lumbermen that the dam leaks 
has been obvious from the beginning recent reports that the dam 
also may be eroding have intensified the uneasiness on main street 
experts say oxygen depletion in the nutrientrich reservoir has 
left pockets of chemicals corrosive enough to dissolve the concrete 
dam 
roughly onefifth of heppners population some 250 people 
died in the 1903 deluge which is listed in the guinness book of 
world records as the worst disaster of its kind measured by per 
capita loss of life 
former mayor cliff green operates the hardware store where local 
heroes bruce kelly and leslie matlock stole a pair of wire cutters 
so they could cut fences and ride crosscountry to warn downstream 
neighbors of the encroaching floodwaters their historic ride saved 
hundreds of residents in lexington and ione 
a system of sirens stands ready to warn townspeople in the event 
of a flash flood today 
but no warning could prepare them for the worstcase scenario a 
breach in the willow creek dam could inundate the town with 18 
million tons of water 
the dam has been a touchy subject among residents since before it 
was built 
opponents claimed the dam was unnecessary supporters then and 
now said they had little choice 
basically we built the dam to save main street from government 
regulations not from water says green whose bright yellow lapel 
button reads best little dam by a townsite 
heppner has a history of flash floods caused by the 
thunderstorms locals call waterspouts 
the most recent in 1971 destroyed several homes and prompted 
the federal emergency management agency to designate the downtown 
area as a flood plain 
fema spokesman chuck steele of seattle said statistics showed the 
town faced a 1 percent chance of a catastrophic flood in any given 
year a 26 percent chance of such a disaster within an average 
30year mortgage cycle and a 67 percent chance of a major flood 
within 100 years 
heppner is one of 258 communities nationwide built in flood 
plains as defined by the flood insurance act of 1968 steele says 
the designation requires residents to carry flood insurance and 
also bans any federally backed construction loans unless measures 
are taken to prevent future flooding 
in heppner it meant the town had to be rebuilt on higher ground 
or protected by a flood control dam 
green was one of those opposed to the dam but he finally 
resigned himself to the idea what else was the town to do 
some people said by god they cant make you do something 
like that green recalls but they just didnt understand there 
wasnt any other choice 
townspeople were bitterly divided by the issue but in 1981 it 
finally was approved by a vote of 297272 
a subsequent us army corps of engineers feasibility study 
showed the cost of the project 347 million outweighed the 
benefits but sen mark hatfield rore pressed for the dam 
citing its potential to save lives

finally the corps proceeded 
the decision to build the dam was vindicated before construction 
was completed green says in 1982 fire destroyed the heppner post 
office the store next door and a vacant building near the center of 
town none could have been rebuilt under the fema restriction 
ed hiemstra remains one of the most outspoken opponents of the 
willow creek dam from his back yard he has a clear view of the 
dams wet face 
we can see its disintegrating but theyre not telling us 
anything he complains they were looking for a sparsely settled 
area so they could experiment with this new type of dam and now 
were stuck with it 
it was the first in the world to employ a quick and inexpensive 
construction technique in which concrete is built up in layers like 
a cake instead of molded and slabbed 
twenty dams have been built since the roller compacted concrete 
construction rcc method was pioneered at willow creek and 
engineers are still perfecting the technique 
as ronnie m lemons wrote in the october 1988 issue of civil 
engineering magazine even with the technology as it exists 
today rcc dams leakas yet there is no consensus on how to stop 
those leaks 
when it first was filled in 1983 the willow creek dam leaked 
nearly 3000 gallons a minute a 2 million grouting project in 1984 
reduced the leakage by 95 percent 
a greater problem than leaking however may be the corrosion of 
the dam from within 
in 1984 a study by environmental engineer william funk of the 
washington state university water research center predicted water 
quality problems at willow creek 
with experience in other cattle and sheepfeeding areas funk 
could predict a watershed rich with the kind of nutrients that can 
destroy concrete while not opposed to the dam he said its 
construction weighed heavily on his mind 
i expected to see a real mess there he says 
corps scientists were surprised to find water quality 
deteriorating more rapidly and dramatically than funk had 
anticipated after four years of study they still are not sure what 
it all means 
were not alarmed but we are concerned says doug larson a 
lake scientist who has spent years studying the waters behind willow 
creek dam 
we have all the compounds present that can deteriorate 
concrete we just dont know how intense they are the big question 
is how quickly is this happening 
he says the answers are at least eight months away consultants 
are studying the geochemical processes occurring in the dam and the 
reservoir while others are analyzing the presence of volatile 
methane gases and the effect of concretecorroding acids 
the corps reputation and future is on the line says cliff 
green they cant say youve got a problem and it may break 
send us a post card they have to do something 
david sykes publisher of the gazettetimes newspaper says the 
corps already has lost credibility among the residents of heppner 
in an angry editorial sykes demanded an independent analysis of 
the dams safety 
we need more than a dose of the corps publicity machine 
sykes wrote we need some action to tell the truth and it should 
come from our elected representatives 
word is out that the willow creek dam is sick the corps of 
engineers says everything is fine but we the people of heppner 
need a second opinion

editors note african voodoo rituals blend with roman 
catholicism and jimmy swaggartstyle pentacostalism in brazil 
officials estimate that 90 million of brazils 144 million people 
practice some form of spiritism but many of them list their

in a packed meeting hall on rios 
poor north side a pentecostal preacher screams the names of african 
voodoo gods as scores of possessed followers surge forward to be 
exorcized 
at a nearby roman catholic church a priest says mass as the 
congregation sways to the throbbing beat of the atabaques the 
traditional wooden drums used in candomble spirit rituals 
persecuted for years afrobrazilian spirit cults such as 
candomble umbanda and macumba today are regarded as serious rivals 
to christianity in brazil the worlds largest roman catholic 
country 
catholics and protestants are striving to win converts among the 
tens of millions of spirit worshipers 
we want to intensify the religious dialogue with our brothers 
in candomble and umbanda we have more things in common than 
divergencies says the rev antonio aparecido da silva a leader 
of the catholic churchs association of black pastoral agents 
on paper roman catholicism is by far brazils dominant religion 
brought by portuguese settlers 400 years ago 
but millions also follow cults descended from yoruba and bantu 
religions originally practiced by african slaves over the 
centuries the cults picked up elements of roman catholicism native 
indian faiths european witchcraft and kardec spiritism and became 
uniquely brazilian 
the christian research institute in sao paulo estimates that 90 
million of brazils 144 million people practice some form of 
spiritism although many still give their official religion as 
roman catholic 
brazilians have multiple religious loyalties simultaneously 
says paul carden director of the institute they go to 
seichonoie a buddhist sect on wednesday an umbanda ritual on 
friday and mass on sunday the option depends on the need of the 
moment 
since 1970 the number of brazilian catholics has dropped from 92 
percent of the population to 85 percent meanwhile the number of 
protestants and especially pentecostals has tripled to nearly 15 
percent 
roman catholicism is a baptizingmarryingandburying religion 
but not relied on for everyday needs carden says the two major 
options today are afrobrazilian spirit religions and pentecostal 
protestantism they are making the most converts at this time 
the universal church of the kingdom of god brazils 
fastestgrowing pentecostal church says that more than 90 percent 
of its members are former spirit worshipers 
jose paiva de oliveira is president of brazils candomble and 
umbanda federation which claims 50 million members he is revered 
as a babalao alaba which he says is like the pope of 
afrobrazilian religions 
millions believe pai paiva father paiva can predict the future 
talk to the dead and cure the ill with herbs or by reading 
buzios or sacred seashells he often participates in the ritual 
sacrificing of goats sheep and chickens to the african gods 
those who follow his counsel include topranking government 
officials including it is said president jose sarney 
if i wasnt right most of the time i wouldnt have 
credibility he says sixty percent of government officials come 
to methe senator who wants to be minister the colonel who wants 
to be general of course the top brass dont come personally they 
send underlings 
the religious rivalry grew in the 1970s when a population boom 
and brazils economic miracle brought a flood of migrants from 
the countryside to urban slums 
people leave their little hometown go to the big city and 
poof their identity is gone theyre floating carden says 
theyve got to establish roots have a role a community 
pentecostalism and afrobrazilian religions provide it 
the pentecostals also got a boost from television and the popular 
programs of us evangelists such as jimmy swaggart and rex humbard 
today dozens of usbased protestant churches operate in brazil 
but the big success story is a brazilian sect the universal 
church of the kingdom of god founded in 1977 with 30 members today 
it has more than 600 churches in brazil two in new york and one in 
new jersey with a daily attendance of some 500000 the church also 
runs a publishing house two radio stations and a morning tv program

bishop edir macedo bezerra the churchs founder and leader 
directs his message straight at spirit worshipers 
ogum show yourself exu i summon you then youre going to 
burn in the name of jesus he screams invoking the african spirit 
gods at a weekly exorcism ceremony at the churchs headquarters in 
rios abolicao district 
scores in the audience swoon as they receive the spirits 
ushers guide them forward to the stage where macedo bezerra calls 
on the holy spirit to expel the entities 
gradually the possessed parishioners recover with a shudder 
and are helped back to their seats 
spiritists are more sincere than evangelists or catholics 
says macedo bezerra a former spirit worshiper himself we have 
the greatest compassion for them but we must show them theyre on 
the wrong road and rip the devil out of their bodies 
however some pentecostal followers have been accused of trying 
to convert disbelievers by force 
oju oba an africanculture group in rio that assists spirit 
centers says it receives almost daily complaints of aggression by 
pentacostalists 
one spirit center was stoned in another a girl was 
sequestered by pentecostalists and preached to for three days 
says jairo pereira de jesus a member of oju oba 
candomble followers say the main problem is a misunderstanding 
about exu a deity symbolized by a phallus and iron spikes and often 
equated with the devil 
the idea of heaven and hell doesnt exist in african religions 
exu is the dynamic principle vitality fertility transformation 
says gesia de oliveira a member of oju oba and a candomble 
practitioner 
the brazilian catholic church has given up trying to repress 
spirit cults instead some priests want to africanize the 
catholic ritual to compete with the cults 
candomble has a great fraternal element catholics go to mass 
and remain anonymous its not a meeting of brothers says the 
rev felix neefjes a dutchborn priest in the ecumenism and 
religious dialogue sector of the brazilian bishops conference the 
church has to ask itself if its corresponding to the peoples 
needs 
da silva a doctor of theology and dean of the theological school 
for the archdiocese of sao paulo heads a clerical campaign to bring 
together catholicism and african religions 
in some masses samba music is played on atabaques agogos and 
other african instruments sometimes the altar is removed and 
flowers and fruit offerings placed on a cloth laid on the floor 
africanstyle 
african culture is our common mother da silva says to 
africans the earth is the altar of god olorum the black catholic 
is rediscovering this 
da silva concedes that some bishops are upset at the changes 
they know only the roman way the european way he says 
but this is a new vitality it is the latin american church 
renewed 
some believe the roman catholic church has become too 
accommodating since the second vatican council of 196265 
the church is afraid of losing people says carden of the 
christian research institute it cant catechize them so it wants 
to make them feel at home and not leave the church its a very 
serious compromise theyre talking about african gods and 
antibiblical things 
many spirit worshipers just wish christians would leave them 
alone 
mae meninazinha de oxum or mother little girl of oxum is a 
candomble priestess in sao joao de meriti a poor city north of rio 
recently she literally had to bar her door to prevent 
pentecostalists from invading 
they cursed us and said we would burn in hell she says 
theyre fanatics we respect all religions but we are not 
respected 
mae beata de iemanja a priestess at the yle omi oju aro 
candomble center in the nearby sao mateus district also has battled 
police and preachers to preserve her religion 
i was baptized a catholic but today knowing what i do of the 
religion of the orixas i wouldnt do it says the 57yearold 
priestess dressed in the traditional white lace dress turban and 
colored ritual necklaces of candomble nature is our religion 
nature purifies blesses does everything it has force 
when olorum made the world he made a place for everything he 
created so why fight we are all children of olorum

just as vincent van goghs supreme 
struggle with his artistic demons came at arles and paul gauguins 
unorthodox genius escaped onto canvas in tahiti so american painter 
russell chatham has found his vision in a valley called paradise 
chatham is no gaugin or van gogh as hed be the first to admit 
but at age 49 hes been painting since he was 7 descended from 
artists who always struggled chatham assumed he would always be 
poor his first memories center on his grandfather gottardo 
piazzoni who painted the 14 landscape murals in the main branch of 
the san francisco library 
forever fresh in his mind is the image of his grandfather on 
scaffolding painting ansel adams captured the same stark scene 
with blackandwhite film the recollection evokes in chatham the 
feeling of being in a cathedral of having a religious experience 
the memory and the photograph intertwine in his mind early he knew 
that art was his destiny 
i knew i could get by somehow chatham says painting was 
the most important thing of all in my family it was what you were 
supposed to do once you sense that you shouldnt go against it i 
never thought about the money i basically assumed it was impossible 
to make a living as a painter but that was what i was so i got 
by 
chathams desire to pursue his passion in a pure place without 
external confusion or false rewards led him from his native marin 
county calif to the paradise valley and livingston mont in 
1972 
his old fishing buddy thomas mcguane was the catalyst hed 
left the increasingly crowded san francisco bay area in 1969 and 
wrote back about the glories of yellowstone trout the artist a 
recordholding fisherman considered to be one of the best flycasters 
in the nation was hooked so were pals richard brautigan and 
william hjortsberg they all headed for montana 
when he left bolinas chatham had a yard sale which included 
dozens of his paintings priced at 25 cents and 50 cents apiece many 
didnt sell so along with the rest of his possessions they were 
piled into a 49 chevy pickup he still cherishes that truck as 
well as a 47 plymouth despite their near terminal infirmities 
arriving alongside deep creek with 5 in his pocket chatham 
borrowed a stake from mcguane and moved into a 50amonth old 
ranchstead which he still rents for about the same price in a shed 
he converted into a studio the newcomer set about learning the 
artistic nuances of his adopted home 
he translated violent autumns numbing winters and the green 
caress of a high plains spring into oils acrylics and lithographs 
he toiled amid mountains called crazies and absarokas gallatins and 
tetons he painted dry fields and woolly cattle ghostly rivers that 
ran quiet and clear through sagebrush and sand 
often the paintings and lithographs were subtle and muted with a 
brooding quality he worked slowly six or seven major canvases a 
year was a good year 
chatham is not a western artist in the mode of charles russell or 
frederic remington he is not counted nor does he wish to be 
among the contemporary painters who earn big bucks with their gaudy 
cowboys bucking broncos and outlandish versions of what longago 
mountain men might have looked like 
year after year chatham quietly painted the elusive landscape of 
montana and seldom sold his visions he became his own oneman 
school of art not western not photo realism not illustration 
simply chatham 
some people have described it as impressionism but it isnt 
chatham says not everything in life can or should be explained 
by the late 1970s the reviewers were paying attention but 
chatham was still broke 
meanwhile his transplanted california buddies were becoming rich 
and famous

brautigan published trout fishing in america writer 
hjortsberg hit it big with falling angel and mcguane sold his 
novel 92 in the shade to hollywood launching himself as a 
popular screenwriter and each began to load up on chatham pictures 
a born barterer chatham swapped his art for firewood and fishing 
rods babysitting service and airline tickets medical care and 
food even a handmade afghan which explains why a few dozen 
cowboys and merchants in livingston now own chatham originals worth 
thousands of dollars 
because after nearly 200 oneman shows which usually lost money 
after living on less than 15000 annually eked out through sales 
to friends and freelance writing chatham has made enough in the 
last two years to stay out of debt with some left over today his 
paintings command up to 60000 with an average of 10000 to 
30000 per canvas 
now 28 years after taking up this desperate line of work 
professionally it appears the work is fulfilling its function 
which is simply to add a measure of interest and dimension to 
peoples lives in an almost subliminal way by inhabiting their walls 
just as a spirit might inhabit a gloomy stairway writes chatham 
in a slim brochure about his work 
he has become the artistofchoice for many of hollywoods hip 
and famous actor jack nicholson reportedly owns 30 chatham 
canvases other buyers include movie stars jeff bridges peter 
fonda and dennis quaid all paradise valley transplants robert 
redford jane fonda ali mcgraw and harrison ford 
thus the supreme irony of russell chathams life is that having 
moved away from the hypedup fast lane of the california art scene 
where patrons abound wealthy admirers found him by what he calls 
accident when they came to flyfish and make movies in a small 
montana town on the edge of nowhere 
as chatham talks he paints neither exercise hampering the 
other he is dressed in untied tennis shoes a rumpled shirt and 
oilsplattered pants he is a big man barrelchested brawnyarmed 
his eyes are large and liquid now brown now gray depending on the 
angle of the studios flat north light his nose once described by 
a friend as a bobsled run fits sideways on his face the image is 
uncannily like a gauguin selfportrait 
it is a silent sunday none of the seven employees he now pays to 
keep track of his growing business are around he has the entire 
second floor of a building which also houses sax amp fryer a 
bookstore which has helped livingstonites find erudition since 1883 
stacked in the hallways are oils acrylics and large framed 
prints from his missouri headwaters series of 12 original 
lithographs most are going to seattle for two major shows one at 
the davidson gallery the other at the kimzey miller gallery 
through late november 
after years of living on the edge chatham at last finds himself 
riding the crest of a success his admirers say will last the 
remainder of his life 
but for chatham there is much more to living than just painting 
there are his wife suzanne and their 3yearold daughter rebecca 
there are new books to write and old ones to reissue through his 
new publishing venture the livingstonbased clark city press 
there are pickup games of pool to be played with strangers across 
the street birds to be hunted with old friends on cold days fish 
to be caught 
writing in sports illustrated a few years ago mcguane told 
of being in the river and looking up to see chatham i see my 
friend and neighbor a painter walking along the high cutbank above 
the river this would be a man who has ruined his life with sport 
he skulks from his home at all hours with gun or rod today he has 
both 
what are you doing 
trout fishing and duck huntingas you can see says the 
painter gesticulating strangely im ready for anything i spoiled 
half the day with work and errands

editors note they are the victims of heart attacks among 
those who survived but rather than resume their old bad habits they 
decided to follow the advice of doctors and alter their lifestyles 
now one will be picked to get a prize as an example for others to 
follow

its a brand new contest with a 10000 first prize but you may 
be glad that you are not an entrant on the other hand all who have 
been nominated are glad they are in the running 
the award heart patient of the year 
some 100 hospitals are participating nominating those men and 
women who essentially became born again heart patients after 
suffering heart attacks nearly 15 million americans suffer heart 
attacks each year and about 450000 have second heart attacks 
nominees chosen by their doctors are people who have altered 
their lives considerably through diet exercise medication 
including aspirin quitting smoking avoiding stress and if 
applicable trying to go from type a to type b 
dr robert c schlant a professor of cardiology at emory 
university school of medicine in atlanta says he agreed to serve on 
the advisory committee because the recognition could stimulate other 
heart patients to follow physicians orders 
sometimes its rather discouraging to see how people are living 
after their recovery says schlant a heart disease specialist who 
has served as president of the association of university 
cardiologists and chairman of the council on clinical cardiology for 
the american heart association they may stop smoking for a while 
but then a year later they are back on cigarettes 
were doing rather miserably in getting people to alter their 
lifestyles in an ideal world this contest will also get some 
people to alter their lives before anything happens after all 
everything we do bypassing other surgeries aftercare treatment 
is secondary and palliative its primary prevention that is 
needed 
one of the nominees already announced is achille kelly 
daprile now 48 who is in far better shape than he was four years 
ago when he suffered a heart attack he gave up the pack of 
cigarettes a day he was smoking he shed about 35 pounds and he now 
jogs to work out stress 
the hardest thing was realizing i had a heart attack says 
daprile owner of a deli and liquor store in weathersfield conn 
id never been in a hospital before i got chest pains going to 
visit somebody in the hospital 
at the time i was working 16 to 18 hours a day i ate all the 
butters breads and meats i wanted i had to make a major adjustment 
to try and not be such a type a personality with workaholic 
tendencies 
daprile has even created a lowcholesterol special sausage for 
his deli customers made with either veal or veal and chicken 
schlant notes that most heart patients do in fact end up more 
active and stronger than before 
there are exceptions herman rice 67 of linthicum heights md 
suffered too much damage when he had a major attack in 1982 but the 
doctors call him their miracle patient 
rice worked on an assembly line at a meatpacking plant when he 
felt such pain in his forefingers that he asked the foreman if he 
could see the nurse 
a man not accustomed to being ill a nonsmoker and teetotaler 
rice ran up the four flights to the medical office collapsed and 
was left with only 40 percent of his heart intact despite 
triplebypass surgery 
when he first came home from the hospital he was crying and 
depressed because he had to retire he couldnt lift anything over 
5 pounds and his exercise was limited to walking his wife says 
i told him to stop crying the lord had given him another 
inning when he said he didnt know what for i told him he was here 
to keep me company

im a strict nurse ive had him for 37 years and i want to 
keep him im happy to lift the shopping bags 
margaret miko of catonsville md also 67 says that before her 
heart attack she felt that westinghouse corp would probably fold 
without her she was a secretary to an important executive 
mrs miko a widow goes to the cardiac rehabilitation center at 
st agnes hospital in baltimore three times a week dons a sweat 
suit does her warmups and works out on the rowing the treadmill 
and the bicycle 
i was never what you would call the athletic type but now i 
wouldnt miss it 
mrs miko collapsed on the job during a stressful day at work and 
remembers someone shouting for anyone with knowledge of cpr 
they practically had the shovel out she says the cpr and 
prayers pulled me through the priest gave me the last rites 
dr raymond bahr director of the coronary care unit at st agnes 
hospital says he decided to nominate patients because of the 
transformations he saw in some he says 1700 heart patients a year 
come through this coronary care unit alone 
the transformation of character is something like being born 
again bahr says they have something the rest of us dont 
appreciate they see life differently after a heart attack 
bahr as a heart specialist regrets that so many people wait 
until its too late to make the changes that will make their heart 
stronger 
too many people have to wait until a mack truck is sitting on 
their chest he says 
bahrs nominess include both mrs miko and miller who were 
virtually given up for dead 
another of bahrs nominees is bernie walter 45 a baseball coach 
and athletic director of arundel high school outside of annapolis 
md 
walter points out that even though he was a health educator he 
ignored the early warning signals he suffered several aches in both 
elbows early in the day but laid down for a few minutes and it went 
away then he coached for two hours and felt better but not quite 
good 
i just felt really tired at 830 that night i was watching a 
hockey game it was the stanley cup the philadelphia flyers were 
winning 20 when the guy started down the ice to score the third 
goal then i had the severe pain and i told my wife he admits 
he was rushed to the hospital given a clotdissolving drug and 
the heart attack was arrested quickly 
im not handicapped in any way he says the idea is not 
just keeping you alive the idea is getting you back to doing the 
things you want to do 
walter certainly is hes totally altered his life 
im also beating out infield hits now he says 
occasionally even getting a double 
bahr says walter is an excellent example of what early care can 
mean 
walter took both his weight and his blood pressure down and 
eliminated salt red meat and any canned products from his diet 
before that cheese and gravy was right down my alley and it 
was always red meat he says now we shop very carefully 
as you can probably tell he says im a type a 
personality im learning to change that if i feel too much 
pressure ill just say the heck with it and go home and ride my 
bike 
both the patient and the hospital who nominated him or her will 
receive 10000 a grant from the makers of ecotrin safetycoated 
aspirin 
it will be presented on when else valentines day

editors note we listen to their warnings and board up our 
houses we dont trust them when they forecast a nice day yet no 
experts touch the lives of more americans than weather forecasters 
people like ron mcpherson the new deputy director of the national 
weather service 
</TEXT>

the clouds hugged the texas hill country on a 
gray day 27 years ago vice president lyndon b johnson waited 
impatiently for word he could fly out of his ranch on the pedernales 
river 
the flight hinged on a national weather service forecast left to 
a neophyte weatherman with more than a little awe of the vice 
president 
ron mcpherson says it was one of his toughest calls in three 
decades of forecasting i was a 22yearold kid with a years 
service and heres a vice president who wants to get out of his 
ranch when he wanted to go somewhere he wanted to go he didnt 
take too kindly to the clouds covering the hills 
but for mcpherson there was no other way johnson had to make it 
to austin by car johnsons pilot let mcpherson know the vice 
president was not too happy with the arrogance of the weather 
the memory has stayed with mcpherson through his career which 
began as an undergraduate intern in 1959 while at the university of 
texas in austin one that has now taken him to the agencys 
secondhighest post 
he was named deputy director of the weather service in september 
and started work in midoctober in charge of daytoday operations 
at an organization attempting to move into the 21st century 
but what better person is there than a guy who worked his way 
up in the system asks don witten a spokesman for the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration which operates the weather 
service 
the service has 299 offices nationwide responsible for watching 
and warning of storms tornadoes hurricanes and flash floods it 
plays a key role in space and air travel and is at the edge of 
research into understanding such phenomena as drought wind shear 
and turbulent storms that die almost as quickly as they erupt 
what attracts mcpherson to weather he says is its uncertainty 
its knowing that youre dealing with something slippery 
youre trained to deal with uncertainty fragments of evidence more 
than any other profession than maybe law he says 
those fragments come from scores of sources around the country 
and the world from forecasters in the field and thousands of 
volunteer storm spotters weather balloons and river forecasting 
centers at the headwaters of the nations major waterways ships at 
sea and satellites hovering above the equator and circling the poles 
the weather service which traces its roots to the armys signal 
corps in the late 1800s has sometimes been on the cutting edge of 
technology and other times lagged behind mcpherson says 
now the weather service is trying to buy its way into the future 
ordering up some sophisticated new electronic equipment to replace 
some of its antiquated methods and gear the new probes will allow 
forecasters to look inside a major storm system and maybe even 
predict a tornado in the embyronic stage or the kinds of storms and 
squalls that spark killer flash floods 
it is part of the nexrad project of the service the air force 
and the federal aviation agency 
the basic unit is automated doppler radar which will allow 
meteorologists to look inside weather systems to see the movement of 
water droplets vapor and dust particles which will betray otherwise 
invisible winds and air turbulence which will in turn betray the 
formation of severe storms and tornadoes 
doppler radar is more refined than current radar which can only 
detect water in weather systems but not its movement a doppler 
system reads the returning radar echo and determines whether it is 
shortening or lengthening much the way the ear can determine that 
an approaching ambulance siren has a higher pitch than one going 
away computers can then give operators a more instant and fluid 
reading on what is going on inside clouds 
the first of the 170 to 190 units will be installed in the early 
1990s at a cost of 25 million each 
mcpherson hopes too that they will help explain how the weather 
systems work 
you cant forecast what you dont understand and you have to 
be able to observe what youre going to forecast 
mcphersons most recent job was as chief of the meteorological 
operations division at the national meteorological center a weather 
service branch outside washington he moved there from san antonio 
20 years ago 
growing up in port arthur mcpherson says he was bitten by the 
weather bug as a 12yearold boy scout working on a weather merit 
badge as part of the assignment mcpherson says he read a passage 
from the book storm by george r stewart 
the story is about a forecast office on the west coast tracking 
a major pacific storm and its impact on land and on people it was 
very impressive for a 12yearold kid he says 
as it turns out ive run into at least eight or 10 people who 
have read the same novel and gotten into meteorology through the 
influence of that novel its a little dated now but its still a 
good story 
you can get hooked on weather don witten of noaa says 
what is it that touches every human life on earth one of the 
answers is weather it can make you an orphan it can bring you a 
fresh crop it can cause you a lot of trouble getting to work yet 
theres nothing like a beautiful day

in her final year on murder she wrote 
angela lansbury as mystery writer jessica fletcher briefly considers 
an offer of marriage from a rich suitor 
but a second marriage is not for the widowed jb fletcher nor 
is it the way lansbury wants to wrap up five years on the hit cbs 
mystery series 
although shes ending the shows long and successful run by her 
own choice lansbury is not yet ready to sever her connection with 
jessica fletcher she wants to leave the character unencumbered so 
that she can return for an occasional movie of murder she wrote 
its my decision to end the series i want to do movies movies 
for television and go back to broadway says lansbury who won 
four tony awards for her performances on the new york stage 
this sunday you can watch her solve another mystery on murder 
she wrote then on monday she stars in the nbc movie shootdown 
in shootdown she plays nan moore a mother whose son is 
among those killed when a soviet fighter plane shot down korean air 
lines flight 007 on sept 1 1983 she presses for more information 
to cut through the cloudy circumstances surrounding the tragedy 
she was instrumental in keeping up the fight to have congress 
investigate why the plane was where it was and whether it was 
deliberately off course she says the movie doesnt come to any 
conclusion but it does place all the facts in front of the audience 
so people can make up their own mind there were so many conflicting 
reports 
lansbury is pleased that the real mrs moore has seen the movie 
and likes her interpretation 
i was very concerned about playing someone whos still alive 
lansbury says i had seen newsreels of her and had seen her on 
donahue in the picture they inserted shots of me to make it look 
like i was on donahue 
the movie also stars jennifer savidge george coe and molly hagen 
and kyle secor as her son john 
lansbury was frequently cast as the mother of grown people 
earlier in her career probably her most famous mother role was in 
the manchurian candidate a chilling 1962 political thriller 
that was withdrawn until recently because of the kennedy 
assassination 
she played the mother of laurence harvey who was only three 
years younger the role also called for her to be insanely 
ambitious directing the career of her husband a joseph 
mccarthytype senator 
the mother phase of her career ended when she went to new 
york and won tonys for roles in mame dear world gypsy 
and sweeney todd 
lansbury was at the 750acre saddle rock ranch set in a bowl in 
the malibu mountains between los angeles and the pacific coast to 
film two episodes of murder she wrote with dale robertson as a 
wealthy rancher 
i visit this man who served on the same flight crew with my 
late husband in the korean war she says hes a widower and im 
a widow and he thinks we should get together its one of the few 
times jessica is tempted to give up her independence but im not 
ready to make that decision and at the end of the show i return to 
cabot cove 
the series hasnt changed much since jessica fletcher a former 
substitute teacher published her first mystery novel and solved her 
first case in september 1984 she is still the curious busybody 
whos always at hand when murder strikes she finds the clues the 
police overlook and thus is able to pick out the killer from among 
the gueststar suspects 
the big change is that she has become very successful as a 
writer lansbury says she has become a celebrity she has 
become more urbane and sophisticated although she has not lost that 
smalltown feeling her world has opened up tremendously 
she has become a champion of middleaged women and women 
struggling to maintain their position in life even though theyre 
alone 
lansbury also has shed about 16 pounds gained in the early years 
of murder she wrote she also champions the cause of middleage 
women with a fitness and health video called angela lansburys 
positive moves 
i went on a diet and a regimen of nonstrenuous exercise she 
says people kept asking what have you done to yourself you 
look 20 years younger i was finally persuaded by my agent to make 
the tape for women my age its an intimate discussion of one 
womans way of taking care of herself

if theres one thing julie wilson has learned 
during her long career singing in nightclubs and hightone places 
like the plaza and the st regis and the algonquin its never count 
on anything 
im a total fatalist says the sophisticated song stylist 
known for her impeccable way with lyrics i feel if its going to 
happen its going to happen if its not its not 
so when peter allen told her nearly five years ago that he would 
write a role for her in his first broadway musical she didnt tell 
anyone 
not a soul miss wilson says you know when you want 
something so much its like the kiss of death if you talk about it 
i didnt open my trap 
her silence and waiting paid off 
miss wilson now is appearing with allen at the mark hellinger 
theater in legs diamond a new musical about the 1920s new york 
gangster allen who wrote the shows music and lyrics also plays 
the famous outlaw miss wilson is flo a woman who fronts a 
nightclub secretly owned by diamond 
they needed a woman of my age and experience to play this role 
someone whos been around the block more than once she laughs 
im the older woman in this show believe me i am the oldie i 
like to say oldie but goodie 
for miss wilson legs diamond is her first broadway musical 
in nearly two decades broadway has only been a part of her show 
business career which began at the age of 17 back in omaha when she 
was chosen miss nebraska since then there have been touring shows 
radio television recordings summer stock and stints in london 
where she appeared in west end editions of kiss me kate south 
pacific and bells are ringing 
but her bread and butter has been nightclubs usually wearing a 
slinky gown and a gardenia perched behind her ear miss wilson has 
sung the best songs of cole porter george gershwin rodgers and 
hart kurt weill stephen sondheim and other broadway writers 
allens material has been a more recent addition she met him for 
the first time in the 1970s but he knew about her long before that 
when he was a kid dancing in australia somebody sent him an 
old record of mine called julie wilson at the st regis she 
says 
those days in the early 1970s were lean years for miss wilson in 
new york suddenly there was no place to sing big clubs were 
closing all over town 
i was fighting for my life she recalls i grabbed whatever 
came my way things like small roles in plays like norman is that 
you in paramus nj 
at the time miss wilson and allen shared the same voice teacher 
keith davis they still do 
i became very aware of peter because my teacher was always 
talking about him and because he had the big hit song i honestly 
love you the singer recalls 
whenever she got a job there would be flowers and a note from 
allen sometimes he and a group of friends would show up to cheer 
her on she attended a lot of his concerts too and they became 
good friends 
then in 1976 she left new york returning to omaha for an 
eightyear sabbatical to take care of her ailing parents and raise 
her two sons when she came back in 1984 to resume her career allen 
showed up at michaels pub an east side nightclub to hear her 
sing it was then that he told her about legs diamond and his 
plans for her 
nothing happened 
a year later she was at her voice teachers studio and ran into 
allen again would you like to hear your song he asked 
allen sat down at the piano and played the music went out of my 
life the song miss wilson sings in legs diamond 
its a little soliloquy she says its a woman singing 
about her loves what happened and why they didnt work out 
then another year went by and miss wilson was asked to perform 
with allen in a workshop production of legs the workshop was 
done in march 1987 the shows producers decided the book by charles 
suppon needed work 
harvey fierstein author of torch song trilogy was brought 
in to help to sharpen some of the characters and make the story 
brighter 
then the show was finally announced to open on broadway in the 
fall of 1988 
but before legs diamond went into rehearsal miss wilson 
found out she was under consideration to replace dolores gray and 
sing the showstopping im still here in the london production 
of follies she told her agent no her heart belonged to 
allen 
i dont want anything else miss wilson told her agent i 
just want to hang out do my club thing and hope that the show will 
go 
she doesnt regret her decision 
im on the boards until they get rid of me she says i 
knew i had to chance it

until this year softvoiced agvam 
tadevosyan was a cardcarrying communist and had a steady job then 
came a transformation he was sent to jail twice for antisoviet 
agitation lost his job and resigned from the communist party 
all this came about he says because of what he sees as 
kremlinimposed terror in his homeland of soviet armenia and he 
maintains that terror must be answered with terror 
he is not alone in his view of the kremlin in moscow 
from a tent on a yerevan square khachik stamboltsyan campaigns 
for election to armenias supreme soviet or legislature the 
biophysicist expresses scorn for mikhail s gorbachev charging that 
the soviet leader has shown us he is no democrat but a dictator 
ten months into a bitter territorial dispute with the neighboring 
soviet republic of azerbaijan on the caspian sea armenian voices 
cry out in anger and frustration they have turned their hostility 
toward the communist party and soviet system presenting a threat to 
gorbachev and the unity of the multiethnic nation he heads 
many armenians predict a confrontation with soviet authorities 
perhaps even a violent explosion 
people are ready to persevere until our demands are met said 
rafael poposyan a former political prisoner literary critic and 
armenian activist i think this movement can be crushed only with 
tanks 
in february tens of thousands marched in yerevan the armenian 
republics capital to demand the annexation of the predominantly 
armenian nagornokarabakh district which has been part of 
azerbaijan since 1923 antiarmenian rioting broke out in 
azerbaijan and at least 32 people 26 of them armenians were 
killed 
led by gorbachev the supreme soviet presidium the central 
governments top executive body in moscow dashed armenians hopes 
in july by ruling that azerbaijans refusal to go along with a 
change in its territory took precedence over nagornokarabakhs 
petition to join armenia 
the kremlin decision backed by a tough backtowork order and 
the dispatch of troops to enforce order produced a brief calm but 
a new wave of strikes and demonstrations broke out in september and 
what began as the karabakh movement broadened into an alternate 
political force with rival tendencies that challenges the 
leadership of the communist party on issues from ecology to economic 
reform 
the movement started with slogans like we support glasnost and 
perestroika and people carrying pictures of gorbachev popoyan 
said this lasted as long as the armenians had faith that 
gorbachev would understand 
many armenians now dont have that faith 
a poster in an openair exhibit of protest art in yerevans opera 
square nerve center of the republics burgeoning nationalist 
sentiment depicts a weeping armenia and reads moscow does not 
believe in tears 
armenians are painfully aware that for centuries the very 
survival of their largely orthodox christian people has often seemed 
at stake for some the rioting in sumgait was a terrifying reprise 
of the 1915 armenian genocide organized by turkey in which 15 
million armenians are said to have perished 
the mostly moslem azerbajanis are ethnically related to the 
turks and armenians commonly call them turks atop a windswept 
yerevan hill hundreds armenians come daily to lay flowers at the 
memorial to the 1915 genocide victims in a ritual made more 
poignant by the spilling of armenian blood in sumgait 
here 15 million armenians are symbolically buried said one 
recent visitor gayany sarkisyan 25 today the same thing has 
started again in sumgait 
gorbachev rejected that logic at the presidium meeting he told 
an armenian speaker what genocide can one speak of you know what 
that word implies the weight it carries you are making accusations 
that you will regret for the rest of your life 
gorbachev acknowledged the karabakh issue had been long 
neglected and the kremlin has approved a plan to promote the areas 
economic and social development by pumping in government money but 
he drew the line at a redrawing of borders which could set off a 
chain reaction among other disaffected soviet minorities 
if placing the nagornokarabakh automonous region under the 
jurisdiction of someone else is the only way then we should recarve 
our whole country gorbachev said people have lived here for 
centuries theyll say to us have you people at the center gone 
crazy or something 
some in armenia dismayed by what they see as moscows 
proazerbaijan tilt speak openly of organizing a secession attempt 
if they wont accord us the rights that are our due well have 
a referendum and vote to live outside the soviet union says 
wouldbe lawmaker stamboltsyan 
our movement has become a much wider movement its goal is now 
independence says tadevosyan 22 who was fired from his job as a 
civilian firearms instructor after he was sentenced to two 15day 
jail terms 
tadevosyan said he expects moscow officials to provoke an 
incident in order to provide a pretext for liquidating the karabakh 
movement 
against state terror we can only reply with terror and the 
state is using terror he claims 
for others however the karabakh issue and not independence is 
still paramount 
since the soviet union has been founded there have been two 
armenias and now we want to reunite them to bring the baby back to 
the mother said artur danilyan 52 a worker at a yerevan perfume 
factory 
despite the outspoken nationalist sentiment faith in moscow has 
not vanished among many armenians a middleaged armenian bard his 
voice choking with emotion gathered a crowd around him on opera 
square as he read a poem that included these lines 
and if russia knew the truth about what islam was doing here 
she would sweep the moslem lice from the face of russia 
the armenian apostolic church an officially recognized religious 
body in the ostensibly atheist soviet state has opposed the kremlin 
decision on karabakh and expressed hope for eventual reunification 
between the region of more than 160000 people and armenia itself 
about the size of maine with 34 million inhabitants 
karabakh is historically armenian territory archbishop 
nersess bozabalian said in an interview what people there want is 
the freedom to work to produce and to achieve their aims without 
losing their national integrity 
the waves of strikes called in yerevan over the karabakh issue 
have subsided and special units of internal security troops sent to 
the city were withdrawn from the streets in october but 
politically armenia remains on the boil 
on a recent monday more than 1000 marchers set out for yerevan 
from echmiadzin the cradle of the armenian church to demand 
unification with karabakh and the removal of echmiadzins party 
chief whom they accused of corruption and inaction they turned 
back only after a high party official was sent out to the highway to 
meet with them 
armenia by all accounts will never be the same 
these past 10 months have been like a century stamboltsyan 
said we have learned so much its as if the entire republic has 
been to university

a year ago the associated press rode along on a 
predawn trip to denver where mexican farm worker alejandro fierro 
wearing his best blue jeans and finest cowboy hat met us 
immigration officers face to face and applied for amnesty after 30 
years of working illegally fierro now boasts a plasticlaminated 
temporary residence card today with only days remaining until the 
deadline for special agricultural workers to apply for the 
governments onetime amnesty fierro is well along the way to 
permanent status and maybe citizenship 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
after three decades of sneaking into the 
united states to earn a living for his family mexican farm worker 
alejandro fierro this year strode across the border upright and 
legal with proof in his pocket that americas new amnesty program 
works 
fierro was 19 in 1958 when he first swam the rio grande and like 
his father and grandfather before him became an illegal alien 
working in the fields of el norte the land up north 
last summer spiffy in a new shirt and polished cowboy boots he 
summoned up his courage and walked into the denver office of the 
us immigration and naturalization service to apply for amnesty 
under the landmark immigration control and reform act of 1986 
that legislation applied to two groups of foreigners living and 
working without permission in this country applications from those 
trying to prove continuous residency in the united states since 
before 1982 totaled 1761766 in the oneyear registration period 
that ended last may 4 
the second category encompasses illegal aliens who have worked 
with perishable crops in certain periods beginning in 1984 
applicants have until nov 30 to seek ins approval as of nov 9 
according to ins figures 1014115 special agricultural workers 
saws had applied for amnesty the approval rate was running at 92 
percent 
fierro is one of the 281112 saws granted temporary resident 
status as of oct 31 thats the first of three steps leading to 
citizenship a move fierro says he will consider seriously in the 
next few years 
sitting in the shade of a big tree on a lunch break in the dawn 
to pastdark colorado onion harvest fierro unsnapped the left 
breast pocket of his western shirt and pulled out the 
plasticlaminated id card he keeps next to his heart 
a90616632 fierrojacobo alejandro says the fine print 
bearer entitled to reside and work in us until card expires not 
eligible for federally funded assistance program expires jan 1 
1991 
the 49yearold father of six speaks no english but he knew the 
meaning of every word on the ins card 
i feel so happy because there is now no problem to find a job 
and i can take a bus said fierro through his friend and 
interpreter reyes perez a us citizen whos worked beside him in 
farmer harry matsushimas fields for years 
the ins card has given fierro back his dignity its also given 
his middleaged legs a rest 
always before beginning his annual migratory ritual in early 
spring fierro would start his stealthy journey to colorado by 
buying five days worth of tortillas canned meat and sweets and 
filling a gallon jug with water then with a spare shirt stuffed in 
his pocket he would pay some strapping mexican teenager 1 to 
carry him piggyback across the rio grande near presidio texas and 
strike out in the darkness on foot 
for five days fierro used to avoid roads and people walking at 
night and hiding by day and finally board a northbound bus only 
when all his instincts told him he was safe from arrest and 
deportation 
not this year 
for the first time i crossed the bridge at el paso which is 
much closer to my home in chihuahua than presidio the american 
inspector looks at my card everything is ok so i go straight 
across the bridge into the united states i didnt have to buy food 
and water i got on a bus in el paso and didnt have to walk 
anywhere fierro said with a big smile 
he was headed for santa fe to work for a few weeks in a 
restaurant kitchen before colorados agricultural season got 
underway thirty miles south of alamogordo nm the border patrol 
pulled the greyhound bus over and put fierros amnesty card to its 
first major test 
they came on and checked the whole bus i was very relieved 
because they let me pass everybody on the bus had papers they 
didnt catch one illegal fierro said 
once in santa fe he said it was easy to find a 350anhour job 
in a restaurant because there are still a lot of illegals around 
but the bosses wont hire them theyre afraid of being caught 
the 1986 legislation aims to prevent illegal aliens from taking 
jobs that ordinarily would be filled by americans and properly 
documented workers the ins estimates as many as 7 million illegal 
aliens are still in the united states 
nationally as of midoctober the ins had issued 3175 warning 
citations and fined 720 businesses more than 2 million for 
violating the new immigration law 
fierro considers his ins card among his most important 
possessions he has proudly showed it to his 80yearold father 
socorro fierro who he says pronounced it a very good thing 
alejandro fierros three daughters live in mexico two of his 
three sons live and work in this country one lives in wichita 
kan and is married to an american the other lives in santa fe and 
has applied for amnesty his third son is home in chihuahua tending 
the 15 cows and small acreage his father has bought with his 
colorado earnings 
i dont know how long i can make him stay home said fierro 
he knows he can have a much better life in el norte and he wants 
to come too 
fierro who lives on about 30 a week and sends more than 
twothirds of his annual 6000 in wages to his wife planned to 
return home when it gets cold but he will come back next year 
and every year after that hes able to hoe harvest and haul onions 
in 1991 when his current id card expires fierro will be 
notified hes eligible to apply for permanent residency if he has 
been an upstanding citizen and a member in good standing of our 
society said ins spokesman duke austin in washington dc 
then he will have to have permanent immigrant status for five 
years before he can apply for naturalization to become a united 
states citizen said austin the earliest that could happen is 
1996 
fierro who was an illegal alien for 30 years said now that its 
actually possible he often wonders what it would like to be an 
american citizen 
it is a big step he said through his interpreter 
especially learning the english but why not i still have many 
years left

a cry in the dark 
 
a deeply religious australian family goes on a camping vacation 
at the site of ayers rock which rises like a monstrous carbuncle 
from the flat desolate land one evening the wife returns to the 
tent in time to see a dingo a wild dog of the outback escape into 
the darkness the nineweekold baby azaria is missing 
search of the surrounding territory fails to locate the baby the 
sorrowing couple returns home and discovers the disappearance has 
become a national sensation television and the tabloid press raise 
doubts about the mothers story and she is arrested on a charge of 
murder pregnant with her fourth child she is convicted and 
sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor 
a grim harrowing story that happens to be true the events are 
told with apparent fidelity in the warner bros release a cry in 
the dark starring meryl streep and sam neill and directed by fred 
schepisi the screenplay was written by schepisi and robert caswell 
taken from john brysons book evil angels 
meryl streep as lindy chamberlain adds another of her impeccable 
portrayals of tormented women this time affecting an australian 
accent curiously it is her performance itself that prevents a 
cry in the dark from becoming a completely absorbing film her 
lindy is so cool and sardonic that she repells sympathy rather than 
attracts it this reportedly was true with the reallife defendant 
sam neill contributes a wellshaded portrait of a husband 
perplexed and bewildered by the onrush of events schepisis 
direction matches the heaviness of the story he seems obsessed by 
the imagery of the huge rock the significance of which is not 
readily apparent the venality of the news media while perhaps 
historically accurate also seems overplayed 
despite its deficiencies a cry in the dark is a valuable and 
courageous document showing how ignorance and hysteria can inflame 
a ruinous miscarriage of justice only this september was lindy 
chamberlain finally cleared of all charges that is noted in a 
postscript to the movie added just before the release 
menahem golan and yoram globus were executive producers and 
verity lambert produced with roy stevens as line producer the 
rating is pg with scary elements for the very young running time 
121 minutes

u2 rattle and hum 
 
in the age of mtv the concert film has become superfluous 
selfparody u2 the sometimes insufferably selfrighteous rock 
conscience of the 1980s also flirts dangerously with the line over 
which lies unintentional comedy 
it took a young relatively inexperienced director 26yearold 
phil joanou to walk this tightrope oblivious to the lack of a net 
u2 rattle and hum is an unselfconscious visually thrilling 
concert film that honors the music but also reveals the boys in the 
band lead singer bono guitarist the edge bassist adam clayton 
and drummer larry mullen jr as less selfimportant than 
reassuringly selfdeprecating 
most of the film shot during u2s joshua tree tour last 
year is in beautiful black and white concert films can be 
cloyingly arty in the filming but joanou lays down an unobtrusive 
visual backbeat for his stars until its time to take the lead 
and when the camera work is center stage its dazzling joanou also 
did his own editing 
thankfully there are none of those 
sittingaroundthehotelsuiterapping scenes when joanou does try 
to interview the band they giggle and stammer what they know to be 
hopeless banalities such as its a musical journey 
other behindthescenes are quite touching during a visit to 
graceland elvis presleys home in memphis mullen struggles 
earnestly to explain why he liked the elvis movies that hipper types 
disdained bono like an indulgent papa sweettalks the tour guide 
into letting mullen have his picture taken sitting aboard one of 
elvis motorcycles 
the edge provides buster keatonlike comic relief though he is 
quite articulate when asked to talk about the film or the music 
backstage just before an encore huffing and puffing bono shouts at 
him not on the first verse not on the second verse on the third 
verse when bb king joins the band onstage in fort worth he and 
bono walk the stage in rehearsal im no good at chords king 
says youll have to get somebody else to do chords bono 
mutters edge can do it 
the title of the movie is from one of the songs that first seared 
the band into us consciousness bullet the blue sky the 
bands political message is more sophisticated than the usual 
ohwowmanheavy rock dose ironically when bono is flinging 
himself around the stage its hard to concentrate on the message 
when thinking nice hair 
bono does allow himself to be upstaged though as on a trip to a 
harlem church where the new voices of freedom sing i still havent 
found what im looking for as a gospel song or bb kings duet 
on when love comes to town a song bono wrote for the blues 
great when he came to ireland 
the true test of a concert film is after all its concert 
footage and the friendly preview crowd at a times square theater 
thought it was they cheered after every number

videos reviewed this week anna two moon junction 
opera do milandro little nikita 
 
anna vestron video vhsbeta 7998 rated pg13 
 
sally kirkland was nominated for an academy award and 
deservedly so for her portrayal of an aging czech actress in 
anna but this gritty film needs more than her extraordinary 
performance to carry it 
directed by yurek bogayevicz the movie tells the story of anna 
an actress who was a great star in her native czechoslovakia before 
being forced into permanent exile in america 
in new york she is forced to endure degrading auditions for bit 
parts her choice of roles limited by her age and her accent in an 
early scene she hops in circles on one foot screaming the words to 
humptydumpty to one directors bidding she winds up being the 
understudy 
enter krystyna a young czech woman who has followed annas 
career from afar she comes to new york tracks anna to an audition 
asks to be her maid then faints from hunger anna touched by the 
young womans adulation takes her in and begins to school her in an 
acting career 
krystyna played by the achingly beautiful model paulina 
porizkova in her film debut soon learns english has her rotting 
teeth capped and finds that acting roles drop at her feet with 
little effort on her part her youth and her beauty are her only 
ticket and she proves a quick study in cashing in on them 
predictably annas star falls as fast as krystynas rises and 
here lies the chief flaw of the film agnieszka hollands screenplay 
is full of such strained parallels the movie gets very preachy and 
stagy so as to better draw the viewers attention to the injustice 
of youths trampling of experience 
the ending is absolutely implausible but so are so many scenes 
leading up to it that it hardly comes as a surprise 
porizkova with her finely chiseled features and lowkey 
performance is perfect as krystyna both savvy and innocent at the 
same time robert fields has a thankless role as daniel the 
sometimelover of anna who is still financially dependent on his 
parents as he enters middle age

someone once told sherilyn fenn she looked a little like marilyn 
monroe and maybe she ought to be in pictures you remember sherilyn 
she was in those two memorable movies the wild life and just 
one of the guys what you dont remember you didnt see them 
you dont know who she is tsk tsk 
then maybe you should keep your record unblemished and skip two 
moon junction as well its a seedy little movie filled with fake 
erotica and silliness most perpetrated by our little marilyn clone 
fenn plays april delongpre a southern debutante about to marry 
one as equally as privileged as she the wedding is a big affair 
patterned after alice in wonderland indeed april looks 
wistfully a her friends as she clicks together a pair of ballet toe 
shoes perhaps she expects her wedding party to pirouette and 
says shes always dreamed of a story book weeding 
then she meets a carny and as the publicity hype puts it 
sparks ignite into flames of passion their passion is as hot 
and appealing as cold grits and they go through their story with 
the speed of molasses you also can pretty much predict the outcome 
and you also know what evil lurks behind the fatherly smile of burl 
ives here a smalltown sheriff zalman king directed this mess and 
also wrote the screenplay

what up dog chrysalis was not was 
 
ever wonder what happened to the class clowns in your high 
school in the case of donald fagenson and david weiss theyre now 
making records 
billing themselves as donald and david was the duos warped 
sense of humor flows through the new album what up dog 
fortunately its accompanied by some sweet soul music 
the multiinstrumentalists team with the potent vocal team of 
sweet pea atkinson a gruff bass and harry bowens a smooth tenor 
to make streetsmart music what up dog sounds more consistent 
than this groups forgotten 1983 masterpiece born to laugh at 
tornadoes but is ultimately less compelling 
walk the dinosaur with its ackalackaboomboom chorus 
is a terrific mindless dance song that with any luck should be a 
smash 
bowers croons the optimistic anything can happen with this 
irresistible opening couplet she took me in the bedroom to show 
me her computer she asked me if i liked it i told her she was 
cuter 
the was brothers also coax fairly interesting songwriting 
contributions from marshall crenshaw and elvis costello and on the 
compact disc a vocal performance from frank sinatra jr of all 
people 
but they include three cuts that are little more than comedy 
skits with music backgrounds humorous the first time theyre 
listened to a drag thereafter add them to lackluster tunes such as 
boys gone crazy and 11 mph the latter about john f 
kennedys assassination and the filler barometer shoots too high 
then again you didnt have to laugh at all your class clowns 
jokes to appreciate the effort

notes from america columbia bonnie tyler 
 
theres no denying bonnie tylers voice she could should be 
one of rocks finest female vocalists with her husky growl that 
echoes both janis joplin and tina turner 
the presence of such an extraordinary voice makes notes from 
america worth listening to but unfortunately the material tyler 
uses and the overblown production on the record make it very very 
ordinary 
tyler first hit both pop and country charts 10 years ago with 
its a heartache and five years later had a no 1 single with 
total eclipse of the heart 
since then the welshborn tyler has recorded sparingly on 
notes from america she teams up with producersongwriter 
desmond child who is known for his work with bon jovi and 
aerosmith the aim is to create big hits what results is big and 
it might be a hit but it doesnt do justice to tylers abilities 
the album is overproduced at nearly every turn dont turn 
around for instance is a ballad that starts off as a wonderful 
showcase for tylers tough yet vulnerable voice but as it builds to 
a crescendo as many songs on notes from america do and a choir 
chimes in the core of the song is lost in a tidal wave of sound 
the title track features 50 people corralled on the streets of 
woodstock ny where the album was made to sing backup why only 
50 
other tunes stand up better hide your heart is a hookfilled 
rocker dominated by snarling guitars while take another look at 
my heart is a lighter keyboardbased piece that allows tyler to 
stand out she even does a version of the bee gees to love 
somebody thats better than the original 
one song stands head and shoulders above the rest an old janis 
joplin tune turtle blues is a wonderful bluesrocker that 
shows the vocal phrasing range and power of which tyler is capable 
notes from america sounds like much of the commercial rock 
n roll on the radio these days it might make tyler richer but 
its a shame such a voice isnt singing more memorable music

land of dreams reprise randy newman 
 
randy newman the songwriter with humor dark enough to make jokes 
about short people has returned with a rich complex album thats 
easily one of the most pleasant surprises of the year 
land of dreams is full of sharply drawn characters cutting 
emotion and of course humor newman on his ninth album again 
shows he is a deft and perceptive composer 
mark knopfler of dire straits and electric light orchestras jeff 
lynne produced and played on much of the album which also features 
an appearance by tom petty but things are dominated by newmans 
calliopelike piano and deltaaccented voice 
side 1 is purely autobiographical dixie flyer deals with 
newmans early move to new orleans the land of dreams in the 
ragtime new orleans wins the war his father returns from world 
war ii but not before his mother teaches him some things about life 
she said here comes a white boythere goes a black onethat 
ones an octoroonthis little cookie heres a macaroonthat big 
round things a red balloonand the paper down heres called the 
picayune 
on four eyes newman deals with the terrors of his first day 
of school youre not gonna leave me here are you he wails to 
his father 
three songs deal with love and love lost falling in love has 
a whimsical catchy hook that captures the happiness of the feeling 
the relationship matures on the evocative something special but 
then is destroyed on bad news from home a desolate piano piece 
about betrayal 
side 2 is more lighthearted starting with roll with the 
punches a satirical look at how some people would solve the 
problems of the poor and hungry 
i say we aint gotta do nothin for nobodycause they wont 
work a lick you knowthey just gonna have to roll with the punches 
yes they will 
masterman and baby j is a rap sendup but with a vein of 
sympathy for people trapped in ghettos with nothing but dreams of 
stardom to keep their ugly world from ensnaring them 
the hit song its money that matters features a rolling 
knopfler lick and a semiserious lyric about what it takes to make 
it in america and i want you to hurt like i do ends the record 
on a quiet note of domestic pain 
land of dreams rings true while much of it may be drawn from 
newmans own life in the telling of his stories he tells us about 
ourselves

sam neill was born in northern ireland grew 
up in new zealand first achieved notice in australian films and 
became well known in american television a suitable path to 
international stardom 
with his strong features and unaccented english neill is a 
selfproclaimed citizen of the world living in london with an 
apartment in sydney and a mountain hideaway in new zealand he was 
recently here to help launch his new film with meryl streep a cry 
in the dark a quietspoken man he is nevertheless forceful in 
his opinions 
a cry in the dark is based on a reallife cause celebre that 
occupied the australian public for several years the wife of a 
seventh day adventist churchman declared that her nineweekold 
daughter had been snatched from the familys camping tent by a wild 
dog known as the dingo because of a flimsy set of circumstantial 
evidence the woman was charged with murdering the baby 
the media exploited the case stirring up emotions that 
apparently continue today despite the fact that the wife played by 
meryl streep was finally cleared of all charges after serving three 
years of a life imprisonment for murder 
anyone who has been to australia in the last eight years knows 
of this case neill said because of the enormous controversy 
the whole thing stirred up i didnt feel as involved with it as 
others who were more familiar with the case because most of the 
time i was living in england 
i was completely flabbergasted by the extent that people were 
excited or angered they were completely involved in the case their 
opinions are not simply mild they were extremely black and white 
and they still are about whether or not these people are guilty or 
innocent of this crime 
the actor jumped at the chance to rejoin streep and director fred 
schepisi with whom he had worked in plenty but he admitted 
that the role of michael chamberlain presented the biggest challenge 
of his career 
i was scared before we started terrified he said with a 
nervous laugh it was certainly a departure from anything ive 
ever done i was encouraged when i learned that meryl was just as 
frightened as i was 
i had met michael chamberlain and it became apparent that this 
was a dualedged thing i realized that i couldnt take liberties 
with his character or his personality or his story this meant that 
i had to act responsibly most acting is a sort of jump of the 
imagination this was not fiction were talking about the 
chamberlains lives and reputations and their futures too so we 
had to do it right 
neills indeterminate accent is due to his lifelong travels 
through the englishspeaking world he was born in northern ireland 
where his father was a member of an irish regiment of the british 
army his father retired when sam was eight and the family settled 
in new zealand as an outsider in a colonial environment he 
overcame his shyness by becoming an actor 
i saw a lot of american films and british films too he 
recalled films cars and rock n roll music have been the 
primary american export of the past 30 years or so when i was 
growing up we had no television that came very late to new zealand 
so we were raised on a diet of films that were made within a four 
or fivemile radius of this very hotel the beverly hills 
after college neill began making documentary movies then was 
cast by director roger donaldson the bounty marie in a 
modest film called sleeping dogs that led to my brilliant 
career one of the first films in the australian movie boom that 
has produced such actors as mel gibson bryan brown and paul hogan 
directors bruce beresford fred schepisi donaldson and others 
in explaining the creative surge neill commented what we have 
in australia is a very vigorous young society with young ideas and 
the film industry is part of that in some ways its the cutting 
edge of that 
in 1980 neills life was changed by a telephone call out of the 
blue the late actor james mason called him from switzerland to tell 
him you should be working overseas im sending you a plane 
ticket to come to london theres a film i think you should try out 
for 
the young actor flew from sydney to london and won the role of 
the satanic damien in the final conflict last of three the 
omen movies that led to his portrayal of the legendary sidney 
reilly in the acclaimed british tv miniseries reilly ace of 
spies he has also appeared in other miniseries such as kane and 
abel and amerika as well as such features as possession 
enigma leap of faith the good wife and next dead

alvin ailey approaches a joyous celebration of 
the 30th anniversary of the alvin ailey american dance theater on 
dec 7 after being honored by the kennedy center for performing 
arts three days earlier 
along with pride in his integrated modern dance companys 
accomplishments farflung touring a satisfying outreach program in 
kansas city and honors for all of it he also faces his companys 
possible demise 
im facing a 30year season with the possibility this will all 
fall apart in the 30th year ailey said the companys 10year 
lease on 20000 square feet of office studio and school space in 
the minskoff theater building on broadway ends next may 
we came in during a real estate slump said william hammond 
company executive director who sat in on an interview with ailey in 
his office now real estate is booming they want to move to 
commercial rates its impossible weve got the best dance studios 
in the city it would be a shame for the studios to be put to office 
space it would be a shame for the company to go out of business 
hammond has been looking so far unsuccessfully for other quarters 
without a place to be it is difficult to be in business he 
said weve got a great school the city is helpful but no space 
is available for three or four years the problem is keeping alive 
between now and then without space or an angel or patron he has 
considered moving the company out of new york 
while worrying about that ailey is choreographing and running a 
company his opus mcshann to music by 72yearold kansas city 
jazz pianist jay mcshann received its premiere nov 4 in kansas 
city 
when ailey receives kennedy center honors on dec 4 along with 
comedian george burns actress myrna loy violinist alexander 
schneider and arts producer roger stevens his company will dance 
itll probably be sections from revelations aileys stirring 
choreography to spirituals 
the kennedy center honors show will be televised on cbs dec 30 
as a general motors mark of excellence presentation 
ailey returned to new york on election day after seven weeks with 
his company in europe and two weeks in kansas city 
the kansas city engagement which has occured every other year 
since 1984 is close to aileys heart because the company enters the 
community dancing by day for children the elderly and prisoners 
and giving evening concerts 
we came through kansas city on tour to play two nights in 1982 
there was a group called the gentlemen of distinction 21 young 
black businessmen they asked what i really wanted to do i said 
to go into a community and take the dance to people ailey 
recalled 
they have to raise a lot of money to do this and they do it 
the kansas city friends of alvin ailey have functions all year 
round it brings together racial segments which would ordinarily 
never speak to each other to socialize and plan together its a 
very good thing for the city 
the audience in kansas city is very sweet and thinks were 
wonderful and every step we do is special but the most interesting 
thing is dividing the 28 dancers into groups of three or four and 
sending them out to two or three places a day they do introductory 
dance classes at elementary schools 
in one section of opus mcshann ailey said theres an 
interruption by the ku klux klan i couldnt get off without some 
kind of social comment missouri in the 30s was rife with the ku 
klux klan 
i worked on it a lot in paris we had five days of rehearsal in 
paris trying to put some edges together well have a week of 
rehearsal before new york a week of rehearsal is like a gold mine 
theres never enough time to do anything we rehearse constantly on 
the road in hotel rooms and hallways 
the company started in 1958 with unpaid dancers and no real place 
to dance 
we saw the dance explosion happen he said we were part of 
it and helped the surge we saw the civil rights movement the 
national endowment for the arts start in 1966 and the responsibility 
for the arts passed on to corporations which can work in strange 
ways 
the touring program of the national endowment which gave 
presenters a third of the companys fee did a lot to further dance 
in this country weve been struggling since they dissolved it in 
the early 80s 
looking back over his companys accomplishments ailey said 
theyve accomplished a tremendous amouth 
weve done a lot of fantastic things he said i really am 
happy about that we toured more than anybody we were the first 
contemporary dance to go into russia in 1971 and the first into 
china in 1985 we started in europe in 1964 three weeks in paris 
and six weeks in london we spent five summers touring in major 
european festivals 
wed dissolve every time we got back wed come back together 
or id get new dancers when we got work colleges got interested in 
us we spend five months a year touring to colleges and 
communities 
finally ailey says what his company is all about were trying 
to project the idea of the expressive possibilities of movement 
metaphors implications what dance can say to ones interior and 
sensitivity 
the dances should have good taste should not be overly 
commercial we should dance about ordinary people our heritage 
should be celebrated in the dance bringing back modern dance 
classics isnt as easy as one would hope funding agencies are only 
interested in what is new 
last years reconstruction of an evening of katharine dunham 
dances with her help cost 500000 and had donations from the ford 
and doris duke foundations the first act was performed in paris 
this year and ailey hopes money will be raised to take it to 
california on this winters tour 
i decided it would be in part a company to preserve black 
choreography and music with the idea of enlarging the minority 
audience i put dancers of different races together the audience 
could applaud the effort of black and white working together 
ailey also encourages new choreographers the upcoming season 
will include a new dance by rovan deon a student at the ailey 
school

with so much to worry about these days americans 
are bellying up to the table to find solace in foods that stir 
memories as much as taste buds 
socalled comfort foods can be delicious but dont have to be 
can be healthy but generally are not can be downhome but might be 
very special what they have in common is an ability to tug at the 
heart strings 
among the first to recognize the lure of comfort foods were jane 
and michael stern their 1984 square meals cookbook was an early 
sign that the foods from which baby boomers fled were again becoming 
the foods for which they yearned 
several new books including a new one by the sterns show the 
interest has not waned 
theres a kind of spiritual nutriment to be found in honest 
food that doesnt take itself so seriously thats an expression of 
the way people really live stern said in a telephone interivew 
that has been our soapbox since before we did square meals 
in their new book a taste of america andrews and mcmeel 
1695 a compilation of their syndicated columns the sterns roam 
the country in search of honest food they stop to sample bowl of 
the wife of kit carson stew in morrison colo the golden 
noodle bake served at the ls ayres department store in 
indianapolis or the fried okra from ruth and jimmies sporting 
goods and cafe in abbeville miss 
a taste of america provides the flavor of more than the food 
as each recipe has a story of the cook the town or the dish 
in comfort foods donald i fine inc 1695 holly 
garrison also takes a trip this one back in time with recipes and 
anecdotes of canned vegetables and processed cheese marshmallows 
and white bread 
unhealthy certainly but comfort foods generally are older 
recipes before people became aware how unhealthy some of these 
foods are if you eat too much of them said garrison 
so she provides heart preserver tips though for fudge she 
writes there are none fudge is not hearthealthy food 
garrison recommends moderation rather than abstinence and 
sometimes cant resist her own favorite of grannys greatest 
hits fried chicken especially with mashed potatoes and gravy 
probably the bestknown comfort food is chicken soup revered 
for its curative and restorative powers garrison writes among 
the other common foods she includes are chicken stew with dumplings 
mashed sweet potatoes with marshmallows and strawberry shortcake 
as garrison writes it is not always the food but the emotions it 
elicits once upon a time a plump roast chicken for sunday dinner 
was the ultimate symbol of prosperity and wellbeing in america how 
bad could things be when we were surrounded by a loving happy 
family seated together at the big dining room table so loaded with 
serving dishes platters and plates of food that the tablecloth was 
barely visible 
stern said he and his wife began writing about comfort foods 
out of a sense of being fed up with overly pretentious overly 
fancy overly expensive food 
i think what happened is that the muchvaunted culinary 
revolution of the late 70s nd early 80s just went so far that 
everyone started to feel what jane and i were feeling he said 
food ought to be something that makes you feel good not something 
that intimidates you 
author karen brown was a victim of that revolution 
i was a yuppie cook she said i could do a beautiful 
dessert souffle and impress my dates but she couldnt make pot 
roast 
when her son was born seven years ago she looked to the food of 
her childhood many of those recipes appear in mommy meals 
legacy marketing 995 a months worth of menus for foods many a 
50s mother put on her table pot roast banana pudding 
carrotraisin salad pumpkin pie 
brown a 36yearold working single mother in dallas said her 
book is written for the woman whos on a firstname basis with her 
pizza delivery men 
when mine knew all these personal things about my life i knew 
he was there once too often she joked since were so busy 
theres a little guilt that were not giving our children all that 
we had and food is one way to do that 
if comfort food mixes the tummy and the heart then the ultimate 
comfort meal for many must be christmas dinner and in christmas 
memories with recipes farrar straus amp giroux 2250 25 food 
writers share food and spirit 
the menus never varied much from year to year which was now 
that i reflect upon it part of the reassuring warmth of the 
season bryan miller writes 
it is the rituals that count more than anything writes irena 
chalmers basically we hold hands with the generations past but 
forge our own unique links in the chain of memories 
edna lewis recalls that her childhood feasts in freetown va 
began in september when children would gather black walnuts 
hickory nuts and hazelnuts using a nut pick or sometimes a 
hairpin wed pry the nutmeat from the shell rich flavorful 
nutmeats that even on those warm bright days filled us with happy 
anticipation beause we knew they would be baked into delicious 
christmas cakes and cookies 
some of the joy was born of hardship marcella hazan recounts the 
christmas her family returned to their farm in italy at the end of 
world war ii a year when the food served was the only gift 
as a special gift for my father mother rose earlier than 
anyone else to bake ciambella a breakfast cake that is now my 
husbands as it was my fathers favorite thing to have with a 
large morning coffee 
and betty fusell tells of a great depression christmas eve dinner 
of scrambled eggs and brains in our house this was not a 
sophisticated french dish cloaked with capers and beurre noir but 
poverty food cheap and to most of my friends disgusting to me 
brains were lovely not only for their creamy softness but because 
they redeemed the plain scrambled eggs that were our common everyday 
supper little did i dream that eggs fresh from the nest annealed 
with nothing but sweet butter would in my adult years be scarce as 
hens teeth and precious as repentance 
in 20 years more what foods will todays kids find comforting 
its hard to say something mommy fixes or grandma fixes its 
not the food but the association said garrison 
maybe granola maybe mcdonalds said stern 
but the precise food is hardly the point so long as it brings 
comfort a sense of tradition and peace

veteran musician chet atkins says he gets 
depressed unless his nimble fingers are dancing along the neck of a 
guitar 
the 64yearold performer known as mr guitar is staying 
happy by playing his instrument well past the 40year milestone in 
his career 
this fall he won the country music association musician of the 
year award for the ninth time he has a new album chet atkins 
cgp which stands for certified guitar player he performs 
frequently with garrison keillor the former host of the radio show 
prairie home companion and he has released an instructional 
video get started on guitar with chet atkins 
to me playing the guitar is like some people who enjoy a meal 
and a dessert he said i remember my boss at rca when they 
would bring the dessert tray and hed look at it like it was a 
pretty girl 
i think guitar playing to me is that way i see a guitar and 
imagine the tunes i can play on it and i kind of get ecstatic and 
excited like my boss when he looked at that dessert tray 
if im not working on a project i get depressed i think im 
not accomplishing anything and i get mad at the world 
atkins album approximately his 80th includes a duet with dire 
straits mark knopfler on john lennons imagine atkins also 
plays a jazzy version of the 1960s pop hit what a day for a 
daydream and does a rare vocal performance on the ballad i 
still cant say goodbye 
but he didnt have to work much on imagine 
its a beautiful melody theres no use improvising too much 
and leading the listener astray 
even though hes sold more than 30 million records he says he 
still finds it necessary to practice playing the instrument he 
learned as he grew up in rural poverty in the clinch mountains of 
east tennessee 
ive got to its like typing or playing tennis or golf if you 
dont do it every three or four days you cant do it i try to 
practice a little bit every week and learn new things if you dont 
you get so you conform too much and you become very predictable 
he said 
its a constant learning process because the music keeps 
changing due to the entrance of young people into music they 
introduce a lot of new ideas to stay a little bit contemporary 
requires a lot of listening and a lot of work no not work but 
play its always been play to me 
he says he still makes mistakes while playing even though hes 
been coaxing melodies out of the instrument for more than 50 years 
but you learn to cover up those things all notes all 
dissonance leads to something else thats the reason music is 
beautiful music is dissonance always resolved 
any note you play is one halftone away from something that 
will work if you improvise so if i hit a bad note i just go up or 
down a half tone and it sounds like i meant to do it atkins said 
hes so dedicated to the guitar that years ago he named his 
daughter merle after fellow guitarist merle travis 
for some reason the guitar gave me a passion to play it that 
will follow me to the grave i just loved the sound of the chords 
and the romance and the shape of the guitar 
my older brother played the guitar and i thought it was such a 
romantic beautiful instrument my dad was a professional music 
teacher and he didnt want me to play guitar because he didnt think 
there was any future in it 
of course i rebelled like all kids do if kids listened to 
their parents there would never be any progress because they want 
you to stick with the status quo 
he owns about 30 guitars but doesnt consider himself a 
collector 
i dont have room in my little home its better to collect 
gold or diamonds it doesnt take up as much space 
he and keillor performed together in 1987 on keillors final 
broadcast of prairie home companion they have appeared together 
often and are scheduled to perform at carnegie hall in early 1989 
i enjoy working with him and standing and watching him 
entertain in his very unusual way atkins said 
i hope to continue what i do playing a few concerts making 
records ducking when the grim reaper swings at me and get on the 
back porch and pick with my friends

the tearful and tearless both cry on 
william freys shoulder 
among those seeking freys help since he published crying the 
mystery of tears three years ago were a woman whose husband 
alternated bouts of tears and laughter and a restaurateur whose 
cooks cried chopping onions 
for the restaurant owner the answer was easy and timehonored 
chop the onions under a mist of water 
other times its more complicated 
frey advised anne firebaugh 64 who divides her year between 
nanoose bay british columbia and alta sierra calif to take her 
husband joseph 71 to a neurologist mrs firebaugh said freys 
ideas reassured her belief scorned by some doctors that there 
was more to her husbands problems than runaway emotions she 
learned that he is suffering from lou gehrigs disease 
frey believes tears are a bodys way of getting rid of chemicals 
produced by strong emotion 
to get confirmation from someone who has made a study of this 
that was very important to me said mrs firebaugh he is 
someone i can look to for help and guidance 
frey of the dry eye and tear research center at st paulramsey 
medical center receives and answers letters nearly every week from 
people including many men concerned about tears or lack of them 
they get a sympathetic response because frey knows the 
frustration of being unable to cry 
his mother suggested the line of inquiry when he was a graduate 
student in the early 1970s in search of a research project he was 
spurred by curiosity over his own lack of emotional tears since he 
was a child 
once scientifically i started thinking about this i started to 
realize this could be a very important process for us as humans i 
became dissatisfied with what i had been satisfied which was the 
fact i didnt cry very easily or very often he said 
so i went and talked to a psychologist first trying to 
convince a psychologist that this is a problem worth dealing with is 
not easy 
but frey eventually found someone who thought he had a worthwhile 
concern and helped him sort out his feelings he estimates he now 
cries four times a month even if his eyes only well up with tears 
i hear things on the news or i read things in the paper or i 
hear something on national public radio or whatever whereas i used 
to not have any tears or cry i will cry about it now because i 
allow myself to do it 
the identities of the key substances removed in tears still elude 
him partly because he may have made a conceptual error early in his 
experiments 
i thought we could take emotional tears and that we could 
compare those to tears that were produced by eye irritation but the 
thing that i have come to realize lately is that when people tear in 
response to eye irritation there is quite a bit of stress involved 
actually when youre sitting there inhaling vapors from freshly cut 
onion your eyes burn really a lot youre feeling pain stress 
his research backed that up showing the same three biochemicals 
are present in both kinds of tears they are leucineenkephalin an 
endorphin and the hormones prolactin and adrenocorticotropic 
hormone known as acth but he doesnt know in what amounts and is 
working on a way to determine that 
tears also have a lot of material such as wetting agents which 
have interfered with his chemical methods of measurements 
one thing were interested in is trying to understand what is 
the biochemical basis of emotion and stress what happens to us when 
we have changes in our emotions and our affect frey said 
if we really understood the biochemistry of stress and emotion 
we might be able to figure out whats going wrong in people who have 
emotional disorders 
so far though his research has been confined to the tears of 
people who are sad not the clinically depressed emotional tears 
are collected in the laboratory by showing poignant scenes from sad 
movies brians song the champ and all mine to give 
have proven to be reliable tearjerkers 
in his book frey wrote that margaret crepeau at the university 
of pittsburgh school of nursing discovered in 1979 that sufferers of 
ulcers and colitis stressrelated disorders cry less often than 
healthy people 
this suggests theres some kind of correlation between crying 
behavior and susceptibility to stressrelated disorders he said 
it doesnt mean that if you cry you wont get an ulcer or 
anything like that 
the flip side of his research could benefit ophthalmology and 
sufferers of dry eyes who number an estimated 2 million to 4 
million in the united states he said most sufferers of dry eyes 
are postmenopausal women 
frey has found women cry on the average of five times a month 
while men generally cry once a month other research has shown 
little difference in the regularity of emotional crying between boys 
and girls under the age of 12 
thats very interesting because for example the hormone 
prolactin which i think is probably involved in the sex difference 
in crying that we see between males and females is at the same 
level in the blood of children frey said but its 50 to 60 
percent higher in the blood of adult women than in the blood of 
adult men 
in his book frey suggested research to learn whether there are 
anatomical differences in the tear glands of men and women other 
researchers have since reported finding those differences 
pregnant women may have erroneously believed they cried more 
often because they were more aware of their emotions during 
pregnancy and they may have felt like crying more due to the added 
stress of pregnancy 
people who argue against his excretory theory of the tear gland 
generally point out that it lacks the filtering apparatus of the 
kidney and ask where the as yetunidentified waste substances come 
from 
as for the source of the unidentified substances being removed by 
the tear gland he said i suspect that while it might come from 
the blood that there is an equally good chance it might come from 
the brain people forget theres a lot of things still not known 
about anatomy

a nitrogen atmosphere keeps apples sweet in 
storage and a crop specialist says it could do the same for vidalia 
onions 
the special storage also could extend the sales season for the 
onions from the current six weeks to as long as 32 weeks said 
horticulturist doyle smittle at the university of georgias coastal 
plain experiment station 
growers sell 30 million worth of vidalia onions from may 1 to 
june 15 but about 20 percent of the crop is lost because the onions 
cant be stored longer the pressure to sell forces farmers to 
accept lower prices this year there was an oversupply and onion 
prices dropped below normal 
smittle who has spent five years trying to extend the shelf life 
of the worldfamous onions achieved the best results by adapting 
the technology used to store apples in michigan and washington state 
vidalias stored in an atmosphere of 5 percent carbon dioxide 3 
percent oxygen and 92 percent nitrogen kept their sweetness and mild 
taste for months he said the humidity must be kept high for 
apples but low for onions 
smittle compared the quality of 200 pounds of onions in cold 
storage and in a controlled atmosphere for 32 weeks last year the 
lack of oxygen in the atmosphere slows the deterioration of the 
onions 
eightynine percent of the coldstorage onions were rated in good 
condition a week after removal from a 34degree room sixtyfour 
percent were good after two weeks 48 percent after three weeks and 
28 percent after four weeks 
onions kept at 34 degrees in the controlled atmosphere were rated 
100 percent good after one week 98 percent after two weeks 93 
percent after three weeks and 83 percent at the end of four weeks 
the tests show that onions kept in just cold storage tended to 
lose the mild sweet taste that vidalias are known for smittle 
said the onion bites you after you bite it in vidalia quality 
is no 1 if you dont have quality the vidalia name wont mean 
anything 
the current optimum flow of onions is about 250000 bags a week 
during the harvest season but if they could be stored through 
december 18 farmers would need to grow about six times as many he 
said he believes the special storage ultimately could provide 
consumers with vidalias for up to 11 months a year 
based on smittles research wj grimes a major grower in 
wheeler county has begun building a controlledatmosphere warehouse 
for 60000 bags of onions 
the warehouse designed by engineers from georgia power co and 
the little ocmulgee electric membership corp will have 
computerized controls and sensors to monitor and adjust the 
temperature humidity and gas concentration hourly 
grimes said he has tasted vidalias stored in a controlled 
atmosphere for up to seven months the onion still had its flavor 
theres no use in storing it unless its going to be a vidalia 
onion i think theres a future in it

sara moody proudly shows a videotape of her 
10yearold nephew stevie roper riding his bicycle and raking 
leaves with his father 
not so long ago those routine activities could have killed 
stevie who suffers from hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia a lack 
of sweat glands that can cause the body to overheat 
but a phone call to nasa in july 1987 has led to a new active 
life for stevie and hope for hundreds who suffer from the same rare 
birth defect an estimated 400 children in the united states suffer 
from hed 
all i did was make a phone call and the rest fell into place 
said mrs moody 49 a homemaker and president of the hed foundation 
she formed in march that call made after stevie became overheated 
in a car and almost died during a vist to hampton was to nasas 
langley research center 
mrs moody got the idea from watching a tv movie about a young 
man who lacked an immune system and lived inside a protective bubble 
designed by the national aeronautics and space administration 
nasa directed her to life support systems inc of mountain view 
calif which helped develop a cooling system for space suits and 
now makes cool suits for firefighters race car drivers and 
nuclear plant workers 
the company designed a childsized vest and cap that stevie could 
wear as a personal air conditioner a portable cooling pack powered 
by a battery circulates chilled water through tubes to the vest and 
cap 
knowing that stevies parents in waynesville nc couldnt 
afford the suit tootsie moody designed a poster collected her dill 
pickle jars and set them on counters at pofolks a restaurant chain 
managed locally by a friend 
the jars and a fundraising effort by another friend brought in 
more than 5000 but life support systems agreed to sell the suit 
at cost for 2600 so the rest of the money went for stevies care 
after a brief flurry of publicity about the suit mrs moody went 
home and settled down again then the telephone started to ring 
you wouldnt believe the people who started calling that had 
this problem everybody said look why dont you form a foundation 
and go on to help those other children i thought well why 
not 
since she started the foundation suits have been delivered to 
children in birmingham ala knoxville tenn tuscon ariz and 
kuwait 
here we were already gone national and now then international 
pow 
pofolks restaurants across the country now have jars to collect 
money for the hed foundation said carol koenig marketing manager 
of the nashvillebased company the campaign would not have started 
without tootsie moody she said 
she is tireless she just keeps going will not take no for an 
answer but she does it in a way that doesnt offend anyone 
twentyseven children are waiting for suits to be made and the 
money to be raised to pay for them the foundation has raised more 
than 16000 most of it spent to buy suits which also have helped 
multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis patients who need to avoid 
overheating 
aside from helping the children survive the suits have brought 
together hed victims who told mrs moody they had never known anyone 
else with the same condition 
its made a different person out of stevie as it has these 
other people she said they no longer feel like a freak 
theyre out as a normal human being except for no sweat glands i 
think its done good in a lot of different ways

mystery of tears three years ago were a woman whose husband 
alternated bouts of tears and laughter and a restaurateur whose 
cooks cried chopping onions 
for the restaurant owner the answer was easy chop under a mist 
of water 
other times its more complicated 
frey advised anne firebaugh of nanoose bay british columbia 
and alta sierra calif to take her 71yearold husband joseph to 
a neurologist mrs firebaugh learned there was more to her 
husbands problems than runaway emotions he is suffering from lou 
gehrigs disease 
frey of the dry eye and tear research center at st paulramsey 
medical center believes tears are the bodys way of getting rid of 
unwanted chemicals 
his research showed that the same three biochemicals are present 
in both emotional tears and those from irritation 
leucineenkephalin an endorphin and the hormones prolactin and 
adrenocorticotropic hormone known as acth but he doesnt know in 
what amounts and is working on a way to determine that 
if we really understood the biochemistry of stress and emotion 
we might be able to figure out whats going wrong in people who have 
emotional disorders frey said 
so far though his research has been confined to the tears of 
people who are sad not the clinically depressed emotional tears 
are collected in the laboratory by showing poignant scenes from sad 
movies brians song the champ and all mine to give 
have proven to be reliable tearjerkers 
the flip side of his research could benefit ophthalmology and 
sufferers of dry eyes who number an estimated 2 million to 4 
million in the united states he said most sufferers of dry eyes 
are postmenopausal women 
frey has found women cry on the average of five times a month 
while men generally cry once a month other research has shown 
little difference in the regularity of emotional crying between boys 
and girls under the age of 12 
thats very interesting because for example the hormone 
prolactin which i think is probably involved in the sex difference 
in crying that we see between males and females is at the same 
level in the blood of children frey said but its 50 to 60 
percent higher in the blood of adult women than in the blood of 
adult men

a nitrogen atmosphere keeps apples sweet in 
storage and a crop specialist says it could do the same for vidalia 
onions 
the special storage also could extend the sales season for the 
onions from the current six weeks to as long as 32 weeks said 
horticulturist doyle smittle at the university of georgias coastal 
plain experiment station 
growers sell 30 million worth of vidalia onions from may 1 to 
june 15 but about 20 percent of the crop is lost because the onions 
cant be stored longer the pressure to sell forces farmers to 
accept lower prices this year there was an oversupply and onion 
prices dropped below normal 
smittle who has spent five years trying to extend the shelf life 
of the worldfamous onions achieved the best results by adapting 
the technology used to store apples in michigan and washington state 
vidalias stored in an atmosphere of 5 percent carbon dioxide 3 
percent oxygen and 92 percent nitrogen kept their sweetness and mild 
taste for months he said the humidity must be kept high for 
apples but low for onions 
smittle compared the quality of 200 pounds of onions in cold 
storage and in a controlled atmosphere for 32 weeks last year 
eightynine percent of the coldstorage onions were rated in good 
condition a week after removal from a 34degree room sixtyfour 
percent were good after two weeks 48 percent after three weeks and 
28 percent after four weeks 
onions kept at 34 degrees in the controlled atmosphere were rated 
100 percent good after one week 98 percent after two weeks 93 
percent after three weeks and 83 percent at the end of four weeks 
based on smittles research wj grimes a major grower in 
wheeler county has begun building a controlledatmosphere warehouse 
for 60000 bags of onions

sara moody proudly shows a videotape of her 
10yearold nephew stevie roper riding his bicycle and raking 
leaves with his father 
not so long ago those activities could have killed stevie who 
suffers from hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia a lack of sweat 
glands that causes the body to overheat 
but a phone call to nasa in july 1987 has led to a new active 
life for stevie and hope for hundreds who suffer from the same rare 
birth defect an estimated 400 children in the united states suffer 
from hed 
all i did was make a phone call and the rest fell into place 
said mrs moody 49 a homemaker and president of the hed foundation 
she formed in march that call made after stevie became overheated 
in a car and almost died during a vist to hampton was to nasas 
langley research center 
mrs moody got the idea from a tv movie about a young man who 
lacked an immune system and lived in a protective bubble designed by 
nasa 
nasa directed her to life support systems inc of mountain view 
calif which helped develop a cooling system for space suits and 
now makes cool suits for firefighters race car drivers and 
nuclear plant workers 
knowing that stevies parents in waynesville nc couldnt 
afford the suit tootsie moody designed a poster collected her dill

sending some patients home immediately after common 
heart catheter tests could reduce the nations medical bills by 
millions of dollars without injuring peoples health a new study 
concludes 
the report estimates that if 15 percent of the 500000 americans 
who undergo this procedure each year were treated as outpatients 
instead of being hospitalized the savings would be 51 million 
some of the savings may already have been realized because many 
doctors in recent years have begun performing the procedure without 
putting their patients in the hospital for a day or two 
the study directed by dr peter c block of massachusetts 
general hospital was published recently in the new england journal 
of medicine 
the doctors compared the experience of 192 patients who were 
randomly assigned to have the procedure as outpatients and 189 
others who were admitted to the hospital for the test no one died 
and there were no significant differences in the need for later 
hospitalization because of complications 
while they concluded that doing the procedure on an outpatient 
basis is feasible and safe they cautioned that only relatively 
young and healthy patients should be treated this way in the study 
patients were not considered for outpatient treatment if they were 
elderly or had a variety of common medical conditions including 
heart failure and high blood pressure 
in an accompanying editorial dr c richard conti of the 
university of florida said the research provides more evidence that 
outpatient procedures are safe and efficient and the results are 
applicable to the general population considered at low risk 
cardiac catherization involves inserting a slender tube through 
an artery into the heart dye is released into the heart and an 
xray camera is used to take movies of blood flowing through the 
heart arteries the procedure is widely used to diagnose heart 
disease

navy sailors were less likely to be 
infected by gonorrhea and probably by the aids virus after a 
videotape about aids played constantly on their aircraft carrier 
three days before shore leave a doctor says 
the incidence of gonorrhea among the crew dropped 75 percent 
from 16 to four cases per 1000 men per day said dr william o 
harrison who created the video program before his retirement last 
august as head of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome evaluation 
unit at balboa naval hospital in san diego 
if the incidence of sexually transmitted disease is reduced 
then the likelihood of being exposed to the aids virus is reduced by 
the same amount harrison said during a recent symposium at the 
long beach naval hospital 
harrison cited security rules in declining to name the aircraft 
carrier or ports it visited but said it was one of many ships that 
showed the 70minute video the carriers crew however was the 
only group monitored for sexually transmitted disease rates before 
and after the video was shown 
all navy personnel are tested for hiv the aidscausing human 
immunodeficiency virus before they are sent overseas 
i can substantiate that the education program works said lt 
cmdr richard a weiner flight surgeon on the long beachbased 
ship peleliu which recently returned from the western pacific 
we repeatedly showed the educational videotape made by dr 
harrison and lectured the crew before pulling into port there were 
no hiv positives people who tested positive for signs of aids 
infection and there was a marked decrease in the rate of sexually 
transmitted disease among the crew 
the video describes case histories and how those people 
contracted aids and in a simplified way explains the human immune 
system and how hiv affects the body and discusses the risk of 
catching aids from infected people on active duty harrison said

researchers have preliminary evidence that extra 
doses of vitamin e may help elderly people ward off disease by 
boosting the strength of their diseasefighting immune systems 
despite the new evidence however doctors say more research will 
be necessary before they recommend that people take this nutrient to 
stay healthy 
our goals are to identify whether the elderly ought to take 
supplements and to identify the role diet and nutrition play in the 
agerelated diseases and the immune system said dr jeffrey b 
blumberg 
the research was conducted on 32 elderly volunteers at the us 
department of agriculture human nutrition research center on aging 
at tufts university for a month half of them got vitamin e 
supplements while the rest took dummy pills 
skin tests showed marked enhancement of the immune response in 
those getting the vitamin their blood also carried more stimulated 
white cells that indicate the vigor of the immune system 
our results show improvements in immune responses of already 
healthy people said blumberg chief of the lab where the 
research was conducted 
some experts believe that a breakdown of the immune system may 
contribute to the illnesses that afflict old people including 
cancer and infections part of this immune weakness may result from 
oxidation the destructive process that makes iron rust and food 
turn rancid 
vitamin e is an antioxidant it consumes the highly reactive 
chemical molecules known as free radicals that result from 
oxidation in the body levels of antioxidants in the body seem to 
decline with age

westinghouse electric corp expects to save 
500000 a year after an artificial intelligence program taught the 
company a thing or two about making the metal tubes that contain 
nuclear fuel in reactors 
conventional industrial computer programs called expert systems 
control production by applying known rules for making particular 
products westinghouse fed the computer raw data from the production 
line 
the discovery system as the company calls it looks at its 
own performance and says i produce good tubing or bad tubing and 
if i produce bad tubing using the experts rules theres obviously 
something missing said researcher jan schreurs 
it helped improve a process at the blairsville specialty metals 
plant in which short thick zirconium alloy tubing is rolled into 
long thin tubes that hold nuclear fuel pellets in reactor fuel 
assemblies 
the computer discovered that the surface quality of tubing did 
not depend simply on the temperature of the fluid used to cool the 
rolling machine and the alloy said schreurs and neil pessall 
another researcher another critical factor was the difference in 
coolant temperatures on the day the rolling machine was calibrated 
and on the days of production 
a new rule derived by humans using the findings says the 
temperature can differ up to 20 degrees fahrenheit before surface 
quality deteriorates before the weather was creating temperature 
differences of 40 degrees 
this process has been used for about two decades without ever 
anybody coming up with a rule schreurs said adding that the rule 
had been there all along but lay buried in the myriad facts that 
only a computer could sort 
the computer does the tedious part of the work looking at the 
same data in a thousand different says you can do that on paper of 
course but people get very tired of doing that they try a few 
obvious things but if they dont find what theyre looking for they 
give up and forget the data the computer doesnt get tired and it 
doesnt forget the data 
the rule is expected to bring about a 1 percent to 2 percent 
increase in the amount of tubing that doesnt need reworking or 
adjustments worth about 500000 a year in production cost savings

grain and soybean futures opened lower today on

soybean prices also were pressured by a combination of bearish 
technical and fundamental signals including beneficial rain over 
the weekend in the major soybeangrowing region of brazil 
rain in the winter wheat areas of the united states weighed on 
soybean prices this morning 
but corn was down only slightly in early trading with support 
stemming from reports that the soviet union had told argentinian 
exporters that it intended to buy only us corn to fill its corn 
import needs for the remainder of this year

commodore international ltd the 
resurgent maker of microcomputers on monday unveiled three new 
models aimed at business users including two additions to its amiga 
line intended to compete with apple computer incs macintosh 
the amiga 2500 and the amiga 2000hd are the first additions to 
the line since two machines one intended primarily for home use and 
another for business were unveiled in april 1987 
the amiga ranks fourth in us sales among computers with 32bit 
microprocessors behind the macintosh international business 
machines corps personal system2 model 70 and compaq computer 
corps deskpro 386 according to market researcher ims america ltd 
especially with apples introduction of the mac ii and iix 
they needed to get the new amigas out because amiga was the hardware 
leader three years ago said rhett anderson associate editor of 
compute gazette a magazine targeted at commodore users and 
published in greensboro nc 
some of their thinking might be if they get these out before 
christmas they consumers might hear the word amiga and some might 
take 500s last years lowcost home computer model home he said 
the new amigas offer twice the capacity of the earlier models and 
a faster microprocessor 
the 2000hd comes with software loaded on a hard disk so the 
machine is ready to use right out of the box said spokesman gary 
fishman 
the suggested retail price for the 2500 is 4699 and the 200hd 
is priced at 2699 the suggested prices for the latest macintosh 
machines range from 100 to 3000 more than the amiga 2500 
the company also introduced the pc40iii which is commodores 
first ibm atcompatible machine sold in the united states fishman 
said commodore already sells ibmcompatible computers in europe 
earlier this month commodore reported a 52 percent increase in 
earnings to 96 million for the first fiscal quarter of the year 
the company suffered serious losses in 1985 and 1986 before starting 
to turn around last year

the supreme court today ordered a florida court 
to restudy whether that state may tax income derived from the sale 
of oil extracted from the outer continental shelf 
the court sent a case involving shell oil co back to the florida 
supreme court for further study in light of the us supreme courts 
ruling on nov 8 in a case from iowa 
the justices ruled that iowa may tax income derived from oil and 
natural gas taken from the outer continental shelf 
the high court upheld an iowa law that allows a state to impose a 
tax on that portion of a companys income calculated to come from 
the amount of business it does within that state 
in the florida case that states highest court ruled in 1986 
that the florida tax applies to offshore oil refined and sold by an 
oil company within the 50 states after it has been transferred to 
the mainland by pipeline from the offshore wells and platforms 
the state court said only income from oil actually sold on the 
platforms at sea is exempt from the florida tax 
the outer continental shelf is underwater land more than three 
miles off the shore of any state the land is owned by the federal 
government which leases it to private companies 
shell said a 1953 federal law authorizing exploration and 
production of outer continental shelf oil bars states from taxing 
any natural gas or oil derived from the offshore land regardless of 
where the products are sold 
any form of state levy direct or indirect would adversely 
affect the amounts of revenue available to the federal government 
from the offshore leases shell said 
state taxes reduce the value of the federal leases the company 
said 
it added that the florida tax is precisely the result congress 
attempted to forbid in exempting the oil from state taxes 
the florida department of revenue imposed the tax on a portion of 
shell oils profits based on a complex formula designed to take into 
account what percentage of the companys national business occurs in 
florida 
the natural gas extracted by shell was not affected by the case 
because it is transferred to other companies that rent space on 
shells offshore platforms and was not carried by pipeline to the 
mainland before sale 
the supreme court in 1981 struck down a louisiana tax on natural 
gas that passes through the state on its way to consumers in other 
states the court said the louisiana tax interferes with interstate 
commerce and with the authority vested in the federal energy 
regulatory commission 
the case is shell oil vs florida 861593

the federal government today ordered a broad 
range of transportation workers from commercial pilots to truckers 
to undergo random drug testing but the testing need not begin for 
at least a year 
transportation secretary jim burnley told a news conference the 
regulations would cover about 4 million workers and were intended to 
take us as far as is practically possible toward ending drug 
use among workers in jobs were safety is an issue 
the transportation department said without offering specifics 
that large companies and transit agencies would have until december 
1989 to begin the testing smaller ones will have up to two years 
under the new rule employers must keep records of testing 
results and make them available to federal officials it was not 
clear how independent truckers would be expected to comply with that 
provision 
unions representing transportation workers have strongly opposed 
required random testing although the unions have been willing to go 
along with other tests such as those conducted prior to employment 
or after accidents 
the random testing requirement is virtually sure to be challenged 
in the courts but dot officials have said they are confident of 
having the tests upheld because of the safety implications 
the testing regulations will cover an estimated 25 million 
overtheroad truckers including the tens of thousands of 
independent truckers many of whom work for themselves and drive 
their own truck 
critics as well as some supporters of the testing regulations 
have questioned whether the rules should even cover truck drivers 
because the testing may be virtually impossible to enforce among the 
independent drivers 
according to government sources who asked not to be named other 
workers subject to random tests include 
more than 500000 airline workers including 50000 commercial 
pilots more than 80000 flight attendants and nearly 300000 
aircraft mechanics 
nearly 300000 railroad employees including engineers and other 
train operators 
about 110000 urban mass transit workers including subway and 
city bus drives 
under the regulations workers would be subject to preemployment 
tests periodic testing whenever a person takes a physical 
postaccident tests tests for reasonable cause and random tests 
the drug testing rule had been expected for months 
burnleys predecessor elizabeth dole called for increased 
testing for drugs among workers in all modes of transportation in 
early l987 the department has issued proposed regulations for the 
various modes of transportation during the last year 
congress this year debated legislation that would have required 
drug testing of millions of transportation workers but the 
provision never was approved in part because of strong opposition 
from organized labor the department has maintained however that 
it does not need new regulations to impose the testing requirements 
unions contend the random tests violate privacy and could make 
workers vulnerable to losing their jobs because of erroneous 
laboratory results

control data corp turning more 
pessimistic said monday it expects to record a loss in the fourth 
quarter that will leave it with approximately breakeven results for 
the year as a whole 
the change in outlook is mainly attributable to continued delays 
in shipments in the companys computer products division control 
data said this includes startup production delays for the new 
control data cyber 960 midrange mainframe which earlier 
experienced delays in availability of critical logic chips 
the outlook for the year particularly in the computer products 
division has changed in the last few days said robert m price 
chairman and chief executive officer in a written statement 
the bulk of the change is due to timing as opposed to lost 
business 
last month control data reported a net loss of 24 million on 
revenues of 8414 million for the third quarter ending sept 30 
for the first nine months of the year the company had net earnings 
of 145 million on revenues of 27 billion

grand metropolitan plc seeking pillsbury co in 
a 523 billion hostile takeover said monday that a group of 
investors including pillsbury may be planning a pacman countermove 
on the british conglomerate 
walter montgomery a spokesman for grand metropolitan confirmed 
the accuracy of remarks about the rumored move which were made by 
the companys chief executive officer ian a martin in an 
interview 
martin told the wall street journal he was taking seriously 
rumors that a group of other unidentified investors were seeking 
buyers for all or parts of grand metropolitan a large londonbased 
distilling gambling and franchise concern 
he also said one of the potential participants might be 
pillsbury the big minneapolisbased food and restaurant franchise 
targeted for acquisition by grand metropolitan last month at the 
same time martin expressed some doubt that pillsbury would 
undertake a pacman defense 
the pacman strategy is so named because it resembles the popular 
video game in which a target turns and tries to gobble up its 
pursuer 
pillsbury spokesman john thompson said he had no comment on 
martins remarks 
part of the reason grand metropolitan might be considered an 
attractive takeover target was the difference between its stock 
price of about 8 a share and its estimated breakup value of between 
1250 and 18 a share 
that degree of discrepancy often invites takeover bids by 
investors who hope to profit by selling pieces of a target company 
when theres a gap as big as there is between our share price 
and breakup value you have to take it seriously just as a 
technical matter martin told the journal 
martin said he saw little logic in a pillsbury move on his 
company so the only conclusion i can come to is that if the 
rumors are true theyre trying to frighten us to abandon our bid 
or something of that kind 
nevertheless he said we have to take it seriously were in a 
major bid battle here we dont know the source of the rumors or how 
serious they were 
on oct 4 grand metropolitan undertook one of the biggest hostile 
takeover attempts on a company with a 60ashare tender offer for 
pillsbury which has been fighting the bid last week pillsbury 
announced a restructuring that includes spinning off its burger king 
corp subsidiary as an independent company 
pillsbury and grand metropolitan also have been skirmishing in 
court over the validity of pillsburys poison pill antitakeover 
bylaw which thus far has prevented grand metropolitan from 
accepting any tendered shares the bylaw would make an acquisition 
prohibitively expensive

the number of working oil and gas rigs plunged by 
45 this week to total 897 marking the largest singleweek decline 
since february industry watcher baker hughes inc reported 
the sharp drop continues a seesaw trend in the volatile energy 
industry but contradicts a traditional yearend increase said 
baker hughes spokesman ike kerridge 
the count has been moving up and down but its been within a 
narrow range for several months kerridge said we dont have 
any explanation for this except to say that its probably the 
result of of uncertain crude prices 
the number of rigs last week increased by 19 to total 942 
following a decline of 10 working rigs in the previous week 
a year ago the count was 1174 baker hughes said monday 
the count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity 
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of 
last friday not the number of rigs actively producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
the lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on may 2 
the 897 reported monday is the lowest count since aug 1 when there 
were 894 working rigs 
it also marked the single largest decline since feb 1 when the 
count dropped by 62 rigs to total 964 
among major oil producing states texas posted the biggest drop 
with 20 fewer rigs followed by wyoming five colorado new mexico 
and ohio four each california and north dakota three each and 
kansas one 
states that saw increases include oklahoma three pennsylvania 
two and michigan one louisianas count was unchanged for the week

president reagan on monday recognized the 
winners of a new national business award for quality control saying 
their accomplishments helped america become more competitive in 
world markets 
the first annual malcolm baldrige national quality awards were 
presented to motorola inc and westinghouse electric corps 
commercial nuclear fuel division in the manufacturing category and 
to globe metallurgical inc of beverly ohio in the small company 
category 
the awards were created by congress last year in honor of 
baldrige who was killed in a rodeo accident in california in july 
1987 while serving as secretary of commerce 
supporters hope honoring us companies for their qualitycontrol 
efforts will boost the standing of us products on overseas 
markets the baldrige prize is modeled after the deming prize which 
japan has been awarding since 1951 to recognize quality achievements 
by japanese companies 
w edwards deming is an american quality control expert revered 
in japan for his work with japanese companies after world war ii 
todays ceremony reflects both the progress we have made and 
the promises that we have yet to keep reagan said americas 
economic strength depends on industrys ability to improve its 
productivity and quality 
c william verity who succeeded baldrige as commerce secretary 
said that the awards were a direct answer to critics who still 
think it is fashionable to question the quality of products that are 
marked made in america based on the strength of the 
applications received this year i think it is clear that the 
winners accomplishments are just the tip of the iceberg in a 
backtoquality movement in this country 
commerce department officials said that 66 us companies entered 
the competition for the first awards the legislation allows up to 
two awards to be presented in the three categories manufacturing 
services and small companies with fewer than 500 employees 
however the judges decided not to make any awards in services 
this year and only one award in the small business category 
accepting the awards were robert w galvin chairman of the board 
of motorola john c marous chairman and chief executive officer of 
westinghouse and arden c sims president of globe metallurgical 
sims said that globe which produces specialty metal alloys at 
plants in beverly ohio and selma ala refused to accept the 
gloom spreading over americas smokestack industries we aimed 
at becoming the lowestcost highest quality producer in the world 
we hit that mark 
motorolas galvin said that his company which employs 99000 
workers at 53 plants worldwide launched a drive to improve the 
quality of its electronic products in 1981 and is well on the way to 
achieving its 10year goal of zero defects in everything that we 
do 
westinghouse employs 2000 people in its nuclear fuels unit at 
plants near pittsburgh where the metal tubes are manufactured and 
two facilities near columbia sc where the uranium fuel pellets 
are loaded into the metal rods 
westinghouse supplies about 40 percent of the us market for the 
nuclear fuel rods used at nuclear plants generating electricity in 
the united states and has 20 percent of the world market 
marous said his companys nuclear business was part of a 
goldfish bowl industry because of public concerns over the 
safety of nuclear power he said he hoped the award would reflect 
credit on the entire industry which is so important to the economic 
wellbeing of the nation

president mikhail s gorbachev summoned top 
communist party and government officials to a provincial town monday 
and told them his reforms will fail unless consumers get better food 
supplies 
his decision to gather top kremlin leaders officials of the 
staterun media as well as regional and district party chiefs in 
orel indicated the importance of the topic as well as the success 
the area has had improving its farm output 
such meetings rarely are held outside the kremlin 
the evening tv news program vremya devoted its first 80 
minutes to the meeting showing gorbachevs remarks and those of a 
parade of orel officials and farmers who said they had increased the 
output of milk and other foodstuffs because of agricultural reforms 
introduced under gorbachev communist party chief since march 1985 
we dont need just words on this theme there have been a lot 
of words spoken already including during the years of 
perestroika gorbachev said in remarks carried by the tass news 
agency now it is clear to us that we cannot move forward 
successfully not having decided this problem 
official radio moscow said gorbachev called the soviet unions 
food supply problems the most important problem of the internal 
policy of the soviet union he has said many times that improving 
food supplies and consumer goods is the top priority of his reform 
effort 
the collectivized farm sector is plagued by low productivity 
disregard for the land and machinery waste in shipping and storage 
and few cultural and social amenities in the countryside 
soviet food stores frequently are empty of anything but the most 
basic goods 
at the meeting in the communist party central committee last 
month gorbachev said agrarian policy had turned farmers from 
masters of their land into day laborers 
gorbachev announced plans then to push his leasecontract 
program under which large collective and state farms turn over land 
to families and other small groups on longterm leases into the 
whole farm sector 
officials say such a system instills in farmers greater care for 
the land and makes them several times more efficient than other 
farmers 
gorbachev billed the meeting in orel an industrial city about 
230 miles south of moscow as a runup to a meeting in the communist 
partys policymaking central committee in february to discuss farm 
policy 
he frequently goes on trips outside of moscow to push his reform 
effort but it was rare for him to call a large gathering of top 
national and regional officials outside of the kremlin 
farms in the region produce grain vegetables and dairy products 
and raise beef cattle 
gorbachev who was responsible for soviet farm policy before 
becoming party general secretary in 1985 said improvements in the 
orel regions agricultural production in the past three years prove 
the value of his drive for greater local control tass said 
the improvements indicate much depends on the initiative and 
independence of local organs of power to rule and decide practical 
problems of the agricultural sector tass said 
the lead article of the government newspaper izvestia monday 
evening said the orel region had increased its sales of meat by a 
third and milk by 17 percent in the past three years it ran its 
story under a headline lease contracts return the land to its 
master 
among the kremlin officials who attended the gathering were 
politburo member yegor k ligachev formerly regarded as the no 2 
leader but shifted at the end of september to the agriculture 
portfolio ligachev did not attend a midoctober meeting in the 
central committee on agriculture 
other politburo members who attended were vitaly vorotnikov 
president of the russian republic moscow party chief lev zaikov 
and former agricultural party chief viktor nikonov

coffee futures prices plummeted monday as reports of discord at 
the london meeting of the international coffee organization reached 
traders on the floor of coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange in new york 
on other exchanges copper gold silver oil and pork futures 
rose cattle grains and soybeans were mixed and stockindex 
futures advanced 
a weeklong meeting of the 74 nationmembers of the international 
coffee organization opened on a sour note with the producer 
countries divided on their goals and the united states the largest 
of the consumer members threatening to withdraw from the ico unless 
it becomes more responsive to the marketplace 
us representative allan wallis the undersecretary of state 
for economic affairs said us participation in the next 
international coffee agreeement was in jeopardy due to the 
problems of the twotier coffee market and the tight availability of 
the mild arabica coffee beans favored by american coffee drinkers 
a twotier market has been created by the willingness of coffee 
producers to sell coffee beans at a discount to countries that are 
not ico members said arthur stevenson an analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
although the european economic community and other northern 
hemisphere nations belong to the ico the united states absence 
from a new agreement would likely be seen as a death blow to the 
agreements effectiveness stevenson said 
that prospect prompted heavy selling of coffee futures in new 
york coffee settled 89 cent to 152 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in december at 12727 a pound 
the london meeting is the second to be held this year to conduct 
preliminary negotiations toward a new coffee agreement the current 
pact expires next sept 30 
despite his complaints wallis expressed confidence that the 
negotiations could produce a satisfactory compromise and stevenson 
noted that bargaining was at an early stage 
we cannot realistically expect the boys in london to wrap up 
everything this week he said 
copper futures prices advanced slightly on new yorks commodity 
exchange after both the comex and the london metal exchange reported 
drawdowns last week in their warehouse stocks of the metal 
copper prices declined last week after touching a new record high 
of 1538 for spot delivery but fred demler metals economist with 
drexel burnham lambert inc in new york said the market appeared to 
be consolidating before moving higher 
theres a lot of nervousness in the market right now he 
said the technicals chart signals suggest maybe the correction 
isnt over 
copper settled 20 cent lower to 180 cents higher with the spot 
november contract at 143 a pound and december at 136 a pound 
gold and silver futures advanced on the comex mainly in response 
to a gain in energy prices demler said 
gold settled 210 to 230 higher with december at 42520 a 
troy ounce silver was 27 cents to 3 cents higher with december at 
6445 a troy ounce 
fears of tight gasoline supplies supported energy futures prices 
on the new york mercantile exchange although trading volume was 
light 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 32 cents 
higher with december at 1427 a barrel heating oil was 34 cent to 
62 cent higher with december at 4463 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 61 cent to 151 cents higher with december at 4816 
cents a gallon 
cattle futures ended mixed to lower on the chicago mercantile 
exchange after a late selling flurry erased earlier gains analysts 
linked the selling to light movement of boxed beef at lower prices 
and concern that the live cattle market had also slowed 
pork futures gained slightly due to higher cash prices following 
light weekend marketings 
live cattle settled 33 cent lower to 03 cent higher with 
december at 7230 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent lower 
to 25 cent higher with november at 8160 cents a pound live hogs 
were unchanged to 32 cent higher with december at 4067 cents a 
pound frozen pork bellies were 35 cent to 57 cent higher with 
february at 4477 cents a pound 
corn futures advanced on the chicago board of trade on rumors 
that the soviet union had bought up to 2 million metric tons of us 
corn wheat and soybeans finished narrowly mixed after recovering 
from an early selloff 
wheat settled 1 cents lower to 1 cent higher with december at 
420 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents higher with december 
at 271 a bushel oats were cent lower to 1 cents higher with 
december at 213 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents lower to cent 
higher with november at 759 a bushel

the united food and commercial workers union 
said monday it plans to sue dart group corp for an unsuccessful 
takeover attempt that the union claims may put over 9000 bradlees 
employees out of work 
carey butsavage an attorney for the ufcw said the union will 
seek to make dart group based in landover md reimburse employees 
for any lost wages they would have earned under their current union 
contracts 
the ucfw also wants dart to pay the costs of employees medical 
insurance and retraining 
bradlees is a discount store chain owned by bostonbased stop amp 
shop cos inc the target of an unsuccessful buyout attempt by the 
hafts earlier this year stop amp shop decided to sell many of its 
bradlees stores to help pay the debt it incurred in a 123 billion 
leveraged buyout undertaken to thwart dart 
a leveraged buyout blocked the haft takeover but they walked 
away with their customary fat profit this time 17 million 
said tom mcnutt president of local 400 of the ucfw bradlees 
employees had their jobs sold out from under them to pay the costs 
of the haft raid 
dart group controlled by herbert haft and his son robert has 
been involved in a number of unsuccessful takeovers 
robert haft dart group president on monday defended his 
companies actions in a press release saying the claims are 
without merit and appear to be a publicity stunt 
the civil suit was to be filed in camden nj the union said 
court papers were made available to reporters monday but court 
officials in new jersey could not immediately say whether the suit 
actually had been filed 
although dart controls retail operations of its own such as 
crown books the hafts have earned a reputation as corporate raiders 
by launching bids for several major retailing chains such as 
supermarkets general safeway stores and eckerd corp 
none of the raids have been successful but in most of them dart 
reportedly has profited by selling its stock to the target company 
or a rival bidder 
dart launched its bid for stop amp shop in january following a 
similar pattern stop amp shops stock price soared as management 
fought to remain independent and speculators anticipated a bidding 
war 
stop amp shop finally agreed to a leveraged buyout arranged by new 
yorkbased kohlberg kravis roberts amp co in such deals a company is 
acquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with the 
companys cash flow or money raised by the sale of its assets 
the deal allowed stop amp shop to remain independent but to pay 
the enormous debt it had to sell part of its underperforming 
bradlees division hechinger co bought the leases to 47 local 
bradlees stores 
in may stop amp shop said it would sell all of the 58 bradlees 
stores in its southern divison including southern new jersey 
maryland and virginia approximately onethird of the bradlees it 
owns the company decided not to sell its 113 stop amp shop stores

interco inc indicated monday it would continue 
resisting a 27 billion hostile takeover bid and would go ahead 
with a planned restructuring if its suitor follows through on its 
threat to withdraw the offer 
the furniture and apparel maker also said it intended to pursue 
its appeal of a delaware court ruling striking down its poison 
pill defense against the 74 a share tender offer 
interco closed down 212 a share at 6587 in new york stock 
exchange trading on monday 
interco made its disclosures in a letter to cardinal acquisition 
corp led by steven and mitchell rales of washington dc 
they came the day after cardinal released a letter to interco 
extending its hostile offer by two days to midnight est wednesday 
and threatening to withdraw the offer if company did not agree by 5 
pm est wednesday to give it confidential corporate information or 
enter into buyout talks 
interco fashioned the restructuring as a defensive maneuver to 
help it thwart the raleses who it has rebuffed since their initial 
64 a share buyout offer in july 
the 28 billion plan includes payment of a special dividend 
totaling 3080 in cash and securities plus the possible sale of 
its ethan allan furniture business and other operations 
the raleses have insisted on a chance to bid on any assets 
interco might put up for sale in a letter to steven rales released 
monday interco chairman harvey saligman indicated that if the 
raleses did decide to withdraw their tender offer they would be 
invited to bid on any properties interco decided to sell 
cardinal announced last wednesday that interco stockholders had 
tendered 296 million shares under its offer combined with the 32 
million shares the group already owns that would give the raleses 
control of 92 percent of intercos outstanding shares 
in its letter the group contended the only barrier to completion 
of a buyout was intercos refusal to withdraw its takeover defense 
last week the delaware chancery court enjoined the use of the 
poison pill defense but interco has appealed the decision to the 
delaware supreme court which agreed to hear the appeal on nov 30 
interco is incorporated in delaware 
while you profess to have confidence in your position on 
appeal your letter boils down to an attempt to pressure us into 
abandoning it saligmans letter read we decline to do so 
interco employs about 54000 people nationwide and had sales of 
334 billion last year in addition to ethan allen the company 
controls such clothing furniture and shoe brands as london fog 
converse and florsheim

the united states could face another energy 
crisis if the domestic oil industry fails to gain congressional 
support for a national policy an oilpatch lawmaker told oil company 
executives monday 
a national oil policy is needed to boost domestic production 
which has plunged in recent months along with crude prices leaving 
the united states dependent on foreign sources for nearly half of 
its oil speakers told the annual meeting of the american petroleum 
institute 
i think were drifting toward a serious energy crisis said 
sen john b breaux dla 
breaux warned that by allowing the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries to flood world markets with oil and in effect 
to dictate oil policy i fear there wont be anybody left in 
the united states to produce 
breaux and other speakers called on industry leaders to urge the 
new administration and congress to support tax incentives to help 
neutralize current volatile oil prices 
earlier amoco corp chairman richard m morrow told reporters at 
a news conference that us oil production had fallen by 1 million 
barrels a day due to declining oil prices while demand had 
increased by the same amount 
morrow who also is chairman of the api predicted that if the 
current trend continues the united states could be importing 
twothirds of its oil by the year 2000 a situation which has 
serious ramifications for the united states foreign imports 
have soared to about 42 percent 
but while presidentelect george bush has said he would support 
incentives to strengthen us production us rep richard b 
cheney rwyo said winning the support of congress would not be 
easy 
getting an energy policy is going to be tough i would like 
to tell you that things are different but they arent cheney said 
cheney said consumers as well as many in government are 
insensitive to the industrys problems because they like cheap gas 
and oil 
many in congress are sayingyou guys did well when oil was 
30 a barrel he said 
most economists and analysts attending the api meeting said they 
were not optimistic that opec would reach an accord any time soon on 
limiting production to help boost prices 
the 13nation cartel meets nov 21 in vienna to discuss possible 
ways of boosting prices 
morrow also said that he believed more and more us oil 
companies would move production overseas in the future in the 
absence of incentives and in an effort to avoid costly environmental 
regulations 
he said amoco spends 35 to 40 percent of its production budget on 
international exploration and will boost that to 50 percent in the 
near future

suitor 
robins and rorer had signed a breakup fee agreement that was 
approved as part of robins chapter 11 reorganization case but the 
court did not approve a similar proposal involving sanofi 
sanofi said in mondays filing that it should receive the money 
even though it had no courtapproved agreement 
the company claimed there was at least an implied agreement 
between it and robins because their teams of executives lawyers

around the clock to negotiate agreements and prepare documents by 
court deadlines 
john d taylor a robins senior vice president said company 
officials could not comment on sanofis filing because they had not
