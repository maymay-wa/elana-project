national elections sunday will likely leave the 
government in the throes of the current legislative gridlock 
regardless of the winner analysts say 
some say the paralysis could leave japan without strong 
leadership to bargain with the united states on trade disputes 
japans leadership has been hamstrung in recent months by 
opposition control of the upper house of parliament and power 
struggles within the governing party 
six political parties with widely differing agendas are 
contending for the 512 seats in the lower house of parliament in an 
election expected to set the tone for japan in the 1990s 
the lower more powerful part of japans twochamber parliament 
passes the budget and appoints the prime minister 
all the party leaders speak of the need to negotiate to resolve 
the legislative crisis after the election but they agree on 
little else said an analysis in todays yomiuri shimbun a 
conservative national daily 
polls in the final week before the election predict the 
governing liberal democratic party will hold its majority but 
political analysts have not ruled out upsets because 30 percent or 
more of voters were undecided 
the conservative liberal democrats in power since the party was 
formed in 1955 lost control of the upper house last year after it 
leaders were battered by a series of sex and bribery scandals and 
an uproar over a new sales tax 
sundays election is critical for prime minister toshiki kaifu 
who lacks a firm power base within his own party he became leader 
of the governing party last summer after two prime ministers were 
forced to step down because of scandals 
here are three possible scenarios in the postelection political 
scene 
if the liberal democrats come in short of a majority kaifu 
will step down immediately former foreign minister shintaro abe is 
the widely favored candidate to replace kaifu but the opposition 
camp is likely to try to appoint popular socialist leader takako 
doi as prime minister 
liberal democrat secretarygeneral ichiro ozawa said his party 
will turn over the government to the opposition if it fails to win 
a majority 
as we are already short of a majority in the upper house i 
must admit the peoples decision not to give us control of the 
lower house would have an immeasurably important significance he 
told the associated press if we lose in this election we have 
no choice but to turn over the government 
that would mean japan could have a leftistled coalition 
government for the first time in more than four decades but the 
socialists and centrist opposition parties failed to resolve policy 
differences before the election and it is uncertain whether they 
could agree on coalition terms 
socialist secretarygeneral tsuruo yamaguchi has said the 
opposition camp will unite quickly if the parties win a majority in 
the lower house 
the liberal democrats may manage to stay in power by 
attracting conservative independents even if the party itself falls 
short of the 257 seats required for a majority 
this would increase pressure on kaifu to step down to take 
reponsibility for the electoral loss and the power struggle within 
the party would probably intensify 
if the liberal democrats win a clear majority kaifu is 
expected to form a strong government of his own unlike the present 
one which reflects the will of party elders 
the first challenge for kaifu will be to pass the budget by 
april 1 the liberal democrats are committed to change the widely 
unpopular 3 percent sales tax while the opposition parties are 
united in saying it should be abolished the tax logjam in 
parliament in the end may also force kaifu to step down 
i would not be surprised if someone other than kaifu ends up 
going to the summit meeting in houston in july said masaya ito 
a political analyst 
either way without strong and stable domestic leadership 
japan will have a troublesome time in trade negotiations with the 
united states whose demands are expected to toughen after the 
election he said

keith haring whose cartoonlike drawings 
appeared in public spaces from new york citys subways to the 
berlin wall has died of aids he was 31 
haring who had been diagnosed with the aids virus more than a 
year ago died early friday in his downtown manhattan apartment 
said an assistant margaret slabbert 
active in aids fundraising haring returned from a european 
trip a month ago and fell ill soon after 
harings work characterized by human and animal figures in an 
energized setting was admired worldwide and brought him a 
lucrative business 
some in the art world denigrated the commercialization of his 
art through tshirts posters and in advertising but haring said 
that was part of the point 
if commercialization is putting my art on a shirt so that a 
kid who cant afford a 30000 painting can buy one then im all 
for it haring said art is nothing if you dont reach every 
segment of the people 
his critical reputation never matched his popularity 
keith harings work is obviously very seductive and immensely 
attractive to a lot of people said new york times art critic 
michael brenson but there never seems to be any edge to iti 
dont care for it at all 
harings motifs a glowing baby dancing figures pyramids 
creatures with tv heads barking dogs first appeared on blank 
advertising space in new yorks subways about 10 years ago 
by 1983 artnews was calling his work provocative 
farreaching and uplifting 
others called it the visual equivalent of rap or hiphop music 
popular but not necessarily serious 
newsweeks mark stevens once called harings work fast food 
its a good time its boogeying on saturday night but great 
no 
in 1986 he painted a 300foot mural on the berlin wall of a 
chain of red and black human figures on a yellow background 
incorporating the flag colors of east and west germany 
his other murals include those at childrens hospital in 
washington dc grady hospital in atlanta necker childrens 
hospital in paris and the maternity ward of princess grace hospital 
in monte carlo 
he did a great deal of work for free including posters for the 
antiapartheid movement and anticrack murals one antidrug mural 
in east harlem overlooking the fdr drive on manhattan is seen by 
thousands of commuters each day 
in 1986 haring opened the pop shop a store in the soho section 
of manhattan that sells products bearing his art including 
tshirts refrigerator magnets and inflatable toys 
my shop is an extension of what i was doing in the subway 
stations breaking down the barriers between high and low art he 
said 
his projects included painting rock star grace jones entire 
body for a poster and collaborating on a poster of model brooke 
shields with photographer richard avedon 
haring was raised in kutztown pa and learned to draw from his 
father a supervisor at western electric his formal training 
consisted of two years as a handyman at the pittsburgh center for 
the arts and two years at new yorks school of visual arts andy 
warhol was his mentor 
mayor david dinkins said harings death deprives the art 
community and the cityatlarge of a great creative force in his 
effort to bring art to communities throughout the city and indeed 
around the world keith haring demonstrated the openness of spirit 
and commitment to creativity that defined his art 
a private cremation was planned with a memorial service to be 
scheduled at a later date

a sheriff fed up with months of 
overcrowding at the county jail commandeered a national guard 
armory and said he will temporarily house prisoners there to keep 
the peace 
richard mccarthy spokesman for the hampden county sheriffs 
department said the action taken friday by sheriff michael ashe 
was a last resort its an extreme action to deal with a more 
dangerous situation 
mccarthy said he expected the 15 minimumsecurity prisoners 
taken to the armorys drill hall would be housed there at least 
through the holiday weekend 
state secretary of public safety charles v barry said ashe was 
notified that housing prisoners in the armory was illegal he said 
ashe was subject to prosecution for criminal trespass and that he 
would pursue legal action tuesday if the prisoners were not removed 
state offices will be closed monday for presidents day 
this is no way to do business barry said if you would 
come to us to discuss the problem we would see what we could do to 
accommodate you 
in a directive sent to the brigadier commander of the 
massachusetts army national guard armory ashe said it appears 
there is an imminent danger of a breach of the peace due to 
insufficient prison space in this county 
reasonable and prudent steps must be taken in order to 
preserve the peace and quell such danger he said 
mccarthy said the move was not symbolic and that ashe believes 
the armory could become an effective temporary prison housing 
about 100 prisoners all 15 prisoners at the armory have less than 
two months to serve mccarthy said 
this action is within my inherent power to keep the peace i 
take full responsibility for this action to protect my fellow 
citizens ashe said 
fridays action followed a week of turmoil at the jail which 
had reached maximum capacity the jail was built to hold 279 
prisoners and is under federal orders to house no more than 500 
inmates 
two deputy county sheriffs were detained for most of wednesday 
by westfield district judge philip contant after they refused to 
take a prisoner back to the hampden county jail in springfield on 
ashes orders 
ashe didnt want the prisoners sent to the jail because it had 
more than 500 inmates 
contant said ashe was doing an admirable job under trying 
circumstances but insisted he would pursue contempt charges if 
prisoners were denied entry to the jail 
mccarthy said early release late sentencing and sending 
prisoners to other jails had failed to relieve congestion at the 
jail a new jail has been approved in nearby ludlow but that is 
expected to take two to three years to build 
state sen brian lees went to the armory described as the size 
of a large gymnasium and said it was unclear whether ashe had the 
authority to take over the building 
were waiting to see if this is legal and whether it falls 
under the guidelines of the constitution he said

senior leader deng xiaoping of china today met 
with the authors of hong kongs proposed constitution for chinese 
rule and called their work a masterpiece of creativity 
many hong kong residents fear the new constitution will not 
force china to keep its promises of allowing the capitalist system 
to remain for 50 years after the 1997 takeover and of letting hong 
kong exercise a high degree of autonomy 
confidence in chinas pledges dropped dramatically after the 
june 34 military crackdown on beijings prodemocracy movement 
the protests were widely supported in hong kong a british colony 
on chinas southwestern coast 
the 51member constitutional committee appointed in 1985 by the 
beijing government completed the final draft of the document this 
week the plan known as the basic law now goes to chinas 
legislature the national peoples congress for approval 
this is a historical event not just for the present but for 
the future not just for the third world but for all of mankind 
deng said such a document is a masterpiece of creativity 
deng met once before with the drafting committee in april 
1987 just after prodemocracy student protests of the winter of 
198687 
during that meeting he emphasized the need for stability and 
warned that after 1997 if people try to turn hong kong into a 
base of opposition to the mainland in the name of democracy 
we will definitely interfere 
he also said general elections and western democracy were 
not suitable for hong kong while keeping certain power for the 
central government will benefit hong kong and bring it no harm 
under the basic law plan only 20 of the 60 seats in hong kongs 
legislature in 1997 will be directly elected in hong kong that 
number will increase to 30 by 2003 
the plan includes clauses that allow china to declare a state of 
emergency and ban contacts with foreign political groups 
at todays meeting deng was accompanied by premier li peng 
communist party chief jiang zemin president yang shangkun and 
congress chairman wan li they did not speak 
ji pengfei chairman of the drafting committee said in his 
closing remarks later in the morning that the plan reflects the 
great thinking of the one country twosystems policy 
he added that the task before the drafting committee now was to 
make the basic law a part of the popular feeling in hong kong 
in hong kong on friday news of passage of the final basic law 
draft was greeted with renewed demands for rapid democratic change 
about 1500 students chanting prodemocracy slogans and carrying 
placards marched to the chinese diplomatic mission in protest 
the government has announced plans to increase the pace of 
democratic change next year

everything richardson said 
he performed the root canals outdoors thursday using a slab of 
wood as an operating table the cat was anesthetized and 
richardson assisted by eight people used forceps to remove the 
dead tissue from inside the fangs he filled the teeth with a 
cement mixture and filed them with a buffer

a study presented at a prestigious scientific 
gathering challenges the commonly held view that teenage pregnancy 
is a scourge of the poor 
the researcher arline t geronimus of the university of 
michigan said friday that pregnancy can lead to economic 
improvement for teenage girls and increase their chances of having 
a healthy baby 
the childrens defense fund a research and advocacy 
organization in washington dc disputed the finding and said it 
would continue to battle teenage pregnancy 
if a 15 or 16yearold becomes pregnant theres no way 
thats a smart thing said the organizations ray obrian early 
motherhood locks poor women into poverty and poor academic 
performance he said 
but geronimus said in an interview i think women in poverty 
know what theyre doing there are social realities in the poor 
that those of us doing research are unaware of 
among her findings presented at a meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science 
infants in povertystricken communities are healthier if their 
mothers are in their teens rather than their 20s because poor 
mothers are healthier when they are younger 
teenage mothers form alliances with the fathers families 
even if they are not married that improve the mothers economic 
positions 
teenage mothers are free to earn a living in their 20s 
because their children are old enough to be cared for by other 
family members 
the elevated death rate for children of poor black mothers 
would become even higher if the women were encouraged to delay 
childbirth 
i would like to go on record today in opposition to the view 
that teen childbearing is selfdestructive irrational or 
antisocial behavior geronimus said 
in a separate study researchers reported that teen mothers were 
no more likely to drop out of school than their childless 
classmates 
simply altering the fertility patterns will not guarantee 
social and economic wellbeing for young mothers said the 
researchers dawn upchurch of johns hopkins university in baltimore 
and james mccarthy of columbia university in new york 
geronimus bases her findings on health statistics and on 
anthropological investigations of poor rural and urban communities 
she said she has conducted extensive interviews with poor women in 
a rural area in north carolina and in boston 
she has also built on the work of anthropologist carol stack 
who found that poor teenage women who have children get help 
including financial help from the families of their childrens 
fathers 
stack also found that poor young women have been widely exposed 
to child rearing and thus arrive at motherhood with realistic 
expectations the young women also receive help caring for the 
children 
geronimus has shown that the health of poor black women 
deteriorates much more rapidly than that of middleclass women by 
the time poor women reach their 20s they may be in menial 
stressful jobs and are more likely to smoke and consume alcohol 
both of which are hazardous during pregnancy 
she thinks the same is probably true for poor white women but 
she said those studies have not been done 
geronimus found that infant mortality was not increased among 
the children of teenage mothers

us defense secretary dick cheney today said 
he plans to play down his highly publicized spat with philippine 
president corazon aquino and focus on the things that unite us 
during his critical talks next week in manila 
i would hope that any unpleasantness is minimized cheney 
said during an interview aboard the us air force jet carrying him 
to this british colony from seoul south korea 
cheneys schedule today included lunch with hong kong gov sir 
david wilson he planned to meet sunday with the us ambassador to 
the philippines nicholas platt before traveling to manila on 
monday 
cheney last week decided to shorten his philippine stay by a day 
after mrs aquino announced she would refuse to see him because of 
anger over negative us press coverage of her government and us 
payments for the use of six military bases in the philippines 
cheney is on a twoweek tour of the pacific rim to reassess 
americas military role in the region he was expected to inform 
the philippine and japanese governments that they can expect a 10 
percent to 12 percent cut in us troops based in asia over the 
next three years and that congress is unlikely to keep paying as 
much for their support as in the past 
clearly we have a major interest in the philippines and the 
region its an important stop cheney said of the manila visit 
the defense secretary pointed out that his discussions come at a 
crucial juncture in the usphilippines relationship with talks 
expected to open next month on renewal of the leases for clark air 
base subic naval base and several other military posts 
weve got major negotiations about to begin with the 
philippines on the bases he said adding that he doesnt intend 
to be in the business of negotiating a new base agreement 
during his stay 
instead he indicated hed work on improving relations 
i think the things that unite us that weve got in common 
are a good deal more significant than any momentary stress in the 
relationship cheney said adding i would expect to focus on 
and emphasize those things such as the historic ties between 
our two countries 
cheney said he deliberately tried to respond in a very lowkey 
fashion to mrs aquinos decision not to receive me i think 
the president has tried to keep all of that on an even keel as 
well 
president bush issued a rare public rebuke to mrs aquino for 
refusing to meet with his defense secretary saying in an interview 
that she can learn a great deal from dick cheney about the way we 
view the very important us presence in the pacific 
cheney said he intended to stress that despite the rumblings 
from congress for troop cuts and sharply reduced pentagon budgets 
our interests in the region will continue 
he added the message i emphasize is were not talking about 
a radical departure of us policy its a matter of readjustment 
but its also a matter of reaffirmation of longterm american 
ties to the region 
in recent weeks us officials have expressed mounting concern 
about aquinos leadership and her ability to withstand the unrest 
inside her government that has resulted in a halfdozen coup 
attempts 
mrs aquinos snub of cheney shocked many because of the support 
shed received from the bush administration in particular the 
presidents decision to authorize us f4 phantom jet fighters to 
pin down rebel planes at the height of the dec 1 coup attempt 
some analysts have viewed mrs aquinos rejection of cheney as 
an attempt to bolster support inside the philippines in the face of 
charges that bushs help made her beholden to washington 
the twoyear leases on the philippine bases expire in 1991 and 
even though pres reagan pledged in 1988 to pay more than 481 
million for their use congress has refused to cough up the full 
amount a sore point between the two governments

the environmental protection agency says 
pesticides may become trapped in homes for years and some say that 
could be cause for concern by the public 
these findings call into question some of the fundamental 
assumptions we have made about the safety of chemical pesticides 
rep james scheuer dny after release of a government indoor 
air study on friday 
scheuer is a cosponsor of legislation that would call for 
additional research into indoor air quality problems 
epa spokesmen characterized the chemical levels found in samples 
of air in homes in florida and massachusetts as uniformly low 
and not great enough to pose a health concern the report concluded 
that no risks of major concern were identified 
the study by an epa consultant examined indoor air in 259 homes 
in jacksonville fla and the springfieldchicopee area in 
massachusetts to determine the residue levels from 32 selected 
pesticides 
air monitoring devices were placed inside and outside the homes 
over a 24hour period on three occasions in 1986 though 1988 in a 
search for traces of the pesticides many of the chemicals have 
been commonly used for years in household products such as bug or 
flea sprays or for termite control and others normally are used in 
agriculture some of the chemicals have been banned by the epa for 
a number of years because they are carcinogenic 
some of the chemicals were found in the houses at levels much 
greater than outdoors sometimes at levels 50 to 90 times the 
levels detected with the outdoor monitors at the same locations 
the study said 
but the epa characterized the concentrations as very low 
levels and not surprising because many of the chemicals have been 
associated widely with household use 
we characterize the risk as low to negligible said michael 
firestone an epa chemist these are not figures that we didnt 
expect to find 
but janet hathaway a lawyer for the natural resources defense 
council who over the years has focused on pesticide issues said 
the study involves an area that has tended to be completely 
ignored by the epa 
government regulators have focused on pesticide residue levels 
on foods but have paid little attention to the risks posed by 
these chemicals in the air especially indoors she said i think 
the study is being underplayed by the epa 
ms hathaway said the findings for a number of the chemicals 
suggest cancer risks from airborne exposure possibly being greater 
than the 1 in 1 million minimum risk level the government uses 
in food residue calculations 
the study conducted by research triangle institute in north 
carolina made no specific risk assessment except to say that 
both cancer and noncancer risks were evaluatedand no risks 
of major concern were identified 
some of the highest airborne levels found inside the houses 
involved chemicals that over the years have been commonly used to 
control termites other chemicals have long been associated with 
various household products from flea sprays for pets to bathroom 
disinfectants and for a variety of garden uses

scientists from around the globe 
have had their chance to review and comment on 15000 pages of 
research from the most comprehensive study of acid rain ever 
conducted 
the challenge now participants said is to take the individual 
reports and pull them together in an integrated document to provide 
planners with a yardstick for gauging the impact of policy 
decisions 
now that we have done the detail we need to come back to a 
universal said james mahoney the director of the national acid 
precipitation program 
about 700 scientists from 35 nations on friday finished a 
weeklong meeting held to review preliminary reports compiled in a 
500 million study by mahoneys program 
the sense of development in the science has been to 
eliminate the two extreme views about acid rain effects mahoney 
said 
there was one extreme that there were no effects that were 
really important and nothing is documented the other extreme was 
that we have an absolute disaster and were burning up the forests 
and the lakes he said 
mahoney said the project is the largest study of acid rain ever 
conducted the scientists reviewed 26 draft studies compiled over 
ten years 
those documents the work of about 1000 researchers focus on 
the topics ranging from effects of acid rain on aquatic life to 
impacts on forests and building materials 
acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide and 
other pollutants that can fall to earth as rain snow sleet fog 
or dust particles 
the studies indicate the pollution can make lakes and streams 
acidic and kill aquatic life the studies also link acid rain to 
declines in certain types of trees and damage to stone buildings 
and statues 
the scientists comments will be taken into consideration as the 
unified report is written 
scientists were told there may be no quick answer to some 
questions about acid rain 
the research into forests indicated acid rain may have 
contributed to the mortality of red spruce trees in the northern 
appalachians 
but david radloff said of the us forest service said while 
its possible to gauge impacts on individual trees larger forest 
systems are too complex 
it may be impossible for a long time to prove acid rain is 
impacting forest ecosystems he said

showing support for polands struggling 
noncommunist government 17 creditor nations agreed to reschedule 
nearly a fourth of the countrys 40 billion foreign debt and 
suspend payments over the next year 
the agreement friday the most generous so far by the paris club 
group of creditor nations lets poland postpone paying principal on 
its debt for eight years said jeanclaude trichet chairman of the 
group 
it allows poland to reschedule 94 billion of its 27 billion 
debt to paris club nations including 34 billion of arrears 
that debt which was due march 1 1991 is to be spread over 14 
years all payments will now be suspended until march 1 1991 
the agreement reached after two days of negotiations reflects 
western backing for the government and its radical plans for 
adopting a market economy trichet said 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki took over in august ending 
four decades of communist rule in poland since then hardline 
communists have been ousted in east germany czechoslovakia 
bulgaria and romania 
macowiecki sent messages to creditor governments feb 9 asking 
them to suspend principal and interest payments for 1989 and 1990 
on the entire 40 billion poland owes and to consider freezing the 
debt or even reducing it 
mazowiecki said the debt was the greatest threat to polands 
dramatic attempt to switch from a centrally controlled economy to a 
freemarket system 
a deputy government spokesman henryk wozniakowski said in 
warsaw that the agreement will reduce payments to the west by about 
onefourth 
janusz sawicki head of the polish delegation said fridays 
accord was the best poland could obtain and should be viewed as a 
response to the mazowieckis appeal the polish news agency pap 
reported 
the paris club agreed with mazowieckis suggestion that 
consultations also be held on reducing the debt in cooperation with 
the international monetary fund the polish pap news agency 
reported 
two weeks ago the fund approved polands economic restructuring 
plan which involves eliminating a huge budget deficit by cutting 
subsidies to unprofitable staterun industries and attracting 
foreign investment by establishing a convertible currency 
elimination of price controls and subsidies created 78 percent 
inflation for january alone the world bank estimates ending 
industrial subsidies will cost 17 million jobs nearly 10 percent 
of polands work force this year 
polands foreign debt is the largest in eastern europe the 
partial payments it was making consumed nearly all its hard 
currency earnings leaving little to rebuild its obsolete industry 
most of the debt was accumulated during the 1970s when edward 
gierek was communist party chief he spent borrowed western money 
on illconceived projects and consumer goods in an effort to win 
public support

the boundary of their respective electoral districts in this tokyo 
suburb takujiro and makiko hamada argued how the country should 
revive trust in japans flagging political system 
i am fighting from the stance of the liberal democrats and 
will reform the liberal democratic party from within makiko hamada 
is fighting from the stance that reform must take place from 
outside the party but what we are aiming for is the same said 
takujiro hamada a threeterm lawmaker 
japan controlled for 34 years by the liberal democrats has 
been beset by a series of scandals that have shaken faith in the 
conservative party it lost its majority in parliaments upper 
house last year and voters are expected to vote out several of its 
members in elections sunday for the more powerful lower house 
mrs hamada a former flight attendant for japan airlines 
emphasized her candidacy as an independent was meant to help 
talented politicians such as her husband who were constrained by 
power politics in the governing party 
i believe from my heart that takujiro hamada is a very good 
politician a serious politician a politician who japan needs but 
is the liberal democratic party really making good the type of 
policies takujiro hamada is proposing the great forecasts the 
party is making she asked

buy influence with many of japans most influential politicians 
bureaucrats and business executives 
the 13year political veteran told the small group of supporters 
and journalists at the rally that the liberal democrats were still 
on the right track although the party needed thorough internal 
reform 
following the 30minute rally the hamadas shook hands and 
hurried off to continue campaigning in their adjoining districts

former vice president walter mondale says 
hes cautiously optimistic about the prospects for global peace in 
the light of recent political upheavals in eastern europe 
mondale told a peace forum friday that while prospects for 
world peace are as good as theyve been in his lifetime he sees 
dangers in power struggles in countries such as romania and 
bulgaria and increasing antisemitism reported in the soviet union 
i want to be optimistic but im very concerned about these 
trends said mondale 62 a minneapolis attorney im not sure 
weve won the whole thing yet 
mondale is moderator of the twoday peace prize forum at 
augsburg college the forum in its second year is intended to 
promote discussion of peace issues and features as speakers nobel 
peace prize laureates diplomats and other leaders 
the forum continues today 
also participating in the forum are former president carter 
yelena bonner a longtime human rights leader in the soviet union 
and widow of the late andrei sakharov the prominent soviet 
dissident and nobel peace prize laureate and peter duffy chairman 
of the international executive committee of amnesty international 
mondale said the bush administration should be responding more 
enthusiastically to the changes in eastern europe 
the day soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev announced a 
multiparty system our president was running around asking for more 
money for the military mondale said i think people were 
wondering what our president was doing heres a tremendous 
development and i wish we could get more enthusiastically and 
energetically involved we seem to be more like bookkeepers now 
checking the books 
mondale suggested that president bush offer eastern europes 
fledgling democracies money and knowhow especially about setting 
up democratic institutions he said the money could become 
available if military funding were cut to match the shrinking 
threat to national security 
bonner opened the forum by saying that gorbachev is a 
powerhungry politician who has an overblown reputation as a 
reformer 
gorbachev has shown himself as a very strong leader in the 
struggle for his own power and his own survival bonner said 
is he only interested in personal power or is he interested in 
the rights of the people 
gorbachevs actions have been widely misinterpreted by western 
countries bonner said she said that revolts for democratic change 
in the soviet bloc have been brewing for a long time and gorbachev 
deserves credit only for not stamping them out 
he behaves that way not because he wants them to proclaim 
their independence from the communist party but because he could 
not stop it bonner said he had no way of influencing events 
in eastern europe 
the forum is sponsored by five midwestern colleges of the 
evangelical lutheran church in america it is held in cooperation 
with the oslobased norwegian nobel institute which awards the 
nobel peace prize

the citys first black school superintendent 
has filed a 10 million lawsuit against the whitemajority school 
board which sparked racial turmoil when it voted not to renew his 
contract 
meanwhile almost 200 students mostly whites have decided to 
withdraw from the selma school system which reopened this week 
following a student sitin to protest the decision not to extend 
norward roussells contract beyond june when it expires 
roussells lawsuit filed friday in us district court in 
mobile claims his contract was not renewed for racial reasons and 
that the boards decision was based in part on his complete 
dismantling of a student placement system known as leveling 
critics of the system say it was designed to segregate students 
and keep blacks in lowerlevel classes 
according to the suit roussells decision to end leveling 
served as the catalyst for removing him because for the first 
time in the systems history black students were given a fair 
opportunity to compete in advanced academic classes 
about 15 blacks demonstrated at selma city hall on friday to 
protest city education policies chanting do the right thing 
and other slogans intended for white mayor joe smitherman 
the protesters have been holding rallies and sitins at the 
building to press their demands that roussell be rehired for 
another three years that changes be made in student placement 
policies and that the city go to an elected rather than 
appointed school board 
the 11member school board which has six white members voted 
along racial lines in december not to renew roussells threeyear 
contract 
roussell said nearly 12 percent of the white students in selmas 
6000student public school system have withdrawn since the schools 
reopened on tuesday under heavy security 
im sure theyve left because of the tense situation were 
facing roussell said but i think that when we get out of this 
situation and resolve our problems people will begin to come 
back 
since tuesday 199 students have left the system 180 of them 
white roussell said that leaves about 1500 whites in a system 
that is 70 percent black 
smitherman who was in office during the racial turmoil of the 
1960s said the withdrawal figures were very saddening he said 
continued withdrawals could turn into chaotic situations in 
surrounding counties

the communist party chief in samarkand today 
denied a report by staterun radio moscow that rioting in soviet 
central asia had spread to his ancient city in uzbekistan 
the broadcast said members of the moslem majority fought ethnic 
armenians 
the report aired on radio moscows international 
englishlanguage service late friday followed a week of unrest in 
the neighboring soviet republic of tadzhikistan where 20 people 
were killed and 568 wounded by interior ministry count 
nasyr yakubov the first party secretary of samarkand told the 
associated press by telephone his city was quiet there were no 
riots and no curfew was imposed 
he said the citys 12000 armenian residents live in peace with 
members of other ethnic groups 
asatyulo yusupov a duty officer at the interior ministry office 
in samarkand also denied the radio report 
radio moscow reported friday that the interior ministry sent 
troop reinforcements to samarkand and ordered residents to remain 
in their homes after dark despite those measures the radio said 
rallies and demonstrations continued 
it cited the interfax news service a joint venture affiliated 
with radio moscow as the source of its information 
no other state soviet news outlet carried the report which did 
not mention casualties or damage in samarkand a city of colorfully 
tiled buildings domed mosques and oriental bazaars 
the ancient city is about 1700 miles southeast of moscow and 
has a population of 390000 mostly moslems the armenian refugees 
are mainly christians 
asked about yakubovs and yusopovs denials an editor at radio 
moscows central newsroom in the soviet capital acknowledged today 
the radio had not been able to independently confirm the details of 
the interfax report 
the report was sent via facsimile to subscribing western news 
organizations in moscow interfax created last year has been a 
usually reliable source on developments in the soviet union and 
even broke the news of what would be in mikhail s gorbachevs 
speech on political reforms to the communist party leadership 
earlier this month 
tass the official news agency reported friday that inflamatory 
leaflets were being circulated in areas of uzbekistan bordering 
tadzhikistan they demanded the immediate eviction of russians 
from central asia and denounced the alleged resettlement in 
uzbekistan of refugees presumably armenians who fled azerbaijan 
tass said 
tass said a man identified as kh saidov was arrested in 
samarkand for carrying 30 antiarmenian leaflets and the siab 
district court fined another man i guseinov 500 rubles 830 
for advocating the eviction of armenians and using force against 
them 
tadzhikistan 1600 miles southeast of moscow was the latest in 
a string of republics torn by ethnic strife since mikhail s 
gorbachev came to power five years ago and relaxed central 
controls he has repeatedly warned that the turmoil threatens his 
reform program 
the strife in tadzhik capital dushanbe was touched off feb 10 
by rumors that armenian refugees were arriving by the thousands and 
receiving scarce apartments 
interfax said authorities brought dushanbe under control friday 
halting a week of bloodshed izvestia the government daily said 
the central part of dushanbe a city of 600000 people was being 
guarded by special soviet army commando units 
tadzhikistans top three officials including communist party 
chief kakhar m makhkamov offered to step down wednesday because 
of the rioting but the resignations were rejected friday at an 
emergency session of the policymaking central committee of the 
republics communist party 
the committee decided that while there is such a difficult 
situation in the republic its leaders do not have the right to 
resign mansur sultanov of the gostelradio state broadcasting 
authority said from dushanbe 
sultanov said he had not heard the rumors of an impending 
massacre cited by interfax but he said an unauthorized 
demonstration was scheduled today at previous demonstrations held 
in defiance of government orders tadzhiks demanded the ouster of 
their party and government leaders 
ethnic russians who make up 10 percent of tadzhikistans 
population of 5 million are worried about the unrest but so far 
are not leaving sultanov said 
the scarcity of housing in uzbekistan which like tadzhikistan 
has one of the soviet unions highest birth rates seemed to be 
fueling nationalist sentiments there 
the presidium of the tadzhikistan supreme soviet formed a 
special commission to investigate how people died in the week of 
violence said boris k pugo a nonvoting member of the ruling 
politburo visiting dushanbe

when detectives arrested a man for the 1946 
killing of a miami police officer they said he was expecting them 
that he knew it was only a matter of time before they would arrive 
but the arrest of 61yearold leroy strachan on thursday in 
lower manhattan left the arresting officers from miami with mixed 
emotions proud at solving an old case but bothered that the 
suspect apparently led a life untarnished by crime in new york 
in the years since the slaying strachan got married had three 
children one of them is a state corrections officer and worked 
for 21 years as a freight elevator operator 
miami detective george cadavid said the arrest was a great ego 
booster no doubt not only was a human life taken but another 
police officers life was taken but heres a person who is now 61 
years old and was 17 years old when the incident happened and as 
far as we can tell hes never been arrested 
strachan was arrested thanks to an anonymous tip eight months 
ago from a consciencestricken witness authorities said 
police said strachan admitted to miami detectives in late 
january that he had shot the officer the victim officer john 
milledge was one of miamis first black police officers 
he told detectives he had been waiting to be arrested since they 
had talked to him in late january the detectives said 
he knew us cadavid said he said are you going to 
arrest me and asked to call his attorney in miami 
he has admitted shooting the policeman and there is other 
evidence cadavid said strachan did not express any remorse over 
the shooting the detective said 
the suspect had several thousand dollars on him at the time of 
his arrest leading police to think that he was about to leave the 
city 
strachan still wearing his dark brown work uniform looked 
nervous as he refused to waive extradition during a brief 
arraignment at manhattan criminal court on friday 
strachans lawyer alan mass told judge bruce allen the fact 
that florida allowed capital punishment played a part in strachans 
decision 
no way if its within our power that mr strachan is going 
back to florida mass told reporters outside court 
the judge ordered strachan held without bail pending a march 14 
hearing 
milledge was fatally shot nov 1 1946 while on patrol outside 
a football game in the overtown section of miami after he had 
chased and beaten several teens who tried to sneak into the game 
cadavid said 
the milledge case was reopened by the departments cold case 
squad after an anonymous july 1989 tip to crime stoppers from a 
woman who had seen a youth with a 22caliber rifle running from 
the shooting scene 
the reason she never came forward was because her husband was 
very good friends with the shooter cadavid said the womans 
husband died a few years ago and her conscience was bothering 
her he said 
cadavid called a new york city detective who ran a check and 
located strachan 
in late january the miami detectives talked with strachan in 
new york 
he told us what had happened we went back to miami to do some 
more investigation to corroborate some of his story we found 
witnesses we found one witness that he had confessed to that same 
night cadavid said 
strachan said that the night of the slaying milledge had hit 
several youths 
according to police strachan said he got a rifle from a friend 
told everyone to step aside fired one shot at milledge then ran 
the next day he left for new york

thirteen brands of fruit juice made 
at a local plant and shipped throughout much of canada were being 
recalled after a chemical that causes cancer in laboratory animals 
was found in samples 
sundor canada inc which is owned by cincinnatibased procter amp 
gamble co announced friday it is recalling all its 48ounce cans 
of juice made from concentrate the juice is shipped primarily to 
manitoba ontario quebec and atlantic canada 
health and welfare canada said the contaminated juices do not 
present a major health threat but the company had been asked to 
recall the products as a precaution 
the company said juice not made from concentrate is not being 
recalled because it is processed without adding local water the 
water has been found to be contaminated with the chemical nnitroso 
dimethylamine or dmna 
also excluded from the recall are products in glass or plastic 
bottles and drinking boxes 
the following brands are affected martins brights a and p 
dominion iga food city cavalier timothys calbeckss pantry 
shelf red label sunshine and libbys pineapple juice 
tests taken from october to december found dmna at levels 
reaching five parts per billion the governments guideline for 
dmna in drinking water is 0014 parts per billion 
dmna is a waste byproduct in the manufacture of some 
agricultural and rubber products it has been found in emissions 
from a uniroyal chemical plant in nearby elmira 
the province ordered the chemical plant shut down earlier this 
month after the dmna turned up in nearby wells 
sundor canada inc formerly known as martins foods company is 
owned by the procter amp gamble co 
in a statement released friday night the company said it is 
difficult to predict what level of dmna would be potentially 
harmful given the varying amounts of juice that people drink 
however sundor believes it is a prudent course of action to 
recall all these products until it has a better analysis of the 
risk involved 
barry pipes a company spokesman said the recall involves 
thousands of cases of juice each case contains 12 48ounce 
cans the company did not specify what types of juice were affected 
pipes said the tests were performed because the company was 
concerned about local water quality 
earlier this week about 160 million bottles of perrier in 120 
countries were being removed from shelves after the cancercausing 
chemical benzene was found in some of the water 
perrier officials said some shipments of the bottled water were 
contaminated by a dirty filter at the companys underground spring 
in vergeze france the filter is designed to remove naturally 
occurring benzene from the carbon dioxide gas that gives perrier 
its distinctive bubble

four members of former president 
sukarnos palace guard have been executed after serving nearly a 
quarter century on death row for their involvement in a failed 
coup a government spokesman said today 
in washington the human rights group asia watch today asked 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to condemn 
the executions by firing squad which it called an act of 
cowardice 
brig gen nurhadi purwosaputro an armed forces spokesman 
confirmed that solaeman noor tohayana satar suryanto and yohannes 
surono had been put to death tuesday 
all were arrested shortly after the abortive communist coup on 
sept 30 1965 they were charged with kidnapping and killing gen 
achmad yani the army commander they were convicted by a military 
tribunal 
officials gave no reason why the four remained on death row for 
24 years but delays in carrying out earlier executions were said 
to have been made to allow time for the accused to divulge 
information about their activities 
the government executed nine former members of the banned 
indonesian communist party in september 1986 the party was accused 
of planning the coup 
in addition to yani five other army generals were killed in the 
coup bid which was crushed within 48 hours by troops led by then 
maj gen suharto he is now president 
in the bloodbath that followed the coup an estimated 450000 to 
500000 people were killed by anticommunist forces 
more than 500000 also were detained following the uprising 
among them some of the nations bestknown writers poets 
educators journalists and intellectuals 
sukarno relinquished power to suharto when calm was restored in 
march 1966 
asia watch sent messages to bush gorbachev and other heads of 
state declaring that to spend a quarter century waiting to be 
killed is cruel and inhuman punishment by any standard 
it also said the four guardsmen were sentenced by military 
courts after trials lacking any semblance of fairness

hazardous wastes have contaminated chinese food 
water and air far beyond international safety standards causing 
significant damage to the health of millions of people an 
international conference said today 
the conference organized by the chinese government and the un 
development program also warned that water resources are fast 
being depleted 
during the first three decade of communist rule pollution was 
considered a problem confined to capitalist countries in recent 
years china has passed an environmental protection law and laws on 
controlling water and air pollution but it has lacked the money 
and personnel to reverse the steady deterioration of the 
environment 
the 44 chinese and 14 foreign experts at the fiveday conference 
ending today called for urgent action to strengthen regulations 
and penalties improve factory efficiency and take steps to better 
manage the environment 
deng nan directorgeneral of the social development department 
and daughter of senior leader deng xiaoping said significant 
damage is now occurring to the health of both urban and rural 
residents mainly due to economic constraints and rapid economic 
development 
she said industrial wastes are destroying water resources and 
that the burning last year of 1 billion tons of coal about a ton 
per person has exacerbated respiratory diseases 
the workshop said many factories particularly small rural 
enterprises lack any pollution control equipment and emit wastes 
and air pollutants directly into the environment 
poorly maintained equipment causes leaks there is often little 
incentive to run factories efficiently and managers lack 
information about how to protect the environment it said 
ms deng said china must charge more for water and coal to 
encourage recycling and efficient use invest in sewers and sewage 
treatment plants and improve the quality of its coal so its 
combustion produces less ash smoke and sulphur dioxide 
the workshop also recommended that china put more effort into 
industrial planning training of environmental experts water 
conservation and enforcement of water pollution policies 
qu geping head of the national environmental protection agency 
said china now spends about 2 billion a year on the environment 
that amount is 07 percent of its gross national product 
he said his agency hopes to increase that amount to 1 percent of 
the gross national product by 1992 which would be one of the 
highest rates in the developing world but he acknowledged that 
just to control todays level of pollution it shouldnt be lower 
than 15 percent of gnp 
the gross national product is a measures of the total worth of 
goods and services produced 
qu said a study made five years ago estimated pollution causes 
128 billion in damage to the economy and the health of the nation 
every year

a daycare center owner accused of 
possessing child pornography tested negative for a veneral disease 
found in three children who attended his preschool the police said 
the attorney for john w shaver who currently is free on 
75000 bond said test results released fiday indicate that either 
the children were infected by someone else or test results from the 
children were incorrect 
i think the state should go back to the drawing board if they 
have three children who are testing positive for gonorrhea because 
to me it means that there may be someone else out there they 
should be looking for said lawyer j david bogenschutz 
police spokesman ott cefkin said police are confident the test 
results are accurate 
the health department told us they were absolutely positive in 
their findings cefkin said 
shaver 56 faces charges of possessing child pornography and 
using pictures of children to create pornographic images on 
tuesday police added 24 counts of procuring the sexual performance 
of a child 
a venereal test given to shaver as part of the conditions for 
his release from jail showed he did not have the sexually 
transmitted disease police said 
shaver was tested after health officials discovered gonorrhea in 
throat cultures of three children who attended shavers rainbow 
learning center 
the new charges involve allegedly pornographic photo montages 
found in shavers home that combine pictures of children with nude 
pictures from magazines 
bogenschutz has entered an innocent plea on behalf of his client 
about 200 children have attended shavers preschool since its 
opening in 1985 county officials closed it down this month as the 
police investigation widened

vice governor and 137 for 21 assembly seats in four 
moslemdominated provinces in the south according to commission on 
election records

sulu voted to join the regional government in a referendum 
covering 13 southern provinces and cities in november

occurred an hour before polling stations opened today at 7 am in 
the town of jolo 600 miles south of manila said maj hermogenes 
esperon a spokesman for the militarys southern command an

imelda marcos new attorney trying to repair 
the image of the former philippine first lady asks that people 
compare her to nancy reagan 
suppose mrs reagan were abducted from her home in california 
and taken to the philippines and charged in the philippines with 
crimes she allegedly committed in the us the attorney gerry 
spence said friday how do you think mrs reagan would feel 
spence made his remarks after a federal court hearing on the 
racketeering indictment that charged mrs marcos and her late 
husband ferdinand marcos with embezzling more than 100 million 
from the philippine treasury to buy art and manhattan real estate

the opportunity to view this case from the perspective of a woman 
instead of a queen because women have rights whether theyre a 
queen or not

people emerged from their bunkers today 
and showered rice on troops loyal to gen michel aoun as the 
soldiers rumbled through two devastated neighborhoods captured from 
a rival christian militia 
long live the army long live aoun weary residents shouted 
from balconies strung with lebanese flags 
we lived 17 days underground its so good to breathe fresh 
air again a woman shouted as she and others sunned themselves on 
a pockmarked balcony overlooking a burned armored personnel carrier 
for many however there was little to celebrate after 18 days 
of fighting for mastery of lebanons 310squaremile christian 
enclave the battle has killed 615 people and wounded 1829 
my poor children what has happened to your father a mother 
sobbed in ein rummaneh as she hugged her two kids her husband was 
a militiaman for samir geageas lebanese forces pushed out of the 
residential district on friday after a savage twoday attack 
aouns command in a communique said the lebanese forces 
mounted an attack at dawn today against the helicopter base at adma 
in the christian heartland of kesrouan province 
the short communique broadcast by aouns radio lebanon said 
the 500 commandos in charge of defending the base were 
confronting the gunmen it did not elaborate 
the base is the only military facility that remains loyal to 
aoun in kesrouan province the power base for geageas militia 
aouns radio said the attack started behind a fierce artillery 
and rocket barrage it did not disclose further details 
military sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 12 of 
lebanons 18 frenchmade helicopter gunships are at the adma base 
todays attack came a few hours after 900 soldiers from aouns 
19000member army advancing behind 36 usmade m48 tanks 
dislodged geageas militia from ein rummaneh on beiruts 
southeastern edge in a savage twoday attack that wrecked the 
residential district 
at least 75 people were killed and 54 wounded in the assault on 
ein rummaneh police said 
a carpet of glass shards and debris covered the narrow alleys of 
ein rummaneh smoke continued to billow today from hundreds of 
gutted apartment buildings 
pieces of furniture blown out of shelled apartments were 
scattered in the streets water from blasted rooftop tanks drained 
into underground shelters 
the people of lebanon are subjected to the ugliest wave of 
annihilation in their history at the hands of gen aoun 
silence is a crime all available means must be used to save 
lebanon geagea said in his appeal which was repeatedly 
broadcast by the christian voice of lebanon radio 
his reference to the legitimate authority was a call on 
syrianbacked president elias hrawi to intervene to dislodge the 
rebellious general from his command headquarters at the 
shellwrecked presidential palace which he has refused to 
relinquish 
geageas mention of available means appeared to be a signal 
that the chieftain of the 6000member christian militia would not 
object to an intervention by the 40000 syrian troops deployed in 
lebanon under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate 
the leftist beirut newspaper assafir which is close to hrawi 
reported movements by hrawis troops and syrian soldiers in 
moslem west beirut and the southeastern mountains overlooking the 
christian enclave overnight there were no details 
hrawi a maronite catholic like aoun and geagea was elected 
nov 24 under a peace plan brokered by the arab league the plan 
was designed to end the countrys nearly 15yearold civil war and 
provide more power to the nations moslems 
aoun who was serving as head of an interim cabinet rejected 
the peace pact and the government of hrawi aoun who refused 
hrawis order to quit as army commander has criticized the peace 
plan for not laying out a timetable for a complete withdrawal of 
syrian forces 
geagea has recognized hrawi but he has been vague on the peace 
agreement

a topranking adviser to soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev said today there wont be any unification 
if the west insists on nato membership for the combined german 
states 
the issues of nato membership and the german military stance 
have become increasingly important as plans for german unity 
advance 
if the western alliance sticks with its demand for a nato 
membership of all of germany then there wont be any german 
unification said valentin falin in an interview with saarland 
state radio 
falin in addition to serving as a gorbachev adviser is the 
head of the international section of the soviet communist partys 
central committee he is a former soviet ambassador to west germany 
falin called on western nations to use the opportunity of german 
unity to ensure peace in europe we are talking about doing away 
with the military factor in europe overall he said 
west german officials pushing ahead with plans for german 
unification have proposed a 16state united germany with nato 
membership but left open the possibility that soviet troops might 
remain in the eastern sector 
defense obligations are indivisible and cannot be weakened for 
a whole germany defense minister gerhard stoltenberg of west 
germany said friday adding that military integration will be an 
initial step 
stoltenberg said defense officials of east and west germany will 
meet after the east german elections march 18 to work out a joint 
security policy and that the continued presence of soviet troops in 
what is now east germany was open to discussion 
he raised the possibility of a transitional phase in which 
the west german and east german armies would cooperate while 
retaining their own command structures but also said we are not 
going to have two different armed forces in a united germany for 
long 
the soviet union has been insisting that a united germany be 
neutral while western allies want it to remain in nato 
the push for quick unification is worrying some countries that 
suffered occupation by nazi germany such as poland 
poland has asked to be included in talks on german unification 
between the two german states and the four world war ii allies 
the united states the soviet union britain and france 
on friday east german premier hans modrow endorsed the polish 
request during a visit to warsaw 
west germanys foreign minister hansdietrich genscher who has 
rejected the polish request said friday that immediately after 
east german elections next month the two governments must declare 
that they will have no territorial claims against their european 
neighbors after reunification 
this applies especially for poland genscher said he said 
german unity will enhance european stability 
an international holocaust awareness organization said victims 
of the last united germany which produced hitler and the nazis 
have great fears of the rush toward reunification 
letters to kohl and modrow from the simon wiesenthal center in 
los angeles said the fears stem in part from the fact that the 
germans have not consulted thos victims about reunificiation 
not a single word is said publicly about the great internal 
questions of how to educate millions of people who have lived under 
an oppressive regime and have been cut off from the real world for 
more than 40 years and how to prevent their ignorance of the past 
from negatively affecting the course of the future said rabbi 
marvin hier in a letter dated feb 9 and released friday 
hier proposed education programs oversight committees strong 
ties to israel and establishment of holocaust memorials and jewish 
cultural exchange programs

the vaticans delegate to the catholic 
church in mexico will also become the popes envoy to the mexican 
president the vatican said today prompting speculation that 
formal diplomatic relations will be restored 
overwhelmingly catholic mexico has had no formal ties with the 
vatican since 1926 when mexico expelled the papal envoy during a 
crackdown on catholic dissidents 
a significant step read the title of a vatican 
announcement the vatican said pope john paul ii and mexican 
president carlos salinas de gortari established permanent envoys to 
allow a permanent dialogue about common interest and for 
contributing to a useful cooperation 
the pope plans to make his second visit to mexico in may 
on wednesday mexicos interior secretary announced that the 
president would soon appoint a personal representative 
the announcement caused outcries by opposition groups which 
accused the government of violating mexicos constitutional 
separation of church and state 
the issue is a sensitive one in mexico where the church was 
historically linked with landowners and other power groups which 
resisted social change mexican law prohibits clergy from teaching 
in universities and schools and even bans priests from voting or 
wearing their collar in public

the soldiers who helped overthrow the 
ceausescu regime won another victory today when the provisional 
government appointed a new defense minister of their choosing to 
replace the one they forced out 
victor anastase stanculescu a lieutenant general who was the 
economic minister was named to replace defense minister nicolae 
militaru 
the appointment climaxed a weeklong protest by junior and 
middlelevel officers who demanded the dismissal of 74yearold 
militaru because they said he had not carried out the democratic 
reforms called for in the december revolution that toppled 
hardline communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
on thursday night staterun television broadcast a frank but 
edited tape of talks between deputy prime minister gelu voican 
voiculescu and 58 officers from 38 units who presented a list of 13 
demands including militarus ouster

wanted as defense chief and they said stanculescu 
at stanculescus installation ceremony today interim president 
ion iliescu said the new minister has prestige in the army and is 
appreciated by its command militaru iliescu said did not 
succeed in establishing a real communication with the armys 
command aggravating the situation in the army to a point at which 
it became a source of tension for all of society 
iliescu said romania still faces a grave situation of the 
political social and economic spheres 
he did not say who would head the economic ministry 
the appointment of a new defense minister defused the first 
challenge by the military to the government it helped create in 
decembers revolution 
at its first meeting friday the 21member executive bureau of 
the ruling council of national unity endorsed the creation of a 
commission to investigate all the officers demands and expressed 
hope that the measures taken by the government would calm the 
situation in the country iliescu heads the bureau 
thousands of civilians had flocked to victory square in 
bucharest to support the officers whose decision to back the 
popular uprising in december was crucial to winning the revolution 
similar demonstrations were held in timisoara and the port of 
constanta 
the newspaper tineretul liber reported today that a big 
demonstration backing the officers was also held in brasov 
romanias secondlargest city on friday protesters shouted the 
army is with us and we are with the army the newspaper adevarul 
said today that before iliescus announcement the national news 
agency rompres had received a statement from a committee of the 
military central command backing the officers call for militarus 
resignation

president bush in a new clash with 
congress over china policy says hell ignore parts of a spending 
package that he considers an infringement on his right to conduct 
diplomacy 
a white house official said today that the action was not an 
attempt to assert presidential lineitem veto powers 
its not a lineitem veto as president hes going to fulfill 
the role laid out by the constitution he is saying he will not 
recognize parts of the legislation that he thinks are 
unconstitutional said stephen hart deputy press secretary 
bush late friday signed a 98 billion state department bill 
that reinforces sanctions on china and requires that congress be 
notified when such secret missions as national security adviser 
brent scowcrofts visit last june to beijing are undertaken 
the president at his oceanside home for a threeday weekend 
signed the bill but voiced serious objections to those sections and 
several others which he said raised constitutional difficulties 
the constitution gives the president exclusive power to 
receive and appoint ambassadors and to conduct negotiations on 
behalf of the united states with foreign governments bush told 
congress 
the overall legislation authorizes 48 billion for the state 
department and related agencies for the fiscal year that began last 
oct 1 and another 5 billion for fiscal 1991 
bush vetoed an earlier version of the legislation not only 
because of the china sanctions but also due to an amendment that 
would have prohibited the administration from seeking thirdcountry 
financing of insurgent groups such as the nicaraguan contras 
congress dropped that proposal from the current legislation 
us support of the contras was phased out under a bipartisan 
accord with congress 
the bill writes into law sanctions identical to those bush 
imposed on china after last mays bloody crackdown in tiananmen 
square including a ban on military sales to china and restrictions 
on trade and loans 
bush declared legislatively mandated sanctions represent an 
unwise constraint upon the presidents ability to conduct foreign 
policy 
however bush signed the bill with the assertion he would not 
follow sections he considered unconstitutional 
some senior white house officials have claimed that the 
constitution grants the president the power to veto individual 
parts of legislation the socalled lineitem veto many 
constitutional scholars dispute that contention 
refusal to follow certain sections of the state department bill 
would be tantamount to a lineitem veto 
the washington post in todays editions quoted an 
administration official as saying the administration is considering 
a lawsuit over the bill to test the issue an administration 
official told the associated press todaythis was not the intent and 
there was no way the administration would initiate such a 
lawsuit 
in congress rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the house 
judiciary constitutional rights subcommittee has said he would sue 
bush if he sought to cast a lineitem veto 
bush noted the legislation allows him to waive sanctions on 
grounds of national interest and suggested this clause put 
enough flexibility into the measure to allow it to escape a veto 
the sanctions remain in effect for now and bush has no immediate 
plans to lift them said deputy press secretary stephen hart 
bush flatly said he would disobey the section of the legislation 
that would require the state department to give congress a full 
report on any politically sensitive secret diplomatic contacts 
the restriction was an outgrowth of the clandestine trip to 
beijing last june shortly after the tiananmen square crackdown by 
scowcroft and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger that 
trip coming soon after bush banned highlevel exchanges between 
us and chinese officials was roundly criticized on capitol hill 
such blanket reporting requirements could be read to compel 
the disclosure of sensitive ongoing negotiations bush said 
bushs statement is the latest dispute with congress over china 
policy 
earlier this year the senate narrowly sustained bushs veto of 
legislation that would have extended visas of chinese students 
studying in the united states bush asserted he was affording the 
same protection to the chinese students by executive order 
the measure he signed also would provide 16 million in startup 
funds for tv marti which will broadcast from the united states 
into cuba and be a sister station to the radio marti that has 
operated for several years 
bush and his wife barbara flew to the snowcovered coastal 
community of kennebunkport on friday for the threeday presidents 
day weekend 
the bushes planned to see how remodeling work is progressing on 
the family home overlooking the atlantic the bushes are having 
rooms remodelled as a gift to each other on their 45th wedding 
anniversary last month 
only two rooms now can be heated in the winter a bedroom and a 
kitchen 
hart said the bushes planned to spend the weekend privately 
relaxing with no planned activities and no guests before 
returning to washington on monday

vaclav havel czechoslovakias 
unconventional president goes to washington this week to tell the 
bush administration that swift policy changes are needed if america 
is to retain its standing among the people of eastern europe 
although many east europeans resent the way the west abandoned 
them to stalin more than 40 years ago the united states is widely 
admired as a beacon of freedom 
in an interview at his lunchtime haunt the vikarka restaurant 
inside the sprawling presidential castle havel indicated that 
washington will have to work hard to keep that standing now that 
europe is changing 
the united states were traditionally seen here as a guarantor 
of democracy and america may be more popular here than in other 
countries and rightly so havel told the associated press last 
week 
but that doesnt mean that in a radically changing situation 
the process of disintegration of the soviet bloc the united 
states will not be called upon to pursue a different policy than to 
date 
it is a phenomenon which has to be reflected upon and 
projected into the future policy havel said leaning over the 
table it is my impression that if the united states does this 
courageously and quickly it will be only for its own good 
havel is reluctant to give specifics particularly before he 
outlines his ideas for president bush during a hectic threeday 
visit that begins monday he will also address congress and meet 
new york cultural figures 
since taking office dec 29 havel has acted decisively to give 
new style and substance to czechoslovak policy 
diplomatic relations have been established with israel and south 
korea prague has translated the latitude won by the overthrow of 
stalinism into a new independence toward moscow insisting the 
soviets start pulling their hated troops out of czechoslovakia 
havel was only four days in office when he visited both germanys 
and gave guarded approval to reunification then traveled to poland 
to propose that prague warsaw and budapest pool economic 
political and other efforts to reenter europe 
in style havel has set standards all his own donning a suit if 
necessary for ceremonial occasions he otherwise favors the dark 
sweaters and corduroy trousers he wore as a dissident playwright 
several of his advisers rock singer ladislav kantor now chief 
of protocol personal secretary vladimir hanzal castle artist 
joska skalnik have the long hair and beards that complete the 
1960s air of this new government 
the 53yearold president has meditated with the dalai lama 
chatted with american rock star frank zappa zappa wore the suit 
and admitted to traveling castle corridors on a childs scooter 
outsiders may puzzle at such presidential behavior but czechs 
who have an ingrained appreciation of the absurd seem to find it 
refreshing and to feel that they have found a real leader 
posters and lapel pins of havel are all over prague when he 
leaves the restaurant schoolchildren gather to applaud and shout 
long live havel 
love desire for understanding strength of spirit and idea 
can radiate forever from our country if we want this to happen 
he told his compatriots in a new years day address suggesting 
they make this our very own contribution to world politics 
let us teach both ourselves and others that politics does not 
have to be the art of the possible especially if what is meant by 
this is the art of speculating calculating and pragmatic 
maneuvering but that it also can be the art of the impossible 
that is the art of making both ourselves and the world better 
havel urged 
discussing the new style of his government havel bristled at 
the suggestion his administration smacks of american hippies of the 
1960s 
he clearly sees a chance to marry some of the ideas of the 1960s 
with the sophistication of the 1980s and what czechoslovaks learned 
from the repression that followed the crushing of liberal reforms 
in 1968 
john lennon zappa and other heroes of the 1960s became symbols 
of freedom for czechoslovak youth through the harsh 1970s and 1980s 
the phenomenon known as the 60s was indeed a sort of 
inspiration for czechoslovakias peaceful revolution last year 
havel said 
but 20 years has elapsed since then the world is different 
he added hippies students vietnam draft dodgers and others 
were predominantly movements of protest antiestablishment 
movements which developed into destructive movements destroying 
the ossified old structures but unable to offer something new 
something better 
the inevitable outcome was that the hippies cut their hair 
put on their suits and became lawabiding americans havel said 
in our case especially the younger generation which is 
partly inspired by the nonconformism of the 60s faces a duty to do 
it better to provide a concrete program to enter politics 
feeling that society was calling him to inspire such efforts 
havel agreed during the revolution to become president 
he still insists i would much rather be a writer than a 
president but he is visibly enjoying the job and there is a 
widespread feeling in prague that this unique president is going to 
be in the castle beyond junes free election breathing fresh 
spirit into world and domestic politics for some time to come

there are just 15 houses in the spot on the map 
known as pigsville but residents say that when the doomed 
enclave is destroyed next year in a bridgerebuilding project it 
will be the end of a closeknit way of life 
the fate of one of milwaukees oldest and most stable 
bluecollar neighborhoods has been sealed by the very bridge that 
has given it an identity the last 80 years 
pigsville on the bank of the menomonee river west of downtown 
will be destroyed in 1991 when the mammoth wisconsin avenue bridge 
whose approach forms one of its borders is rebuilt under a 153 
million project 
theres a lot of irony in it its a unique special 
neighborhood that now will be gone resigned to the history 
books said alderman michael murphy whose district includes 
pigsville 
the 40 or so residents who have lived in the neighborhood many 
for decades will be relocated starting in august 
theyll be leaving behind the asphalttile roofs limestone 
basements and creaky stairwells of their centuryold homes theyll 
also leave behind the smell of hops from the huge miller brewing 
co brewery across the river the sounds of crowds cheering at 
milwaukee brewers games at county stadium a quartermile away and 
the platerattling vibrations of soo line trains that pass on the 
western edge of the neighborhood 
but most of all the residents will miss the camaraderie that 
goes back decades and the privacy of an isolated neighborhood where 
crime is rare and friends can venture outside in their bathrobes 
for an earlymorning chat 
our biggest fear going somewhere else is neighborhoods dont 
get his close said kim papp whose family has lived in pigsville 
since 1922 its a great place to live were all going to miss 
it 
mrs papp 30 her husband william a plumber and two 
daughters live next door to the twostory house where her husbands 
father grandmother and grandmothers sisterinlaw still live 
our daughters are the fifth generation to live down here 
she said theres a lot of history bills greatgrandfather 
helped build the wisconsin avenue viaduct 
that viaduct the main bridge for the main drag leading toward 
downtown was completed in 1911 boasting concrete arches that 
resemble a roman aqueduct the bridge is the main symbol for 
pigsville but it is suffering from longterm deterioration and 
must be replaced and the replacement project will mean the 
leveling of the clutch of houses at its base 
the river the railroad tracks and the approach to a smaller 
bridge to the south form the other boundaries of pigsville theres 
only one road leading in 
unless you know where youre going its hard to find said 
resident sue wiederstein theres only one way in and one way 
out its like a little city suburb theres no sidewalks we dont 
have driveways or garages we dont have problems 
how the area got its name which dates back to before the turn 
of the century is a mystery one story attributes the moniker to a 
man who kept pigs while another holds that the area was named 
after a dentist named dr pigg yet another says it was named for 
iron castings known as pigs poured from a smelting furnace at a 
nearby foundry 
while residents throughout the menomonee river valley often 
stake claim as members of pigsville most agree the 15home 
neighborhood of bungalows and cottages at the base of the viaduct 
is the original pigsville early residents were german immigrants 
later supplanted by slavs 
pigsville has had its share of excitement occasionally the 
menomonee is known to rise above its banks with spring rains 
sending water through the streets 
roughly once every 10 years one of the passing soo line trains 
has derailed sounding a boneshaking clamor at least three times 
despondent people jumped to their deaths from one of the bridges 
above 
but perhaps the single biggest event was in the early 1980s when 
neighborhood residents joined together to force the closing of a 
popular tavern called fourth base because patrons sometimes plucked 
flowers from neatly kept gardens or urinated in the road 
the final chapter is at hand the bridge project is slated to 
begin in 1991 with demolition of the homes and bridge the new 
bridge which will preserve the original architectural design will 
probably take two years to complete 
leonard bielinsky 77 a retired shoemaker reared 11 children 
in pigsville he and his wife irene moved to their 120yearold 
home in 1950 and expected to live there until they died 
we dont know where were going we cant do anything till 
they make us an offer thrown out thats how i feel about it he 
said

anarchists communists and advocates of 
totalitarian government will be allowed into the united states 
under a law signed by president bush unless officials can find a 
reason to keep them out that goes beyond their political beliefs 
the measure part of a 98 billion state department 
authorization bush signed friday night effectively repeals part of 
a 1952 law that barred visitors with radical views 
nobel laureates gabriel garcia marquez and pablo neruda have 
been excluded under the law in recent years as well as authors 
graham greene doris lessing and carlos fuentes according to a 
senate foreign relations committee report 
among others excluded were french actor yves montand former 
rhodesian prime minister ian smith hortensia allende widow of the 
marxist president of chile and yasir arafat head of the palestine 
liberation organization 
for a generation and more these miserable provisions made the 
united states present itself to other nations as a nation of 
fearful muddled intimidated citizens said sen daniel 
moynihan dny 
the socalled lookout list of excludable aliens maintained by 
the state deparment should be purged of the names of persons 
previously considered ineligible because of political beliefs or 
associations moynihan declared 
still subject to exclusion under the new measure are aliens 
who are polygamists or who practise polygamy or advocate the 
practice of polygamy 
polygamy itself but not advocacy of polygamy is forbidden by 
state law in most of the country 
lawyers familiar with immigration could not recall any problems 
with polygamists visiting the united states who include many 
leaders of moslem countries 
the senate committee report said the new provisions would not 
prevent the government from barring visitors on grounds of national 
security or foreign policy 
others still barred under the law but not always in practice 
are the mentally retarded the insane criminals pimps 
prostitutes paupers vagrants professional beggars stowaways 
drug addicts chronic alcoholics and those with a dangerous 
contagious disease or likely to become burdens on the american 
public 
there is also a ban on but no definition of those afflicted 
with psychopathic personality or sexual deviation or a mental 
defect 
another undefined but excluded group is aliens coming to the 
united states to engage in any immoral sexual act

glass shards crunched underfoot as red 
cross workers removed the body of a lebanese forces fighter crushed 
by his burnedout tank against the wall of a demolished building 
gen michel aouns soldiers warned civilians not to touch 
corpses saying some of them had been boobytrapped by the fleeing 
lebanese forces militiamen led by samir geagea 
two other red cross workers in bright orange uniforms trudged 
through a pile of garbage near the sovietmade t54 tank in the 
furn elshubbak neighborhood trying to slip a metal stretcher 
under the body of a second militiaman 
we found the lower part of the body near the garbage the 
upper part was 10 yards away said one red cross worker as he 
waved off swarming flies 
parents shooed away youngsters watching the scene 
where are the other two bodies one harried rescuer asked 
his colleague there were four militiamen in the tank 
an eerie silence hung over furn elshubbak and ein rummaneh on 
saturday a day after aouns soldiers captured the neighboring 
districts from the lebanese forces after a 16hour tank assault 
at least 43 people were killed and 54 wounded in the attack on 
the lowincome residential districts in christian east beirut 
by police count more than 600 people have been killed and more 
than 1800 wounded in the 18dayold showdown for mastery of the 
310squaremile christian enclave 
ein rummaneh and furn elshubbak looked as if they had been 
struck by a killer earthquake after the brutal onslaught by aouns 
predominantly sunni moslem mukafaha or special corps 
an acrid stench of incinerated steel mingled with the smell of 
corpses 
some of the districts densely populated narrow alleys resembled 
junkyards piled with burned cars some compressed into thin sheets 
by tanks that had crushed them 
tanks and armored personnel carriers rumbled through the dusty 
streets as people emerged from bunkers to take stock of the damage 
and stockpile food 
many threw rice on aouns troops from balconies strung with 
lebanese flags as they shouted long live the army long live 
aoun 
we have finally seen light said mary shammas a housewife 
the lebanese forces was a germ that was squashed by the army may 
god safeguard the army and the general im ready to die for him 
aoun 
some young women sunned themselves on a pockmarked balcony 
overlooking a burned lebanese forces armored personnel carrier 
we lived 17 days underground its so good to breathe fresh 
air again shouted one 
the 1500yardlong furn elshubbak commercial boulevard looked 
like a piece of plowed land strewn with debris pieces of 
furniture and window shutters 
aouns soldiers were defusing mines planted by geageas men 
around the militias posts and barracks now decorated with aoun 
posters and the lebanese flag 
a soldier who lost his left eye in the latest clashes stood 
guard at the entrance to one of the lebanese forces barracks in ein 
rummaneh 
theres a boobytrapped backgammon board here no one can go 
in we are waiting for the sappers bomb squad he said 
the troops stationed in nearly every street in the two areas 
warned civilians against touching suspiciouslooking objects 
the dirty militiamen have even boobytrapped corpses said 
one soldier standing next to a car piled with mines the army had 
removed from the edges of furn elshubbak 
we didnt enjoy fighting them but we wanted to liberate our 
areas from these filthy people they left us no other choice 
said another soldier 
we are taking a small rest now before we attack them in 
ashrafiyeh he added 
ashrafiyeh is one of the last two pockets of the lebanese forces 
in east beirut the other is the lowincome district of nabaa 
reporters and photographers were not allowed to go close to the 
kassardjian barracks the lebanese forces main barracks in the 
area because the area around it is still being cleared of 
mines 
workers were singing as they collected garbage next to a red 
volkswagen containing a body wrapped in a plastic bag 
the wife of a lebanese forces militiaman pierre helou sobbed 
as she hugged her two children in ein rummaneh 
my poor children what has happened to your father 
she doesnt know whether her husband pierre has been killed or 
has surrendered to the army a neighbor said 
long lines of cars crowded the lane leading into west beirut at 
the museum crossing the only open link between moslem west beirut 
and the christian sector 
most of the passengers were fleeing ashrafiyeh in fear of an 
aoun offensive very few cars were crossing into east beirut

campaign rhetoric is heating up as 
sundays elections draw near with the opposition government and 
rebel guerrillas exchanging threats of vengeance and accusations of 
cheating and planned violence 
the campaign had been relatively tranquil since a dec 10 
opposition rally turned into a bloody clash but now the tension is 
showing as the feb 25 vote approaches and the result remains 
uncertain 
the tone of the campaign darkened as opposition vice 
presidential candidate virgilio godoy said the sandinistas would be 
forced to pay for their past misdeeds and president daniel ortega 
responded likewise 
ussupported contra guerrillas accused the government of 
planning an armed offensive on election day the sandinista 
government said 2000 contras were preparing to disrupt the voting 
both sides denied they planned any violence but said they 
wouldnt hesitate to respond if provoked 
managua residents assessed the situation and advised each other 
to stock up on food water and candles in case there of trouble 
after election day 
you never know said one middleaged woman who did not want 
her name used its better to prevent than to lament 
two polls last week found about 50 percent of respondents 
picking ortegas leftist sandinistas with around 30 percent 
expressing a preference for violeta barrios de chamorros 
ussupported united national opposition a coalition of 14 
disparate parties 
however the accuracy of any poll is difficult to assess not 
only is nicaragua a rural country with few telephones but many 
people are reluctant to express their true feelings after years of 
civil war and intimidation 
interior minister tomas borge accused the opposition of planning 
to disrupt voting in an effort to make a sandinista victory appear 
illegitimate 
uno representatives denied that and said they expected to win 
easily but godoy said that if the sandinistas set loose 
turbas or gangs of supporters the opposition would call out 
its own supporters 
we wont let ourselves be intimidated by the government 
godoy said 
the sandinistas who have ruled since the overthrow of dictator 
anastasio somoza in 1979 have an interest in appearing to win 
fairly because it would put pressure on the united states to reduce 
sanctions and other pressures on the government 
mrs chamorros campaign manager antonio lacayo said friday 
that uno would accept a sandinista victory if international 
observers confirm the vote is fair 
about 3000 international observers and journalists plan to 
watch the voting international observers have asked both sides to 
control the zeal of their supporters but over the past week the 
campaign atmosphere has been more intense 
were going to make them pay the bill ortega told a crowd 
of thousands at a rally wednesday in the northern town of matagalpa 
ortega who is seeking a second sixyear term used a common 
nicaraguan phrase vamos a pasarle la cuenta an ominous 
expression that threatened retribution against uno should the 
sandinistas win 
they will be left without a newspaper and the house of the 
lady and that of the vice presidential candidate will be turned 
into nurseries for children ortega told the crowd 
mrs chamorro laughed off ortegas threats even though her 
newspaper la prensa was shut down for nearly two years because of 
its criticism of government policies it was allowed to reopen in 
october 1988 
how funny this poor man is saying that because hes already 
lost mrs chamorro said 
both mrs chamorro and godoy pointed to increasingly 
enthusiastic opposition crowds and said the threats showed the 
ruling party was becoming desperate 
the exchange actually was started by godoy who used the same 
phrase against the sandinistas in two speeches saying one by 
one we will make the sandinistas pay the entire bill 
the us state department expressed concern about ortegas 
statements but not godoys and urged ortega to commit the 
sandinistas to respect the political civil and human rights of 
opposition parties 
the statement noted that under international agreements signed 
by ortega the elections are envisioned as a first step in a 
national reconciliation process 
the godoyortega exchange marked a change in tone because most 
nicaraguans are hoping for peace after years of civil war and both 
parties had tried to exploit that mood 
ortega for example bills himself as the president of peace 
and urges reconciliation 
mrs chamorro says her government would be the only one that 
could bring peace and reconciliation she notes the sandinistas 
have the largest armed forces by far in the region and she promises 
to dump the weapons into the ocean if she is elected

former governors hankering for the power they 
once held and perhaps the trappings as well are heading down the 
comeback trail in increasing numbers hoping to regain the best job 
they ever had 
you think youll like retirement but after about a year you 
miss the crowds says bruce king who is trying for a second 
comeback and third term as governor of new mexico 
as governor youre like the director of the symphony in 
congress youre more like one of the players of instruments 
said rep joe brennan a democrat who is giving up his house seat 
to run for his old job as governor of maine 
at a time when politicians complain that the pressures of money 
and ethics are driving people out of government there is no 
shortage of experienced candidates for the 36 governors seats up 
for election in 1990 
in at least eight states former governors are running for 
governor not counting incumbents seeking another consecutive 
term and at least three more former governors are considering 
running or are being mentioned as possible candidates 
some may be engaging in futile gestures or spoiler candidacies 
while others have serious shots at winning 
lester maddox the onetime segregationist and oneterm governor 
of georgia is a longshot in the democratic primary this year at 
74 he is a symbol of another era 
evan mecham impeached in 1988 as governor of arizona is a 
symbol many republicans in his state would like to forget but gop 
leaders say a crowded field could splinter the opposition and allow 
him to make a strong showing 
former texas gov mark white defeated for reelection four 
years ago is a strong democratic contender and may have recovered 
from the fallout over the tax increase and no passno play high 
school sports rule he pushed as governor 
other former governors running or likely to run include 
republican richard snelling in vermont and democrats fob james in 
alabama and john carlin in kansas 
in alaska republican walter hickel who served in the 1960s and 
was a spoiler independent candidate four years ago is considering 
another run and democrat bill sheffield who served one troubled 
term in the 1980s hasnt ruled out another try in nevada former 
gov bob lists name is being floated by republicans looking for a 
challenger 
its the best job in america said michele davis executive 
director of the republican governors association 
a us senator how many jobs does he get to fill maybe 
40 she said explaining some of the allure a state governor 
were talking thousands its pure power 
some of the interest in returning to the statehouse also may be 
due to disenchantment with washington 
a stillstrong congressional seniority system breeds frustration 
and some say the stalemate over the federal deficit has engendered 
a sense that little if anything ever really gets resolved in the 
nations capital 
brennan was the first former governor in two decades to move to 
the house though the senate has many former governors but in 
either chamber he said a former governor is acutely aware of the 
limits of his power compared to what he wielded in his old post 
theres no question you have the levers of government much 
more available to you he said youre not bogged down in any 
seniority system because there is no seniority 
you can make a difference you are the chief executive 
said king up there on capitol hill youre just one of 400 and 
some odd 
few have shown more unabashed enthusiasm for the governors job 
than king in new mexico 
he first won election as governor in 1970 after serving as 
speaker of the state house barred by law from a second consecutive 
term he returned to his cattle ranch in 1975 and planned his 
comeback he won another fouryear term in the 1978 election 
now 65 and eight years out of the governors mansion in sante 
fe king is waging another comeback bid 
davis who heads the national republican group that will try to 
defeat king if he wins the democratic primary offers ungrudging 
professional admiration 
bruce king is truly one of the best polticians i have ever 
seen davis said he can work a room like nobody remember 
names everything but he is the past others are the future 
now that new mexico has changed its constitution to allow 
governors to succeed themselves king makes no secret that he has 
two more terms in mind 
i enjoy campaigning he said i must

a decade ago janet mullins a 30yearold 
single mother with a background in retailing and real estate and a 
recent college degree took a job typing letters in a senate office 
as a first step to a meaningful career in politics 
in a meteoric rise that would make the producers of the movie 
working girl gulp mullins was made chief of staff in sen 
robert packwoods office less than two years after she started 
working for the oregon republican she more than doubled her 
18000 salary in that time 
mullins quit the job after a year to return to kentucky but 
parlayed the packwood post into series of plum jobs and after 
working in the bush presidential campaign she was appointed 
assistant secretary of state for legislative affairs 
a selfdescribed senate animal the 40yearold mullins a 
democrat until she went to work for packwood is the state 
departments chief lobbyist on capitol hill 
she also reportedly is dating one of the capitals most powerful 
and eligible democrats senate majority leader george mitchell of 
maine her adopted partys principal nemesis in the senate 
a younglooking businesslike brunette who says she shies away 
from profile stories mullins said in an interview the secret of 
her success is simple hard work and an eye for good 
opportunities 
then again mullins hasnt had much time for reflection in the 
last decade what with raising her daughter shannon now an 
18yearold college student in colorado and routinely working long 
hours 
luck and timing have also played a role take for instance her 
decision to join the bush campaign 
she was about two days away from accepting a job with the 
presidential campaign of senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
in 1987 when lee atwater called and said dont make a decision 
until i can talk with you mullins said 
atwater the republican national committee chairman ran george 
bushs presidential campaign 
rejecting the advice of several friends mullins went with bush 
because he was an excellent candidate his campaign 
organization was the ateam from the beginning and the bush 
operatives convinced her she would have a role that would be 
satisfying for me she said 
although she was a neophyte in presidential campaigns she was 
named executive director of the fund for americas future bushs 
political action committee 
she has a reputation for being tough says a former boss 
sen mitch mcconnell rky but he added that mullins is actually 
more bark than bite he also calls her extraordinarily 
bright 
packwood has even cited mullins in his speeches as an example of 
how one can succeed quickly by dint of hard work and intelligence 
others describe mullins as politically insightful capable and 
private 
so private in fact that she refuses to talk about the nature 
of her relationship with mitchell although she doesnt deny it 
mitchell who was divorced three years ago also doesnt discuss 
his personal life spokeswoman diane dewhirst said 
rumor its not a rumor mcconnell said when asked about a 
mullinsmitchell relationship mcconnell hired mullins to run his 
successful 1984 senate campaign in which he upset incumbent walter 
huddleston mullins then became mcconnells chief of staff 
in a town where twocareer couples are common such separation 
of personal and professional lives democrat and republican is 
not unusual 
it hasnt been a problem for me said sen jesse helms 
rnc the ranking republican on the senate foreign relations 
committee i like her she is a charming young lady 
mullins predecessor in the state department position j edward 
fox said access to the leadership can be a big plus in the job 
which he said was very tough the administrations foreign 
policy is a good whipping boy for members of congress he said 
while mullins declines to talk about her social life shes not 
closedmonth about other aspects of her work 
the neat part of my job is that i personally represent the 
secretarys and the administrations point of view my job when i 
walk into a meeting is to know what secretary of state james 
baker would want what the president wants she says leaning 
back in her chair in a large sunny office on the state departments 
seventh floor 
supervising a staff of 50 mullins and her team track 
legislation and advance the administrations foreign policy goals 
on capitol hill where members often have their own ideas 
because the white house legislative affairs office has the 
entire agenda to deal with they really rely upon us and the nsc 
the national security council to honcho the foreign policy side 
of things she said 
while mullins gets on the phone with members and staff people 
to the extent i can she usually relies on feedback from staff 
she comes to capitol hill for big events like bakers testimony 
before the senate foreign relations committee 
from a professional standpoint 1990 started off well for 
mullins when the senate gave president bush a big victory by 
sustaining his veto of a bill that imposed sanctions on china the 
house had overridden the veto 
generally mullins and her operation receive good marks but 
some members have their gripes 
sometimes they do well said rep benjamin gilman rny a 
member of the house foreign affairs committee sometimes they 
come to us late there have been some hot issues they came to 
us late in the game 
others dont have an opinion 
who asked sen joseph biden ddel when questioned about 
mullins i havent been lobbied by anyone in the 
administration said biden a leading democrat on the foreign 
relations committee

ronald reagan was in front of the camera 
again with lawyers hanging on his every word as the former 
president produced a videotaped version of his recollection of the 
irancontra affair 
reagan testified behind closed doors for about six hours friday 
and returned for a second session today answering questions about 
his role in the irancontra affair the failed armsforhostages 
deal during reagans second term 
reagan was compelled to testify in the case by us district 
judge harold greene who is presiding over the trial of former 
white house national security adviser john m poindexter in 
washington dc 
the former presidents blue luxury car pulled up in a pounding 
rainstorm at about 930 am today poindexter arrived by taxi 
about 15 minutes earlier bounding through the rain and past a 
throng of reporters on his way into the courthouse 
as they did friday both men ignored reporters questions 
outside the courthouse 
the former president was to face 154 questions which were drawn 
from 183 submitted to the court by defense attorney richard 
beckler the attorney was allowed followup questions if necessary 
but the judge prohibited him from raising additional questions on 
new subjects 
on friday greene had estimated that the president would wind up 
the taping by lunchtime today 
security was especially rigorous for the extraordinary session 
which began friday morning at the federal courthouse in downtown 
los angeles reporters were kept more than 100 yards away 
in deference to the former president greene allowed reagan 79 
to give videotaped testimony near his belair area home rather than 
require him to appear in person at poindexters trial in washington 
on friday reagan entered the courtroom a few minutes after 
poindexter and the two exited separately about 6 hours later 
the former security adviser goes on trial march 5 on charges of 
concealing from congress assistance by his former aide oliver 
north to the nicaraguan contra rebels and lying about a 1985 
shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
poindexter sought the former chief executives testimony to 
bolster his contention that his secret activities had been 
authorized by reagan 
i think he was very fair in his testimony beckler said of 
the president as he left court 
greene threw out 29 of becklers questions because they lacked 
relevance or touched too closely to national secrets 
crossexamination was to be conducted by dan k webb the chief 
prosecutor for irancontra independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
although the judge has not made the specific questions public 
he said they fell into several broad categories such as the extent 
of reagans knowledge of the shipment of missiles to iran and 
reagans understanding of legislation that barred temporarily 
us aide to the contras 
reagan said early in 1987 that he hadnt known about secret 
bank accounts and diverted funds two products of the irancontra 
affair that he said he found personally distasteful he told 
the tower commission he didnt know the national security council 
staff was assisting the contras 
poindexter subsequently told congress he believed reagan 
understood that north was instrumental in keeping the contras 
supported without maybe understanding the details of exactly what 
he was doing 
greene earlier rejected a request by news organizations to 
attend the deposition however he said he would order the 
videotape released within a few days after editing to remove 
material deemed to touch on classified matters

from the deserts of turkmenia to the glacierlaced 
peaks of tadzhikistan soviet central asians are venting their 
anger over nationalist issues as they awaken from decades of 
complacency 
dangerous ingredients that have been brewing for decades 
suppression of islam joblessness pollution and a burgeoning 
population have come to a boil and they pose dangerous new 
challenges for the kremlin 
in some cases the emotions have exploded into violence since 
1986 more than 120 people have been killed in ethnic clashes in 
the region 
stretching over an area half the size of the united states and 
home to 49 million people soviet central asia is becoming the 
nations heartland but also one of its biggest headaches 
president mikhail s gorbachev is well aware of the dangers as 
he tries to reverse decades of neglect of the environment culture 
and religion 
this is a kind of chain reaction accompanied by an orgy of 
violence gorbachev told the supreme soviet legislature last week 
during the most recent outbreak of ethnic violence in tadzhikistan 
the countrys destiny and the safety of our citizens is at 
stake comrades we must do everything to put out the fire 
gorbachev said 
soviet central asia has been in flames before it was a 
crossroads for invading mongols turks persians and slavs until it 
was absorbed in czarist russias drive south in the 19th century 
in modern times the central asians have fought each other 
in 1986 the bloodiest soviet ethnic riots in decades broke out 
in alma ata the capital of kazakhstan following the replacement 
of the republics party leader a kazakh by an ethnic russian two 
people were killed 
that same year in a prelude to the riots that began last week 
3000 people rioted in dushanbe the capital of tadzhikistan 
reports spoke of an unspecified number of injuries 
last may bands of young people frustrated with high prices and 
consumer shortages rioted in two cities of the turkmenia republic 
bordering iran 
then in june a largescale rampage of arson and murder 
involving ethnic uzbeks and meskhetian turks forcibly deported to 
central asia by stalin in 1944 tore through uzbekistans fergana 
valley about 100 people were killed 
later that month four people died in the kazakhstan city of 
novy uzen when rioters attacked immigrants from the caucasus 
accusing them of setting up private business and getting special 
housing and other privileges 
similar factors fueled riots that exploded feb 10 in dushanbe 
where 20 people have been reported killed 
as many as 200000 of the republics 51 million people are 
reported to be unemployed and housing is in short supply in 
dushanbe for the large families that are traditional among central 
asians 
young villagers living in tents since an earthquake destroyed 
their homes in january 1989 have been identified as rioters in 
dushanbe they reportedly were enraged by rumors that armenian 
refugees fleeing ethnic violence in the caucasus were being given 
apartments 
the protesters demands have included banning the sale of pork 
which moslems do not eat and introducing measures to combat 
unemployment they also want the tadzhik language to use the arabic 
script instead of cyrillic 
other problems include animosity between the indigenous 
population and immigrants many of whom have better skills and 
therefore receive better jobs and better housing 
demographics are an important factor in the unrest 
a population boom in the five central asian republics 
tadzhikistan turkmenia kazakhstan kirgizia and uzbekistan 
means that in many areas there are more people than jobs a soviet 
legislator has estimated that 6 million young people are not 
working or studying in central asia 
the population boom has political ramifications it threatens to 
shift the power balance which now favors european slavs in the 
north to the moslems in the south the central asian republics now 
account for 17 percent of the total soviet population compared 
with 15 percent in 1979 and 11 percent in 1959 
western demographers say central asia could hold the majority of 
the soviet population within a century if current birthrates 
continue tadzhikistan has the highest birthrate of all 15 soviet 
republics with its population increasing 345 percent in the last 
decade 
most of the residents of the broad area separating the countrys 
slavic heartland from iran afghanistan and china are of moslem 
heritage and have taken advantage of the freedoms gorbachev has 
offered to assert their religious interests 
the number of students in islamic academies is increasing along 
with the publication of the koran and other religious books the 
kremlin is removing a stalinera ban on group religious education 
and plans to allow believers to organize charities 
last year the spiritual leader of central asias moslems was 
ousted after radicals accused him of corruption and ignorance of 
islam 
in central asia as elsewhere the deteriorating environment has 
become a rallying point 
national policy demanding increased cotton production has led to 
overuse of fertilizers increasing infant mortality in some places 
to as high as 70 per 1000 live births seven times the us rate 
pushing marginal land into production has ruined hundreds of 
thousands of acres 
rivers tapped to irrigate the cotton crop on arid land have 
dried up nearly half the aral sea between uzbekistan and 
kazakhstan making its revival one of the soviet unions most 
pressing environmental concerns

superpower leaders are expected to sign two 
big and three small treaties in 1990 the year of arms control and 
the proposed pacts mark a big change in the way moscow views its 
security interests 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev who for the past five years 
has amazed the west with sweeping arms proposals made dazzling 
concessions over the past two weeks clearing the way for a 
strategic arms reduction treaty start and a multilateral pact to 
cut conventional armies in central europe 
the treaties which are qualitatively different than previous 
arms control pacts reflect the change in soviet thinking on 
security issues say us and soviet arms control officials and 
experts 
the changes in kremlin thinking sparked in large measure by an 
economic crisis within the soviet union have prompted the 
gorbachev generation to scrap the doctrine that guided kremlin 
leaders during the four decades of the cold war that they needed 
an east european military alliance as a buffer against possible 
aggression from the west 
and both superpowers have decided that the world would be safer 
with fewer nuclear weapons reversing a fourdecade buildup 
someplace there is a museum of old vital interests that 
nations could no longer afford to defend said albert carnesdale 
an arms control expert at harvard university 
several of the agreements are likely to be signed at a summit 
this june in washington us and soviet officials say 
president bush and gorbachev are likely to sign a start 
framework agreement in june instructing negotiators to hammer out 
the remaining details of the 1500page document for signing by 
years end said one soviet official speaking on condition he not 
be further identified 
in june the two leaders also are expected to sign protocols 
designed to ease senate ratification of two minor treaties from the 
1970s limiting underground nuclear tests 
and agreement is near on a bilateral pact under which the 
superpowers would destroy most of their chemical weapons 
multilateral negotiations continue for a global ban 
in the most notable recent soviet concession gorbachev dropped 
opposition to bushs proposal that the united states retain 30000 
troops in britain and southern europe under a treaty reducing 
conventional armies in central europe 
bushs plan would allow the superpowers to keep 195000 troops 
apiece in central europe mostly in germany 
gorbachev also waived his opposition to the reunification of 
east and west germany 
those concessions and others designed to speed work on start 
which would reduce superpower strategic nuclear arms by 30 percent 
prompted some western commentators to describe the soviet union 
as a failing power 
us and soviet arms negotiators however reject that argument 
saying gorbachevs flexibility reflects a changing perception of 
national security and the wish of kremlin leaders to concentrate 
on domestic affairs 
no one is holding a gun to our head we are negotiating 
agreements on the basis of our security interests what is good 
for us said one soviet official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
gorbachev was willing to allow the 30000 us troops to stay on 
the european periphery because far more soviet forces will remain 
within the soviet union far closer to the potential battlefield 
than american reserves 
a us arms control official agreed saying the soviets are 
preoccupied with their internal problems and they want to minimize 
the time their top leaders will spend on internal questions 
the soviets have accelerated work on arms control treaties by 
coming to the us position in a couple of cases but the us 
positions were not cutthroat said the american official also 
speaking on condition he not be further identified 
they are not rolling over completely he said but want to 
close deals this year and are willing to push some hard 
questions down the road 
among the issues that have been moved to later negotiations are 
soviet efforts to draw the united states into talks on naval arms 
control limitations on sealaunched cruise missiles and a 
superpower disagreement on how to count fighter aircraft in europe 
the nuclear conventional and chemical treaties differ from arms 
control pacts of the 1970s by requiring the superpowers to scrap 
large numbers of arms including new weapons systems the treaties 
of the 1970s limited the numbers of weapons but did not require 
destruction of significant quantities 
by and large in the past arms control agreements codified 
defense plans said carnesdale what has changed is that our 
defense plans have built into them an expectation of arms control

powerful tobacco interests that have ruled 
virginia since colonial times may be losing clout as legislators 
prepare to join their counterparts in 44 other states in passing a 
law to restrict smoking in public 
how influential the tobacco lobby remains will be shown by 
whether the general assembly approves the stronger or weaker of two 
bills that have survived initial votes in the house of delegates 
and the senate 
the success of both bills so far shows the increasing clout of 
health groups that have battled wellfinanced tobacco interests 
over public smoking for years lawmakers and lobbyists say 
when you see bills introduced in virginia what more can you 
say said athena mueller general counsel for action on smoking 
and health an antismoking lobby based in washington 
antismoking activists attribute their success to recent medical 
reports on the harm caused by secondhand smoke and the waning 
political influence of rural counties where tobacco is the no 1 
cash crop 
virginia the nations fifth biggest producer of tobacco is 
among six states with no statewide limits on smoking in public the 
others are north carolina tennessee missouri alabama and wyoming 
states such as illinois and kentucky merely limit smoking in 
schools ms mueller said but 30 to 35 states have relatively 
strong antismoking laws that cover a variety of public places 
tobacco lobbyists concede they have been forced to accept 
smoking regulations because of the growing strength of smoking 
opponents 
the antismoking zealots are much louder than smokers said 
tom lauria a spokesman for the tobacco institute in washington 
theyre able to get their point across to both the media and to 
the lawmakers i dont think the smokers are doing that 
but lauria said the tobacco industry continues to influence 
legislators the weaker virginia bill has been drafted at least 
in part by tobacco interests he said 
the bills sponsor delegate c richard cranwell and the 
tobacco institutes chief virginia lobbyist anthony f troy have 
vehemently denied the tobbaco lobby is behind the weaker bill as a 
way of forestalling the other one 
there are provisions in that bill that we object to troy 
said 
the housepassed bill sponsored by cranwell a democrat from 
roanoke county would ban smoking in elevators school buses 
school common areas and hospital emergency rooms and require 
nosmoking areas in government buildings 
but it would also limit cities and counties from passing tough 
new local smoking ordinances and require employers to have the 
support of twothirds of their workers before banning smoking in 
the workplace 
troy said the tobacco industry thinks the bills guidelines for 
local ordinances are too stringent 
a senatepassed bill would ban or limit smoking in a wide range 
of public places allow localities to make ordinances as strict as 
they want and let employers forbid smoking in the workplace 
antismoking ordinances already in effect in nearly two dozen 
virginia localities including some of the states most populous 
counties and cities would remain intact under either bill the 
differences between the two measures probably will be resolved by a 
committee of legislators from both chambers said sen thomas j 
michie jr a democrat from albemarle sponsor of the senate bill 
the two chambers must act before their adjournment march 10 
gov l douglas wilder who took office last month has not 
endorsed either bill saying he preferred to let the legislators 
work the issue out among themselves first 
michie who saw his legislation narrowly defeated last year 
attributed the turnaround to medical warnings about passive smoke 
and constituent pressure 
i dont think interest groups have a great deal of influence 
when the citizenry feels strongly about something he said 
health groups are divided about the smoking legislation 
david l bailey jr a lobbyist for heart lung and cancer 
associations said the weaker bill would satisfy them its a 
good half a loaf he said 
but other health activists see the tobacco lobby behind the 
bill anne morrow donley executive director of the virginia group 
to alleviate smoking in public said she would rather see no 
statewide law than the cranwell bill 
when the tobacco industry sees that it is inevitable that some 
law is going to go through then they do what cranwell has done 
she said they get a weak bill as weak as they can get it and 
they tie the localities hands

david clarke is running for mayor of the 
nations capital and already is just a step away from getting the 
job eight months before the election 
clarke the only white candidate for mayor in this predominantly 
black city would automatically become acting mayor if incumbent 
marion barry stepped down because of his indictment last week by a 
federal grand jury 
the 46yearold city council chairman says however that he 
doesnt want the job that way 
i am not a candidate for acting mayor clarke said im 
not calling for barrys resignation 
he says that if he succeeded barry before the nov 6 election it 
could upset many blacks who make up 70 percent of the population 
of the district of columbia 
our community is going through a difficult time clarke 
said its going through mourning 
he says he knows that a number of blacks are concerned over 
whether barry has been treated fairly in any case he says 
washingtonians need to restore their dignity by voting for the 
next mayor and not have one foisted on them 
barry was indicted thursday on three felony counts of lying to a 
federal grand jury and five misdemeanor counts of cocaine 
possession he was arrested jan 18 in a sting operation in a 
downtown hotel 
barry in a statement released by his aides said he would be 
exonerated at his trial and added that he was not considering a 
resignation under city law he can serve as mayor unless he is 
jailed after being convicted 
clarke asked in a recent interview about his chances of being 
elected said im staking my career on it he stressed his 
ties in washington where he was born and schooled 
he was director of the local branch of the southern christian 
leadership conference in the 1960s and part of the campaign that 
led congress to grant home rule to the city in 1973 he said he 
doubts that race will be a major factor in the voting 
i am not hearing it and i do not think it is a feeling of the 
majority of the voters in this city clarke said if i thought 
it was a dominant feeling why would i take this gamble 
clarke pointed out that before winning the chairmanship in a 
citywide election eight years ago he represented a racially 
diverse ward 
the next mayor should come from within local politics he says 
he brands the rev jesse jackson who moved here last year as an 
outsider 
jackson remains noncommittal about a run for mayor a washington 
post poll the day after barry was arrested showed jackson as a 
strong favorite with clarke and other announced candidates well 
behind 
there have been hints that the us attorney for the district of 
columbia jay b stephens might accept barrys resignation as part 
of a plea bargain 
the mayor dropped plans to announce for a fourth term on jan 21 
three days after his arrest but has given no sign that he will 
not run he currently is in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation 
clinic in florida while city administrator carol thompson heads a 
caretaker government 
barry says he is being treated for alcoholism 
if barry were to resign clarke would become acting mayor for up 
to 120 days the deadline for holding a special election if barry 
were to resign within 60 days of the election however clarke 
would be mayor until then 
clarke refused to discuss what he would do if barry resigned and 
he automatically became mayor but he spoke eagerly of the kind of 
mayor he would be if the voters choose him in november 
id be much more low key he said contrasting his style to 
barrys 
you wont see any great claims of the dave clarke 
administration he said instead clarke says he would 
concentrate on getting things done 
the 6foot5 250pound clarke at times appears disheveled with 
shirttail out and necktie askew as he lumbers about the district 
building often he can be seen pedaling a bicycle around town 
clarke and his wife carole have been married for 16 years and 
friends say their social life is anything but flamboyant 
his style is in sharp contrast to that of barry an impeccably 
groomed selfdescribed night owl who travels by chauffeured 
limousine and relishes his entourage and other trappings of power 
clarke characterizes his relationship with barry as one of 
respect constructive tension but is noticeably irritated with 
the way barry has reacted to policies clarke helped establish on 
the council 
after 16 years in making policies we havent seen enough 
realized because of the administration the chairman said 
the other candidates for mayor are sharon pratt dixon a utility 
company executive and democratic national committee member and 
council members john ray and charlene drew jarvis

despite fears that the planet is heating up 
temperatures in the southeastern united states have actually fallen 
1 degree fahrenheit over the past 30 years according to a federal 
study released saturday 
the finding contradicts the widely held notion that pollution in 
the atmosphere has already made temperatures start to rise 
its cooling and getting wetter said george a maul this 
is quite different from what the computer models suggest should be 
going on with global warming 
oftenrepeated theories of global warming hold that rising 
levels of carbon dioxide methane and other gases are trapping heat 
in the atmosphere causing the socalled greenhouse effect 
these gases result from burning fuels and other sources 
computers programmed to run complex mathematical formulas predict 
that if the gases continue to build up temperatures around the 
world will jump between roughly 3 and 8 degrees fahrenheit over the 
next century 
maul an oceanographer with the us commerce departments 
atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory in miami 
presented his findings at a meeting of the american association for 
the advancement of science 
he said his work does not definitely prove that global warming 
isnt happening the fall in temperatues may be a factor of the 
difficulty of calculating global warming on a regional scale but 
it should increase the debate about global warming 
last year maul and colleagues produced a report showing that 
overall temperatures across the united states have been virtually 
unchanged during the past century 
two other studies done by other groups of researchers suggest 
that around the world temperatures have risen 1 degree in the past 
100 years 
however some critics have suggested that this rise might be 
partially due to increasing urbanization where the temperatures are 
recorded city temperatures are higher than the surrounding 
countryside because of the concentration of people 
mauls latest data show that from the turn of the century to the 
mid1940s average temperatures in the southeast rose a 
halfdegree but since then they have fallen a full degree so 
over nearly a full century temperatures have dropped half a degree 
at the same time annual rainfall in the southeast has increased 
65 millimeters or roughly 2 inches since the turn of the century 
maul said he believes that if the heattrapping gases continue 
to increase and nothing else changes then global temperatures 
almost certainly will increase however he said too little is 
known about other forces that affect weather such as ocean 
currents and the suns output to say with certainty that the 
planet will heat up 
computerized predictions known as computer models produce 
widely divergent scenarios of what might happen especially over 
relatively small portions of the earth 
the weather is affected by mountains lakes and other features 
on the earths surfaces however adding all of these features to 
the computerized calculations makes the job dauntingly complex 
michael e schlesinger of the university of illinois at 
urbanachampaign who makes computer models said that accurate 
predictions about global warming will require calculations that use 
10 times finer detail and producing a model with this much detail 
would require running the worlds fastest supercomputer nonstop 
day and night for 40 years he said 
despite the uncertainties many climate experts have used the 
existing models to speculate about what might happen over the next 
century among the predictions offered at saturdays meeting 
diana liverman of pennsylvania state university said higher 
temperatures and lower rainfall could damage mexican farming corn 
output for instance in nonirrigated fields could fall by 40 
percent 
orman e granger of the university of california at berkeley 
said that rising sea levels in the caribbean would destroy the 
beaches which are crucial to the islands tourist industry

sen christopher dodd cant seem to shake the 
criticism on his left from opponents of military aid to el 
salvador an odd predicament for a longtime foe of administration 
policies in central america 
dodds wethersfield conn office has been occupied his name 
has been pasted on effigies of death squad victims in the latest 
campaign college students in the northeast are receiving phony 
draft notices urging them to call dodd and change his position on 
salvadoran aid 
during the reagan administration dodd supported a measure 
barring economic aid to el salvador unless the us certified 
progress in human rights he also opposed president reagans 
certification of the country 
dodd chairman of the senate foreign relations subcommittee on 
western hemisphere affairs has been a spokesman against aid to the 
contras in nicaragua on those and other issues affecting the 
region he has been no darling of the right 
but his proposal last week to cut military aid and then either 
increase it or decrease it depending on the progress of peace 
negotiations won no converts among leftleaning groups 
dodd says the plan was a logical progression of his longheld 
view that salvadoran president alfredo cristiani a personal 
friend wants peace and is willing to negotiate with rebel forces 
the change in dodds position is in the amount he is willing to 
support 
if the salvadoran government broke off negotiations or failed on 
the human rights front the aid would be cut entirely on the other 
hand if the rebel forces were responsible for breaking 
negotiations full military aid would be restored 
the time has come to frame our assistance in a way that 
evidences our firm support for what president cristiani is trying 
to achieve dodd said among other things he said this 
legislation makes it clear that if cristiani is overthrown or 
unconstitutionally removed from power all assistance will be 
terminated 
coming two days after sens john kerry and edward kennedy 
proposed a complete cutoff of aid dodds proposal pleased 
conservative observers 
dodd is looking at it in a realistic manner said michael 
wilson a policy analyst at the conservative heritage foundation 
he understands the issue a little bit better than some of these 
other senators as well 
typifying the reaction from the left was larry birns of the 
council on hemispheric affairs 
the basic thing about dodd is hes a straddler birns said 
he has lost a lot of credibility in terms of being the serious 
student of the region that he has long been believed to be within 
the community of those who closely monitor uslatin american 
relations dodd is looked on as unreliable and inconsistent 
dodd and his liberal critics disagree on a fundamental point 
the impact of military aid birns and others argue that military 
aid simply provides the tools for right wing death squads to carry 
out their terror campaign against peasants land reformers and 
anyone else deemed potentially subversive 
dodd argues that military aid prevents violence by convincing 
rebels that they cannot take over the country by force and must 
negotiate for a political role 
there are those who say if we cut off aid we cut off the 
war that is just not a fact said dodds top senate aide jason 
isaacson 
the group whose local chapter was responsible for the draft 
cards being sent to yale rutgers and other schools is pleased 
that dodd has at least abandoned his support for full military aid 
to el salvador 
that hes calling for a cutoff of half the aid indicates that 
the policy is in trouble and it indicates that the pressure that 
has been put on in his district and around the country has had some 
impact said hugh byrne political director of the committee in 
solidarity with the people of el salvador 
byrne points to the cosponsors of his proposal moderate sens 
jim sasser dtenn joe biden ddel terry sanford dnc and 
dale bumpers dark as an indication that he has staked out a 
centrist position 
isaacson rejected any notion that dodd formulated his policy 
with his critics in mind 
this proposal has to do with whats going on in el salvador 
today and with whats gone on in el salvador for the last 10 
years isaacson said it has nothing to do with what goes on in 
this country

president bush out for a chilly 
power walk near his snowswept vacation home said he plans to 
stay out of former president reagans court battle with john 
poindexter 
asked if he had talked recently to reagan who gave closed 
videotape testimony friday and saturday in the trial of his former 
national security adviser bush said no have not talked to him 
bush said he planned to stay out of it as to whether he 
thought it was good that the former president had testified bush 
said thats a matter between him and the process the process 
worked 
the bush administration however joined reagans defense last 
week in supporting his assertion of executive privilege to avoid 
turning over diary excerpts sought by poindexter 
poindexter goes on trial march 5 on charges of concealing from 
congress assistance that national security aide oliver north gave 
to the nicaraguan contra rebels and lying about a 1985 shipment of 
hawk missiles to iran 
bush who was reagans vice president consistently has denied 
any knowledge of the irancontra dealings 
bush arrived in maine on friday to spend the holiday weekend 
with his wife barbara at their seaside home 
skies dawned sunny on saturday but a bitter wind blew across 
the snow scape 
dressed in wool plaid pants and a leather flight jacket against 
the icy air bush headed off on a vigorous march of about 5 miles 
to inspect repairs on his speedboat 
although he invited reporters to join him for part of the slushy 
walk bush was not in a mood to discuss issues 
no questions he called curtly as he and mrs bush set out 
from the family compound on walkers point 
instead he bantered about the great day and pointed out his 
secret for icyweather walks a cane he called one of these 
sticks for the nonslide walker 
he said he had heard no news of reports that cuba was to reform 
its party structure however he said he had spoken to boston 
cardinal bernard law who was going to meet with church leaders in 
cuba 
asked about the fournation drug summit he attended thursday in 
colombia he said reaction has been so far pretty good 
he jovially shook hands with a few bystanders along the 
residential route but seemed more intent on racing past them to 
keep up his breakneck pace 
careful of this down slope you guys bush told the press 
pack before dashing off ahead i have to speed up i hate to go 
so slow he said as aides and bodyguards panted along 
power walk he shouted to reporters apparently missing 
their rejoinders that this form of exercise was the habit of his 
former democratic presidential rival massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis 
bush walked to nearby cape porpoise where his speedboat fidelity 
is in dry dock for an overhaul 
bush proclaimed the job beautiful 
new screws new engines everything its perfect 
mrs bush rode back in one of the security vehicles that 
accompanied them on the walk while bush was joined by his daughter 
dorothy leblond a maine resident for the return hike 
bush went the opposite direction for his walk than he did a year 
ago when a walk into the town of kennebunkport resulted in a 
chaotic traffic jam of reporters cameras townspeople and security 
vehicles 
the bushes were planning later saturday to go over remodelling 
plans with the interior decorator who will redo some rooms in the 
87yearold stone house on walkers point 
they plan to return to washington on monday

winter winds and waves have broken down 
or removed much of the oil left over from last years cleanup 
exxon says but state officials are not so sure 
theres a considerable amount of oil thats not been 
removed said art weiner an alaska department of environmental 
conservation official who heads scientific programs for the states 
oil spill team 
exxon officials said friday that some beaches that were black 
with oil in september from the march 24 spill from the exxon valdez 
tanker are now clean especially those that have taken the most 
intense beatings from winter storms the beaches are in prince 
william sound and the gulf of alaska 
even areas that are more protected from the elements are being 
cleansed by the harsh weather they said 
there has been significant removal through time said andy 
teal a biologist coordinating exxons shoreline monitoring more 
than half of what was found in september has disappeared by now 
he said 
exxon said its data reflected surveys conducted from september 
through december 
on friday exxon turned over four months of data from its 
monitoring program to the state conservation department and the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration the company said 
the data reflected its best estimate of how much oil from the 
nations worst oil spill remains on the beaches and under the 
surface of prince william sound and the nearby gulf 
the exxon valdez went aground on bligh reef as it was leaving 
the oil port of valdez it spilled nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude into the sound and the gulf 
company officials said they hoped the sharing of data with the 
federal and state governments would help defuse a contentious 
atmosphere that has existed in recent months concerning the effects 
of the spill and cleanup 
we dont want to come across as if theres no problem said 
hans jahns exxons scientific coordinator who is analyzing the 
information that 19 scientists have gathered since september the 
studies were conducted at 64 sites throughout the oil spill area

7 million gallons of oil remained along the affected area more 
than 1000 miles of shoreline of prince william sound and the gulf 
of alaska 
exxon officials refused to estimate how much cleanup might be 
needed this summer saying they will release their general 1990

the sticky black goo slopping 
onto southern california beaches from an oil spill is more than an 
environmental disaster its a conspicuous electionyear issue for 
politicians and environmentalists 
this kind of thing motivates to action even people who are not 
politically or environmentally active said bob hattoy regional 
director of the sierra club youve got angry republican 
housewives from orange county sopping up oil with tea towels this 
will have an effect 
the cause of the 400000gallon spill feb 7 still is under 
investigation but officials speculated the 811foot american 
trader was struck by one of its anchors while maneuvering into a 
mooring area two miles offshore 
the spill coincided with campaigns for the june primary when 
candidates for governor will be chosen along with many other state 
and local offices 
so many politicians went to the beaches that mayor tom mays 
finally asked them for advance notice so they would not interfere 
with the cleanup they were bringing their podiums on the beach 
and it was a whole show mays said 
the interest among lawmakers however also is expected to 
revitalize efforts aimed at improving oil industry safety 
including proposals for double hulls and double bottoms on tankers 
better traffic control system to guide tankers along the coast 
more tanker safety equipment and a halt to new offshore oil 
drilling 
the double hull issue probably will be the first settled because 
it is currently before a housesenate committee working on 
compromise legislation 
william rusnack vice president of corporate planning for arco 
said the oil industry was bracing for the worst we always have a 
concern there could be an overreaction he said 
in the first days after the spill strong santa ana winds kept 
the oil slick offshore but a sudden shift in wind direction and 
high tides last weekend pushed the oil ashore on huntington beach 
and newport beach 
chocolatebrown waves crashed onto beaches caked in black muck 
that looked like asphalt and smelled like road tar from the air 
it looked like a highway had been paved where the water touched the 
sand 
as of saturday morning 10 days after the spill the oil had 
killed about 175 birds and coated 370 others in oil about 1000 
grunion a small fish were killed when they came ashore to lay 
their eggs which also were doomed halibut fisheries were 
devastated fishermen said 
ship traffic was barred at three harbors hurting fishing boat 
charter services catalina island excursion operators and 
whalewatching boat operators even local fish stores that sold 
fish caught far away from the spill lost business from the publicly 
state officials said things could have been much worse the 
spill will not make the record books in terms of wildlife killed or 
dollars lost and it pales in comparison to alaskas valdez spill 
the cleanup was aided by cooperative weather in the early days 
the geography of the beach the accessibility of equipment and a 
lot of dumb luck 
sandbags and booms so far have protected environmentally 
sensitive wetlands and almost no oil drifted south to the tide 
pools and the rocky shoreline which would have been much more 
difficult to clean than the sandy beaches of newport and huntington 
some businesses even benefited from the spill restaurants and 
shops catered to curious visitors who wouldnt normally be on the 
beach in the slow winter season one shop was selling 1295 
tshirts that read crude is rude dude

mile from the nearest road

a pair of gum boots a walking stick and a sheathed knife 
reporters at the scene said police kept them and local residents 
about 300 yards away as they loaded oukos remains into an air 
force helicopter for the journey to nairobi 
oukos last public appearance was on feb 10 when he addressed 
a service club in kisumu 220 miles northwest of nairobi and not 
far from his home 
the kenya times has reported that a white car arrived at oukos 
home at about 3 am tuesday and left with the minister the 
newspaper attributed its report to sentry and a servant 
ouko a father of four girls and three boys first served as 
permanent secretary in the ministry of foregn affairs from 1963 to 
1964 and held the same position in the ministry of works up to 1969

a regional communist party leader on saturday 
denied reports of rioting in uzbekistan and another top official 
said the rumors were aimed at inflaming ethnic tensions in the 
neighboring republic of tadzhikistan 
the communist party newspaper pravda warned that ethnic strife 
threatens the reforms of president mikhail s gorbachev and 
thousands of people in leningrad demonstrated against civil 
violence particularly antisemitism 
radio moscow on friday night reported clashes between members of 
the moslem majority and ethnic armenians in the ancient uzbekistan 
city of samarkand it said army troops had been sent to the city 
and a curfew had been imposed 
it attributed its information to the interfax news service a 
joint venture affiliated with radio moscow 
but nasyr yakubov the first party secretary of samarkand told 
the associated press by telephone that his city was quiet there 
were no riots and no curfew was imposed he said the citys 12000 
armenian residents live in peace with members of other ethnic 
groups 
interfax later quoted an unidentified highranking interior 
ministry official in moscow as saying the report amounted to 
provocative information aimed at aggravating the situation in the 
region and provoking new national disorders 
radio moscow said further checks by its correspondents showed 
that samarkand was calm and quiet 
the city is about 1700 miles southeast of moscow and has a 
population of 390000 mostly moslems the armenian refugees are 
mainly christians and had fled ethnic violence in the mostly moslem 
republic of azerbaijan 
in the tadzhik capital of dushanbe the army general in charge 
of enforcing a state of emergency said that thousands of troops 
have helped to stabilize the city after a week of unrest 
i cannot say we have full control over the situation now but 
there are no more outrages like those that took place feb 13 and 
14 lt gen georgy kondratyev said in an interview with the 
newspaper sovietskaya rossia 
the violence in dushanbe a city of 596000 people 1600 miles 
southeast of moscow was touched off feb 10 by rumors that 
armenian refugees were arriving by the thousands and receiving 
scarce apartments 
the official tass news agency said the death toll in 
tadzhikistan had risen to 22 
in a frontpage editorial pravda said increasing civil violence 
and confrontations in the farflung soviet republics are 
endangering gorbachevs reforms 
the newspaper said the soviet union was at a turning point 
democracy it said must be defended from political extremists on 
the right and left 
democracy should not be left defenseless before the danger of 
civil confrontation chaos and unstability pravda said 
unfortunately the danger is becoming more and more real 
the key question of the day is on what ground stabilization 
will be achieved it said on the grounds of democracy with 
the help of emerging democratic institutions on the ground of 
national and interethnic accord or in accordance with the forced 
methods of tightening the screws happily used in the past 
perestroika is forging fundamental changes in the soviet union 
pravda said 
we must defend our perestroika as a revolution which is 
worthwhile only if it can defend itself pravda said and we 
shall defend it from violence and political platitude from 
ignorance and philistinism from unreason and destruction

ruben deases just turned 18 is charged with firstdegree 
murder in the killing of jennifer ann gardner a brother edward 
deases 21 awaits trial on the same charge a third brother 
johnny 16 is the states key witness 
four youth workers have testified that ruben bragged about the 
may 28 killing after his arrest and even made up rap songs about it 
one such song included the lines she thought she was cool 
and i was a fool and now shes dead and im ahead said jack 
leinen a former youth services worker at the des moines detention 
center where ruben was held 
ms gardner 20 was the girlfriend of a fourth deases brother 
eustaquio 23 a cocaine dealer who according to defense lawyers 
sold 10000 worth of the drug a week they shared a onebedroom 
apartment in ames a college town north of des moines in central 
iowa 
called by prosecutors to testify on friday eustaquio lunged 
across the defense lawyers table at ruben throwing punches and 
snarling curses officers had to pull the brothers apart 
at the time of the death edward and ruben deases also were 
living in the apartment johnny then 15 was visiting for the 
weekend from boys town the nebraska home for troubled youth where 
eustaquio met ms gardner years earlier 
on the night of may 28 while eustaquio was out of town edward 
got into an argument with ms gardner johnny testified 
she was strangled then decapitated the next day her head was 
found by a jogger in a roadside ditch south of ames ruben and 
edward were arrested june 1 hours before her torso was found in a 
lake north of ames 
johnny deases testified that edward was jealous of ms gardners 
influence over eustaquio and that edward viewed the woman as an 
obstacle to his advancement in eustaquios cocaine dealing business 
after quarreling with edward johnny said she threatened all 
three brothers with a 9mm automatic and went into the bedroom 
johnny ruben and edward sat in the living room and plotted her 
death johnny said he was recruited to kill her because of his 
legal status as a juvenile but lost his nerve 
ms gardner had returned to the living room with a beer and was 
sitting on the couch watching mtv johnny said when ruben moved 
behind her and grabbed her throat in a choke hold lifting her feet 
from the floor 
she was struggling the youth said her legs were moving 
and he brought her to the ground in about 45 seconds 
she was panicking as if she was drowning her arms were moving 
every which way her legs were moving every which way she 
was gasping for air he said 
johnny deases said ruben choked the woman until she was 
unconscious and edward then strangled her with a belt while ruben 
held the body down with his foot johnny also said he saw ruben 
have sex with the corpse 
defense lawyer stephen terrill contends ms gardner was killed 
by edward and that ruben pleaded with his brother to call an 
ambulance he also got johnny deases to admit he earlier had 
withheld evidence and lied about what happened on the night of the 
killing 
chris cox a former iowa state university football player who 
shared the rent on a west des moines apartment with eustaquio 
deases said edward ruben and johnny deases showed up at his 
apartment in the wee hours of may 29 
cox said that while johnny deases went to another room he 
freebased cocaine with edward and ruben who wanted to know what to 
do with a dead body and whether they could borrow knives rope and 
tape 
it seemed weird cox said when edward and ruben told him 
they had killed ms gardner and left the body in the bathroom of 
the apartment 
the brothers were arrested only after they told another friend 
about killing ms gardner and he alerted authorities after hearing 
news accounts about the slaying 
ruben is scheduled to testify in his own defense if convicted 
of firstdegree murder the brothers face mandatory life prison 
sentences without parole 
since the killing eustaquio has been arrested and sentenced to 
prison on a federal cocaine trafficking conviction

when the exxon valdez sailed into icy 
alaskan waters its crew included a timid helmsman a second mate 
with alleged mental problems and a captain with a history of 
drinking according to testimony at joseph hazelwoods criminal 
trial 
as the prosecution ended its second week of evidence and 
prepared to wrap up its case a picture emerged of a cohesive 
navigational team strengthened by highly educated and experienced 
officers but weakened by the troubled few 
as the case against hazelwood unwound questions were raised 
about the skippers drinking his knowledge of the crew and his 
judgment in leaving the ships bridge in the hands of others at the 
time of a tricky maneuver 
did he know that the man holding the ships wheel robert kagan 
had wellknown problems with steering did he rely too much on the 
veteran third mate gregory cousins and once the ship was 
grounded did hazelwood try a dangerous maneuver to rock it off a 
jagged reef 
the jury must decide whether any of hazelwoods actions 
constituted the reckless behavior with which he is charged 
the 43yearold hazelwood the only person criminally prosecuted 
in the nations worst oil spill is charged with seconddegree 
criminal mischief a felony and three misdemeanors reckless 
endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating a vessel 
while intoxicated 
if convicted on all charges hazelwood faces a maximum penalty 
of 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
the march 23 1989 grounding of the 987foot exxon valdez 
spilled 1092 million gallons of oil into the clear waters of 
prince william sound killing countless birds fish and wildlife 
and coating hundreds of miles of rocky coast with black goo 
as crew members formed a virtual parade to the witness stand 
their struggle to maintain loyalty to the captain while testifying 
against him was evident 
cousins who was in charge of the ship when it ran aground 
blamed the helmsman kagan for failing to follow orders and steer 
hard to the right i think mr kagan didnt really understand the 
command said cousins 
the third mate credited hazelwood with being calm and clearly in 
command after the disaster 
kagan himself conceded under oath that he had become timid 
about steering after he was once accused of chasing the 
compass or oversteering a ship 
james kunkel the chief mate graduate of prestigious kings 
point merchant marine academy and a 20year veteran of the seas 
suggested the skipper knew or should have known that helmsman 
kagan was the weak link in the ships chain of operations 
i mentioned id sailed with him before and i thought he needed 
extra supervision and extra practice in steering kunkel said 
recalling a conversation he had with hazelwood he said kagan could 
not do even the simplest tasks without being watched 
once he said he assigned kagan to paint a bulkhead but knew he 
would have to keep an eye on him to make sure he used the right 
paint and brush 
yet kunkel credited hazelwood with keeping everyone calm aboard 
ship and said he made prudent decisions in the wake of the 
grounding 
the second mate lloyd lecain said he had assessed kagans 
capabilities as slightly below normal 
i talked to capt hazelwood about it he testified he 
knew he had a problem he told me to keep an eye on him when he was 
steering 
but hazelwoods defense team immediately attacked lecains 
crediblity telling the judge that lecain was on leave from exxon 
for mental problems they asked that the jury be told that lecain 
had boasted of being a submarine commander in the falklands a 
green beret in vietnam and a figure in the irancontra affair 
defense lawyer dick madson said that when hazelwood left his 
ship after the accident lecain approached him and said he had two 
cyanide pills in case he needed to commit suicide saying he was 
ninja trained 
superior court judge karl johnstone ruled that jurors should not 
hear these allegations because they were confusing and constitued 
character evidence not permitted under alaska law 
and then there was crew member maureen jones who was the 
lookout when the exxon valdez grounded she said she saw an 
aura around the bow of the ship which she could not explain she 
described it as a greenish glow 
for hazelwood who has a history of drunken driving convictions 
and is accused of intoxication on the fateful night one fact 
mentioned by every crew member was important they said the captain 
seemed sober and in command after the accident and denied smelling 
alcohol on his breath blood and urine tests taken about 10 hours 
after the accident showed alcohol in his system and an investigator 
smelled liquor on him 
what was the captains demeanor kunkel was asked about the 
hours after the grounding 
very sullen but all business he replied cool calm in 
charge

drugs are now available that can put aids 
patients into remission and recent advances have made clear that a 
vaccine to protect against aids infection is possible a panel of 
aids experts said saturday 
at the same time however the aids epidemic is being followed 
by a suddenly resurgent epidemic of tuberculosis the scientists 
said 
we have now made demonstrable first steps in inducing 
remission said william haseltine of the danafarber cancer 
institute in boston 
i think there is evidence that a substantial number of people 
who would have died are now alive haseltine said at the annual 
meeting of the american association for the advancement of science 
he cautioned against a premature conclusion that the aids 
epidemic may be coming to an end a number of treatments for aids 
and aidsrelated infections are available he said but many of 
them are not available to the poor or to developing countries 
it looks like most of these will be expensive hard to deliver 
and require monitoring haseltine said 
unless we develop a vaccine the future of this epidemic 
worldwide will be extremely grim he said 
a year ago the prospects for an aids vaccine looked doubtful 
said james mullins of stanford university but that has changed 
there has been a transition in the effort to find a vaccine 
mullins said 
vaccines to protect animals against aidsrelated viruses have 
shown some success he said encouraging researchers to believe 
that similar vaccines can be found for humans 
theres new hope and interest that a vaccine is possible 
said john mcgowan of the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases in bethesda md 
sten vermund also of the allergy institute noted that an 
epidemic of tuberculosis is emerging in aids patients in the inner 
cities 
in new york city for example tuberculosis declined between 
1960 and 1977 but is now increasing and has reached the 1960 level 
again 
we anticipate in our major cities losing two decades of 
progress in our tuberculosis control efforts said vermund and 
unlike the aids virus which cannot be transmitted through casual 
contact tuberculosis is easily transmitted through the air 
i think we should worry about tuberculosis and the risk to the 
general population vermund said 
many of the cases of tuberculosis are occurring when individuals 
who were exposed to tuberculosis early in life contract aids they 
lose the ability to continue suppressing the tuberculosis bacteria 
which normally would have remained dormant and tuberculosis 
appears 
its likely to be yet another health problem imposed on the 
inner cities where the health problems are already legion 
vermund said there is no strong evidence yet that tuberculosis is 
spreading to a significant number of poeple who do not have aids 
but that is likely vermund said 
he said the rise in tuberculosis began before the aids epidemic 
probably because of the rise in the homeless population during the 
1970s homeless people are at elevated risk of tuberculosis 
vermund said

leftist guerrillas said they would free 
two american hostages if us diplomats negotiate conditions for 
their release a newspaper reported saturday the fate of a third 
american hostage was unknown 
the three men were captured last week when president bush met in 
colombia with three south american leaders to discuss ways to stop 
drug trafficking 
the bogota newspaper el tiempo said relatives of two of the 
americans james donnelly of detroit and david kent of 
indianapolis had been contacted in medellin where they traveled 
to gain news about the captives 
the report said the relatives were assured that donnelly and 
kent who were captured either monday or tuesday in the drug center 
of medellin were in good health and their lives will be 
respected 
the paper said the kidnappers demanded that a committee be 
formed to discuss the unspecified conditions under which the two 
hostages would be freed 
the report quoted the kidnappers as saying the panel should 
include representatives of antioquia state of which medellin is 
the capital the us embassy in bogota the colombian human rights 
comittee the red cross colombias attorney general and relatives 
of donnelly and kent 
the us embassy in bogota did not comment immediately on the 
report 
donnelly 65 a mechanical engineer and kent 40 a school 
teacher were kidnapped in medellin in separate attacks by armed 
men 
the third american the rev francisco amico ferrari of 
rochester ny was kidnapped in cali on thursday while the summit 
was held in the resort city of cartagena 450 miles to the north 
although police blamed the leftist guerrillas for the abduction 
no claim of responsibility has been received and authorities and 
amicos colleagues said no word has been received about his fate 
the guerrillas of the procastro national liberation front 
issued a statement friday night claiming responsibility for the 
abduction of donnelly and kent which the police had already blamed 
on the front 
the communique obtained by the associated press said the 
rebels kidnapped donnelly and kent to condemn the us 
intervention in latin america 
it said the bush meeting with the leaders of bolivia peru and 
colombia was part of a plan to impose military control over 
colombian territory 
the four nations agreed on a joint plan to fight drug 
trafficking 
since last year washington has played a key role in colombias 
crackdown on the medellin and cali drug cartels by extraditing 
several top drug traffickers to the united states to face federal 
charges 
referring to the us invasion of panama on dec 20 that ousted 
dictator manuel noriega the guerrilla statement said as it just 
happened in panama the objective of the plan is to impose its 
us own interests 
the statement also criticized to a us proposal to place 
american ships off colombias shores to interdict drug shipments 
the proposal was put on hold after it was criticized by colombian 
officials 
the guerrilla communique also criticized the colombian 
governments freemarket economic policies and a recently passed 
medellin law taxing citizens to raise funds for the construction of 
a subway 
the leftist insurgency aimed at establishing a marxistleninist 
state in colombia began 25 years ago authorities say the national 
libertion front and the cali and medellin drug cartels have not 
worked together in the past

walter e fauntroy the capitals nonvoting 
delegate to congress and a prospective candidate to succeed 
embattled mayor marion barry has again asked his fellow residents 
to withhold payment of their federal income taxes until the city is 
granted statehood 
fauntroy whose statehood bill lies virtually dormant in 
congress has promoted the tax disobedience strategy for weeks 
without much notice but the proposal landed him on the front page 
of the washington post on saturday and was sure to raise more than 
a few eyebrows at a time when congress and the administration are 
not in the friendliest of moods toward city officials 
fauntroy who said he is agonizing about running for mayor 
in the wake of the perjury and cocainepossession charges lodged 
against barry noted at a news conference friday that people who 
fail to file tax returns or withhold their payments could face 
fines or imprisonment 
but those of us who have decided to take this action are 
prepared to accept those consequences he said 
fauntroy and other statehood advocates have tried several 
gambits recently to revive interest in the statehood issue even as 
the citys image is bogged in municipal scandal a monumental drug 
problem and the highest murder rate in the nation 
one idea has been to post signs at the citys borders which 
read welcome to the nations last colony all residents must 
leave their rights at the border dc statehood now 
another in barrys last proposed city budget calls for the 
election of two shadow senators and a shadow congressman to 
lobby for statehood though fauntroy already effectively has that 
job in the house 
congress in 1978 did pass a constitutional amendment which if 
ratified would have granted statehood to the city but only 16 
states approved the amendment before the 7year ratification period 
expired approval from 38 states is required 
fauntroy likened his tax protest to the civil disobedience of 
the civil rights movement he said he would soon establish an 
escrow corporation to receive tax payments of fellow 
protesters and hold them until statehood is attained that 
organization he said will be called the taxation without 
representation committee 
henry b holmes a spokesman for the internal revenue service 
said that while formation of the escrow corporation would appear to 
be legal taxpayers who diverted their payments could still face 
serious penalties 
holmes noted that the us courts have consistently ruled that 
similar tax protests such as those against the vietnam war did 
not obviate criminal or civil liability for nonpayment 
with 650000 residents the district of columbia is more 
populous than alaska wyoming delaware vermont and north dakota 
while its 68 square miles is less than onetenth the size of rhode 
island 
president bush has long opposed statehood for the district 
though he favors it for puerto rico which likely would send 
republicans to congress the democratic partys national platform 
in 1988 meanwhile singled out the heavily democratic city for 
statehood a plank won by supporters of the rev jesse jackson 
despite that the democratic congress has been less than eager to 
press the issue again 
jackson himself a possible contender in the mayors race has 
acknowledged he might someday like to serve in the senate but 
denies any personal motivation for his support of dc statehood 
under limited home rule granted by congress in 1974 washington 
residents elect their own city government which levies one of the 
highest local income taxes in the nation but while they 
participate in presidential balloting their only representation in 
congress is the sole nonvoting post held by fauntroy 
the federal government annually contributes about 500 million 
to the citys 3 billion budget that payment in theory is in 
lieu of property taxes on federal lands and buildings in the city 
sen john warner rva recently called the federal subsidy a 
very hefty price and said that was why he had no use for the 
taxation without representation complaint 
i brush aside this quotation which was revered in 1776 but 
believe me it doesnt apply to the district of columbia today 
he said

striking umw member from coeburn va said friday its a good 
contract i think itll fly 
the strike has idled 1700 united mine workers members in three 
states 
kirk and the rest of the striking miners got their first look 
friday at pittstons 49page proposed contract the fouryear pact 
would give pittstons 1700 union miners in virginia west virginia 
and kentucky concessions on health care and pension benefits and 
the company more flexible work rules

contract between the union and pittston expired umw president 
richard trumka said

offer while he met friday with miners at the russell county 
fairgrounds in southwestern virginia 
im proud trumka said choking back tears im proud you

pittstons offer is a winner said charlie keen a veteran miner 
from whitewood va who attended the rally at the fairgrounds 
its better than i expected keen said i believe well be 
back to work next week theres no doubt in my mind it will be 
ratified 
i think a lot of people are relieved to hear its a good 
contract said steve powers a striking miner from clintwood va 
some people are struggling financially 
similar briefings were held for striking miners in west virginia 
and kentucky 
umw vice president cecil roberts had to coax more than 200 
members of local 5737 out of the rain and into an eastern kentucky 
elementary school to hear the contract provisions the miners were 
angered with the pacts lack of provision for taking back 13 
strikers accused of picketrelated violence 
ive glanced at it enough to know what my vote is and my vote 
is no said jerry hurley of lick creek ky 
roberts said the 13 miners were suspended not fired and their 
work status will be decided by an arbitrator 
the umws strike began april 5 the contract settlement offer 
was reached new years eve but not made public until friday while

its a good contract for our employees good for the company 
and good for the communities odom said in a statement friday 
we look forward to going back to work 
the umw is eager to get back to doing what we do best and 
thats mine coal trumka said 
wages were not a major issue in the strike but miners would 
receive a cumulative 120anhour raise at the end of three years 
topscale hourly pay in selected positions would be 1752 
pittston won the ability to hire contract truck drivers and 
maintenance workers so long as union miners are not laid off in 
the process and the company would be able to run its mines 24 
hours a day seven days a week except for christmas and the sunday 
day shift 
the umw won its demand to maintain the 100 percent medical 
coverage for employees pensioners and their families the same 
coverage provided by the 1988 national agreement 
pittston agreed to continue participation in the union pension 
plan

pigue told the washington post he and the girls mother tammy 
had doubts that the people who telephoned them wednesday with the

heart tells you that you hope it is pigue said

zulu leader mangosuthu 
buthelezi and his organization saturday lashed out at the african 
national congress and questioned anc leader nelson mandelas 
commitment to black unity 
buthelezi and the leadership of his inkatha movement accused the 
anc of trying to aggravate black political divisions their 
statements suggested that a bloody feud between the anc and the 
more conservative inkatha may persist despite the release of 
mandela who has been widely viewed a possible peacemaker 
also saturday blacks staged protest marches and rallies in 
several cities and towns across the country 
the central committee of inkatha adopted a resolution urging 
mandela not to be used by factions in the anc which are even 
now being destructively divisive when history is calling on all 
blacks to unite 
buthelezi in a separate statement said he was the target of a 
sordid and sick smear campaign by ancaligned activists aimed 
at depicting him as the main cause of the 3yearold conflict in 
natal province that has claimed more than 2500 lives 
inkatha which claims 15 million members opposes the ancs use 
of guerrilla violence and its advocacy of militant antiapartheid 
tactics such as economic sanctions and consumer boycotts the anc 
favors a partly socialist economy while inkatha backs capitalism 
on friday buthelezi became the first black leader to criticize 
mandela publicly since the anc patriarch was freed feb 11 after 27 
years in prison 
mandela made serious errors of judgment in suggesting that 
police sided with inkatha in clashes between the group and the anc 
buthelezi said he did not even pick up the phone to check my 
side of the story 
on saturday however buthelezi directed his criticism at the 
anc not at mandela personally 
buthelezi said mandela contacted him after the statement was 
issued friday and added i am entirely at ease and satisfied that 
there is still love and respect between us 
buthelezi chief minister of the tribal homeland of kwazulu 
said he hoped to meet mandela when the anc leader visited natal 
this trip could take place as soon as next weekend 
in black protests saturday police in the tribal homeland of 
ciskei reportedly fired tear gas over a large area after blocking 
protesters from a stadium a rally was planned at the stadium to 
protest the fatal shootings of several blacks by police last week 
during celebrations marking mandelas release 
in johannesburg about 1000 black postal workers jogged through 
downtown chanting in support of the anc they demanded higher 
wages and protested government moves to privatize major stateowned 
enterprises 
about 1000 youths staged a peaceful march in the cape province 
town of wellington to demand improved educational and recreational 
facilities in thokoza near johannesburg several thousand blacks 
attended a rally protesting high rents and demanding the mayors 
resignation 
in another development a group opposed to mandatory military 
service said conscription should be suspended pending an inquiry 
into charges that a secret army unit masterminded assassinations of 
antiapartheid activists 
the statement by the end conscription campaign follows 
disclosures by police investigators and in news reports about four 
former members of a johannesburg police squad who allegedly joined 
a covert army unit assigned to attack antigovernment groups one 
of the four is in custody and arrest warrant have been issued for 
the others

several hundred employees of a 
national bank ended a twoday sitin saturday to protest plans to 
close branches and cut jobs but workers threatened a strike 
involving all five national banks 
the employees at the national mortgage bank began their sitin 
strike friday and left saturday afternoon the secretarygeneral of 
the bankworkers association juan zanola said union members would 
strike all five national banks monday 
organized labor one of argentinas most powerful institutions 
appeared to be nearing an open break with the peronist party 
government it helped elect 10 months ago 
teachers demanding pay hikes threatened to boycott the start of 
classes march 5 and striking clerks who shut down federal courts 
one day last week pledged to do so again next week 
the national mortgage bank workers were protesting plans to 
close 14 branches and cut 1200 jobs 
on friday president carlos menem said of the striking bank 
employees that it will go bad for them he insisted he will go 
ahead with plans to restructure argentinas failing 
statedominated economy 
they may fatten the lines of the unemployed he said of the 
strikers 
leaders of the 3 millionmember general labor confederation 
sided with the strikers we workers support menem but we 
reject restructuring plans that include layoffs of bankworkers 
said guillermo andreoni a secretarygeneral 
menem was elected last may and took office in july his current 
confrontation with labor poses dire consequences for his plans to 
sell public companies balance the budget by reducing state 
spending and hold wage increases below price hikes as a way to 
curtail inflation 
the confederation opposes any plan that may reduce jobs and 
benefits and defends workers demands for more pay when the 
previous government tried similar measures the group responded 
with 13 general strikes 
the confederation so far has refrained from calling a general 
strike even though wages shrank by 50 percent last year and menem 
seems to have put the needs of business ahead of the demands of 
labor 
labor is disenchanted with menem who pledged during the 
campaign to raise wages increase employment and turn around the 
state sector by increasing efficiency rather than selling companies 
that were created or nationalized four decades ago by president 
juan domingo peron 
menem has said he has no choice but to impose austerity 
measures argentina no longer may borrow abroad because it stopped 
repaying its loans argentines refuse to lend money to the 
government that on jan 1 seized bank deposits printing money has 
led to hyperinflation 
the showdown with organized labor comes at a time when menems 
public approval rating has slid to 48 percent compared to 80 
percent four months ago according to a poll published several days 
ago by the respected socmer agency 
the national currency lost 28 percent of its value this week 
against the dollar bringing the australs devaluation to 51 
percent since the start of the year and 99 percent since january 
1989 
devaluation has fueled inflation that in january soared by 79 
percent and by 4924 percent in 1989 the cost of living from 
february 1989 through last month skyrocketed by 8164 percent 
wages have not kept pace a dilemma the government sought to 
alleviate by setting up soup kitchens then by handing out food 
coupons 
neither solved the problem and fears of social unrest such as 
the food riots of last may are widespread

the legality of the nations first 
hypodermic needle exchange program has been upheld by a state judge 
superior court judge robert peterson said friday there is only 
preliminary proof the program is slowing the spread of aids but 
added to wait until you get that concrete specific evidence is 
too late 
we waited a long time said david purchase founder of the 
1yearold program now we have a clear legal sanction and we 
can go about the business of saving lives 
each week health workers distribute about 2000 clean needles 
to drug users in return for used ones to prevent intravenous drug 
users who carry the aids virus from spreading it to others by 
sharing syringes 
well obviously keep on going with what we think is a 
successful program to combat aids said dr al allen director of 
the tacomapierce county health department 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact shared needles 
or syringes infected blood or blood products and from pregnant 
women to their offspring 
allen filed the lawsuit against the city of tacoma and pierce 
county last fall to test the legality of the program the health 
department was the first public agency in the nation to sponsor a 
needleexchange project 
robert rohan the departments lawyer said the case also was 
the first in the nation to test the legality of a needleexchange 
program 
although the ruling directly affects tacoma only allen said the 
decision could serve as a precedent for similar programs nationwide 
city attorney bill barker said his staff would meet with the 
city manager and city council next week to decide whether to appeal 
the ruling and whether to pay the citys 50 percent share of the 
45000ayear program 
if the ruling stands the city could participate without being 
under the threat of being charged or accused of making an 
expenditure on an unlawful or illegal program barker said 
the city withheld its share in november after state attorney 
general ken eikenberry issued an advisory nonbinding opinion 
saying needle exchange programs were illegal under state law 
the law exempts state county and municipal officers who 
distribute paraphernalia in their lawful duties and the judge 
ruled that health officials are covered by that exemption

the soviet union will block the reunification 
of germany if the west insists on nato membership for the combined 
states a top adviser to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said 
saturday 
also saturday two west german publications said chancellor 
helmut kohl and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher made 
concessions to moscow to win kremlin support for reunification last 
week 
the bonn government denied the reports which said the west 
german leaders agreed to seek immediate legal recognition of 
polands western border by a united germany and promised that east 
germany would continue to supply the soviets with muchneeded food 
and farm equipment 
in an attempt to calm soviet fears about security genscher 
saturday ruled out basing nato troops on what is now east german 
soil 
the west is agreed that with a unification of germany there 
will not be any eastward extension of nato genscher told the 
westdeutsche rundfunk radio station 
his comments conflicted to some extent with those of west german 
defense minister gerhard stoltenberg who said friday that natos 
military protections should extend without weakening to all of 
germany in the event of unification west german officials have 
said they have no intention of turning their backs on the western 
alliance 
the kremlin made its stance clear saturday 
if the western alliance sticks with its demand for a nato 
membership of all of germany then there wont be any german 
unification valentin falin said in an interview with saarland 
state radio 
falin in addition to serving as a gorbachev adviser is the 
head of the international section of the soviet communist partys 
central committee he also is a former soviet ambassador to west 
germany 
the soviet union has been hardening its stance against nato 
membership for a united germany creating an impasse that could 
slow the breakneck pace toward reuniting the states split after 
world war ii 
polands insistence on a role in guiding the process has created 
another potential stumbling block it is concerned about 
conservative west german politicans claims to prewar german 
territories that were awarded to poland by the allies after world 
war ii 
the welt am sonntag newspaper reported that kohl and genscher 
when they met with gorbachev last week promised to seek full and 
immediate legal recognition of polands western border by a unified 
germany 
a bonn government spokeswoman denied saturday that such a 
promise was made but added that it is possible this issue was 
discussed 
welt am sonntag and the influential der spiegel magazine of 
hamburg said kohl and genscher also guaranteed to the moscow 
leadership that east germanys contractual obligations to deliver 
various products to the soviet union would be upheld after 
reunification 
welt am sonntag said the products were mainly food and farm 
equipment the soviet union is heavily dependent on east germany 
for such agricultural products 
the spokeswoman denied that such an agreement was reached in 
moscow but added these issues can only be settled after the 
joining of the two german states 
der spiegel appears on the newsstands on monday and welt am 
sonntag is a sunday newspaper both provided their reports to other 
news media in advance of publication 
west germany has sought to quicken the pace of unification 
prompting east german protests that bonn has been heavyhanded in 
its dealings with its troubled neighbor 
for weeks there have been assertions that the troubled east 
german economy could soon collapse 
east germany has been hurt by the exodus of about 2000 
emigrants a day this year joining the more than 340000 who left 
last year many of them are young skilled workers 
in the financial capital of frankfurt west german economics 
minister helmut haussmann criticized east german premier hans 
modrows rejection of quick introduction of the west german mark in 
east germany 
heading back home with the west german mark in your luggage is 
one of the greatest gifts there is haussmann said referring to 
modrows trip to bonn earlier in the week 
a free marketoriented country like hungary would know how to 
appreciate such an offer haussmann added 
east germans have said they realize that unification is 
inevitable and they have been making plans to join the two 
countries and the city of berlin 
that includes east german plans to tear down a 12mile stretch 
of the berlin wall between the reichstag the former parliament 
building and the famous checkpoint charlie crossing 
the west berlin city government said the east germans will put 
up a 5foot fence along most of the stretch but leave open a 
200yard section near the brandenburg gate the work is to start on 
monday 
east germanys communist leaders began opening the wall last 
nov 9 in response to the exodus of east germans and the growing 
street rallies demanding democratic reforms 
a group of about 1000 west germans held their own street rally 
in frankfurt saturday and clashed with police in a demonstation 
against an extreme rightist party 
several police officers and 27 demonstrators were injured in the 
clashes police said the demonstrators threw rocks bottles and 
fireworks the protesters demanded that the ultrarightist national 
democratic party be outlawed

expelled former president gustav husak former premier lubomir 
strougal and other members it said had given communism a bad name

gave up its monopoly on power is to compete in free elections 
in addition to husak and strougal 18 other former officials

political responsibility of former senior party officials for the 
crisis development in the past they were announced following a

power

majority in parliament following the revolution it also has lost 
credibility and prestige among the people and is expected to face a 
tough campaign in free elections tentatively scheduled for june 8 
husak became party chief in 1969 following the sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia in august 1968 
he was replaced as head of the party by milos jakes in december 
1987 but continued as president of czechoslovakia a post he lost 
during the revolution to playwright vaclav havel once the nations 
leading dissident 
strougal resigned as premier on oct 11 1988 following party 
criticism of his work 
the party suspended the memberships of husak strougal and 30 
other former party officials in december

the nose rings are brass bronze or stainless steel giving them 
lasting value usually 2 to 3 inches in diamater they are inserted 
in the flesh between the nostrils when the bull is about 1 year 
old cattle owners have long used the rings in the sensitive noses 
to control ornery bulls 
about the only one who ever removes a ring from a bull is the 
butcher my farmer friend says said mauldin in a recent 
interview 
she has bought the rings at auctions for 2 or so the rings 
sell at her shop for as much as 5 
ive found them in a box of tools at auctions and ive had 
people bring them in wondering if i had a use for the rings she 
said i want those that are used i wouldnt have any use for a 
new one 
people who decorate with country items use the bull rings as 
wall decorations according to mauldin 
the pure country enthusiast would not polish the ring they 
dont want it to shine or look new she said 
nostalgia also is a selling point especially for customers who 
grew up on farms they exclaim i know what this is mauldin

los angeles ap former president reagan spent a second day 
in court saturday testifying about the irancontra affair that 
mired the final two years of his presidency 
reagan flanked by secret service agents emerged from a federal 
courtroom at 210 pm and headed down a back stairwell after 
completing approximately eight hours of videotaped testimony over 
two days 
reagan who had entered the downtown federal courthouse smiling 
and waving earlier in the day smiled broadly as his limousine 
pulled out of the courthouse parking garage as he has before 
reagan ignored reporters questions 
reagan testified before us district judge harold greene in 
connection with the trial of his former national security adviser 
john poindexter 
poindexter is accused of concealing his former aide oliver 
norths assistance to the nicaraguan contra rebels and lying about 
a 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
poindexter declined comment as he climbed into a taxi after the 
session but answered no when asked if he would be returning to 
the courthouse for more testimony 
testimony is finished thats all i can tell you said his 
lawyer richard beckler 
later reagans spokesman mark weinberg issued a news release 
saying the former president had cooperated and hadnt asserted 
executive privilege 
since he first learned of the irancontra matter and 
immediately told the american people about it president reagan has 
cooperated fully with all of the attendant investigative and 
judicial proceedings the statement read 
president reagan testified fully and completely in response to 
questions posed by counsel for adm poindexter and the irancontra 
independent counsel president reagan agreed to the videotaped 
deposition and did not assert executive privilege the statement 
concluded 
reagan was allowed to give his videotaped depositions at a 
courtroom near his belair area home rather than in washington 
where the proceedings against poindexter are to begin march 5 
security was especially rigorous for the extraordinary twoday 
session federal marshals and secret service agents kept the media 
some 40 feet away from reagan as he entered and left the courtroom 
friday reporters were allowed only a bit closer saturday 
although the depositiontaking was closed to the public greene 
said the videotapes would be released within a few days after 
editing of issues deemed to involve national security 
over the two days the former president answered 154 questions 
about his role in the irancontra affair the failed 
armsforhostages deal during reagans second term 
the questions were drawn from 183 submitted to the court by 
beckler who was allowed followup questions if necessary however 
the judge prohibited poindexters attorney from raising additional 
questions on new subjects 
i think he was very fair in his testimony beckler said 
poindexter sought the testimony to bolster his contention that 
his secret activities had been authorized by reagan 
although the judge hasnt made the specific questions public he 
said they fell into several broad categories such as the extent of 
reagans knowledge of the shipment of missiles to iran and reagans 
understanding of legislation that temporarily barred us aid to 
the contras 
reagan said early in 1987 that he hadnt known about secret 
bank accounts and diverted funds two products of the irancontra 
affair that he said he found personally distasteful he told 
the tower commission which was appointed to investigate the 
affair he didnt know national security council staffers were 
assisting the contras 
poindexter later told congress he believed reagan understood 
that col north was instrumental in keeping the contras supported 
without maybe understanding the details of exactly what he was 
doing

a soviet environmental group has asked the 
us government to protect the habitat for sandhill cranes when it 
considers relicensing the kingsley dam on nebraskas platte river 
alexander mischenko deputy chairman of the soviet association 
for ecology and peace said in a letter to the federal energy 
regulatory commission that the platte river habitat is a primary 
staging area for the cranes about 10 percent of them nest in 
siberia following their spring migration from the united states 
the soviet made their appeal at the urging of the us chapter 
of friends of the earth 
brent blackwelder vice president for policy for friends of the 
earth called the soviet move unprecedented and a sign of the 
growing recognition that environmental issues often transcend 
political boundaries 
us environmental groups have urged federal energy regulatory 
commission to place conditions on the longterm licenses sought by 
central nebraska public power and irrigation district and the 
nebraska public power district to operate the dam two other power 
plants and a steam plant 
applications for those licenses will be submitted may 5 
the environmentalists say the dam has held back too much water 
from the platte river threatening the habitat of 300 species of 
migratory birds including six endangered species and the sandhill 
cranes 
the longterm licenses for the districts expired in 1987 and 
they have operated on annual licenses since then on wednesday the 
federal commission placed conditions on nebraska public power 
districts interim license concerning habitat development and flows 
in the platte river 
at first i thought when i heard it soviet intervention in the 
relicensing that it was a joke said frank dragoun manager of 
the power and irrigation district 
he said that although sandhill cranes arent hunted in nebraska 
they are hunted legally in eight or nine other states with 14000 
to 16000 killed annually 
power district spokesman wayne jacobsen said the sovietss 
intervention in the relicensing issue looks like it might make an 
interesting legal problem for somebody to straighten out 
ken strom manager of the national audubon societys sanctuary 
along the platte river between kearney and gibbon said the 
international interest in the river shouldnt come as a surprise 
we and anyone involved in habitat on the river realize its 
not just a nebraska resource but a national and international 
resource he said 
sandhill and whooping cranes that rest and feed along the river

that forced 600 nearby residents from their homes 
the fire at tyre king recycling which contains between 12 
million and 14 million tires broke out monday and investigators 
have blamed arson 
ontario officials said there was no health hazard outside the

lake erie and 60 miles north of erie ohio which lies across the 
lake 
about 40 firefighters were working to bring the blaze under 
control some environmental experts say it could burn for months

a freight train derailed near this small 
town saturday morning sparking a huge fireball and forcing the 
evacuation of several families living nearby authorities said 
nobody was reported injured in the accident shortly before 830 
am said mike cox spokesman for the state department of public 
safety he said the derailment of 24 cars caused quite an 
explosion the cause wasnt immediately known 
the train was reported carrying liquid propane and other 
hazardous materials cox said he said there was a possibility some 
of the material would leak into a creek but other authorities 
discounted the possibility 
fearing further explosions firefighters decided ot allow the 
fire to burn itself out 
doug fogg corsicana police departments assistant fire chief 
said it was common practice to allow derailment fires to extinguish 
themselves 
the three crewmembers who werent identified were given drug 
tests a standard procedure following train accidents 
curtis rash mayor of this town of 200 about 45 miles south of 
dallas said he was about two miles away when the blast occurred 
it looked like napalm going off he said it was a ball of 
fire about 100 feet in diameter it rose up in the air about 100 
feet or so 
the wreckage continued burning past noon and huge black plumes 
of smoke could be seen for 15 miles reporters and other 
nonresidents were being kept out of the area 
the 44car train bound for houston from tulsa okla lost its 
last 24 cars on a curve said john grundmann superintendent of 
operations for fort worthbased burlington northern which owns the 
train 
a commercial cleanup team from nearby corsicana arrived shortly 
before noon to begin removing the wreckage the texas railroad 
commission and state water commission dispatched investigators to 
the derailment 
fear of more explosions kept five public safety department teams 
from approaching the site and forced evacuations of fewer than a 
dozen families in a rural section of emhouse the evacuation area 
was scaled back later in the day and all but three or four families 
were allowed to return 
cox said the authorities at the site believed some of the 
hazardous liquids were leaking into chambers creek which feeds 
feeds lake corsicana and the richland creek reservoir which 
supplies water to many navarro county residents 
but rash said the creek is about 400 yards from the accident 
scene and said he doesnt believe the leaking materials would be 
able to reach the water and charles gazda chief of the emergency 
branch of the environmental protection agency in dallas said as 
far as he knew nothing spilled in the creek that would cause any 
significant problem 
the mayor said that despite the mammoth fireball the explosion 
wasnt extraordinarily loud 
when we went around to evacuate those who lived nearest there 
thy were still sleeping he said they didnt even wake up 
the nearest residents were about a quartermile from the 
derailment scene

former president carter revealed saturday 
that he tried to persuade panamanian ruler manuel noriega to step 
down after that countrys may presidential election which was 
widely considered fraudulent 
carter who served as an unofficial election observer tried to 
negotiate with noriega on may 8 a day after the election said 
robert pastor who was carters national security adviser on latin 
america from 1977 to 1981 
i negotiated with noriega through an intermediary all through 
that day and i tried to convince him noriega could be a hero 
that all of his problems would be over carter told the peace 
prize forum at augsburg college 
i had the authority this is the first time ive ever said 
this publicly to tell noriega you can stay on as commander in 
chief until september 1989 when the new president takes over 
you will not be extradited to the united states you can stay in 
panama if you wish after you step down as commander in chief 
carter recalled 
i think he considered this very carefully about 2 oclock 
monday afternoon may 8 it became apparent to me that noriega 
decided to steal the election he refused to communicate with me 
any more carter said 
carter left saturdays conference which was attended by an 
estimated 3400 college students and others without saying who had 
given him the authority to negotiate with noriega 
noriega who held ultimate power in panama as military 
commander is accused of trying to steal the election for his 
handpicked candidate international observers said the opposition 
really won by a 31 margin but noriega annulled the results 
noriega surrendered to the united states after this countrys 
invasion of panama last year and is in custody in miami awaiting 
trial on drugtrafficking charges 
pastor reached saturday night at his home in georgia declined 
to say who gave carter permission to negotiate with noriega 
i think i would like to leave it as saying he consulted with 
senior levels of the us government said pastor an emory 
university professor and director of the latin american program at 
the carter center at emory 
through tabulations made by the roman catholic church pastor 
said he and carter determined early the day after the election that 
the opposition had beaten noriegas candidate he and carter tried 
to contact several senior military officials and subsequently 
noriega to arrange a meeting pastor said 
in the meantime carter met with the opposition leadership 
current panamanian president guillermo endara and vice presidents 
ricardo arias and guillermo ford 
they encouraged carter to get directly in touch with noriega 
to try to arrange a peaceful transition pastor said we later 
learned that noriega had gotten the message and was just too afraid 
to meet with carter 
after noriega failed to respond carters staff informed him 
they would give him an hour to do so before carter would hold a 7 
pm news conference to denounce the election as a fraud pastor 
said

a federal welfare experiment would deny some job 
training opportunities to about 10000 poor people in 10 states to 
see how well they do without them a newspaper reported saturday 
texas welfare officials have questioned the ethics of the 
experiment and refused to participate according to the dallas 
morning news 
the experiment is intended to evaluate the job opportunities and 
basic skill training program which requires some people on welfare 
to apply either for education or training programs or lose benefits 
the experiment would reject some people who normally would have 
received training forming a control group and compare their 
experience over several years with those who participate in the 
program 
government officials say this kind of experiment is the only way 
to determine if the training programs will work even if it means 
some people are denied job training opportunities 
federal officials hope to have 10 states participate in the 
experiment arkansas california and oklahoma have expressed an 
interest 
but some state officials including those in texas are 
uncomfortable with the ethical dilemma of randomly forcing some 
people out of potentially helpful programs in the name of science 
the paper said 
we told them we would not take part said claudia langguth 
deputy commissioner for the client selfsupport services division 
of the texas department of human services my staff told me it 
would require a very large control group of several thousand 
people 
federal officials have focused new attention to the ethics of 
welfare experiments on feb 12 us health and human services 
secretary louis sullivan killed a federal study that would have 
denied about 800 texans access to extended medical coverage and 
child care 
officials also told ohio that a similar study of new medicaid 
benefits in that state would likely be canceled the paper said 
martin gerry assistant secretary for planning and evaluation 
for hhs said the although the value of medicaid and child care 
programs are generally accepted the benefits of jobs programs are 
still being weighed therefore the need for a precise experiment is 
greater he said 
i dont see here yet any real disadvantage to the person who 
is not picked to go into jobs gerry said 
jobs was created by the family support act of 1988 it requires 
states to have specific educational and job training programs for 
people who are or are likely to become longterm welfare 
recipients 
the law set aside 500000 a year to pay for controlbased 
experiments to evaluate the program 
in states included in the experiment a small percentage of 
those who meet the guidelines for inclusion into jobs will be 
randomly rejected and placed in a control group their ability to 
find work will be compared to those in the jobs program 
the experiments results will be used to adjust the program 
federal officials said

cubas hardline communist party called for a 
party congress next year the official cuban news agency said 
saturday in a dispatch that hinted the party will consider economic 
and political reforms 
cubas fidel castro has remained one of the communist worlds 
staunchest stalinist holdouts and has criticized the democratic 
reforms that have swept out old guard communist leaders in eastern 
europe over the past year 
while saturdays prensa latina dispatch was the first indication 
that cuba is willing to consider change the report said the 
communists also reaffirmed revolutionary principles and cited a 
need to strengthen cubas defense 
the dispatch came less than a month after castro declared on 
jan 28 that cuba would stick to orthodox communism even if its 
longtime ally the soviet union cut off 5 billion a year in aid 
he also said he would brook no political liberalizations and 
rejected a petition for recognition by an opposition party based in 
miami 
the us state department in washington had no independent 
knowledge of saturdays report and could not comment said an 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the communist party central committee said friday that on march 
15 it would announce the date of next years party congress prensa 
latina reported in the dispatch monitored in mexico city 
the members of the high body studied an analysis made by the 
political bureau about fundamental problems that should be tackled 
by the fourth party congress that need to be debated and 
adopted prensa latina said quoting cubas official communist 
party daily granma 
at fridays meeting the committee promised to improve results 
in the process of correcting the sphere of economic and social 
development such as in the political conscience of the country 
it said 
the news agency said the central committee also reaffirmed its 
support for castro who came to power in 1959 
there is agreement that conditions have matured enough to 
tackle in practical and concrete terms as to perfect the political 
system in the country prensa latina said 
despite indicating a willingness to consider reforms the 
dispatch said the cuban government remains committed to its 
fundamental policies 
analyzing these realities in light of the situation of 
socialism on the world level the meeting concluded that if cuba 
has been able to maintain itself despite certain errors it was due 
to our sticking to a revolutionary policy prensa latina said 
it should remain clear that this critical analysis will not 
question cubas principles and will discuss how to make more 
perfect a united leninist party based on democratic centralism 
it said 
prensa latina apparently referred to the us invasion of panama 
in december as a reason to maintain its defenses 
facing the crisis of socialism and the aggressive euphoria of 
american imperialism we need to continue strengthening our 
defenses and preparing the people to resist and conquer any 
aggression 
it is necessary to analyze the immediate and longterm goals 
of the revolution we will follow the light of our principles 
without ever responding to external pressures the dispatch said 
cuba is heavily dependent on soviet economic aid and there have 
been signs the assistance is being pared 
us sources last year said there had been substantial 
reductions in soviet aid to cuba as evidenced in the marked decline 
in the purchase of sugar which the soviet union buys from cuba at 
prices substantially higher than world market levels as a form of 
subsidy 
during a visit to havana in april soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev made no move to ease cubas debt burden which last year 
was estimated at between 8 billion and 12 billion cubas debt to 
western nations was believed to be about 6 billion 
castro in the past has expressed disapproval of gorbachevs 
domestic reforms as leaning too much toward capitalism 
the cuban revolution will not back down one millimeter not 
even if it is totally blockaded by the united states or if the 
soviet union totally cuts off its supplies he said last month

obscenity charges were issued against a 
satellite adultmovie channel and three other companies including 
gte corp over broadcasts of what officials described as hardcore 
sex movies 
four companies and 10 people were indicted by a county grand 
jury over the movies which authorities said were picked up on home 
satellite dishes and in some cases recorded and shared by 
teenagers 
among those named in the 18count indictment unsealed friday 
were gte corp of stamford conn a subsidiary gte spacenet inc 
of mclean va us satellite inc of murray utah and home dish 
satellite networks inc of new york city also known as the 
exxxtasy channel 
the names of the individuals charged were withheld because they 
hadnt been served with court papers said montgomery county 
district attorney jimmy evans 
the charges involve allegedly obscene videos with titles such as 
hardcore girlfriends and fantasy chamber that were beamed 
into alabama on the american exxxtasy channel 
colette connor vice president of advertising and promotion for 
home dish satellite network denied wrongdoing 
the movies that we broadcast as far as we know have never 
been judged obscene she said 
barbara foelbar manager of corporate communications for gte 
spacenet said as a communications common carrier regulated by 
the federal communications commission we have no authority to 
censor what customers use our satellite to transmit 
an attorney for us satellite inc said he hadnt seen the 
indictments and couldnt comment on them 
an investigation of the transmissions began about a year ago 
after evans office received complaints from parents whose children 
were buying copies of adult movies at school 
the movies had been taped by other students off satellite dish 
transmissions he said 
gov guy hunt and the governors of utah virginia and new york 
will be asked to arrange extradition of those defendants to 
alabama the prosecutor said 
evans said that for 150 anyone with a satellite dish code 
number and descrambler could subscribe to american exxxstasy for 
six months he said his investigators began taping the material and 
found it contained graphic sex scenes which he called hardcore 
obscenity and clearly a violation of the antiobscenity act 
that law approved by the legislature in may expanded the 
definition of obscene materials to include telephone and electronic 
communications 
evans said he sought federal cooperation in the prosecution on 
grounds the defendants may have violated federal obscenity statutes 
the mother of a porn star who committed suicide in 1984 after 
two years of making movies came to montgomery to testify before the 
grand jury 
karen applegate of burnsville minn said some of the movies 
made by her daughter colleen are still shown on the exxxtasy 
channel 
the only reason im here is to get rid of my daughters 
films and stop the men who use her she said those men made 
money off her before her death they dont have to after 
the charges carry a maximum penalty of 36 years in prison and a 
540000 fine against each defendant the state also could seize 
property and profits which evans said could amount to millions of 
dollars

rival protestant and roman 
catholic soccer fans rioted at a match saturday and police said 
they fired plastic bullets into the stands to stop the disturbance 
fortyeight police officers and 15 civilians were injured and 
one officer and one civilian hospitalized police said 
the violence spread from the stadium to surrounding streets and 
fans hijacked buses and set them on fire a statement from the 
royal ulster constabulary said 
in other incidents later police said a bomb exploded near an 
army vehicle in southwest belfast slightly injuring two soldiers 
on patrol a second bomb exploded 10 minutes later in a parking 
area at the greenan lodge hotel in the west of the city after an 
anonymous warning that allowed police to evacuate the building in 
time no injures were reported at the hotel 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for either blast 
the violence at the stadium was the worst in years at a soccer 
game in northern ireland sports events are usually free of the 
fighting between protestants and the roman catholic minority that 
has torn other areas of life in the british province security 
forces had feared trouble at the game a firstround match in the 
bass irish cup competition so it was delayed 25 minutes until the 
spectators were seated 
the police who said many fans were under the influence of 
drink had formed a barrier between supporters of the linfield 
team which has a tradition of having only protestant players and 
donegal celtic a team based in a catholic neighborhood of west 
belfast 
police said one linfield supporter got onto the field and 
attacked a celtic player and serious public disorder continued 
in donegal celtics area 
officers were pelted with bottles and stones and had to use riot 
shields to protect themselves police said 
the officers eventually charged fans in the donegal celtic area 
to keep from being overrun by the crowd and had to fire plastic 
bullets to repel the sustained attack the royal ulster 
constabulary said 
trouble flared again at half time and continued sporadically 
during the remainder of the match which linfield won 21 
after the game as the donegal celtic supporters made their 
way home through west belfast they hijacked four buses and set 
them on fire the police statement said 
officers fired more plastic bullets to disperse those crowds it 
said 
the statement also said a bomb had been discovered in an empty 
house convenient to where police would have been taking up duty 
to see these supporters through the area it was being defused 
and no one had claimed responsibility police said 
the soccer match had been drawn to be played at the donegal 
celtic ground in the heart of catholic west belfast but the irish 
football association fearing trouble switched it to windsor park 
northern irelands international soccer ground which is also home 
to linfield 
celtic failed in a high court bid to have the match switched to 
a neutral spot

reuters which announced it will end its news 
picture agreement with united press international continued to 
supply photos on saturday to upi amid a public flap between the two 
news services 
under a 10year agreement begun in january 1985 upi has been 
supplying reuters with news pictures from the united states while 
reuters supplied upi with news pictures from abroad 
on friday reuters abruptly stopped sending photos to upi 
saying it was dissatisfied with the quality of photographs supplied 
by upi and intended to start its own us photo coverage it 
resumed sending photographs to upi after upi threatened a lawsuit 
we told them they were way out of line through our 
attorneys upi vice chairman joe taussig said friday 
he added that reuters offered to turn the service back on if upi 
would agree not to sue for breach of contract upi made no 
agreement and is still considering legal action taussig said 
taussig said the original agreement calls for either service to 
give 10 days notice of intent to terminate 
but on saturday milt capps the senior vice president for 
corporate affairs at upi said earlier comments about the 10day 
period may have been in error 
he said upi lawyers are reviewing the contract to determine if 
reuters had violated it 
upi is considering restarting its own international photo 
coverage and also studying a photo exchange agreement with other 
foreign news service agencies capps said 
reuters said it restarted the service friday night after a 
senior upi official called and asked that the service be resumed 
temporarily 
capps said no senior upi official had made such a request 
andrew m nibley editor of reuters america said in a statement 
released early saturday at their request this evening we agreed 
to temporarily continue providing them with nonus pictures 
however we will no longer be using upi pictures 
we will be covering the united states with our own resources 
to ensure a quality service to our subscribers in the united states 
and abroad 
the dispute between the two news services started friday when 
reuters issued a news release announcing it was ending its 
agreement with upi and starting up its own news photo network in 
the united states 
in addition reuters filed a lawsuit to recoup money it says it 
lost on the agreement the company didnt say what those claims 
might total 
it has not been an easy decision its essentially a quality 
issue we do not want their pictures said robert a crooke a 
spokesman for reuters america 
as to why reuters was providing photographs to upi he said 
this is simply giving them some continued international coverage 
for a limited amount of time 
in a statement released friday before the service was restored 
upi said the abrupt cancellation of the photo exchange was 
unjustified and without regard for the interest of both companies 
subscribing newspapers 
upi chairman earl w brian said the news service is outraged 
at the sneak termination of the reuters international picture 
service for which there was no basis whatever 
upi is owned by infotechnology inc a holding company with 
interests in scientific and information ventures which completed 
acquisition of the company that controls the news service in march 
1989 from mexican publisher mario vazquez rana upi lost 16 
million in 1988 and 25 million in 1987 
reuters presently supplies news photographs directly to 20 
united states newspapers and 500 newspapers around the world 
crooke said

aflcio leaders are using their annual winter 
trek to florida as a strategy summit designed to help unions regain 
bargaining clout lost in the 1980s and to bolster the chances of 
laborsupported candidates and legislation heading into 1990 
elections 
union chiefs gathering in bal harbour will try to capitalize on 
the unity and renewed fighting spirit many said has been felt 
following successful strikes in 1989 by appalachia coal miners and 
telephone workers in the northeast where unions won on key 
bargaining points 
it was one of the most traumatic decades for organized labor 
it was ushered in with union busting but ushered out by union 
building said jan pierce vice president of the communications 
workers of america in charge of the new york region 
the pittston coal strike served as a rallying point for 
organized labor at one point before a tentative settlement was 
reached new years eve some 46000 coal workers in 10 states 
walked off their jobs in sympathy strikes 
theres a new spirit of solidarity unions are again living up 
to the credo that an injury to one is an injury to all pierce 
said 
also on this weeks agenda for the aflcios executive council 
is the second meeting between the 33member board and labor 
secretary elizabeth dole meetings with several prominent officials 
of the democratic party one of labors traditional allies and 
domestic and international issues 
abortion is expected to dominate much of the behindthescenes 
maneuvering though aflcio president lane kirkland has already 
said a vote on prochoice resolutions will be skipped and instead a 
committee will study whether the 141 million member federation 
should take a stand 
recent labor department statistics show that union membership 
has remained fairly constant since 1985 at about 17 million but 
the percentage of the workforce that is unionized has dropped to 
about 16 percent meaning that labor is not bringing in new 
members to match the rapid growth of the workforce in 1985 for 
instance 18 percent of the workforce belonged to unions 
aflcio spokesman rex hardesty said union officials realize that 
future organizing drives will have to center around issues such as 
health care that employers are reluctant to provide 
we bottomed out in the 1980s and it was just brutal but 
weve gotten up off the floor hardesty said 
still others noted that unions suffered their share of setbacks 
last year such as the machinists walkout at eastern airlines 
the strike which continues was dealt a major blow last 
november when pilots and flight attendants ended sympathy strikes 
their defection followed president bushs veto of legislation 
establishing a special congressional panel to propose a solution to 
the strike 
a whole bunch of workers got kicked around a lot were not 
out of the woods yet in the face of all the monkey wrenches 
that can be thrown at us we still have a rotten situation said 
paul booth organizing director for the american federation of 
state county and municipal employees 
booth and others contend the bush administration is following 
former president reagans antiunion lead by allowing employers to 
intimidate workers who try to organize 
many labor leaders felt reagan who fired striking air traffic 
controllers in 1981 and effectively killed their union was the 
worst president of the century for organized labor 
union officials will continue efforts for a warmer relationship 
with the bush administration as mrs dole visits with council 
members tuesday 
also on labor leaders mind this week will be the upcoming 1990 
elections as a steady stream of political heavyweights make

federal tax officials are using new auditing 
powers to investigate the american subsidiaries of japanese 
companies they suspect have underpaid corporate income taxes by 
billions of dollars according to a published report 
the new york times reported in its sunday editions that while 
foreignowned assets in the united states more than tripled in 10 
years to 18 billion and gross income of foreign firms here more 
than doubled the amount of taxes paid didnt change much 
data compiled by the internal revenue service indicates that of 
36000 foreignowned companies more than half didnt report any 
reported taxable income 
tax officials say subsidiaries underestimate their earnings to 
reduce their tax liability by manipulating transactions with parent 
companies the times said 
but the government often thwarted in its efforts to review the 
records of such companies is now armed with a new law that gives 
the irs broad authority to assess taxes on foreignowned firms that 
fail to promptly comply for requests for records or testimony 
we dont target a particular country for enforcement 
charles s triplett deputy associate chief counsel of the tax 
agency told the times nonetheless its pretty clear that the 
japanese do a lot of business here and have many us subsidiaries 
acting as distributors of manufactured goods 
the japan tax association said the irs was partly to blame 
because it had failed to establish concrete guidelines for 
determining the right price of transactions between branches of a 
multinational company 
tadashi iwashita a financial counselor at the japanese embassy 
in washington dc said japanese firms try to comply with us 
tax laws 
one unidentified irs official told the times the agency suspects 
that underpayments amount to at least 12 billion

residents lined up against mayor richard m 
daleys plan to build a third airport in chicago voicing concern 
that their neighborhoods would be eliminated by his proposal 
isnt there some other place he could put this thing some 
other place than this town resident mary ann kolojay asked 
the plan would virtually obliterate her hegewisch neighborhood 
on chicagos far southeast side 
hegewisch an old steel mill neighborhood separated from the 
city by stretches of landfills factories and vacant lots is one 
of two neighborhoods and two suburbs where 6700 homes and 47 
businesses would be demolished to make way for the proposed lake 
calumet airport 
we have all this land everywhere and they still have to 
flatten this town kolojay said while working a cash register at 
a local food store 
why not bridgeport said resident mike hennessy referring 
to daleys neighborhood 
daley said the 49 billion project would rejuvenate an area 
impoverished over the last decade by the decline of the mills and 
other industry he said the airport would generate 200000 jobs and 
137 billion in annual revenue 
the airport scheduled to open in 2010 would be 20 percent 
larger than ohare international airport on the citys far 
northwest side and 15 times the size of midway airport southwest 
of chicago 
ohare has been criticized by federal officials as being 
overcrowded and the cause of national travel delays the question 
of a third airport has been under debate for months and four other 
sites have been proposed 
federal transportation secretary samuel k skinner and illinois 
gov james r thompson said that daleys proposal unveiled 
thursday will be considered with the others 
we are a long way from having a third airport said gregory 
baise chairman of a threestate committee conducting a 6 million 
study to pick a rural south suburban site i would view daleys 
plan very skeptically

japan held parliamentary elections sunday that put 
the scandalplagued governing liberal democratic party to its 
toughest test in decades 
a controversial sales tax and sex and influencepeddling 
scandals have dogged prime minister toshiki kaifus party for 
nearly two years forcing the resignation of two prime ministers 
on saturday hundreds of candidates wearing white gloves to 
symbolize clean politics held final campaign rallies and the issue 
was on the minds of some voters 
the consumption tax and cleaning up politics are the most 
important issues in this election said a middleaged woman 
coming out of a voting booth who declined to give her name 
but masaru oshima 48 said although opposition parties are 
gaining support their policies are unclear and their leadership 
untested he said he voted for the liberal democrats 
polls indicated that the large number of uncommitted voters 
could hurt the liberal democratic party which has ruled japan 
since 1955 the conservative party needed to win at least 257 seats 
in the 512seat lower house of parliament to retain its majority 
and win the right to name the prime minister 
the liberal democrats hold 295 seats in the outgoing house to 
83 for the main opposition the socialist party 
a victory for the socialists could lead to japan having its 
first female prime minister 61yearold socialist chairwoman 
takako doi 
polls opened at 700 am 5 pm est saturday and were to 
close 11 hours later partial election results were expected later 
sunday but final results were not expected until monday afternoon 
mild winter weather across the country was expected to 
contribute to an unusually high voter turnout polls predicted 80 
percent of japans 90 million eligible voters would cast ballots 
a poll released saturday by the nationwide asahi shimbun 
newspaper reaffirmed earlier surveys showing the liberal democrats 
leading the socialists by about 20 percentage points 
but 322 percent of the 103200 people surveyed said they had 
not decided which party they supported the newspaper did not 
provide a margin of error for the survey conducted feb 89 and 
1112 
ms doi said sunday she was confident that people will move 
the mountain a second time referring july elections for the less 
powerful upper house of parliament in which the governing party 
lost its majority for the first time in 34 years that chamber is 
now controlled by a socialistled coalition 
outside his tokyo residence kaifu told reporters its up to 
the judgment of the people but im certain that the liberal 
democratic partys policies are generally accepted by the people 
both leaders voted earlier by absentee ballots 
at a rally saturday kaifu urged several thousand people at 
tokyos shinjuku station not to be swayed by the opposition 
he accused the socialists of being unclear on their position on 
defense and said a comment by ms doi that such issues could be 
worked out overnight after the election was irresponsible 
we cant allow someone who does things overnight to take over 
this precious country he said 
in an effort to win support from conservatives the socialists 
watered down their longstanding opposition to the usjapan 
security treaty under which the united states bases 50000 troops 
in japan but opposition to the treaty remains party policy giving 
the conservatives an opening to accuse socialists of weakening 
japans security 
the liberal democrats had a disastrous year in 1989 caused by 
scandal and the passage of the unpopular 3 percent sales tax in 
april 
also in april prime minister noboru takeshita resigned to 
accept responsibility for an influencepeddling scandal in which 
politicians profited from sales of cutrate stock shares supplied 
by the recruit co conglomerate 
takeshitas replacement sousuke uno lasted only two months and 
was plagued by allegations of extramarital affairs 
he quit after the sex scandal and sales tax cost the liberal 
democrats their majority in the upper house in the july election 
the party also lost farmers support for partly opening 
agricultural markets to imports 
ms doi urged several thousand people at a rally in the western 
tokyo suburb of hachioji to show you believe the consumption tax 
and money politics are unforgivable 
kaifu 59 urged voters not to base their decisions solely on 
the sales tax and promised the liberal democrats would not allow 
another recruit scandal 
the ldp will repeat right policies but we will never repeat 
wrongdoings he said 
the uno scandal and the sales tax which was particularly 
disliked by housewives who do most of the family shopping gave 
women in this maledominated society a new voice in politics the 
womens vote was said to have played a large part in the liberal 
democrats election loss in july 
the liberal democrats fielded 338 candidates socialists 149 
komeito clean government party 58 japan communist party 131 
democratic socialist party 44 united social democratic party 6 
and the progressive party 7 there were 64 candidates from minor 
parties and 156 running as independents

federal investigators said friday they 
smashed a pirate video movie ring that produced 1500 illegal 
videocassettes a week for distribution to rental stores in the 
northeast 
the investigation described by film industry officials as the 
most damaging operation ever against video bootlegers led to the 
arrests of seven people in new jersey and new york in raids 
thursday night said gary penrith acting special agent in charge 
of the fbis newark office 
during those raids he said agents discovered a video 
duplicating lab in a home in the new york borough of queens packed 
with 78 stateoftheart video recorders and about 2000 copies of 
video movies popular in the rental market 
agents also found what they believe to be a distribution center 
in a private home that manufactured phony labels and boxes for the 
videos and shipped them to stores in the northeast officials said 
for us this series of seizures in new york and new jersey 
represents the toughest crackdown ever on video piracy said mark 
harrad an attorney and investigator who worked with federal agents 
on the case for the motion picture association of america 
weve had bigger seizures but the discovery of the labs and 
distribution centers are really the most significant thing he 
said 
neither the fbi nor the motion picture association could provide 
an estimate of how much money the bootleg ring cost the industry 
authorities believe the queens lab was producing at least 1500 
illegal videocassettes a week said jack valenti president of the 
movie association 
arrested in new york were julio larraquente owner of video 
latino and sarita feldman owner of latin video both in the new 
york borough of brooklyn

a coast guard investigator said joseph 
hazelwood smelled of alcohol but otherwise did not appear drunk the 
night his exxon valdez went aground causing the nations worst oil 
spill 
mark delozier one of the first officers to board the exxon 
valdez after it rammed a reef last march 24 testified friday that 
he called for someone to administer blood and urine tests to the 
crew after first encountering hazelwood and smelling liquor on his 
breath 
but delozier said his message to coast guard headquarters was 
misinterpreted and a state police officer was dispatched with a 
different mission 
he was under the impression he was supposed to come out to the 
ship to take ahold of an unruly drunk delozier said noting the 
officer brought no testing equipment 
i was disgusted at the fact that we had already waited a few 
hours and now he was going to be of no use to us he said noting 
that the passage of time meant alcohol could dissipate from blood 
and urine 
but delozier acknowledged that hazelwood seemed coordinated and 
showed no sign of being intoxicated other than the smell of his 
breath 
delozier said hazelwood had a very intense and very obvious 
smell of liquor about him and was trying to hide it by covering his 
mouth and drinking coffee 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is charged with one felony 
count of seconddegree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of 
reckless endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating a 
vessel while intoxicated if convicted the former tanker skipper 
could draw up to 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines 
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled from the exxon 
valdez into prince william sound on march 24 killing countless 
birds fish and wildlife and blackening hundreds of miles of rocky 
shore 
delozier who boarded the ship about 3 hours after it ran 
aground on bligh reef said he first saw hazelwood standing at a 
window in his cabin with an elbow on a window sill and his hand 
covering his mouth 
because of the confusion about sending test equipment to the 
ship the blood and urine tests were not taken until 10 hours 
after the accident he said 
before delozier took the stand a forensic toxicologist 
testified that hazelwoods blood and urine tested positive for 
alcohol 
michael a peat of sacramento calif said hazelwood had a 
level of 0061 percent of alcohol in his blood and 0094 percent in 
his urine 
he said the blood and urine tests almost never result in the 
same figures and did not explain the significance of the amounts 
found 
the blood alcohol test was under the alaska state limit of 010 
for driving a vehicle but over the federal limit of 004 for 
operating a commercial vessel 
ironically delozier acknowledged that he had been drinking the 
night before the accident at the same valdez bar where hazelwood is 
alleged to have gotten drunk earlier in the same day 
delozier said he had only two light beers and did not consider 
himself intoxicated but conceded that someone talking to him might 
have smelled beer on his breath 
mr delozier are you sure you werent smelling your own 
breath chalos asked of the confrontation with hazelwood 
absolutely delozier responded

independence and demanded freedoms that were lost when the kremlin 
annexed the baltic state in world war ii 
about 100000 people attended a rally friday in the republics 
secondlargest city of kaunas while 40000 turned out for a public 
meeting in the capital vilnius according to a spokeswoman for 
sajudis lithuanias grassroots proindependence group 
leaders of sajudis addressed the crowds in both cities renewing 
the republics demand for independence sajudis activist romuna 
sakoloskejda said by telephone from vilnius 
lithuanias parliament last week approved a resolution declaring 
unlawful and invalid the 1940 act that incorporated their 
republic with neighboring latvia and estonia into the soviet union 
they demanded talks with the kremlin on restoring lithuanian 
independence 
on thursday the parliament of neighboring latvia also condemned 
the annexation and voted to restore the national anthem and 
redandwhite flag of independent latvia replacing the communist 
hammer and sickle emblem 
lithuania a hilly region on the baltic sea about the size of 
west virginia was under russian rule before world war i and 
occupied by the german army during the war 
it became the first baltic state to declare independence from 
both russia and germany on feb 16 1918 and its example was soon 
followed by latvia and estonia 
but all three baltic states enjoyed only about two decades of 
independence before being swallowed up and incorporated into the 
soviet union in 1940 after the 1939 hitlerstalin pact carved 
eastern europe into spheres of influence 
the soviet union tried to diminish the local culture by 
promoting immigration of russians to the baltics but lithuanians 
still make up about 80 percent of their republics population 
lithuania has spearheaded the baltic drive for independence from 
the soviet union its communist party broke with moscow in december 
the lithuanian moves initially drew sharp criticism and warnings 
from soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev but the lithuanian partys 
move to break with moscow won it public support at home 
lithuanias parliament faces an election feb 25 and the 
outcome will be a major factor in future relations with moscow 
gorbachev has promised more autonomy for the 15 soviet 
republics during a visit last month to lithuania he announced 
that a law is being written that under certain conditions would 
allow a republic to secede from the soviet union

attorney general dick thornburgh is concerned 
that the american bar association will use a resolution endorsing 
abortion rights to produce a litmus test for screening judicial 
nominees 
but the president of the aba says the hotly debated resolution 
adopted tuesday in los angeles will not affect the way the bar 
group evaluates the qualifications of prospective federal judges 
thornburgh said in an interview friday that the resolution could 
result in a litmus test on judicial nominees 
if one arm of the aba is saying something and another arm of 
the aba is evaluating judicial candidates you want to know whats 
the connection between the two arms he said 
but l stanley chauvin the aba president said the resolution 
will not touch the abas standing committee on federal judiciary 
decisions on rating prospective candidates for federal judgeships 
that wasnt the purpose of the resolution he said in a 
telephone interview it will not have anything to do with it 
as far as our relationship with gen thornburgh and the 
justice department it is as though it never passed said 
chauvin who voted against the resolution along with john j curtin 
jr the aba presidentelect 
adopted by a 21 margin following acrimonious debate the 
resolution puts the aba in opposition to the bush administration on 
abortion rights under thornburgh the justice department has asked 
the supreme court to overturn its landmark 1971 decision that 
legalized abortion 
thornburgh has expressed other concerns about the abas judicial 
screening panel which conservative critics have charged was used 
by liberals to weed out people with views the committee found 
unacceptable 
thornburgh last spring got from the aba an agreement to delete 
language from its guidelines stating that political and 
philosophical views would not be considered except as they bore on 
other factors 
aba officials denied the views of candidates were considered 
but thornburgh threatened to cut the organization out of judicial 
screening unless it agreed to change the guidelines 
on friday thornburgh denied he was again threatening the aba 
with exclusion from the judicialselection process 
we want to hear from the aba he said 
but thornburgh expressed concern that the members of the 
judicialscreening committee might feel compelled to enforce aba 
policy on abortion when interviewing prospective candidates 
thornburgh said that as an aba member he objected to the 
resolution because this view doesnt reflect my views 
i am concerned that the association would squander its 
expertise to express its views in areas where they have no 
particular expertise he said

the soviet government friday rescinded its 
requirement that alaska flights to siberia have a soviet navigator 
aboard again opening the door for flights across the bering strait 
the change was announced the same day federal aviation 
administration and soviet of civil aviation officials met in 
washington dc to sign a memorandum of cooperation promoting 
civil aeronautics and air commerce between the united states and 
soviet union 
the agreement sets up air corridors between anchorage gambell 
king island and nome and the siberian communities of provideniya 
magadan anadyr and khabarovsk 
the soviets also announced they will upgrade the airport at 
provideniya and give it international status 
the decision lifting the navigator requirement applies to all 
carriers including nomes bering air 
while bering airs twinengine commuter planes have made scores 
of flights into siberia since their first flight to provideniya in 
1988 the airline balked when the soviets required a soviet 
navigator be aboard each flight 
bering air owner jim rowe said the 12000perflight cost would 
be prohibitive and the airline stopped flying to siberia in 
november rowe was in washington dc on friday and could not be 
reached his office said 
the small airline charges 2500 for each charter to siberia 
and about 250 for a oneway trip 
this is the first significant step in a twopart effort to 
begin regular commercial air service between alaska and the soviet 
union sen ted stevens said in a news release its welcome 
weve been working toward this for a long time

us officials believe international terrorism 
is declining although attacks by iraniansponsored shiite groups 
are on the increase 
iran believes terrorism is a legitimate part of foreign 
policy said an american official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
preliminary figures show incidents of international terrorism 
declined by about 25 percent last year from the 1988 total of 856 
according to the official 
the figures to be released in the state departments annual 
report on terrorism next month also show a decline of about 27 
percent in the number of fatalities from terrorist acts from 660 
to 485 exact numbers on overall incidents were not available 
counterterrorism experts attribute the 1989 decline to better 
airport security more commitment by governments to bring suspected 
terrorists to trial and a drop in violent activities of palestinian 
groups 
fatah the largest faction of the palestine liberation 
organization has kept a pledge leader yasser arafat made in 
december 1988 to refrain from terrorist attacks said the us 
official who predicted fatah would continue that promise 
two groups that may not remain as inactive as they were in 1989 
are the fatah revolutionary council headed by abu nidal and the 
popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral commanded led 
by ahmed jebril 
abu nidals group has been paralyzed by a revolt that led the 
libyanbased leader to order dozens of followers killed over the 
past two years plo sources say however experts agree the group 
still poses a threat and that some abu nidal operatives have joined 
the syrianbased pflpgc 
fbi and intelligence officials believe the pflpgc carried out 
the december 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over scotland that 
killed 270 people however the us official said evidence 
collected in the multinational police investigation isnt 
sufficient to bring charges 
jebril is thought to have carried out the pan am attack under 
contract with iran which has been accused of sponsoring dozens of 
terrorist attacks around the world 
iraniansponsored terrorism has increased in the six months 
since the death of revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the state department issued a warning earlier this month that 
proiranian extremists could be planning an attack against 
americans in europe to coincide with the 11th anniversary of the 
islamic revolution that brought khomeini to power

government scientists say changing water 
temperatures in the tropical pacific ocean may be signaling the 
start of a new el nino that could cause powerful climate changes 
worldwide 
current conditions resemble those of 1986 a relatively mild 
version of el nino which has caused widespread devastating weather 
in the past 
the current situation deserves very close attention the 
federal climate analysis center said in a statement friday 
the el nino in 198283 led to weather changes that were blamed 
for 1500 deaths and billions of dollars in damage across the globe 
we dont want to say something is developing that could be 
like that because that was exceptional dr vernon kousky of the 
climate center said in a telephone interview 
the 198283 el nino was blamed for worsening the devastating 
drought in africa causing severe winter storms to come ashore in 
california spawning the first typhoon to strike french polynesia 
in 75 years followed by five more in five months deluging peru 
and ecuador with torrential rains and promoting the worst drought 
in two centuries in australia 
the united nations estimated overall damage at between 2 
billion and 8 billion 
scientists suggest that was a onceinalifetime event however 
the el nino in 198687 was closer to average bringing some weather 
changes but not the massive damage of the earlier event 
formally called el ninosouthern oscillations or ensos these 
events are characterized by unusually warm water conditions in the 
eastern tropical pacific ocean and by changes in air pressure over 
different parts of that ocean 
water temperatures near the international dateline have risen 1 
and 2 degrees fahrenheit above normal while that may seem small 
the great amount of energy needed to warm such a large mass of 
water can make it a significant increase 
years ago when such changes tended to be first noticed by south 
american fishermen around christmas the phenomenon was given the 
name el nino which is spanish for child a reference to the baby 
jesus 
current conditions are similar to those prior to the 1986 event 
said kousky but he added i cant really say how firm it looks 
there is nothing to say this will hang in there tough and 
continue on were just monitoring it carefully 
if it does build into a fullfledged el nino the impact could 
be felt worldwide 
the problem is relocating warm water from one side of the 
pacific ocean to the other 
normal conditions include strong easterly winds which move the 
warm surface waters of the ocean toward asia and allow cooler 
waters to rise up from the depths along the coast of south america 
but when an enso occurs the easterly winds diminish or are 
replaced by westerlies and the warm water sloshes back toward the 
americas 
that puts more rain and cloudiness in the central pacific where 
it normally isnt said kousky and the heating strengthens the jet 
stream and upsets the normal wave patterns 
a disruption in the normal jet stream can cause changes in 
weather almost anywhere on the globe 
el ninos have been recorded periodically for many years 
evidence of the effects of el ninos can be traced in fact back to 
1532 when an unusually wet season apparently helped pizarro and his 
conquistadores cross normally desert areas in what is now peru

a disease closely related to the aids virus 
can almost certainly be traced back to an african monkey which may 
have given it to people by biting them a researcher said 
dr vanessa m hirsch of georgetown university said friday the 
west african epidemic of hiv2 disease most likely comes from the 
sooty mangabey a nondescript charcoalgray monkey that is now 
endangered 
the virus causes no outward signs of disease in the monkeys but 
when humans contract the disease it causes a serious illness that 
is similar to acquired immune deficiency syndrome although less 
fatal 
hirsch said she believes hiv2 was transmitted from monkeys to 
people within the past century through a bite or some other close 
contact 
hiv2 is in the same family of viruses as hiv1 the virus 
responsible for the aids epidemic elsewhere in africa as well as 
europe and the united states 
many kinds of african monkeys naturally harbor relatives of the 
human aids virus and while the chances of transmission from 
animals to people are slim this likely has happened in the past 
and could occur again 
hirsch presented her findings friday at a meeting of the 
american association for the advancement of science 
many experts believe that hiv1 spread from animals to people 
as well according to one theory it moved into a small 
geographically isolated pocket of humans in africa the disease 
became epidemic only in recent years when those people moved to 
cities 
the evidence is highly suggestive of transmission from monkeys 
to man of hiv2 said dr louis n martin of the delta regional 
primate research center at tulane university but where did hiv1 
come from we dont know 
hirsch said there are two reasons to think that hiv2 came from 
sooty mangabeys the monkey virus and hiv2 are about 75 percent 
alike and the monkeys live in the same area where hiv2 is rampant 
she said the animals are quick to bite and people in west 
africa keep them as pets and for food 
i would say its very dangerous to own any kind of african 
primate hirsch said 
she said the sooty mangabey virus also was probably the cause of 
an aidslike illness in macaque monkeys in the united states 
macaques are asian monkeys and do not naturally harbor their own 
relative of the aids virus 
a virus known as siv or simian immunodeficiency virus was 
first isolated at the new england regional primate center in 1985 
and it has become an important standin for studying human aids 
macaques that catch this virus quickly grow sick and die they 
are now used as models to test possible ways to treat or prevent 
aids in people 
for instance researchers at the new england primate center have 
found evidence that a potential medicine known as cd4 which is 
intended to draw the virus away from its usual targets in the 
bloodstream appears to wipe out the virus in monkeys preliminary 
studies of this approach are now being conducted in people 
other researchers at the delta primate center have found that 
vaccines made from killed monkey virus may be effective in 
protecting animals from infection with the virus experts say this 
work is among the most promising signs yet that an aids vaccine for 
people is possible

amid the applause for president bushs role at 
the colombia drug summit questions linger over the meetings 
achievements and the deliberate avoidance of areas of dispute 
sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the judiciary committee 
praised bush on friday for his courage and leadership but 
called the presidents drug policies misdirected and geared too 
much toward military assistance 
this continues our policy of attacking the drug traffickers 
but doing too little to stop coca growing by farmers which is the 
root problem biden said 
he said the united states should focus on crop development 
economic assistance debt relief and trade policies that do not 
undermine legitimate exports such as coffee and flowers 
the summit communique signed thursday by bush and the leaders of 
colombia bolivia and peru proclaimed sweeping goals such as 
replacing cocagrowing economies attacking the production and 
trafficking of drugs and reducing the demand by users 
the document didnt say how those goals would be achieved 
however and controversial subjects such as the extradition of drug 
suspects and increased us military involvement in the drug war 
were largely ignored 
there also was no discussion of any specific amount of increased 
aid from the united states though the andean nations clearly want 
more assistance and relaxed trade policies 
national drug policy director william bennett said many of the 
blanks would be filled in during negotiations with the summit 
countries 
im not saying we wont have more difficulties from here on 
we will he said still he said the summit had been of 
transcendent importance 
it was the first time the four countries faced up to all the 
problems bennett said calling it important for the south 
american leaders to talk about the moral dimensions of a coca 
economy 
assistant secretary of state bernard aronson called it a 
meeting in which nobody talked in stereotypes or cliches bennett 
said there was a lot of goodnatured sparring 
bush gave no hint he would beef up the 22 billion fiveyear 
andean aid program already on the table 
were going to stay with that figure for now the president 
said thursday before returning to washington 
bushs attendance provided a dramatic gesture of support for 
barco and his unrelenting battle against the drug lords 
rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics abuse and control called bush on friday to 
congratulate him 
rangel said it was a significant first step in the global 
effort to control the drug trade and the communique provided a 
valuable framework for future cooperative efforts 
rangel whose committee will hold a hearing feb 28 about the 
summit outcome made clear he believes the administration has a 
long way to go 
i hope your entire cabinet will become energized by your 
historic mission rangel said in a letter to bush the heads of 
the executive departments must develop the kinds of creative 
strategies that will be necessary to reduce the demand for drugs

the post reported reynolds confirmed its plans to test market 
the cigarettes but got testy when asked about the marketing study 
reynolds does not know what these documents contain the 
company said in a statement reynolds does not know if they are 
authentic or fabricated if they are authentic they represent 
stolen proprietary information belonging to rj reynolds and 
which would be of great value to our competitors 
the company already has had plans for a new brand of cigarette 
go up in smoke this year when public uproar led reynolds to

prosecuting pablo escobar in this country i just dont know what 
the odds would be at this point florida department of law

progress on a chinese application to join an 
international group aimed at expanding world trade has been slowed 
because of questions about chinas commitment to economic reforms 
the state department says 
it said friday that a number of members of the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade gatt including the united states have 
expressed concern about measures china has taken which restrict 
market access and are incompatible with gatt principles 
we believe these questions need to be adequately addressed 
before further action is possible on chinas application the 
department said in a written response to press questions 
at the same time state said it was looking forward to the 
eventual inclusion of taiwan in gatts membership because of the 
islands importance in the global trading system 
the department added that the united states has maintained a 
consistent policy on gatt membership for both china and taiwan over 
the years 
we have told both parties that we want eventual access for 
both on meaningful terms agreed upon by gatt members it said

a disease closely related to the aids virus 
can almost certainly be traced back to an african monkey which may 
have given it to people by biting them a researcher said 
dr vanessa m hirsch of georgetown university said friday the 
west african epidemic of hiv2 disease most likely comes from the 
sooty mangabey a nondescript charcoalgray monkey that is now 
endangered 
the virus causes no outward signs of disease in the monkeys but 
when humans contract the disease it causes a serious illness that 
is similar to acquired immune deficiency syndrome although less 
fatal 
hirsch said she believes hiv2 was transmitted from monkeys to 
people within the past century through a bite or some other close 
contact

hal rosenbluths 51ststory office looks 
down over city hall far away from the dusty brown north dakota 
prairie but he thinks the two fit together 
the 37yearold chief executive got interested in north dakota 
when he decided to help its droughtstricken farmers now hes 
become a fan of the state and his friendship has led to a thriving 
business and the promise of more to come 
rosenbluth travel is the nations fourthlargest travel agency 
a 98yearold business that writes airline tickets for corporate 
giants ranging from eastman kodak to general electric 
but rosenbluths idea of a great vacation is someplace where 
youre overdressed if you wear anything other than a tshirt with a 
stain on it 
he is a very downtoearth nonpretentious person says 
sen kent conrad dnd 
the two men and their wives struck up a friendship after 
rosenbluth opened a dataprocessing office in linton nd in 
1988 when drought threatened to drive many families there off the 
farm they have united in a promotion and recruitment effort they 
say could spur several rosenbluth clients to open new businesses in 
north dakota 
its so genuine its so refreshing pure rosenbluth said 
during a recent interview in his office i had never carried on a 
conversation for more than 15 minutes i think until i went out 
there 
folks in linton a town of about 1000 in central north dakota 
find it easy to talk to rosenbluth 
before our first meeting i was nervous said sharon jangula 
the coordinator for rosenbluths dataprocessing office i really 
didnt know what to expect a stuffed shirt hard to talk to 
strictly business type person i was really surprised 
rosenbluths 2300 employees are called associates 
to become one you must be nice friendly outgoing and 
willing to provide demanding clients with elegant service 
managers are taught that a good supervisor is a good servant 
each new employee at any of the agencys 265 offices round the 
world is brought to philadelphia for seminars that end with tea in 
the board room rosenbluth and other managers serve the tea and 
cakes 
associates are encouraged to think of ways to improve the 
companys service one employees suggestion led to rosenbluth 
travels new telecommunications service for the deaf 
thats one of the few ways you get dismissed is if someone 
suppresses an idea rosenbluth said 
his management style may sound corny or impractical but you 
cant argue with success 
rosenbluth went to work for the company in 1974 after earning a 
degree in criminology from the university of miami the former 
steamship ticket office his greatgrandfather opened in 1892 had 
20 million in billings 
bored as a vice president rosenbluth left the front office 
after a year to work as a reservation agent his management ideas 
were born in afterhours talks with the other agents 
by 1975 rosenbluths billings had grown to 300 million they 
hit 11 billion last month and are still growing the company says 
out of its success came a social conscience 
the agency contributed to philadelphia charities but the sight 
in 1988 of struggling farmers and parched midwest fields on the 
television news sparked something in rosenbluths imagination 
determined to help he contacted us agriculture department 
officials to find out what area was hit hardest they pointed him 
to north dakota and state officials pointed him to linton 
the company rented space in a tractor dealership and hired 40 
parttime employees to punch information into the companys 
computer at 5 an hour to some farm wives rosenbluths jobs were 
the difference between losing the farm or taking a job an hour away 
in bismarck 
he expected costs in north dakota to be less although he 
insists he never considered the potential savings wages alone are 
20 percent to 25 percent less than in philadelphia 
he found a strong work ethic practically no turnover and nice 
people that fit his corporate style 
i said to myself this is something we need to wake up to 
rosenbluth said

with the expansionist 1980s behind most us 
companies and the leaner and more conservative 90s under way 
corporate restructuring may well become more popular as a way to 
increase the price of a firms stock 
junk bond financing is just about on hold and fewer takeovers 
are getting done so its harder for companies to boost their stock 
prices by making acquisitions but buying back shares divesting 
underperforming units or taking other restructuring steps is an 
easier and sometimes cheaper alternative 
when marriott corp announced in december it was restructuring 
by selling most of its restaurants and buying back more stock 
company officials said enhancing shareholder value wall streets 
catchword for raising the firms stock price was among their 
goals 
it doesnt always work and when it does it can take time the 
day the marriott restructuring was announced the companys stock 
fell 1 a share to 3362 
marriotts shares have traded lower since then but the company 
has been subject to the same doldrums that have eroded prices for 
most issues on wall street this year 
investors were more enthused when international business 
machines corp announced a 1 billion stock buyback in october 
they immediately bid the computer giants shares up 237 to 
10412 ibm is currently trading at about that level 
how much a restructuring affects a companys stock price depends 
on a number of factors including the kind of move undertaken how 
much money is involved and whether the shares themselves are 
directly involved as in a buyback conditions on wall street are 
also a variable 
there is nothing new about restructurings but analysts have 
predicted there will be more of them in the coming months and years 
now that the takeover boom has ended 
companies are now working from within rearranging and 
streamlining their businesses trying to improve their profits and 
consequently the price of stock if they decide to repurchase 
stock the price often goes up under the law of supply and demand 
but some firms are forced into restructuring by the threat of 
hostile takeover attempts the buyout binge may be over but a few 
companies have become the targets of investors who want a better 
return on their holdings in other words a higher stock price 
georgia gulf corp had to formulate a recapitalization plan to 
try to fend off texas investor harold simmons who holds about 9 
percent of the chemical companys stock simmons began playing a 
catandmouse game with georgia gulf last summer presenting 
management with a list of suggestions on how to raise their share 
price 
the company says its recapitalization plan which provides for a 
cash payment to stockholders is worth up to 55 a share simmons 
dissatisfied with the recapitalization has launched a 11 billion 
at 45 a share hostile bid and wants to unseat the georgia gulf 
board 
the companys stock is currently trading below simmons bid 
simmons strategy considered corporate raiding in some 
quarters is similar to the approach carl icahn used at texaco 
inc starting in late 1987 icahn then texacos biggest 
shareholder fought the oil companys management for more than a 
year charging they were not doing enough to raise its stock price 
icahn proposed a takeover bid and tried unsuccessfully to unseat 
texacos board the oil giant ended up with a major restructuring 
that included the sale of billions of dollars worth of assets and 
the payment of a special dividend to stockholders 
now icahn is the largest shareholder at usx corp and is 
expected to rock the boat there too

if the economy is headed for a period of pain 
and retrenchment some stubborn optimists in the stock market 
evidently havent gotten the word 
over the first seven weeks of 1990 the financial news has been 
almost unrelentingly negative recession forecasts a sudden rise 
in interest rates and the dramatic failure of a prominent wall 
street firm 
the stock market joined in the gloomy chorus last month with a 
selloff that chilled followers of the january barometer which 
is supposed to signal the likely course of stock prices over the 
rest of the year 
but with all those excuses to lose its nerve the market has 
lately rebounded instead and now stands only about 6 percent below 
the record high it reached as the new year began 
the latest demonstration of the markets resiliency came this 
past week when barely a ripple of selling followed news of the 
collapse of drexel burnham lambert the firm that reigned as 
junkbond king through most of the 1980s 
that was hardly the only instance analysts also note that the 
market has been faced with a barrage of increasingly downbeat 
appraisals of the business outlook 
for example maury harris economist at painewebber inc this 
month said he believed the odds of a recession had increased to 
about two in five or 40 percent from one in three previously 
at about the same time the economists s jay levy and david 
levy in chappaqua ny increased their recessionprobability 
rating from 50 percent to 60 percent 
among other factors both cited the surprise jump in interest 
rates which has added to an already worrisome list of credit 
problems facing business planners and consumers 
said the levys the economy has financial vulnerabilities that 
are now just beginning to impact nonfinancial economic activity 
overindebtedness has reduced or ended business at a number 
of retail firms construction companies are building fewer houses 
because they cannot obtain financing financial institutions 
willingness to fund real estate development is diminishing the 
result of lately having been burned too many times 
the stock market however is not making the kind of recession 
forecast it has made in advance of many past business slumps the 
dow jones average of 30 industrials down 1261 at 263559 in the 
past week remains just a decent rallys distance shy of its jan 2 
peak of 281015 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index down 64 at 18375 the nasdaq composite index for 
the overthecounter market up 17 at 42901 and the american 
stock exchange market value index off 202 at 35877 
volume on the big board averaged 14857 million shares a day 
against 15498 million the week before 
attempts to explain the stock markets steady showing generally 
fall into two categories on one side theres the bullish view 
that investors in the aggregate a traditionally knowledgeable 
group can see beyond any shortterm economic weakness to better 
days ahead 
in the other camp are those who believe stock traders are 
missing the usual signs of trouble their vision obscured by the 
long bull market of the 80s 
to some of this persuasion the problem was only worsened by 
drexel burnhams demise and the markets unruffled response to it 
as junk bonds full further from favor and credit worries mount 
these observers say stocks are less and less likely to get support 
from takeover news and speculation 
even before the drexel news broke analyst greg smith at 
prudentialbache securities observed the stock market continues 
to react to takeover stories as though little has changed i would 
like to see market reactions that indicate investors understand the 
takeover binge has been severely diminished as a positive stock

bankruptcy once conjured up images of outraged 
creditors plundering whats left of businesses that cant pay the 
bills a notion rooted in medieval europe 
in late 20th century america however bankruptcy has taken on 
an entirely new meaning as a protective remedy that allows troubled 
companies to keep operating while they work out their financial 
problems under a judges supervision 
bankruptcy itself has become a huge business fed in part by 
failures such as that of financial giants drexel burnham lambert 
and integrated resources inc this past week 
the latest names join a long list of other big business that 
have recently found refuge in the bankruptcy court system 
including eastern airlines and the campeau corp retailing empire 
such moves have placed an extraordinary amount of power in the 
hands of judges entrusted with the fates of companies that employ 
hundreds of thousands of people and owe billions in debts 
more money passes through bankruptcy courts than all other 
courts combined bankruptcy attorneys say figures compiled by the 
american bankruptcy institute a washington group of attorneys 
show the number of bankruptcy filings nearly doubled to 643000 
last year compared with five years earlier 
most filings represent sincere attempts by businesses in 
financial trouble to delay or stretch out repayment of onerous 
debts under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code which gives 
companies a respite from creditors while they restructure and 
attempt to rehabilitate themselves 
the code was liberalized in 1978 partly to give businesses more 
flexibility in turning to the chapter 11 strategy attorneys trace 
the bankruptcy boom to that reform which in many cases has been 
exploited by large financially solvent companies facing potential 
ruin not necessarily because of pressure from lenders 
texaco inc for example resorted to chapter 11 three years 
ago not from heavy losses in its oil business but because of a 
105 billion court judgment awarded to smaller rival pennzoil co 
manville corp and ah robins co exited bankruptcy court in 
1989 as healthy companies after years under chapter 11 protection 
because of productliability lawsuits that they claimed threatened 
their existence 
chapter 11 as its now functioning is proving to be a fairly 
hospitable resort for big companies said frank kennedy a 
university of michigan professor and noted authority on bankruptcy 
law other countries dont have anything like rehabilitiation 
our bankruptcy laws are unique in providing hospitality 
many business veterans have found american bankruptcy law to be 
a lifeline in squalls of financial trouble sanford sigoloff an 
executive known as a turnaround artist for helping steer building 
products retailer wickes cos through a sucessful bankruptcy five 
years ago is one of the systems most articulate defenders 
there are lots of chapter 11s in this country and a large 
percentage of them meet all or part of their obligations over time 
and come back said sigoloff the system when used as 
designed is outstanding 
bankruptcy stems from the italian bancorotto or broken 
bench in medieval italy where skilled craftsmen did business 
from benches in guild halls those who defaulted on debts faced the 
wrath of suppliers who would smash the bench and rifle the 
craftsmens tools as partial compensation 
protection against bankruptcy is largely an american legal 
innovation based on the theory that if businesses had a reprieve 
from sudden shortages of cash or credit for whatever reason they 
and the country would ultimately benefit because jobs would be 
saved and the economy would continue to grow 
for the businessman its a time to renew the company 
sigoloff said for the creditors its an opportunity to have a 
common forum and return the company to health 
in drexels case however the chapter 11 filing appeared to be 
largely a formality to briefly prolong the life of the company 
which had been devastated by legal problems and a depression in the 
market for its main business highrisk junk bonds 
many legal experts say the drexel case illustrates another side 
to the us bankruptcy law that it is not a magic bullet for 
resurrection 
without public trust or a marketable product both of which 
drexel quickly and dramatically lost bankruptcy court becomes a 
trough where the scraps of a business are thrown to be distributed 
among its many creditors 
thats the kind of business so tied to confidence that its 
difficult to reorganize said harry dixon an omaha lawyer who 
chairs the american bankruptcy institute any company that has 
that problem chapter 11 wont solve 
in other business news this past week 
the government said a 30 percent tradebalance improvement in 
december helped the united states narrow the deficit to 1086 
billion the smallest in five years but private economists said 
the figure masked a troubling surge in dependence on foreign oil 
and other products this year that could dramatically widen the 
deficit the most visible symbol of us economic weakness 
big three carmakers reported a severe plunge in 1989 earnings 
because of costly incentives to woo buyers and a depression in the 
auto industry workers at general motors corp and ford motor co 
got sharply reduced profitsharing bonuses chryslers workers gone 
none 
perrier recalled its famous sparkling water worldwide after 
traces of cancercausing benzene were found in some shipments the 
french company which traced the contamination to a dirty filter 
faces multimilliondollar losses potentially huge liability claims

just when it looked like things couldnt get any 
worse for the junk bond market the house of drexel came tumbling 
down in a stunningly swift collapse 
it was the kind of news that gets the pulse racing in some 
vulture buyers and other longterm investors 
the junk market has been reeling for months from defaults 
credit downgrades of benchmark issues requirements that ailing 
thrifts sell their holdings and a virtual boycott by mutual funds 
and others 
then last weeks chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by the parent of 
drexel burnham lambert inc removed the firm that built the 200 
billion market virtually from scratch 
for many it was a fitting comeuppance for the cocky investment 
bank and its paper prodigy which promised such riches that many 
buyers seemed to forget why the bonds were called junk 
but a number of stouthearted money managers who invest for the 
long haul rather than the quick turn believe there are juicy 
pickings in the junk pile 
if nothing else the drexel bankruptcy has created an 
opportunity for people that can truly analyze the creditworthiness 
of the individual bonds and can determine those that are junk and 
those that arent junk says steven case senior consultant at 
berg fiduciary consultants 
junk bulls caution that the market is likely to remain shaky for 
months as buyers remain scarce and hardpressed investors 
everyone from thrifts to what remains of drexel itself sell their 
holdings the heady enthusiasm for doubledigit yields that 
dominated the gogo years is out 
but anyone willing to do a sober review of junk bond issuers 
checking cashflow the schedule of debt maturities coming due and 
need for asset sales can find good values 
that is whats slowly taking place says dan baldwin who 
manages close to 1 billion in highyield assets at chancellor 
capital management in new york its going back to credit 
fundamentals 
baldwin and others say the negative publicity about the market 
has obscured the fact that there are at least three levels of junk 
out there 
roughly 35 percent of all junk bonds come from companies that 
are operating profitably and are traded actively by a number of 
securities firms baldwin says bonds issued by turner broadcasting 
system inc and kroger co the cincinnati retailer that made good 
yield around 12 percent more than two percentage points above 
investmentgrade corporate bonds 
a similar amount of bonds have been issued by companies that can 
meet their interest payments but few market makers deal in these 
issues so liquidity is problematic he says 
at the bottom is the stress tier perhaps 25 percent of the 
market where issuers are in default or unlikely to be able to meet 
future debt payments baldwin says yields here can range from 16 
percent to more than 30 percent assuming interest actually is 
paid and paid in cash rather than more junk 
the prices have gone down so low and yields are so attractive 
its very attractive relative to equities baldwin says 
peter w thayer president of gateway investment advisers in 
cincinnati is a longtime equity investor who shunned junk bonds 
in the past but is giving the market another look 
a buyer willing to wait two to four years for a return can 
assemble a 20 million portfolio of bonds from a dozen companies 
thayer says at current prices the investment should pay off 
handsomely even if a few of the companies fail he says 
for the small investor it isnt a bad time to put some money 
into highyield mutual funds because customer redemptions in the 
wake of drexels bankruptcy filing may depress fund prices thayer 
adds you should just buy them and forget them for a few years 
for the real vulture the markets current distress is like an 
appetizing heap of corpses 
david j breazzano who manages about 100 million for t rowe 
price associates of baltimore is interested only in true 
distressed credits or companies that have filed for bankruptcy 
protection these bonds trade mostly for as little as 20 cents to 
50 cents on the dollar 
few people deal in these bonds though so when an investor has 
to sell the price often drops fast 
if somebody can absorb size he can buy it below market 
substantially below breazzano says the vulture buyer may have 
to wait through two to three years of bankruptcy court proceedings 
but if hes done his homework on the company he can be pretty sure 
of a payback 
as breazzano says everything even a bankrupt bond has value 
at a price

until last week 23yearold jarl ginsberg was 
an options trader at drexel burnham lambert inc 
but when the companys parent filed for bankruptcy court 
protection in the largest collapse of any wall street firm 
ginsberg was forced to consider his alternatives 
getting a masters of business administration would give him 
credentials and credibility and it would buy him time while 
the industry limps back on its feet 
the shine on the mba degree the yuppie ticket to bigger and 
better things that has been coveted for more than a decade has yet 
to tarnish 
despite fresh and massive layoffs on wall street businesspeople 
and students alike still say the degree makes a difference 
business schools anticipate no drop in applications though 
students are shifting their studies away from risky investment 
banking in favor of consulting and more traditional areas like 
corporate finance 
many new mbas have yet to chip away at the loans they took out 
to foot the degree a few are considering drastic career changes 
one 30yearold investment banker who graduated from columbia 
universitys business school two years ago owes nearly 25000 on 
college loans but job prospects have dimmed so astonishingly that 
he is preparing to apply to law schools 
career paths within banking are fairly restricted now he 
said speaking anonymously so he wouldnt officially violate his 
companys donttalktothepress policy its time to look 
beyond banking 
what drove hordes of people to the financial services industry 
via business school was the promise of financial rewards that 
practically knew no bounds 
recruiters visiting the columbia campus a few years back were 
offering starting salaries of 75000 and the unspoken promise of 
250000 five years out one recent grad remembers 
today financial companies are not even showing up to talk to 
students let alone offer them jobs at new york univeristys stern 
school all companies are cutting back and some are canceling 
their schedules to interview for summer internships said howard 
leifman assistant director of the schools office of career 
development 
at columbia director of placement and career services elizabeth 
katsivelos said there havent been any excessive cancellations 
but she did note that more students are showing an interest in 
consulting and manufacturing 
in 1986 the gogo days of wall street 31 percent of columbias 
mba grads went to brokerage houses and investment firms last year 
the number dwindled to 16 percent and katsivelos called further 
declines possible 
some insiders predict only a mere 10 percent of the drexel 
people will actually land jobs in financial services in new york 
more than 5000 drexel employees were expected to lose their jobs 
according to a study of recent mba graduates from the 
prestigious wharton school in philadelphia those accepting jobs in 
the northeast have dropped more than 7 percent while those moving 
to the south jumped 56 percent 
for those willing to pack it all in and move many will find 
themselves trapped by real estate they cant readily unload 
cooperative apartments in brooklyn heights which offers a 
birdseye view of wall street are either being deeply discounted 
or taking months to sell 
at the peak of the citys real estate boom a few years ago a 
modest twobedroom apartment sold for 225000 in a less 
fashionable brooklyn neighborhood local realtors now tell the 
owners theyll have to drop to about 190000 if they want a quick 
sale 
youre stuck with property youve paid a lot of money for 
one homeowner complained 
for those who do manage to land on their feet the question 
becomes just how solid the foundation will be do they have any 
chance of earning their previous salaries 
one 28yearold trader who earned 100000plus at a wall 
street firm has been unemployed since september his prospects are 
even bleaker now that hes competing with another few thousand 
drexel jobless 
though he received a generous severance package theres only 
money left to cover living expenses for his family and the mortgage 
on his designer duplex loft for another eight months 
then of course theres a certain amount of guilt to be dealt 
with after riding the wave of greed and materialism some of wall 
streets unfortunate said they were embarrassed they didnt see the 
end coming 
i feel responsible for not anticipating things better said 
one

andrew barnes head of the st 
petersburg times bristles at a texas tycoons attempt to acquire a 
prominent newspaper that was set up to be forever independent 
what youre seeing is people who think everything can be 
measured in dollars says barnes 50 of a bid led by fort worth 
billionaire robert m bass to acquire control of the times 
publishing co owner of the newspaper and the congressional 
quarterly 
a bassled partnership which bought a minority stake in 
mid1988 offered 270 million for a controlling share a deal 
rejected friday by trustees who control the company the bass 
investors also are suing for a bigger share of dividends they claim 
arent fairly distributed 
what paved the way for a takeover fight was a feud that started 
long ago in the family of the late times titan nelson poynter who 
ran the newspaper for 30 of its 105 years 
poynter engineered a unique way to keep a profitable daily 
newspaper in the hands of journalists free from control of 
outsiders or even his family he established a nonprofit journalism 
school the poynter institute which through a complex system is 
the major stockholder of the newspaper and receives 83 percent of 
the dividends 
in a special centennial issue in 1984 the times said of its 
ownership as corny as it sounds how one of americas 
largest daily newspapers became the property of a school is the 
story of one mans commitment to corporate excellence and local 
control 
nelson poynters gift valued in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars has been called both a noble gesture and a tax dodge 
poynter carved family scars as he brought his dream to life ten 
years after his death in 1978 disgruntled heirs said they felt 
they werent getting a fair share of the dividends they sold their 
minority interest to bass and now are part of his poynterjamison 
ventures ltd partnership 
in its suit the bass group values the company at 450 million 
and alleges management is cheating shareholders bass and his 
partners own 40 percent of the common stock but only receive 57 
percent of the companys dividends 
barnes who wont disclose the companys worth calls the suit 
meritless and wrong and vows to respond as forcefully as we 
know how to do 
theyre accusing us of doing what we assert we do they call 
it a breach of fiduciary trust this is a fight about dividend flow 
and whether they get the 6 percent they bought or the 40 percent 
theyd like barnes said 
both sides have been lining up highpowered attorneys for what 
could be a long and bitter fight 
barnes believes an emphasis on profits would sacrifice 
journalistic excellence 
journalism is our strength we also have excellent lawyers 
he said i dont intend to lose 
the other side thinks economics and good journalism mix 
bass 41 a renowned takeover dabbler with artful acquisitions 
to his credit wants the paper because it is widely respected and 
financially sound says spokesman david bonderman 
barnes acts like its the holy grail that nobody could have 
an interest in journalistic integrity if they had an economic 
stake bonderman said the only ones like that are the st pete 
times and pravda and even pravda seems to be learning its lesson 
barnes doesnt take kindly to the soviet communist party 
newspaper analogy 
if they so value the journalistic aspect how can they compare 
us to pravda he asks 
were not talking about little old ladies barnes said 
were talking about corporate raiders from texas i think theres 
an intimate relationship between good journalism and the dollars it 
costs to provide it you cant have it both ways 
the bass group has said it will guarantee editorial integrity of 
the paper and claims the buyout plan would strengthen the 
institute financially 
the newspaper poynter envisioned wouldnt have to worry about 
debt or ownership by investors or a large newspaper chain that 
could influence content he centralized control of the newspaper in 
the hands of one person by arranging for the institute shares to be 
voted by the chief executive officer of the times publishing co 
that power went first to times editor eugene patterson who 
picked barnes as his successor when he retired in 1988 barnes is 
chairman of the institute board chairman and chief executive 
officer of both the times holding co and the times publishing co 
and editor president and chief executive of the newspaper 
when nelson poynter took over the paper and its parent from his 
father paul in 1947 the stock was allocated with the idea that 
nelson would have voting control and his sister eleanor would 
have a greater income flow said merritt gardner an attorney who 
represented her before her death in 1987 
it didnt work out that way 
eventually nelson poynter called in the redeemable nonvoting 
stock eleanor held leaving his sister with 40 percent or 200 
shares of voting stock and only 6 percent of the dividends 
poynter wound up with 60 percent of the voting stock or 300 
shares and 3000 shares of preferred stock he didnt redeem that 
gave him 94 percent of the dividends later some shares went to 
poynters widow marion who receives about 11 percent of the 
dividends 
voting stock provides power nonvoting stock brings dividends 
the bass group got its entree by buying the 200 shares of voting 
stock owned by poynters nieces mary alice jamison griffin and ann 
poynter jamison parker the sisters daughters of eleanor said 
they were forced to sell to settle estate taxes after their mother 
died

drexel burnham lambert inc gave thousands of 
fired workers skimpy severance payments but offered cutrate deals 
on computer equipment as it headed into oblivion after reshaping 
corporate america in the 1980s 
the bulk of drexels 5300 employees were turned loose friday 
into a slumping securities industry that already has witnessed tens 
of thousands of layoffs since the 1987 stock market crash 
drexels parent company filed for protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law tuesday when it 
defaulted on some debt and banks refused to lend money the company 
then began liquidating its businesses including the oncepowerful 
securities firm 
it has been a historic week said kathleen camilli a drexel 
money market economist who is forming a research firm with a 
coworker just think 10 years from now ill look back and say i 
worked for drexel burnham and that firm no longer exists 
on friday drexel workers finished packing boxes unscrewed 
computer equipment from desks to buy at firesale prices and left 
the firms downtwon headquarters many for the last time 
its a beautiful day isnt it one drexel executive said 
pointing to a drizzly gray sky overhead its like the day king 
kong invaded manhattan 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said an unspecified number of 
employees from investment bankers to secretaries would remain 
temporarily to finish pending business drexel is transferring some 
business to other firms and liquidating its portfolio of junk bonds 
and other securities 
under the severance plan salaried workers are to get a week and 
a halfs pay for each year of completed service plus two weeks 
pay unsalaried workers are to get just one weeks pay per year 
plus one week employees said the maximum is 24 weeks pay for 15 
or more years at the firm 
the payments are coming out of the securities firms remaining 
assets which are not covered by the parents bankruptcy filing 
we deeply regret this short notice of termination to you but 
we made herculean efforts to obtain additional capital which we 
believed would be available and anticipated a refinancing of our 
debt obligations as has been done in the past the letter said 
unfortunately this did not occur 
with the filing of the petition in bankruptcy by our parent 
company a loss of confidence by the public our investors and 
customers has resulted in our inability to conduct our business and 
compelled us to close down our operations 
the bulk of drexels highyield bond division in beverly hills 
calif was fired the operation long headed by michael milken was 
largely responsible for the firms rise to prominence 
about 1000 drexel clients handled by milken used the risky debt 
securities to expand some used them to raise money for hostile 
raids on much larger firms a phenomenon that altered american 
business in the 1980s 
drexels demise was due in part to the collapse of the junkbond 
market last fall and to the firms agreement to plead guilty to 
securities crimes and pay 650 million to the government milken 
left drexel after he was indicted on related charges 
also friday officials confirmed that shearson lehman hutton 
inc was expected to acquire about 28000 drexel brokerage accounts 
with assets of as much as 5 billion the accounts are held by 
current and former drexel employees their relatives and small 
institutions 
a drexel junkbond holder filed a classaction lawsuit charging 
a drexel controlling company milken chief executive frederick h 
joseph and others with fraud deceit misrepresentation and 
securities law violations in junkbond deals 
the lawsuit filed in delaware chancery court claims milken 
lured in thousands of investors and then engaged in secret 
transactions
