economic and political problems 
are growing in brazil and president fernando collor de mellos 
conservative government is under attack from all sides 
businessmen say the country is being driven into an unnecessary 
recession labor leaders complain that paychecks are eaten up by 
inflation 
professional groups rail against authoritarian government 
officials and even collors congressional allies are in open 
rebellion 
the government is growing increasingly isolated said walder 
de goes a political science professor at the university of 
brasilia it has lost almost all support from organized sectors 
of society the president must show a greater willingness to 
negotiate and less arrogance 
inflation has risen steadily since may it totaled 137 percent 
last month and many observers predict nearly 20 percent in 
december 
business bankruptcies are up unemployment is increasing and a 
steep recession appears to be developing 
bad economic news has led to harsh public confrontations between 
the government and businessmen who had been collors most 
enthusiastic backers the president has said corporations cause 
inflation by not reducing their profit margins 
we need more love for our motherland instead of for only 
whats in our pockets he told brazilian reporters during a trip 
to japan in november 
in response businessmen say they are being made scapegoats for 
the administrations economic failures 
just because theyre too incompetent to beat inflation we 
cant all be held responsible antonio ermirio de moraes 
director of the huge conglomerate grupo votorantim said in an 
interview with the rio daily o globo he also said there were 
thieves in the government and justice minister jarbas 
passarinho threatened him with legal action 
jair meneguelli president of the workers central union the 
largest and most radical labor federation has threatened to 
withdraw from governmentsponsored talks on a national social 
pact 
one round was postponed in november and meneguelli said his 
union would meet with its traditional enemy the federation of 
industries of sao paulo state to draw up a joint proposal for the 
social pact negotiations 
the government has reason to fear this union because capital 
and labor have a strength and that strength can change the 
governments plans said the union leader who represents 12 
million workers 
early in november the brazilian bar association urged collor to 
reverse a decree limiting the sex and violence content of 
television programs in prime time tales castelo branco 
association president said the decree was unconstitutional and 
amounted to censorship 
presidential spokesman claudio humberto rosa e silva responded 
id like to suggest the association president return to school 
and if he lacks the humility to return to school he should at 
least read the constitution 
at a ceremony launching a lowincome housing program collor 
declared no one is going to put a straitjacket on this 
president im going to continue to work for the needy without 
fear of those who want to continue oppressing our people with lies 
radicalism and violence 
a poll published by the newspaper folha de sao paulo indicated 
support for collors economic austerity measures was at a record 
low the survey conducted in brazils 10 largest cities found 43 
percent of respondents opposed 26 percent supporting collor and 
the rest neutral 
in midnovember the government suffered several important 
defeats in congress where it technically has a comfortable 
majority collor lost one vote on retirement benefits by a 
humiliating 26441 
the government has a majority but not an organized 
majority it commands said rep gastone righi of the conservative 
brazilian labor party righi who previously supported collor said 
his party would now condition its support on economic results 
renan calheiros collors longtime political ally quit as the 
presidents house leader and broke with the government the 
president is becoming crazy calheiros said in resigning he 
has a total contempt for congress 
villas boascorrea a leading political analyst said collor was 
lucky in the timing of his problems congress is due to recess 
until march and the yearend holidays are approaching in the hot 
southern hemisphere summer 
public opinion is basically shut down for the next few 
months he said if the government can regain control of the 
economy in the near future collor will be able to recoup at least 
part of his prestige

james beard often called the dean of american 
food rose early most days not to get to the markets or his stove 
but to talk on the telephone a morning constitutional of gossip 
that could last two hours 
now beard himself five years after his death at 81 is at the 
center of a roiling kettle of gossip 
fermenting the gossip is a pair of biographies both a tribute 
to his pivotal role in the development of an american cuisine one 
of the books is a celebration the other is a portrait warts and 
all 
there is a bonfire of the foodies quality about this said 
robert clark who is writing a third biography of beard these 
are all goodhearted people who are competing to sit on his throne 
and then competing for status and stature in the food business 
beard was the genius behind the discovery of american 
cooking reveling in the fine preparation of simple local 
ingredients the same qualities that have become watchwords of 
good eating in this country many people who knew him called him a 
walking encyclopedia of gastronomy food he preached should 
always be fun 
he gave up hope of a career in the opera after nodes developed 
on his vocal cords and turned to acting but soon found few parts 
for a man his size 6foot4 and 200 to 300 pounds according to 
evans jones book epicurean delight 
so he brought drama to an early love food 
like theater offering food to people is a matter of 
showmanship and no matter how simple the performance until you do 
it well with love and originality you have a flop on your 
hands he once wrote 
stylish and outgoing beard also had a remarkable ability to 
attract all sorts of people willing to help him cook write 
organize his life and in later years get around 
james gave to everybody but the bargain implied giving in 
return wrote barbara kafka the editor of the other beard book 
the james beard celebration 
people would do unbelievable things for jim in work and in 
personal service things he accepted with such ease and lack of 
selfconsciousness that any notion of burden was eschewed she 
wrote 
beard traveled frequently and found friends students and 
colleagues everywhere he spent time oregon california new york 
london and france there were cooks restaurateurs writers 
childhood friends theater movie and opera people 
he wrote 22 books and countless newspaper and magazine articles 
consulted for restaurants catered opened cooking schools and was 
a spokesman for kitchen equipment and food products he was a 
pioneer of backyard cooking and of television cooking shows though 
he lacked julia childs affinity for the camera 
to oversimplify matters he was the person who almost 
singlehandedly transformed americas eating habits from salt and 
pepper and ketchup on the table to much more complex pleasures 
said george lang owner of the new york restaurant cafe des 
artistes and also a food columnist and friend of beards for 35 
years 
until beard cooking in america was essentially european said 
kafka whose book is full of reminiscences and recipes from those 
who knew beard 
her book is an invitation to join beard and his friends and 
their food and was published to raise money for the james beard 
foundation established four years ago in beards greenwich village 
townhouse by child peter kump its president and others 
the foundation offers workshops book parties dinners and 
exhibits of food photography and art a scholarship program is 
expected to begin granting money next year 
both books are really quite wonderful in their own way lang 
said the question is what youre interested in if youre 
interested in recipes for your main course then barbara kafkas 
book will be for you and the anecdotes will be dessert the 
opposite is true for jones book 
clark who edits the journal of gastronomy said his book will 
include no recipes but will be the story of american food over a 
100year period as told through the life of james beard 
beard grew up an only child in oregon where his mother had run 
a hotel and where she instilled in him her fascination with fine 
food 
i cooked fairly seriously by the time i was 14 and 15 beard 
is quoted as saying in kafkas book i never really learned i 
had a funny feeling that i could take something i ate and reproduce 
it like a musician with music 
it was a time beard also documented in delights and 
prejudices his 1964 memoirs at least in part beards efforts 
to write a sequel inspired jones and kafka 
he apparently tried to break his writing block with several 
people said kump a beard friend who opened peter kumps new 
york cooking school 
jones wife and editor judith jones of alfred a knopf inc 
said beard made some tapes with her husband which became material 
for his book and kafkas book begins with a transcript of a tape 
he made with her 
beard the gossip might have delighted in beard the topic of 
gossip friends said 
jones writes of friendships that fell apart business 
difficulties and the effects of beards domineering mother 
some people were unhappy that both books mention beards 
homosexuality clark said 
in kafkas book beard himself brings it up in a tape he made 
saying by the time i was 7 i knew that i was gay i think its 
time to talk about that now 
jones has heard the accusation that his book is homophobic 
perhaps in part because the subject is introduced in a footnote 
but he insisted he was merely being discreet and that beards 
sexuality is irrelevant 
there is a strong feeling of wanting to protect his memory and 
wanting to inherit his reputation on the part of a lot of people 
clark said he made people feel like he was totally theirs and i 
think the world is full of people who feel that they knew him 
best 
we didnt quite know how sticky that would be mrs jones 
said 
kafka wont discuss jones book asked why she said have you 
read it to the end 
in the final chapter jones describes her as a writer who at the 
time she and beard met may have known more about courts of 
intrigue than she did about the world of food 
i havent read what barbara calls her book jones said 
but beyond the gossip and the disagreements kump said its 
important that so much is being written about beard 
jim made a tremendously significant contribution to gastronomy 
in this country kump said 
and he noted all but two of beards own books are back in 
print

it could be the site of a drug deal in a dingy 
back alley off kenmore square the black steel doors of a 
graffitiscarred brick building open onto a hallway where addicts 
gather each day for a fix 
this is the habit management institute the states busiest 
methadone clinic some 500 people pass through its doors every day 
for a dose of the drug that staves off the craving for heroin 
and while this is not an illicit drug trade it is a business 
the clinic is privately owned and turns a profit like any company 
many of its clients as they are called are middleclass and pay 
for their doses the same way they buy bread 
as clinic vice president robert potter put it if you can pay 
the freight we can provide a firstclass service 
twice a week jerry 35 who wouldnt give his last name shows 
up at the clinic in a dress shirt and tie before gong to work as a 
computer operator for the state 
jerrys father died when he was young and his mother was an 
alcoholic at 22 he became a heroin addict three years ago he 
started coming to habit management 
i pay cash every week he said and theres an incentive 
to stay clean i dont want to pay my own money here and then go 
out and spend more on heroin 
the clinic opens early to accommodate working people seven days 
a week at 615 am sharp the alley doors open and clients stream 
in 
standing in line they pay the required fee 105 a week for 
methadone and counseling to a burly clinic supervisor manning a 
cashbox 
each person then gets an identification tag showing they are 
clients not street people looking for drugs and moves down the 
line to get their dose 
standing behind a counter a nurse puts a peachcolored 
methadone tablet about the size of a poker chip into a paper cup 
hot water is poured in with a drop of orange syrup mixed in for 
taste 
the client gulps it down and is off to work home to 
college at 10 am the doors close 
we get housewives plumbers said clinic founder lenny 
kupsc most of our clients are white middleage males with a 
high school diploma 
a social service worker by trade kupsc decided to start his own 
business after a brush with cancer with an estimated 40000 
intravenous drugusers in massachusetts a methadone clinic seemed 
like a surefire success 
taking his inspiration from california where many private 
forprofit drug clinics sprang up after the taxcutting measure 
proposition 13 cut state services kupsc opened habit management in 
boston in 1986 
there was a business model that showed you could provide a 
quality service and that people who were addicted to drugs were 
willing to pay for it kupsc said 
similar clinics have sprung up across the country during the 
past 10 to 15 years according to wendell turner a spokesman for 
the national association of state alcohol and drug abuse directors 
in washington dc 
at habit management business boomed kupsc opened clinics in 
lowell springfield and south yarmouth his company even bought two 
mobile homes and turned them into moving clinics to service other 
towns 
some communities fought against having the clinics and some 
social service workers criticized the idea of a profitable 
methadone business 
addicts are a very vulnerable population and there were 
questions about whether this should be something that people profit 
from said janice kauffman chairman of the massachusetts 
methadone treatment providers association 
but in 1988 the state came to habit management seeking help in 
meeting the demand for methadone treatment 
with the specter of aids looming more intravenous drug users 
were getting subsidized methadone treatment in an effort to halt 
the spread of the disease 
things changed when aids became a big scare kauffman said 
it was serving nobody to not have more treatment for iv drug 
users i dont think there was a passion to treat heroin users but 
there is a passion to treat aids 
so kupsc agreed to take on state clients who received medicaid 
or other funding where once he only served those who paid with 
their own money today 70 percent of his clients are subsidized 
kupsc wears an earring a gym suit and expensive running shoes 
as he pads around his spacious office he wont reveal habit 
managements profits or his own personal income 
but he defended his clinics saying clients receive counseling 
and are regularly checked for illicit drugs the state licenses his 
operation and keeps a close eye on it he added 
the state is more diligent when it comes to me kupsc said 
theres a mentality that if youre making money thats evil and 
you have to be watched 
but with public money being impacted the traditional network 
of services are at risk he said someones got to pick up the 
ball its got to be the entrepreneurs who see theres an 
opportunity

the sunday correspondent a weekly newpaper with 
national circulation is folding after failing to find the 
investment needed to stay afloat the papers management has 
announced 
the sunday correspondent which includes the chicago tribune 
among major shareholders was launched on to the crowded sunday 
newspaper scene on sept 17 1989 at a cost of 255 million 
but sales of the paper fell below the 350000 figure needed to 
break even and last august shareholders pumped in another 19 
million to keep it going 
the paper also switched editors in what it called the 
interests of the continued shareholder support and on sept 30 it 
changed from a broadsheet to a tabloid 
but the move failed to increase its share of the mass national 
readership in this nation of 57 million people and the papers 
chief executive nick shott said tuesday night that its final 
circulation had fallen to 210000 
the demise of the sunday correspondent leaves britain with 10 
national weekly sunday newspapers 
like its competitors and tv and radio stations the paper has 
been hit by falling advertising revenue in britains current 
economic recession 
shott said the closure will mean the loss of about 200 jobs

in the middle ages french feudal lords bedded the 
wives of their serfs and called it a noblemans right nowadays 
male executives prey on female employees but some women are 
fighting back 
it is a new difficult battle for french women 70 percent of 
whom work outside the home 
according to a survey by the european communitys executive 
commission 36 percent of working women in france reported being 
harassed sexually by bosses or coworkers 
sexual harassment has been around for centuries yet its 
still a taboo subject said marievictoire louis a sociologist 
and cofounder of the association to fight violence against women 
at work 
any woman who brings charges of sexual harassment against her 
employer runs the risk of being ridiculed isolated not believed 
and naturally of being fired if she hasnt been already 
prospects of better treatment on the job are improving for 
women who mke up 41 percent of the work force the national 
assembly is working on legislation expected to pass in the spring 
that would make sexual harassment a crime punishable by large fines 
and prison terms of two to five years 
the government agency that monitors womens rights is looking 
for ways of changing labor laws to enable inspectors to intervene 
in harassment cases and make employers responsible for the security 
of female workers 
only the employer can put an end to sexual harassment mrs 
louis said by law employers are required to provide working 
conditions which respect the employees health and safety and that 
includes an environment free of sexual harassment 
she said the campaign against sexual harassment got an 
unexpected boost from a satirical film about two female postal 
workers who turn the system to their advantage 
promotion canape couch promotion written and directed by 
didier kaminka has attracted about 1 million viewers since it 
opened in october xavier gelin the producer said negotiations 
were under way for a hollywood remake 
for me sexual harassment can be defined as repeated advances 
that end up turning into blackmail kaminka said in an interview 
sexual harassment is rampant when theres high unemployment and 
young inexperienced women without specialized training are afraid 
to lose their jobs 
kaminka said he spent four months inside the postal service 
where he found the expression couch promotion to be part of the 
vernacular one scene shows actress grace de capitani obtaining a 
desirable apartment from the postal services housing administrator 
only after promising sex 
officials said publicly that everything in the film is 
fiction but i can tell you its all true kaminka said 
mrs louis criticized the film for playing down the violence 
that accompanies many acts of sexual harassment 
in her small office in eastern paris she pointed to a pile of 
dossiers of women who had been abused verbally and physically 
beaten and raped by their male employers 
she described mrs a a dental assistant who submitted to her 
bosss repeated advances because she had an unemployed husband and 
a baby when she finally rejected him he reduced her salary 
bullied her and slapped her 
charged with assault he denied sexual harassment and said mrs 
a had consented to his attentions she later withdrew the charges 
in exchange for a letter of dismissal and 40000 francs 8000 in 
damages 
another case involved mrs b 24 hired by a town official who 
abused threatened raped and blackmailed her for two years 
mrs b finally went to authorities and the official was charged 
with several sex and assault offenses involving other women 
including a minor 
despite a statement of support from the mayor the official was 
convicted and sent to jail he was released however and the case 
is still pending 
fannypinching skirtchasing males have been french theater 
fare for centuries from molieres tartuffe to the heroes of 
slapstick boulevard comedies but mrs louis said 
theres nothing funny about the abuse of an employers 
power

a death squad has turned over 330 
weapons to the government in a sign that a decade of massacres and 
vigilante justice could be ending in a northwestern bananagrowing 
province 
the paramilitary group handed in automatic weapons a 
shouderfired antiaircraft missile grenades jeeps and 
sophisticated radio equipment a police spokeswoman said tuesday 
she asked not to be identified a standard practice at national 
police headquarters 
the group is led by fugitive millionaire fidel castano 
castanos squad has been blamed for killing scores of peasants 
in a series of massacres in cordoba province the group says it was 
formed to protect ranchers and farmers from leftist guerrillas who 
rustled cattle and extorted socalled revolutionary taxes 
but a secret police investigation revealed that the group 
financed by the medellin drug cartel became a rightwing death 
squad 
castano has said his groups decision to disband is a response 
to a ceasefire declared by the maoistinspired rebel group 
peoples liberation army which with two other insurgent groups is 
holding peace talks with the government 
last weekend castano donated about 3000 acres of land to 
peasants in the region the weapons were turned over monday in alto 
sinu cordoba

governor and representatives of the attorney generals office 
castano who has several arrest warrants against him did not 
attend

some western nations are gathering 
food medicine coal and heating oil for the soviet union but 
others are skeptical about moscows need for emergency aid 
they wonder if the soviet union the worlds largest grain 
producer really needs food they also worry about the soviets 
ability to distribute supplies 
signals from the soviet union have been confusing with some 
soviets saying they have plenty of food 
president bush said america would try to help if necessary 
however us officials say there is no evidence of widespread 
hunger that there is food in the cities and the agricultural 
regions of the soviet union 
many relief workers and government officials hestitate to join 
the food effort because of reports that some parts of the soviet 
union refuse to share food with others and in many cases soviets 
are malnourished or undernourished not starving 
officials at the japanese foreign ministry for instance 
maintain help is more urgently needed by starving people in asia 
and africa japanese officials are considering sending medicine to 
the soviets 
germany the biggest proponent of sending food to the soviet 
union is worried about whether the goods will reach the hungriest 
people 
the german red cross says it has 2 billion to spend on shipping 
private donations including hundreds of thousands of tons of 
sugar milk grain heating oil coal and toothpaste 
however hundreds of trains carrying the soviet unions normal 
food purchases are halted at its borders because soviet tracks are 
a different size and the foreign rail cars cannot enter the 
country there are not enough people to unload the goods so german 
food already shipped has not reached the interior 
we know there are problems in the soviet union of things 
getting lost said mats karlsson who oversees swedish aid to 
eastern europe and the soviet union 
he said many private organizations are reluctant to get 
involved 
our experience from other countries is that you are very 
dependent on the systems that exist karlsson said in the 
soviet union the economic system is being changed and we 
dont know what its being changed to 
finland the only european country with rail lines that match 
the soviet unions sent railway officials to germany this week to 
discuss the transportation problem but the finns say there is no 
need to send food 
there is little on the shop shelves but the people arent 
starving and there are no reports of hunger either said pentti

the german branch of the catholic relief organization caritas

up a truck convoy caritas is sending packages of staples to 
religious organizations around moscow 
germany italy canada spain and britain have promised up to

for the aid 
the economic community is also considering a 1 billion donation

much of the food is being collected from individuals at red

municipal authority have offered their cold war stockpiles of food 
however the international committee of the red cross has no plans

establish free market economies britain has set up a 40 million 
fund to help the soviets learn about food distribution energy 
small businesses and financial services 
many other organizations and states say they are not considering 
sending aid because the soviets havent asked 
soviet ambassador nikolai uspensky said on swedish television 
last week that the main problem facing the soviets is the 
mechanism of bringing the food from the field to the shop floor 
to the shop shelves 
when this chain breaks there can be so many reasons 
inefficiency sheer sloppiness it can be political motivations 
sheer criminal motivations anything uspensky said 
halvard kvamsdal a former red cross official in norway said he 
often crosses the border to the soviet union and it has never 
been this bad still when he asked his soviet neighbors last 
week what they needed they requested toys and clothes 
whoever has food is sitting on it karlsson said there is 
a shortage which gives rise to malnourishment but the soviet 
union has been living with malnourishment for a long time

troublemakerelect bernard sanders is getting 
his first taste of the institution he describes as out of touch 
with the american people 
a selfdescribed socialist elected to the house as an 
independent from vermont sanders is among 44 incoming freshmen in 
congress enduring interminable orientation sessions lectures on 
everything from office allowances to ethics from computers to the 
customs decorum and unwritten rules of the house 
but sanders is determined to violate one unwritten house rule 
the dictum that freshmen be rarely seen and never heard 
people in vermont know me he said they sent me down here 
to cause trouble thats what they sent me down here to do 
the 49yearold former mayor of burlington lost no time keeping 
that campaign promise with rhetoric as unruly as his gray hair 
sanders took on congress 
youre asking me do i think the congress of the united states 
is out of touch with the american people he said i do 
according to sanders its time congress represented working 
people and poor people does this body do that today it does 
not the majority of the american people think as i do that 
this institution is dominated by big money and the wealthy 
will sanders line up with the congressional majority backing 
president bush on the persian gulf not likely 
i have very very very serious concerns about president 
bushs policies he said i absolutely do not agree that there 
needs to be an offensive war against iraq 
will he dive for cover at the mention of the dreaded word 
taxes 
ill tackle it he said the tax system in this country is 
an absurdity its grossly unfair you can solve the deficit 
problem by asking the wealthiest people in this country and the 
large corporations who have enjoyed huge tax breaks to start paying 
their fair share 
on nov 6 vermont voters dumped republican rep peter smith in 
favor of sanders a freshman smith ran afoul of antiincumbent 
fever fueled by budget negotiations that left republicans looking 
like the party trying to protect the wealthy from paying more 
taxes 
the antiincumbent mood was not limited to vermont 
at a session held tuesday by the democratic study group newly 
elected members were in an aggressive mood 
we have been in the trenches we have heard from the 
people said calvin dooley of california who defeated republican 
charles pashayan jr 
jim moran of virginia who ousted republican stan parris said 
he hoped the democrats would press their tax fairness issue in the 
new congress that is the democratic theme if we dont use the 
issue weve blown it he said 
while learning the ins and outs of his new job sanders tried 
with limited success to temper his naturally aggressive instincts 
after all while he sat among democrats he was not one of them and 
his relationship with the majority party was shaky at best 
i think its fair to say some of the leadership will not 
accept me with open arms said sanders he would like to 
participate in the democratic caucus while retaining his status as 
an independent 
the democratic caucus meets monday and the question of whether 
to admit sanders to its ranks will be on the agenda house leaders 
have taken no public position on the question 
even with a mandate to come down here and give them hell 
sanders is no different from his colleagues in his desire to get 
good committee assignments hed like education and labor and 
banking 
he talks less than he did back home about the need to throw out 
the two major parties 
as ive said to the people of vermont my election can serve 
as an inspiration to many people out in this country who are sick 
and tired of the twoparty system and i think that it will he 
said my function is not to be running around the country 
starting a third party my function is to be the best congressman 
that i can be

house majority leader richard gephardt is the 
first congressional leader to oppose authorizing use of military 
force in the near future to drive iraq out of kuwait 
the best policy now is to enforce the economic sanctions i 
am against authorizing force now gephardt dmo said tuesday 
in a telephone interview i think we should stay the course with 
sanctions against iraq 
gephardts opposition to a resolution is the first public break 
among the democratic leadership who said last week that president 
bush would have a better chance of winning congressional approval 
for the use of force in the persian gulf if the united nations 
first backed such a move 
house speaker thomas foley dwash and senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine did not indicate whether they support or 
oppose such a resolution 
as the senate armed services committee opened hearings tuesday 
on the gulf crisis democrats demanded that bush give congress the 
same opportunity as the united nations to debate a resolution 
authorizing military force 
this un resolution is not a substitute for fully informing 
the american people of our own nations objectives and strategy 
said committee chairman sen sam nunn dga 
today the committee hears from two former chairmen of the joints 
chiefs of staff william crowe and david c jones and former 
secretary of state henry kissinger 
the hearings stem from bushs decision to send 200000 
additional troops to the gulf region a move that increases us 
forces to about 430000 by january and gives the united states an 
offensive military option 
democrats who have been highly critical of bushs policy shift 
including nunn had hoped to question defense secretary dick cheney 
and gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
but the administrations top military officials declined to 
testify while the security council prepares to vote on a resolution 
threatening to use all necessary means to drive iraq from 
kuwait if it does not leave by january 
foley told newly elected house democrats on tuesday that the 
administration must seek congressional approval for using force 
even if bush wins un approval 
i would personally want to have some assurance from the 
administration that no action would be taken prior to this congress 
meeting or it would be necessary to think seriously about calling 
in the previous congress foley said 
sen edward kennedy dmass said it is not enough for 
president bush to go to the united nations to get approval for the 
use of military force in the persian gulf he must also come to 
congress 
another panel member sen carl levin dmich said it was 
incredible that the president feels the need to obtain un 
approval for a us offensive but wont commit himself to seeking 
congressional approval for such an operation 
widespread democratic support for the sanctions was evident as 
democrats indicated the administration has failed to make its case 
for military force 
the question is not whether military action is justified it 
is nunn said the question is whether military action is wise 
at this time and in our own national interest 
fighting the tide of criticism republican sen john mccain of 
arizona declared the issue is not prerogatives it is 
patriotism 
former cia director james schlesinger testified that the united 
states believes it will take about a year for international 
sanctions against iraq to take full effect 
schlesinger told the panel that was an official estimate but 
the former defense and energy secretary did not indicate the basis 
for his statement 
his society iraq is bleeding and its going to get worse 
with the passage of time schlesinger said but it may take 
somewhat longer for those difficulties to lead saddam to change his 
mind and withdraw from kuwait he said 
schlesinger said the united states must show tenacity and we 
must be prepared to stay a year in the desert of the mideast

bennett i want to direct your attention to march 6 1987 
do you recall having a meeting with sen riegle 
gray in march of 1987 yes i do after fhlbb aide mary 
ellen taylor had gone out the door he pulled me aside and he said 
you know there are some senators out west that are very unhappy 
about the bank boards regulation of lincoln and i think you ought 
to talk to them 
bennett of the five senators who are participating in this 
hearing as respondents who was the first one to raise with you the 
subject of a meeting with senators 
gray sen riegle at that time i protested i said its 
the same thing all over its the charlie keating vendetta 
argument the feud argument 
we went back and we sat down for a couple minutes and i went 
through with him how charles keating had been making these 
accusations for a long time and i didnt see why i needed to talk 
to these senators that i had the best team in the federal home 
loan bank system out there regulating this institution i was 
confident of that and then we got up and he said well 
youll be getting a call 
bennett tell us what transpired subsequent to that meeting 
which led up to your going to the meeting april 2nd 
gray somebody on my staff asked me told me that i had to go to 
a meeting i dont remember who it was but i had to go up to a 
meeting in sen deconcinis office and that i was to come alone i 
was not to bring staff 
bennett now have you ever been directed on any other occasion 
in your government service not to bring an aide with you 
gray never i arrived went to sen deconcinis office 
there were four senators in the room sen deconcini sen mccain 
sen glenn and sen cranston i sat down directly across from me 
was sen deconcini sen deconcini said mr chairman were 
here to talk about our friend from lincoln savings 
bennett you recall those specific words being used 
gray etched in my mind forever and as he started senator 
mccain said now we dont want to do anything thats improper in 
this meeting and i said well its not improper to ask 
questions 
bennett who was the friend 
gray charles keating then sen deconcini said were 
very concerned about this regulation this direct investment 
regulation of yours he said you know were concerned that 
its unconstitutional and he said wed like you to withdraw 
it until we can find out whether its constitutional he said 
if youll do that well get our friend at lincoln to make more 
home loans and i said well gosh if i were to withdraw this 
regulation how would we ever be in a position to find out whether 
it was constitutional that actually wasnt the issue it was a 
statutory and not a constitutional issue but apparently he didnt 
know that 
so i said you know weve gone through all the administrative 
process getting this regulation done we adopted it pursuant to 
the administrative requirements of the law and no im not going 
to do that what purpose would that serve 
bennett now did sen deconcini ask you to withdraw that on 
behalf of the sampl industry in general or sampl institutions in 
general 
gray no he said they were there for their friend at lincoln 
i told the senators that i simply could not answer their 
questions i said you know there are a number of reasons why 
first of all i really dont want to know anything more than i need 
to about lincoln i particularly dont want to know about this 
one any more than necessary because i dont want it to come 
through that i have a particularly unusual interest extraordinary 
interest in this institution 
i had been accused repeatedly of having a vendetta and only a 
few days before lincoln savings had petitioned that i recuse 
myself from any matter having to do with lincoln so i said if 
my life depended on it i could not answer all these questions 
youre asking me the only people who can answer these questions 
are the people who are regulating the institution out in san 
francisco you know you would have to find out from them i cant 
answer your questions 
bennett as best you can recollect can you describe the 
roles of each of the senators at that meeting 
gray sen deconcini was host and every time he said anything 
he said we we us we i assumed he was 
speaking for them 
bennett did you consider sen deconcinis request of you to 
withdraw the regulation to be usual or unusual proper or improper 
gray well i considered it to be improper of course 
because we had adopted that regulation pursuant to the law that the 
congress of the united states set up for the bank board that was 
our job to adopt regulations to protect the fslic the safety and 
soundness of the thrift system

the manufacturer of the hubble space telescope 
ignored three test failures and did not consult its own experts in 
building the defective 15 billion instrument a nasa 
investigation concludes 
there was a surprising lack of participation by optical 
experts with experience in the manufacture of large telescopes 
during the fabrication phase the investigative board said 
tuesday in its final report 
the manufacturer perkinelmer relied on tests with a single 
instrument called a null corrector for grinding the 945 
inchdiameter mirror and that should have alerted knowledgeable 
people in perkinelmer and nasa to the need for independent 
validation the report said 
there were at least three cases where there was clear evidence 
that a problem was developing and it was missed all three times 
said dr lew allen director of the space agencys jet propulsion 
laboratory in pasadena calif who directed the study 
perkinelmer now called hughes danbury optical systems 
rationalized away any independent measurement because of a 
belief that the null corrector was the only device that was 
accurate according to the report 
thomas arconti spokesman for the danbury conn firm said 
there would be no comment until officials had read the report 
the investigators found that perkinelmer technicians in the 
optical operations division were deeply concerned at the time 
that the discrepant optical data might indicate a flaw the 
report said but it added there are no indications that these 
concerns were formally expressed outside this division 
a similar lack of communication was cited as a contributing 
cause to the challenger space shuttle accident in 1986 
the hubble report said the management structure at perkinelmer 
raised a strong block against communication between people 
doing handson work and higherlevel experts 
the telescope launched last april from the space shuttle 
discovery cannot be focused properly because its 
945inchdiameter primary mirror is too flat in the center 
allen said blame belonged equally to perkinelmer and to nasa 
perkinelmer should not have allowed a situation that 
inhibited communications to exist allen told a news conference 
nasa had every right to expect that perkinelmer would have done 
a better job with this they had competency and experience in 
optics and nasa should have expected more professional performance 
than they actually got 
but he added it is fundamentally nasas responsibility as a 
government agency to get this done nasa should have been aware of 
what was happening at perkinelmer 
he said one change resulting from the challenger accident 
investigation is that methods for better communications are in 
place both in nasa and among its contractors the hubble telescope 
was built 10 years ago 
the investigators determined early in their probe and 
reiterated in their final report that an optical test used in the 
manufacturing process was not set up correctly and thus the 
surface was polished into the wrong shape 
perkinelmer design scientists as well as management for the 
company and for nasa failed to follow the fabrication process 
with reasonable diligence and were unaware of the flaws the 
report said it did not name any individuals 
some of the reasons allen cited were severe cost and schedule 
problems which he said caused management to pay attention to other 
problems also he said a number of review mechanisms did not go 
deep enough 
dr lennard fisk nasas chief scientist said he was certain 
the hubbles problems which include solar panels that shake the 
spacecraft whenever it passes from sunlight into darkness and vice 
versa can be fixed by visiting astronauts in 1993 he put the 
price tag at about 50 million 
nasa plans to put corrective lenses on the cameras even without 
the corrections the hubble has returned some spectacular pictures 
from space many with better resolution than ever seen by 
groundbased cameras

business is bad in jordan one of the 
countries hardest hit by the persian gulf crisis but food is 
abundant and promises of aid are trickling in from abroad 
the hashemite kingdom sandwiched between iraq and israel has 
survived the turbulence of the middle east since it was created in 
1921 but many analysts consider jordans current predicament its 
most perilous yet 
god help us if theres a war said fahed alfanek a 
prominent independent economist 
iraqi president saddam hussein who faces an international army 
opposed to his aug 2 invasion of kuwait could drag israel into 
the conflagration exposing jordan the oil that comes exclusively 
from iraq to meet jordans domestic needs of 60000 barrels a day 
would be cut off if war broke out 
the country would probably be flooded with refugees from iraq 
and kuwait as it was in august and september when more than 
735000 refugees passed through many had to be fed and accomodated 
until they could be repatriated 
prices of imported food including meat have increased 
considerably but fruit and vegetables grown in the jordan valley 
have become cheaper because they are not being exported to persian 
gulf countries anymore 
the finance ministry estimates that jordan has lost 2 billion 
in revenue this year because of the gulf crisis with a debt 
already at 83 billion before august such losses could be 
catastrophic 
fanek said jordan will be able to keep its economy afloat with 
1 billion in aid a year 
but so far it has only been promised 115 million by germany 
250 million by japan 20 million by france and almost 19 million 
from the netherlands as compensation for abiding by the 
unimposed trade embargo on iraq 
the european community also has promised aid but the amount has 
not yet been set 
king husseins refusal to join the antisaddam coalition and his 
advocacy of a negotiated arab slution has stirred widespread 
resentment in the united states europe and the persian gulf where 
jordan has traditionally found support 
amman hesitated to implement unordered sanctions on trade 
with iraq until august its main trading partner the government 
came under fire by the international community and was accused of 
dragging its feet in pressuring saddam a longtime ally of king 
hussein 
oilrich gulf countries opposing iraq cut all trade with the 
kingdom to pressure it to join the antisaddam alliance the saudis 
cut off oil supplies leaving jordan no option but to truck it in 
from iraq 
fanek said jordans losses have so far not yet seriously 
affected the kingdoms 3 million people 
but he stressed with the current stalemate we may start 
seeing shortages in two months time 
jordanian companies have maintained production levels and are 
planning for what they hope will be a limited disruption 
thats why they havent fired workers yet fanek said 
but how long they can do that is questionable because they cant 
export much of their merchandise the unimposed trade embargo on 
iraq has brought jordans only port aqaba to a virtual 
standstill 
the government estimates jordans export losses since august at 
440 million 
many businesses are reporting a drop in sales of up to 60 
percent supermarket manager ibrahim darakjian said business has 
suffered because the store has to close early under a government 
energysaving plan 
the people most affected are the jordanians who worked in kuwait 
before saddam troops invaded 
the government estimates that 300000 jordanians most of them 
of palestinian origin were in kuwait before the invasion at least 
half have come back to look for jobs in a country where by faneks 
estimation unemployment is about 20 percent 
most of these people were remitting an estimated 800 million a 
year twothirds of jordans foreign currency reserves 
those who kept their savings in kuwaiti currency became 
penniless overnight iraq decreed the kuwaiti dinar once one of 
the middle easts strongest currencies equivalent to the iraqi 
dinar 
iraqi currency is not convertible on the thinlytraded free 
market it was worth about onetenth of the kuwaiti dinar before 
aug 2 and less now 
the government estimates that jordanian workers lost as much as 
8 billion in property and savings

us troops tired of waiting in 
the desert welcome the possibility of a un resolution setting a 
january deadline for iraq to pull out of kuwait 
the sooner they take immediate action the sooner thisll get 
over and we can all go home air force sgt bill hubbard 21 of 
tarpon springs fla said tuesday 
some servicemen who arrived in saudi arabia soon after president 
bush ordered troops to defend it on aug 7 said the united nations 
should have set a deadline much earlier to prevent saddam husseins 
forces from destroying kuwait 
hes been in kuwait so long now hes just raping the 
country said air force tech sgt ricky presley 32 of little 
rock ark who arrived aug 16 
i think we should never have let him do that in the first 
place i think it a deadline should have happened a while back 
he said 
capt ali 34 a kuwaiti army tank commander waiting to go on 
maneuvers about 40 miles from the kuwaiti border also believes a 
deadline should have been set as soon as they attacked kuwait 
i dont know why they are waiting we were ready to go 
months ago said ali who refused to give his last name to 
protect his wife parents and four children still in kuwait 
1st lt bruce lake 29 of newport news va a tank platoon 
commander who has spent more than three months in the desert said 
he and his troops from the 69th armored regiment of the 24th 
infantry division would be delighted with a deadline 
but i dont think itll fly just from my reading of the 
situation and listening to the news i havent sensed that much 
unity and we still seem to be leading the way he said 
either an operation or a gohome date is going to boost 
morale he said we feel that we have the forces we need over 
here to do the job and push this guy out if need be and to go 
home 
the un security council is expected to meet thursday to 
consider a draft resolution setting a jan 15 deadline for iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait restore its government and release all 
foreign hostages 
lt col robert mccann 42 of west hope nd said 
international support is important because in todays world no 
one nation can just do what they want to thats why were here 
air force staff sgt jim white 39 fairfield calif said un 
support of the multinational force is essential to prevent similar 
aggression elsewhere 
how many times in the past has the united states been the 
almost sole bearer of international disputes now i feel if we 
dont come through on this one its going to have a domino 
effect he said 
as they stepped off a c5 galaxy transport after a 36hour 
flight from travis air force base in california some of the newest 
reinforcements for operation desert shield were equally hopeful 
we got to bring this thing to a head one way or the other 
said capt clarence ryan 40 of laurel md who was leading a 
unit of cooks and firefighters from the 60th military air wing at 
travis the long waiting game will it pay off we dont know 
but the longer we wait the more kuwait is being torn up 
after two months with a combat unit in the desert staff sgt 
douglas barton 40 of san antonio said he got tired of waiting and 
decided to end his 20year army career 
im not going to sit in the desert for no reason time for me 
to go he said as he waited for a flight home

the soviet union buys a lot of us grain but 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says policies of the european 
community also have had a major effect on the incomes of american 
farmers 
yeutter said tuesday that russia is a huge and valued customer 
of the united states and could become even more valuable in the 
1990s 
but yeutter said that what has happened in the last decade 
outside the soviet union has had a greater impact a far greater 
impact on farm income here in the united states and we need to 
understand that 
simply in terms of grain programs he said ec policies have 
resulted in the shifting of 50 million metric tons of grain in 
international trade 
a decade or so ago the european community was an importer of 
between 20 and 30 million tons of grain per year yeutter said 
now the community is an exporter of between 20 and 30 million 
tons of grain per year 
yeutter said this shifting has happened because of distortive 
practices followed by the ec in its farm policy structure and 
that has meant tougher times for american farmers in international 
markets 
next week world trade negotiators will reconvene in brussels in 
hopes of concluding the uruguay round of talks aimed at reforming 
global trading rules under the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade 
agriculture has been an obstacle in the talks and yeutter is 
pessimistic about reaching an agreement 
yeutter and us trade representative carla hills recently 
visited european leaders to urge compromises on agricultural issues 
confronting uruguay round negotiators 
i came back very pessimistic about the outlook and im still 
pessimistic yeutter said it seems to me the position of the 
european community is so far from that of essentially the rest of 
the world that i see no way to bridge that gap in the few days that 
remain 
japan which wants to continue protecting its domestic farmers 
by banning rice imports is the only country that is at all 
supportive of the ec position he told the agriculture 
departments annual outlook conference 
the ec members are belgium denmark france germany greece 
ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands britain spain and 
portugal 
yeutter said the united states wants a 75 percent reduction in 
tradedistortive internal supports and a 90 percent cut in export 
subsidies over 10 years 
the ec has offered a 30 percent cutback in internal supports 
based on 1986 levels but has not made any specific commitment to 
reducing export subsidies yeutter said nearly half of the 30 
percent reduction in ec supports has occurred since 1986 leaving 
only about 15 percent to be carried out in the next 10 years 
further he said the ec has not offered any net gains for those 
countries wanting more market access to the bloc 
if the talks fail and everyone goes home without liberalizing 
global trading rules it will mean a fullblown reappraisal of us 
policies 
well have to determine how best to protect our own 
interests yeutter said in essence well have to determine 
how to get the most bang for the buck in a more confrontational 
environment in international trade in agriculture and perhaps in 
international trade in all the other spheres of economic activity 
as well 
yeutter said he hoped such a gloomy development does not emerge 
and that were certainly going to go to brussels next week with 
an open mind 
but he added were not going to negotiate with ourselves in 
brussels next week were not going to come back with an agreement 
that we do not believe is in the best interests of this country 
and im certainly not going to come back with an agreement that i 
do not believe is in the best interest of american agriculture 
 
washington ap a new forecast by the agriculture department 
says the value of us agriculturaleexports is expected to drop 4 
percent this fiscal year to 385 billion 
export value rose to a nineyear high of more than 401 billion 
in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 
the volume of shipments also will drop 6 percent to around 1395 
million metric tons as sales of corn and other coarse grains 
decline the departments economic research service said tuesday 
although the decline in 1991 had been indicated by the agency 
for some time it was the first official forecast to include 
specific values and quantities 
lower world grain trade is expected following larger harvests 
by traditional grain importers and the us share of world grain 
trade is expected to fall following increased competitor 
production the report said 
corn exports will drop largely because of a onethird cutback in 
the soviet unions corn import needs also the report said larger 
199091 world wheat output has brought sharply lower wheat prices 
however it added higher prices are forecast for soybeans and 
soybean meal which will offset declines in the volume of 
shipments 
us agricultural imports were projected to drop slightly to 22 
billion in 199091 from a record 225 billion last year

the food and drug administration will take its 
first look at the safety of foods that are genetically altered to 
enhance certain qualities such as freshness 
although the agency questions its legal authority to regulate 
genetically altered fruits vegetables and other food crops the 
fda said tuesday it will grant a california companys request for 
review of a wellknown marker gene to produce genetically 
engineered tomato cotton and rapeseed plants 
even though we dont have legal authority people are going to 
ask us is it safe said fda spokesman bill grigg he said the 
agency may decide it has jurisdiction over food plants whose 
genetic makeup has been manipulated 
gene altering is used to create or enhance specific traits in 
foods the davis califbased company calgene inc wants to sell 
a tomato that keeps longer off the vine a cotton plant that is 
more resistant to herbicides and a rapeseed plant that has a lower 
fatty acid content 
the rapeseed yields industrial oils and canola which is popular 
among dietconscious consumers 
calgene and environmentalists say fda has regulation authority 
and it is time to prepare the public for the arrival of hightech 
food 
this genetic engineering in this context falls under their 
authority said roger h salquist chairman and chief executive 
officer of calgene 
we want fda to make sure ahead of time that were not 
experimenting with consumers said douglas hopkins senior 
attorney for the environmental defense fund 
we see this as a positive development that calgene is pressing 
the fda hopkins said his new yorkbased environmental groups 
says the fda must act because many firms are ready to enter the 
market 
both men agree that the foreign genes constitute food 
additives that give the fda jurisdiction because foods with 
additives are subject to premarket testing 
but salquist and hopkins disagree over whether the fda is 
prepared to do the job 
environmentalists like hopkins say the agency has ignored the 
issue and now must act in a vacuum salquist and his industrys 
trade group the industrial biotechnology association say that 
guidelines they helped develop will guide the fda 
in order to review something you have to have something to 
review said salquist who said he wanted the process to be as 
open as possible so the public can understand the issues 
the company said in a statement the approval of the kan 
gene by the fda will expedite and simplify the future approval of 
genetically engineered fod crops 
known as a marker the kan gene is widely used in biotechnology 
to identify and track altered cells it has been used on humans in 
clinical tests using genetically engineered cells 
defense fund biologist rebecca j goldburg said the ability to 
shift genetic material from plant to plant or between plants and 
animals vastly expands the number of traits that can be 
incorporated into food 
but the added traits she said could include poison substances 
in addition the group says the gene is resistant to the 
antibiotics kanamycin and neomycin 
however the company says the amounts would not detectably 
increase the number of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the body 
and the antibiotics arent that widely used 
richard d godown president of the industrial biotechnology 
association said about 100 genetically altered food products are 
in various stages of development 
the whole industry is not more than 15 years old he said 
most companies are less than five years old this is the first 
time weve gotten to this stage of development

hundreds of refugees seeking asylum in this 
country are being needlessly held in government detention centers 
a private group says 
the lawyers committee for human rights wants to expand a pilot 
project run by federal immigration officials in which 200 refugees 
were paroled into their communities in new york miami los angeles 
and san francisco 
most of the 200 appeared promptly for immigration hearings and 
have not disappeared the group said in a report released tuesday 
all were required to post a 500 bond as part of the agreement 
under the program which began in may 
some 2000 asylumseekers are being detained by the immigration 
and naturalization service while the government decides whether to 
send them back to their home countries detention typically lasts 
from nine months to a year 
among the participants in the pilot project said the group was 
a 23yearold woman whose cousins were killed by guerrillas in el 
salvador she spent over a month in a los angeles detention 
facility 
another was a 29yearold surgery professor from china who 
treated wounded prodemocracy demonstrators he was held in a miami 
detention center for three months 
hundreds of refugees applying for asylum in the united states 
are unnecessarily detained the committee said it sent a letter 
to ins commissioner gene mcnary asking for expansion of the 
project 
the ins said however that expansion would be premature at this 
point 
so far we like the program said ins spokesman duke austin 
but he said that it has not yet gone through a full cycle of 
events and needs to last for its full scheduled 18 months before 
final evaluation 
parolees have agreed to report voluntarily for deportation if 
immigration officers determine they fail to qualify for asylum 
well wait to see what happens on the question of whether 
they disappear austin said 
he questioned how much the program could be expanded calling 
the 200 the bestcase situations theyve got work got an 
address they dont appear to be abscondee types 
under a 1982 ins regulation aliens arriving without required 
travel documents are detained unless they are found to pose no risk 
of absconding and can get a relative or sponsor in this country to 
file a petition on their behalf 
most aliens seeking asylum are unable to meet those 
requirements says helton who lobbied the ins to launch the pilot 
project

president bush hopscotching across four 
continents in less than two weeks spent time today at a spot he 
hasnt seen much of lately the white house 
but not for long 
bush leaves again sunday for a weeklong tour of south america 
and after that he plans at least one foreign trip a month through 
april 
as the us economy weakens at home bush is spending more and 
more time overseas and like soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev the president is finding that he often is better 
received abroad than at home 
in his recent travels bush has met with dozens of world leaders 
as he seeks to build support for a united nations security council 
resolution authorizing military force against iraq 
international diplomacy often makes strange bedfellows as bush 
seeks to build his coalition he and his lieutenants have been 
conferring with unlikely allies 
that included a controversial meeting last friday in geneva with 
syrian president hafez assad the united states still considers 
syria to be a nation that supports terrorism with an abysmal 
record on human rights 
meanwhile secretary of state james a baker iii met in paris 
with chinese officials to discuss the un resolution 
china a permanent member of the security council with veto 
powers remains under us sanctions imposed in the aftermath of 
chinas bloody crackdown on dissidents in beijings tiananmen 
square massacre in 1989 
secret meetings between white house national security adviser 
brent scowcroft and chinese officials last year caused considerable 
controversy because of a ban bush imposed on highlevel 
uschinese contacts 
that ban is still in place but bakers overtures to the chinese 
caused hardly a ripple 
furthermore administration officials say they expect baker to 
confer with cuban officials in new york later this week on the 
persian gulf crisis cuba is a member of the security council 
although it is not one of the five permanent members with veto 
power 
bush has defended his contacts with leaders of regimes that have 
previously been scorned by the united states 
of his meeting with assad bush said i have no problem 
sitting down with him for this common objective 
for bush the recent spurt of international diplomacy may seem 
like easy duty after the two months he spent crisscrossing the 
country campaigning for republican candidates who often openly 
criticized his tax and budget policies 
like gorbachev bush is rejoicing in the cheers he gets from 
foreign audiences even as the us economy sours 
bush basking in a usmexican lovefest tuesday as he wrapped 
up a twoday meeting with mexican president carlos salinas de 
gortari in monterrey was reminded of the recent statistics showing 
the us economy teetering on the brink of a recession 
he conceded recession at home could damage prospects for a 
freetrade pact by increasing protectionist pressures in congress 
as the giant us economy slows down it may slow down even 
more it concerns me that some in our country and some in our 
congress might turn inward to what you properly label as a 
protectionist mode bush told a mexican businessman who raised 
concerns about us protectionism 
still that was just a temporary note of discord for bush on a 
tour that has brought him before the biggest audiences of his life 
when he was in prague czechoslovakia last week bush addressed 
a crowd of perhaps 200000 people in historic wenceslas square on 
monday in monterrey he encountered over 35000 at a town plaza 
rally 
somos una familia we are one family he told cheering 
mexicans in monterrey 
there was no one there to remind him that hed reneged on his 
no new taxes pledge that congress had just enacted a difficult 
fiveyear 500 billion package of spending cuts and tax increases 
that the nation at home was slipping into a recession that 
republicans had lost seats in the midterm elections or that the 
democraticcontrolled congress was skeptical of his persian gulf 
policies 
no it was all glitter and pomp for bush as he raised a 
champagne glass on tuesday at a state luncheon offering his toast 
to mexico god bless you all and thank you for a wonderful 
visit

the food and drug administration is being 
required to release results from animal tests of silicone gel 
breast implants that critics say would document a wide array of 
medical problems 
us district judge stanley sporkin ruled tuesday in a freedom 
of information act lawsuit that public citizen health research 
group is entitled to see the results of animal tests dow corning 
conducted over a span of 20 years and to see a list of complaints 
about the product from women 
the material was submitted to fda in conjunction with its 
regulation of the implants 
dow corning a joint venture of dow chemical co and corning 
glass inc has been a major supplier of silicone gel breast 
implants since the 1960s 
more than 2 million women have the breast implants in 1988 
there were 130000 implanted in women following surgery for breast 
cancer 
public citizen founded by consumer activist ralph nader filed 
the lawsuit in 1989 after it unsuccessfully petitioned the fda to 
ban silicone breast implants on grounds they can cause allergic 
reactions tissue swelling and damage to internal organs 
the suit was filed after a news leak from the agency that some 
of that some tests showed an increased incidence of cancer at the 
site of silicone implants in animals said dr sidney wolfe 
director of the research group

brown university women are scrawling the 
names of alleged rapists on the bathroom walls in a guerrilla 
attempt to get the school to do more about sexual assault among 
students 
brown spokesman robert reichley called the women magic marker 
terrorists and said they face expulsion if caught 
students said the graffiti is aimed at getting the ivy league 
school to take stronger action against socalled date and 
acquaintance rape 
its not an easy thing for a woman to take this action and i 
dont think anyone was taking this lightly or doing this 
vindictively or maliciously said lisa billowitz of brown against 
sexual assault and harassment or bash 
it was an act of desperation in an attempt to get brown to act 
responsibly and provide us with a system where we can air these 
grievances publicly as opposed to bathroom walls 
the list of about 30 names began appearing more than a month 
ago it has stirred strong emotions at the 7000student school and 
focused attention on the issue of college men forcing dates or 
other women they know into having sex 
its a controlling force of conversation said student 
stephanie cooper 19 
the names are based on allegations from victims or their 
friends students said it was unclear how many of the women if 
any have filed charges students said women on campus lack 
confidence the allegations will be handled effectively 
court proceedings can take years and a victim could be sitting 
next to her rapist in classes for a few years said jenn david 
21 a member of the universitys disciplinary council and a 
founding member of bash 
janitors have scrubbed the walls clean but the names keep 
reappearing keep this list going strong warn others a 
message on one wall said women also write words of support and 
advice usually unsigned 
adam gillitt whose name appeared on a wall wrote the student 
newspaper the brown daily herald proclaiming his innocence 
rape is a violent crime that takes away the voices and the 
choices of the victims so too do anonymous accusations without 
factual bases take away the options of the accused he wrote 
one woman told the providence journalbulletin the list helped 
her meet with other alleged victims of the same attacker 
together were thinking of pressing charges she said her 
name was not given 
no sexual assault cases have come before the disciplinary 
council but it has considered cases of racial and antihomosexual 
assaults and sexual harassment david said 
she blamed the schools lack of a written procedure for dealing 
with rape and said the deans were insensitive blaming the 
victim and steering them away from taking action 
they had the rapists write a letter of apology to the victim 
or attend a threehour alcohol counseling session she said 
rape statistics at brown were unavailable the school began 
compiling figures last week officials said 
we are proud of our efforts but know that they alone cannot 
correct one of societys greatest flaws dean of student life 
john robinson wrote in the campus paper while admitting that 
browns disciplinary system designed in the 1960s has become 
outdated 
a sexual assault task force of students and administrators was 
formed last summer but some students accused the school of acting 
too slowly 
some also want the school to appoint a dean of womens concerns 
draft a sexual assault policy improve security and give officials 
sensitivity training 
the rising militancy has disturbed some on campus 
i think the idea of a personal catharsis and a woman trying to 
work through her feelings are perfectly legitimate but i dont 
think a man should be able to be slandered and that is the crux 
said cooper 
reichley the university spokesman said the school has written 
the men on the list inviting them to file complaints 
i do not think that accusations of such a serious crime made 
anonymously can be described as anything but striking at the heart 
of the american judicial system of innocent until proven guilty 
he said

the race is on to perfect a plastic battery the 
size of a playing card that would make electric cars an attractive 
alternative to gasolinepowered vehicles scientists say 
interest is so great they say electric automobiles will be 
streaming down americas highways by the end of the decade 
its a matter of time said duward shriver a professor at 
northwestern university 
electric cars use no gasoline and emit no carbon monoxide 
making them attractive in a world worried about pollution and 
nervous about the persian gulf crisis cutting off oil however 
electric cars need several batteries to cover long distances 
without recharging and standard auto batteries are heavy and 
bulky 
the solution may be the cardsized plastic battery scientists 
here for a symposium say that the technology is available and that 
such a battery could be developed within a few years ushering in 
the mass use of electric cars 
were trying to replace batteries of a traditional kind with a 
battery of a much less traditional kind said mark ratner a 
northwestern university chemistry professor who received an award 
this week from the materials research society for his work with 
plastics 
general motors corp plans to manufacture an electric car but 
it would require 32 standard leadacid car batteries said 
spokeswoman toni simonetti it certainly takes up a lot of real 
estate in the car she admitted 
ratner said the leadacid battery is heavy and somewhat 
dangerous because it gives off toxic substances but batteries made 
out of polymers or plastics are light dont pollute and present 
few if any dangers he said 
other uses of polymer batteries include portable computers and 
smart windows with panes that change color to absorb or 
reflect heat depending on energy needs he said 
experts predict foreign countries or the us government rather 
than detroit will be the first to use vehicles with polymer 
batteries 
the french canadians japanese their governments have 
pushed more ratner said they were ecologically conscious a 
little before we were 
still scientists here said they are encouraged by external 
forces that have made new batteries a higher priority after nine 
years working quietly in polymer labs ratner said he has been 
deluged with inquiries since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and the 
price of oil became a national preoccupation again 
stringent airquality regulations enacted in california also are 
speeding up polymer battery experiments under law 2 percent of 
all cars sold by 1998 in california must be electricpowered 
from the standpoint of city pollution the standards in 
california almost force electric vehicles shriver said 
in the short run the purpose for electric cars is to cut 
pollution said spokesman jerry martin of californias air 
resources board 
but as technology improves there will be more advantages 
he said they will be cheaper virtually silent and for urban 
driving the vehicles can meet the needs

americans set a longdistance calling record 
this week that broke the one set the day after last years san 
francisco earthquake 
american telephone and telegraph said tuesday it has only 
theories on why 1484 million longdistance calls were made on its 
lines monday 
on oct 18 1989 the day after the san francisco earthquake 
atampt handled 1447 million longdistance calls said spokesman herb 
linnen on an average day the company handles 115 million to 120 
million calls 
traditionally the monday after the thanksgiving weekend is 
busy although there has never been one like this linnen said 
it was the busiest calling day in the history of atampt 
linnen speculated that people were trying to catch up on 
business or perhaps discussing the possibility of war with iraq 
but then there were a lot of calls to tollfree 800 numbers 
and that could mean people were doing more christmas shopping by 
phone he said 
atampt handles 70 percent or more of the nations longdistance 
calls

farm exports from this country are dropping but sales of wine 
have gone up 377 percent since 1985 for the first six months of 
this year they topped 51 million up 19 percent over last year 
japanese wine drinkers took one bottle out of every four 
the december issue of agexporter an official monthly 
quoted jeff hansen representative of a big california wine 
company as saying that japanese have a bias toward french and 
other european wines 
yet japan is one of the great success stories of the us wine 
industry he went on 
sales there have increased from 32 million in 1985 to 223 
million in 1989 the two top wine brands in japan are us wines 
bottled specifically for the japanese market 
winegrowing countries such as france and germany are harder to 
crack but he pointed out that the french know their wines and that 
makes sales easier germany has more potential as a customer he

politicians in islam are sometimes lukewarm 
about family planning because they fear opposition from religious 
leaders and people in moslem countries are less excited by the 
issue than americans says a pioneer of the movement 
imtiaz kamal of the pathfinder fund in pakistan sees growing 
popular support for family planning in islam citing the grand 
mufti of jordan and religious figures in iran the koran islams 
holy book says nothing about family planning one way or another 
she added tuesday in a meeting sponsored by the us agency for 
international development 
the agency has a major family planning program in the third 
world but does not promote abortion 
she emphasized wide differences in islam 
in some moslem countries females are liberated as in 
turkey she said in some countries they have to cover their 
bodies entirely as in yemen but some countries have topless 
beaches and remember who gave you bellydancing 
ms kamal said men as well as women should be brought into 
family planning programs

radioactive waste from nearly four decades of 
nuclear weapons production at the savannah river complex will be 
crystallized into glass logs at a new plant that cost 930 million 
to build 
converting the liquid waste into a solid will boost storage 
safety by eliminating the chance of leaks from deteriorating steel 
containers deputy energy secretary w henson moore said at 
dedication ceremonies tuesday 
for all those years all we did is store waste in tanks 
moore said today we begin a concrete solution no more talking 
no more planning instead a real solution to a real problem 
french scientists pioneered the process known as vitrifaction 
at savannah river the most radioactive waste will be converted 
into 2by10foot cylinders of black glass 
operated by remote control the plant will blend radioactive 
waste and powdered glass then cook the mixture at 2100 degrees 
fahrenheit to produce the glass cylinders at the rate of one every 
18 hours 
it will take about 15 years to turn all the waste into glass 
officials said nearly 6900 canisters will be made and will be 
stored in a honeycomb arrangement in a building shielded by five 
feet of concrete 
two years of tests with nonradioactive material will precede 
any work with nuclear waste 
researchers spent 400 million developing the plant which will 
cost 300 million a year to operate construction began in 1983 
unlike most of the nuclear sites other facilities the glass 
plant provoked little opposition state politicians support it and 
environmental groups are not fighting it 
since savannah river opened in 1952 it has accumulated 34 
million gallons of radioactive waste leaks in some of its 51 
underground tanks have contaminated surrounding soil 
we took advantage of nuclear power without being able to take 
care of the waste what some people have called the rear end of 
the nuclear industry said rep butler derrick dsc for the 
first time we have made a serious effort to deal with a serious 
waste problem and we have spent almost 1 billion 
the energy department owns savannah river and westinghouse 
savannah river co operates it its three nuclear generators were 
shut down about two years ago for safety reasons 
the new plant will treat about 7 percent of savannah rivers 
most radioactive waste the less radioactive waste will go to a 
separate facility where it will be mixed with cement and other 
ingredients 
on sept 30 officials began pouring the first batch of that 
mixture into a 600foot vault

for years the saudis have defended 
mecca and medina against possible attack by proiranian shiite 
moslem zealots now they fear that islams holiest shrines are 
threatened by iraq 
the saudis are preparing to confront possible terrorism linked 
to the standoff with saddam hussein when this years annual hajj 
or pilgrimage begins in june 
the saudi leadership is prepared to repel evil and harm and 
has taken precautionary measures to deal with anything that might 
undermine the security of pilgrims interior minister prince 
nayef bin abdelaziz said recently 
the saudis are tightlipped about security precautions in mecca 
and medina where nonmoslems are banned but travelers reported an 
increase in the number of security personnel and more intensive 
identity checks 
prince mohammed bin faisal bin turki who heads the islamic 
department at the saudi embassy in washington but is currently in 
riyadh said an iraqi attack on the shrines would be a mistake 
it would backfire on them he said its not the right 
place or the right time to try to stir things up 
thousands of soldiers from around the world were deployed to 
saudi arabia after iraq invaded neighboring kuwait on aug 2 
the multinational force was sent to protect saudi arabia on the 
assumption it would be saddams next target and to enforce trade 
sanctions against baghdad but the army could be used to attack if 
diplomacy fails to force iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
saddam could plant saboteurs among with the 2 million moslems 
who visit mecca and medina during the hajj as the iranians did 
before the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini died last year 
for the last decade the saudis have been grappling with 
iranianinspired terrorism including attempts by iranian 
revolutionary guards disguised as pilgrims to smuggle explosives 
and weapons into the kingdom 
there has been no suggestion so far that iraqis should be banned 
from making the pilgrimage the kingdom never banned iranians even 
when relations hit rock bottom 
in 1987 more than 400 people most of them iranian pilgrims 
were killed in what the saudis said were iranianinspired riots in 
mecca birthplace of the prophet mohammed who moslems believe 
transmitted the word of god 
the following year the saudis announced a quota system that 
restricted the number of pilgrims to 1000 for every 1 million 
citizens of moslem countries that would have cut the iranian 
contingent from 150000 to around 55000 iran has boycotted the 
pilgrimage since then to protest the quotas 
the differences between iran and saudi arabia are both political 
and religious the saudis were one of iraqs main backers in the 
iraniraq war 
irans 55 million people are overwhelmingly shiite moslem a 
breakaway sect saudi arabias estimated 9 million people are 
mainly members of the mainstream sunni sect 
iranian leaders have long demanded that mecca and medina be 
wrested from the control of the saudi royal family and put under an 
international commission 
the saudis broke off relations with tehran in april 1988 
accusing iran of terrorism and subversion but both sides have been 
seeking to improve relations since khomeini died and moderates 
gained strength in iran iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait spurred 
those efforts 
saddam has tried to don khomeinis mantle by denouncing the 
presence of foreign forces on saudi soil as a betrayal of islam 
but before august the head of secular iraq was not renowned for 
his islamic credentials 
meanwhile iraniansaudi relations have been warming the 
foreign ministers of iran and saudi arabia met in new york about 
two months after the invasion of kuwait in the first such senior

the stakes have never been higher as secretary 
of state james a baker iii returns to the un stage with what 
appears to be a winning hand in a dangerous game of chicken with 
iraqi president saddam hussein 
the issue could be no less than war or peace 
baker is meeting with other foreign ministers outside the united 
nations before taking charge of the security council on thursday 
with a us resolution threatenin military force to rid kuwait of 
its iraqi invaders 
a pokerfaced politician who helped lift his old texas country 
club buddy george bush to the us presidency baker has never 
run a graver risk than the threat to go to war over kuwait if iraq 
does not pull out by jan 15 
his managerial skills already have been put to the test as he 
carefully assembled on weary treks a lopsided majority to support 
the resolution 
his job now is to steer it through the un security council 
with a minimim of dissension and in a way that maintains the odd 
alliance that links such disparate states as syria the soviet 
union west european democracies the saudi monarchy and the exiled 
rulers of kuwait 
the idea behind this toughest of resolutions directed at saddam 
hussein since the aug 2 invasion is to frighten the iraqi leader 
into yielding but what if the strategy doesnt work 
the result could be the first war authorized by the security 
council to counter aggression since the action against north korea 
40 years ago 
the fear then was that chinas intervention could touch off a 
wider conflict the fighting stopped short of that 
the fears this time are several saddam could unleash a chemical 
attack inexperienced us troops could get bogged down in a desert 
war iraq could attack israel or saudi arabia heavy casualties 
could result 
standing defiantly in the range of iraqi missiles on 
thanksgiving bush acknowledged the dangers as he told us troops 
in saudi arabia 
no one knows precisely when this dictator may acquire atomic 
weapons or exactly whom they may be aimed at down the road but we 
do know this for sure he has never possessed a weapon that he 
didnt use 
bush sent baker on two long trips abroad this month to rally 
support for the us resolution threatening war to liberate kuwait 
and baker appears to have been successful 
china said today that it would not vote for the resolution but 
it has promised not to veto it cuba probably will vote against the 
resolution possibly also yemen the only arab country on the 
15nation council 
baker who made plans to see as many foreign ministers as he 
could today before thursdays vote has had the kind of break that 
any political operative relishes 
the soviet union after insisting for months that diplomacy 
should be given more time now has turned on saddam with a fury 
matching bushs 
incensed that baghdad has trapped more than 3000 soviet 
citizens in iraq president mikhail s gorbachev demanded monday 
that saddam withdraw from kuwait and free foreign hostages 
the fate of iraq is in the hands of its leadership he said 
time is running out 
until gorbachev leveled the threat at iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz in moscow the soviets were very cautious about 
threatening to use force 
but the caution gorbachev and soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze showed in their meetings with baker has now given way 
to unqualified support for the bush administration 
the shifting of the deadline from jan 1 to jan 15 represents a 
slight concession to the soviets and others hesitant to threaten 
iraq with all necessary means it also gives us troops more 
time to get ready to fight 
the additional two weeks could only make a difference if saddam 
were to do a 180degree turn and obey the resolutions he has 
ignored since the invasion 
since baker already has repeatedly rejected partial 
solutions there may be no facesaving way out for iraq 
the hand held by bush and baker will have been called 
 
editors note barry schweid has covered diplomacy for the 
associated press since 1973

led by an american libyas war on deadly 
flesheating screwworm flies is about to take to the skies 
after months of delays the aerial release of millions of 
sterilized flies will begin early next week according to an 
official from one of the un agencies leading efforts to wipe out 
the parasite 
test releases had been scheduled for august with hopes to begin 
fullscale release in january 
the program has been held up in part by initial us refusal to 
deal with libya and by the slow response from several nations to 
deliver on aid pledges 
officials are especially anxious since infestation by the fly 
which attacks livestock wildlife and humans has been reported 
moving toward egypt these days borne by westerly winds 
experts have expressed fears that the fly could move quickly 
down the nile river valley into central africa threatening exotic 
wildlife as well as livestock 
the fly was first spotted in libya in july 1988 and for most of 
the time since has been living in a narrow band in northern libya 
the experts say that the only way effectively to eradicate the 
fly is by releasing tens of millions of flies sterilized in a 
special facility in mexico that uses patented us technology the 
flies mate with flies already in the area the matings yield no 
offspring and the insect eventually dies out 
a us entomologist employed jointly by the un food and 
agriculture organization and the international atomic energy agency 
is in tripoli to oversee the eradication efforts said bjorn 
sigurbjornsson in a telephone conversation from the iaeas vienna 
offices 
the agency is involved because radiation is used to sterilize 
the flies 
us sanctions prohibiting americans to travel to libya or do 
business with it complicated planning for eradication the 
measures date back to 1986 when thenpresident reagan accused col 
moammar gadhafis regime of sponsoring terrorism 
last spring an fao official announced that the united states 
had reversed its position and agreed to let us technicians 
employed by international organizations travel to libya on un 
passports us expertise is considered crucial to the success of 
eradication 
the united states became the expert in eradicating the fly after 
a devastating infestation of lifestock in the american southwest 
the fly settles in wounds or tick bites and eats away at the 
flesh of its hosts a fatal attack for many animals 
sigurbjornsson said there was particular concern at this time 
because it is the lambing season in libya and trauma caused by the 
birth of the animals could be inviting to the fly 
september was a disaster we had 3000 cases of animal 
infestation sigurbjornsson said 
an official at the international fund for agricultural 
development another un organization based in rome said that 
donor countries had so far delivered about 60 million about 
twothirds of the aid sought earlier this year

californias huge point arguello offshore 
oil field its value boosted by the persian gulf crisis will 
begin producing oil within a few months after years of 
environmental and economic delays officials say 
a consortium of 18 oil companies will start pumping 20000 
barrels a day chevron corp spokesman mike libbey said tuesday 
chevron manages the project for the consortium 
the field 150 miles north of los angeles contains an estimated 
300 million barrels of heavy crude the biggest reserve discovered 
in the united states since alaskas prudhoe bay in 1969 
the consortium built a 22 billion pumping facility two years 
ago but it has been idle while the oil companies battle 
politicians and environmentalists over the safest way to transport 
the oil to southern california refineries 
the consortium said tuesday it will send the oil by pipeline to 
central and northern california while it continues the battle 
libbey said the decision to pump now is tied to iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait which sent oil prices skyrocketing and left 
future supplies of oil in doubt 
wed much rather have domestic oil he said that 
situation didnt exist four months ago 
earlier this year when oil dropped below 20 a barrel chevron 
said the consortium would have lost money on every barrel produced 
oil is now more than 32 a barrel 
the consortium had earlier held off production while it fought 
with local politicians and environmentalists over whether to 
transport oil from the site 10 miles off the central california 
coast by tankers or by pipeline 
the oil companies have sought permission to transport up to 
40000 barrels a day to southern california by tanker for several 
years until an underground pipeline to los angeles can be 
completed but santa barbara county officials and environmentalists 
say tankers pose too great a risk of an oil spill 
libbey said chevron appealed to the california coastal 
commission on tuesday to let it use tankers but a hearing is not 
expected for several months 
in the meantime he said the consortium will ship 10000 to 
15000 barrels of crude a day by pipeline to a unocal refinery near 
the coastal town of santa maria in central california the rest 
will go to refineries in central and northern california 
the consortium has approval to pump up to 100000 barrels a day 
from the field 
the ultimate preferred destination is los angeles because 
thats where the need is he said its the biggest gasoline 
market in the world

and the rise of modern finance and charles johnsons middle 
passage were selected tuesday by the national books foundation 
for its 40th anniversary awards 
chernow 41 of new york city said he wrote about 19th century 
american bankers to contrast their style with the likes of donald 
trump in the 1980s 
the morgans had a very different notion of what business was 
it was a gentlemens club against todays wild carnival of greed

washington in seattle is the first black man to win since ralph 
ellison in 1953 for invisible man two black women gloria

narrow complaint to broad celebration johnson said

slave ships recounts a terrifying voyage taken by a freed slave 
aboard a clipper in 1830 the trip serves as a catalyst for 
selfdiscovery 
you dont write out of your skin black and white americans 
share the same ideals ellison said after the awards johnson 
can take a slave odyssey and knows how it links up to 
shakespeare 
the panel that selected the fiction winner had been marked by

the fbi has illegally kept a file for five years 
on the head of an organization that defends political dissidents 
around the world the american civil liberties union charged in 
lawsuit against the bureau 
the lawsuit filed tuesday in federal court in washington 
accuses the fbi of violating the freespeech and privacy rights of 
lance lindblom of the j roderick macarthur foundation 
i am outraged that my own country engages in such insidious 
policestate tactics of keeping files on lawabiding organizations 
and people lindblom said 
the lawsuit seeks unedited copies of all material in the file 
destruction of the file an admission that the fbi acted unlawfully 
and monetary damages to be decided by a jury said harvey grossman 
legal director for the aclus illinois chapter 
in washington fbi spokesman carlos fernandez said the bureau 
does not comment on active litigation 
grossman said lindblom received 22 pages from the file after a 
freedom of information request was filed but the information was 
so heavily censored it was impossible to tell why lindblom was 
placed under surveillance 
he said the fbi cited national security concerns in censoring 
the material 
one uncensored item from the file was a newspaper column about 
lindbloms travels with a south korean dissident lindblom said he 
often travels overseas and his foundation helps defend dissidents 
on trial in sensitive areas of the world 
he said the foundation based in suburban niles has donated 26 
million in support of social justice since its founding in 1976 
among the causes it has supported was the making of the 1989 
documentary roger and me about the impact on michigan 
residents of the closing of several general motors plants 
i think it affects people dealing with us lindblom said of 
the fbis keeping of a dossier and how do you tell your 5 and 
6yearold sons which i had to do last night why the fbi is 
investigating you that was chilling enough

the federal government took control of 
the northeastern state of assam today postponing elections there 
and giving security forces broad powers to fight violence by 
militant separatists 
the first major political decision by the 18dayold government 
of prime minister chandra shekhar was approved at a cabinet meeting 
tuesday night a home ministry spokesman said 
the federal rule order must be ratified by parliament and can 
last up to six months without new parliamentary approval 
assam rich in oil teak and tea has been in the grip of a 
secessionist movement for two years militants of the united 
liberation front of assam say the benefits of the areas natural 
resources should go only to native assamese 
the militants have killed at least 100 people in the two years 
of their armed campaign in assam a state of more than 21 million 
people that is nearly separated from the rest of india by 
bangladesh 
the federal government which banned the front on tuesday 
claims the militants are trained by rebels in the neighboring state 
of nagaland and by burmese guerrillas 
assam is the third state to fall under federal rule punjab 
where sikh militants have been fighting for independence has been 
governed from new delhi for 42 months jammukashmir was placed 
under federal rule in january to combat a moslem seccessionist 
movement 
elections for assams state legislature were to have taken place 
by jan 8 when lawmakers fiveyear terms expired 
the legislature now stripped of power is dominated by the asom 
gana parishad or assam peoples party which rode to power in 1985 
on a wave of studentled violence for greater autonomy 
assam chief minister prafulla kumar mahanta the states highest 
elected official condemned the federal rule decision as a 
betrayal of the democratic process 
mahantas peoples party achieved an agreement for greater 
autonomy from the federal government in 1985 but more radical 
members of his party rejected the accord and formed the liberation 
front to demand complete independence 
mahantas party was part of coalition government of former prime 
minister vp singh chandra shekhar replaced singh on nov 10 
after leading a breakaway faction of singhs janata dal party 
assam is also being torn by a separatist movement among the 
animist bodo tribes of northern assam who say the hindudominated 
assam government discriminates against them

a longdelayed plan to boil off 
radioactive water left over from the 1979 accident at three mile 
island begins thursday 
i fully expect it will be easier to evaporate 23 million 
gallons of water than getting permission joe kuehn site 
operations director of the damaged unit 2 reactor said tuesday in 
announcing the start of the process 
the project was proposed in 1986 but government reviews and 
challenges from antinuclear groups held it up 
gpu nuclear corp operator the nuclear plant said the water is 
mildly radioactive and the raditation released poses no threat to 
the public 
the nuclear regulatory commission approved the proposal the 
state environmental resources department on nov 21 cleared the way 
for the process to begin 
kuehn said the water will be boiled twice and will take 18 
months to two years to evaporate 
trace amounts of radioactive tritium that could not be filtered 
out will be vented with steam along with smaller traces of cesium 
strontium and carbon14 kuehn said he said the maximum dose 
anyone could receive from the released tritium equals about one 
days exposure to naturally ocurring radiation 
fuel inside unit 2 began melting and radiation was released in 
1979 during what was the nations worst accident at a commercial 
nuclear plant

this winter will likely be the cruelest since 
world war ii for the soviet union and its former east bloc allies 
as recession compounded by rising oil prices continues to deepen 
un economists say 
in a report released tuesday the economists draw a grim picture 
of increasing food shortages in the soviet union bulgaria and 
romania soaring unemployment rates throughout the region and 
doubledigit inflation 
these threats could stall the whole reform process of moving 
from a command to a market economy they say 
the consequences of such a failure are incalculable and would 
not only be economic they warn in the 147page report which 
also pointed to increasing signs of social unrest in the east 
one certain effect would be to raise enormous pressures for 
emigration from the east to the west says the survey compiled 
by experts of the un economic commission for europe it notes 
that new soviet legislation would soon allow unrestricted travel 
abroad 
there seems to be little ground for contradicting the view 
that the people of eastern europe and the soviet union are facing 
their hardest winter since the end of the second world war the 
report says 
the survey also says slower economic growth in western europe 
and fears that the united states could slide into recession may 
have an impact on financial and technical support for the east 
moscows former eastern european allies depend on the soviet 
union for about 80 percent of their oil transmission breakdowns 
have already reduced soviet exports by more than a fifth the 
survey notes 
starting jan 1 1991 payment for soviet oil will have to be in 
convertible currency and at world market prices under the regions 
comecon trading system to be dissolved on that date moscows 
partners have paid the equivalent of about 750 per barrel in 
transferable rubles this compared with an average 18 paid on 
world markets before iraqs invasion of kuwait 
if eastern europe has to buy oil at 35 or even 40 a barrel 
then the price shock is much larger than the ones faced by the 
west in the 1970s the survey says 
the comecon trading system based on bilateral agreements has 
already effectively collapsed the survey says 
during the course of this year a chaotic mixture of barter 
deals clearing agreements and hard currency transactions have 
emerged it 
adds to avoid accumulation of rubles the survey says moscows 
partners have resorted to a variety of trade restrictions that led 
to retaliations and a virtual trade war

todor zhivkov the deposed communist dictator in 
bulgaria who was long regarded as the east bloc leader most 
subservient to moscow says he views his long political career as a 
big mistake 
if i had to do it over again i would not even be a communist 
and if lenin were alive today he would say the same thing 
zhivkov said in an interview in todays the new york times the 
interview took place at his granddaughters house in sofia where 
he remains under house arrest 
zhivkov 79 ruled bulgaria for 35 years until he was forced out 
last year but he said he began to doubt his belief in communism in 
the mid1950s and realized after the rise of mikhail gorbachev that 
the structure of communism was shaky 
i have been a soldier i have been a communist it is my deep 
belief and conviction that i served my people and my country he 
said but i must now admit that we started from the wrong basis 
from the wrong premise the foundation of socialism was wrong 
zhivkov is facing corruption and embezzlement charges bulgaria 
is in dire straits the country is broke and moscow is preoccupied 
with its own difficulties 
the nation is on the verge of selfdestruction national 
suicide he said it doesnt matter anymore whether the system 
is called socialism or capitalism 
zhvikov said his country would have fared better had it allied 
itself with the west early on instead of casting its lot with the 
soviet union after world war ii 
we were surrendered to stalins camp he said bulgaria 
would certainly be far ahead of where it is now if it had been 
westernoriented 
such remarks contrast sharply with comments made by zhivkov in 
the past twenty years ago he said the soviet union and bulgaria 
act as a single body breathing with the same lungs and 
nourished by the same bloodstream 
when reminded of such statements zhivkov dismissed them with a

president bush seeking to allay mexican 
worries about the evil vise of us protectionism is promising 
to fight any congressional efforts to raise trade barriers at that 
countrys expense 
bush cautioned us and mexican business leaders tuesday that 
protectionist sentiments may spread with the downturn in the us 
economy 
as the gigantic us economy slows down it may slow down 
even more it concerns me that some in our country and some in our 
congress might turn inward to what you properly label as a 
protectionist mode bush said 
but protectionist measures will not become a major problem 
bush said before returning to washington tuesday night from a 
twoday trip to mexico this president will continue to veto 
protectionist legislation 
i think most americans realize that if we are going to export 
we better not be protectionist bush said you cant have it 
both ways we shouldnt want to have it both ways 
bush was focusing today on the united nations debate set for 
thursday on a usbacked resolution to authorize military force 
against iraq unless it pulls out of kuwait by jan 15 
he was meeting with secretary of state james a baker iii for a 
briefing on bakers talks with un security council members who 
will be vote on the resolution 
bushs main reason for his visit to monterrey mexico was to 
discuss with president carlos salinas de gortari the prospects for 
a freetrade agreement between the two countries bush has asked 
congress for the green light to begin negotiations 
i dont think as we go forward on a free trade agreement its 
going to get caught up in the evil vise of us protectionism 
bush said monday before salinas hosted the president and his wife 
barbara at a state luncheon 
in a joint statement the two presidents expressed shared 
concern about the cases of violence on both sides of the border 
the issue is a sensitive one in mexico concerns have been 
expressed about violence in the united states against mexican 
immigrants the presidents directed their aides to develop 
recommendations on stopping such incidents 
they also agreed to develop a plan to deal with environmental 
pollution along the border including hazardous wastes produced by 
mexican industry 
the united states already has freetrade agreements with canada 
and israel some mexicans have expressed concern that us 
competition could overwhelm their companies under a freetrade 
agreement while others appear wary lest americans skew such a pact 
in their own favor 
salinas who rolled back mexicos high tariffs in the two years 
since he took office has expressed concern that protectionist 
attitudes are spreading in the united states with the worsening 
economy 
he also complained that mexican exports are subject to far more 
restrictions and regulation at the us border than are american 
products entering mexico 
bush underscored his hope for a successful conclusion to the 
uruguay round of international trade talks they are currently 
deadlocked over european agricultural subsidies which washington 
wants slashed 
bush said however protectionist sentiment in congress arising 
from the deadlocked talks and proposed freetrade pact can be 
managed

five experts in fireproof suits waded into a blaze 
feeding on as much as 23 million gallons of jet fuel and in half 
an hour snuffed a fire that had burned for 53 hours at stapleton 
international airport 
its just like the fire forgot what to do said dwight 
williams owner of williams boots amp coots of port neches texas 
he was one of the five men who extinguished the blaze tuesday 
the crew sprayed a smothering chemical on an 800000gallon tank 
and a 350000gallon tank after firefighters cooled the two 
containers that had burned since monday with foam and water so the 
men could get near the valves 
the larger tank was onethird to onehalf full the other had 
only a fraction of fuel 
up to 150 firefighters had battled the blaze but admitted they 
werent up to the task in tools or expertise 
the reality is this kind of thing doesnt happen very often 
and there are very few people who do it on a regular basis said 
fire chief richard gonzales 
denver officials had planned to let the fire burn itself out but 
changed their strategy after consulting williams boots amp coots 
continental airlines which owns four tanks at the storage area 
hired the specialists and flew them in 
gonzales said it took 13 minutes to suffocate the bigger blaze 
and 17 minutes more to snuff the other 
its like riding bad horses or jumping out of an airplane 
said williams who formed the company 11 years ago and ive done 
both 
a broken valve on a 400000gallon tank was thought to have 
touched off the fire which broke out sunday and spread to a 
400000gallon tank those two tanks burned themselves out monday 
but not before igniting the two other tanks 
the four tanks and a 24inch pipeline had a capacity of about 
23 million gallons of fuel but it was not immediately clear how 
much burned at the tank farm a half mile from the airport terminal 
the fire reduced the two 400000gallon tanks to smoldering 
crumpled hulks but left the two others standing all four tanks 
were owned by united airlines 
the fire forced the airline sunday to reschedule and delay 
flights by monday united had solved its shortage by flying in 
fuel and using tanker trucks

gov bob martinez has endorsed plans to 
protect the florida keys by creating a marine preserve that would 
be paid for in part by 5 fees on snorkling and diving 
the plan approved by martinez and the cabinet on tuesday still 
needs the legislatures ok 
the keys are a string of islands extending from floridas tip 
from the atlantic ocean to the gulf of mexico environmentalists 
say the areas coral reefs and sea grass beds are being destroyed 
by boats and overdevelopment 
the proposal approved tuesday calls for boundaries that would 
extend from the islands out three miles into the atlantic ocean and 
10 miles into the gulf 
martinez and the cabinet rejected one part of the plan that 
would have instituted a 50cent highway toll and 1 flight fee to 
help pay for the preserve left intact was a 5 fee on snorkling 
and diving 
agriculture commissioner doyle conner said the money shouldnt 
come from tourists simply because they travel to the area 
in my judgment they should pay when they dive or when they 
launch boats he said 
the proposal would also place sensitive areas of the keys 
offlimits to boaters and slap controls on treasure hunting 
tropical fish collecting and spearfishing

spurred by fears nuclear weapons could fall into 
the hands of separatists in the climate of eroding central control 
the kremlin has warned that troops will shoot anyone trying to 
seize military installations 
in statements published today soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and defense minister dmitri yazov denounced attempts by 
breakaway republics to form their own armies and take control of 
nuclear arsenals 
they also criticized vandalism of red army monuments and 
discrimination by civilians against servicemen and their families 
seeking housing jobs and services 
the army newspaper red star also quoted russian federation 
president boris n yeltsin gorbachevs rival and a leading 
advocate of greater autonomy for the republics defending the 
military 
we offer constructive help to the armed forces so that they 
are not drawn into the political battle yeltsin was quoted as 
saying at a session of the russian congress of peoples deputies 
more and more quarters have been speaking out against the 
armed forces in recent days yazov said in a speech televised 
tuesday night and published today in red star 
in several republics the formation of independent army units 
is developing in contradiction of the need for a united armed 
forces he said 
yazov said military district commanders have directives to 
take installations and systems under the guard and protection of 
armed units in case local civilian officials shut off their 
water power or other services 
soldiers have orders to use weapons if they or their bases 
are attacked commanders have orders to prevent acts of vandalism 
and counteract the construction of monuments glorifying 
fascists and their henchmen 
calls are heard to turn over nuclear weapons to individual 
republics gorbachev said making claims on nuclear weapons 
will not be allowed under any circumstances they have been and 
will remain in the hands of a united armed forces 
yazovs speech and a decree issued by gorbachev protecting the 
rights of servicemen and their families came 11 days after the 
soviet president said he planned major changes in the armed forces 
gorbachev has not indicated what reforms he has in mind beyond 
a previously announced plan to convert defense factories to 
civilian production and cut military spending in conjunction with 
eastwest treaties reducing conventional and nuclear arsenals 
those treaties have been accompanied by the withdrawal of many 
soviet troops from eastern europe and the de facto disintegration 
of the kremlinled warsaw pact military alliance the retreat and 
problems finding housing and jobs for displaced servicemen have 
battered morale in the armed forces 
attempts are made to defame and dishonor officers and 
soldiers and members of their families there are armed assaults 
against military installations gorbachev said 
army officials and publications have aired similar complaints in 
the past but they have proved difficult to verify and catalogue 
the strong words from gorbachev and yazov also had the clear 
intention of reestablishing the crumbling authority of the central 
government which is fast losing power to the 15 soviet republics 
gorbachev is pushing for a new union treaty to cede some local 
and economic authority to the republics but retain central control 
over defense and security foreign policy and international trade 
on tuesday gorbachevs communist party allies in the russian 
congress tried to persuade the body to vote on the union treaty 
yeltsin and gorbachev hammered out a compromise under which the 
congress would debate the union treaty but not vote on it

new york city has moved to take cigarettes out 
of the hands of youngsters by taking cigarette machines out of most 
public places 
a law banning the vending machines in all public places but 
taverns and hotel bars where minors arent allowed anyway was 
passed 331 by the city council on tuesday and signed by mayor 
david dinkins 
today we have achieved an important prochild prohealth law 
that will save lives said dinkins who quit smoking 28 years 
ago each year in new york 32000 children begin a habit that 
will lead to the death of 10000 of them 
the law which orders the machines removed by jan 31 1992 is 
similar to measures already in effect in minneapolis and salt lake 
city 
councilman jerome odonovan who cast the only vote against it 
complained it amounts to too much regulation and is unenforceable 
city law already restricts smoking in private work places and 
former mayor edward i koch banned smoking by executive order in 
municipal buildings 
dinkins said he wants the city also to phase out cigarette 
advertising in baseball stadiums and on city property

foreign minister qian qichen said today that 
china will not vote in favor of a united nations resolution 
authorizing the use of force to drive iraq out of kuwait 
however he refused to say whether china would abstain from the 
vote expected thursday or veto the measure us officials have 
said they expect china will not exercise its veto 
it has always been the position of china to call for a 
peaceful settlement of the gulf crisis and to avoid the use of 
force or the act of war qian told reporters at beijings airport 
while preparing to leave for the united states 
as one of the five permanent members of the un security 
council china has veto power over any resolution it has voted for 
all 10 previous un resolutions that seek to pressure iraq into 
ending its nearly 4monthold occupation of kuwait but it has 
expressed reluctance to see force used 
china and the four other permanent members the united states 
soviet union france and britain worked monday on a draft 
resolution that would allow all necessary means to liberate 
kuwait some us and soviet officials indicated they expected 
china to support the resolution 
but qian said such predictions have no basis 
asked if he meant china will not vote for the resolution qian 
said i think so 
asked if he planned to veto it he replied i have not said 
so i think you will know after i cast the vote i will not say 
anything before then 
the united states is the main sponsor of the resolution 
although the us government has said it already has authority to 
use force without it 
china may hope to use the threat of a veto to win a us promise 
to lift sanctions imposed after chinas june 1989 army attack that 
crushed a prodemocracy movement those sanctions already have 
crumbled in recent months due in part to chinese cooperation on 
earlier un resolutions against iraq 
qian said he planned to meet tonight with secretary of state 
james a baker iii concessions qian might seek would include an 
end to us opposition to world bank loans to china that do not 
address humanitarian needs a resumption of defense cooperation and 
military sales and agreement not to link chinas human rights 
record to its mostfavorednation trade status 
what china most wants is an understanding that bilateral 
relations will be conducted on pragmatic terms and that human 
rights issues such as the jailing of dissidents will not be raised 
at every forum 
qians visit strips one sanction the ban on highlevel 
exchanges of most of its meaning although the state department on 
tuesday insisted it remains in force department spokesman richard 
boucher said the sanction bars excanges of a formal and 
ceremonial nature but not contacts 
qian told reporters i see no difference between contacts and 
exchanges 
he said he expected to meet with president bush and discuss 
relations and a peace settlement in cambodia as well as the persian 
gulf crisis 
i think that this visit is a rather important event in 
bilateral relations he said he said he is willing to meet with 
us legislators is the american side makes such arrangements 
the us congress has been far stronger in its criticism of 
chinas crackdown on dissent than the bush administration which 
argues that direct attacks on the chinese leadership will have no 
effect

the barren shelves of soviet grocery stories are 
the result of a crumbling distribution system and panic buying not 
any real shortage of food a senior soviet official was quoted as 
saying today 
the amount of food in the soviet union has not diminished 
tass quoted first deputy premier lev voronin as saying on soviet 
television late tuesday 
the central government is toughening sanctions against those who 
fail to meet food delivery orders he said 
many regions of the soviet union have halted shipments of food 
and consumer goods to other parts of the country as a means of 
dealing with the collapsing soviet economy 
rather than obey the central governments demands for food 
deliveries to the cities at state prices they consider too low 
producers are trading food directly for other scarce supplies 
wherever they find them 
economic reforms also have freed farmers to sell more of their 
produce at market prices leaving less for delivery at dirtcheap 
prices to the state stores 
soviet and german officials have set up task forces to arrange 
transport and distribution of emergency food aid for soviet 
consumers facing barren shelves a highranking german official 
said today 
horst teltschik top foreign policy aide to chancellor helmut 
kohl told reporters he was to meet with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev to discuss food aid as well longerterm economic 
cooperation 
kohl has promised massive emergency aid to protect soviet 
citizens from hunger during the winter german red cross officials 
have already begun receiving contributions for the soviets from 
private german citizens 
the soviet union had a record grain crop this year but the 
centralized economy was unable to adjust quickly to bring in the 
bounty and millions of tons of wheat rotted in fields for lack of 
equipment fuel and transport space 
russian republic president boris n yeltsin warned russian 
legislators tuesday that food shortages have nearly overshadowed 
all other issues 
the latest consumer crisis to strike moscow is a milk shortage 
which has reduced the production of processed cheese cottage 
cheese and sour cream 
the capital has already endured scarcities this year of such 
staples as bread sugar cigarettes and potatoes

a procedure for freezing tumors offers new hope 
for victims of liver cancer one of the deadliest forms of the 
disease and may also be useful against prostate cancer a 
scientist says 
of 30 liver cancer patients who underwent the procedure six are 
diseasefree said dr gary onik of pittsburghs presbyterian 
hospital his work was reported tuesday at the 76th scientific 
assembly and annual meeting of the radiological society of north 
america 
the technique called cryosurgery can destroy tumors next to 
major blood vessels without destroying normal tissues nearby onik 
said 
onik and colleagues also have tested the ultrasoundguided 
probes that freeze cancerous tumors with liquid nitrogen on seven 
prostate cancer patients of those patients no complications have 
resulted onik said 
onik said the technique can benefit patients whose cancer is 
caught before it affects the whole liver he said radiation and 
chemotherapy are ineffective against liver cancer 
everybody we worked on by definition couldnt be helped any 
other way onik said 
the patients who are diseasefree have survived an average of 29 
months with the longest five years he said survival for the 
other patients has averaged 22 months and two whose cancer has 
come back are still alive he said 
the projected survival among comparable liver cancer patients 
who dont use cryosurgery is six to nine months onik said 
dr andrew gage deputy director of the roswell park cancer 
institute in buffalo ny said oniks technique offers hope to 
patients who otherwise would be lost 
he said conventional surgery is still preferred but cryosurgery 
might be better for the approximately one person in 50 who has too 
many lesions to remove with a scalpel but not so many that they 
involve the whole liver 
i think hes making an important contribution gage said in 
a telephone interview 
the technique involves making an incision into the abdomen and 
using ultrasound to find the cancerous lesions in the liver a 
surgeon then inserts a probe into a lesion and freezes it

riot police plunged into a crowd of about 
2000 protesters blocking a bridge in downtown sofia today and beat 
students who were calling for the socialist government to step 
down 
two students were arrested and one policeman was injured in the 
clash a doctor later said the students were badly beaten in 
custody and had to be hospitalized 
about 200 students formed a chain across the eagles bridge at 7 
am bringing rush hour traffic to a standstill soon the blockade 
was joined by a swell of trade unionists who have organized a 
general strike this week 
sympathetic drivers parked four trolley buses across the bridge 
many of the protesters wore blue armbands the color of the 
opposition union of democratic forces 
the protesters called for the resignation of premier andrei 
lukanov a former communist turned reformer who became increasingly 
unpopular as bulgaria slid into its most serious economic crisis 
since world war ii 
the protest had been going on about an hour when police in riot 
gear tried to push the protesters back from the bridge and drove 
one of the parked buses away using batons the police beat a few 
dozen protesters who pressed forward to try to stop a second bus 
from being removed 
the bridge was cleared by 10 am police spokesmen said but 
strikers tried to stop streetcars and buses in other parts of the 
capital a stronghold for the opposition 
the leader of union of democratic forces petar beron called 
for a twoday general strike to end today but others in the 
opposition vowed to continue it it was not clear early today how 
many workers were involved in the strike 
nedelcho terdiski a doctor at tirogov hospital said the two 
arrested students were brought to the hospital from sofias central 
police station with injuries apparently caused by beatings 
mayor alexander karakachanov called the police intervention as 
impermissible he said an investigation was being carried out 
and officers found guilty of beating detainees would be punished 
lukanovs government began talks with opposition leaders tuesday 
on resolving the standoff over how to run this balkan country of 9 
million people 
the opposition alliance on tuesday urged workers to end the

the conservative party elected john major as their 
leader but only queen elizabeth ii could make him prime minister 
the queen made majors appointment official this morning after 
holding a private audience with him at buckingham palace 
theoretically though she could have named someone else 
the governing powers of the british monarchy have been assumed 
by parliament since the early 19th century but sovereignty remains 
with the throne 
under the royal powers major could appear at the palace to be 
told by the queen that she had chosen someone else as prime 
minister harold brooksbaker publishing director of burkes 
peerage said tuesday 
margaret thatcher made her last stop as prime minister this 
morning in the room on the first floor of the palace where she and 
the queen had met most tuesdays since 1979 to talk about government 
business 
about half an hour later major entered the room for his royal

attacked riot police today as thousands of people defied a curfew 
to protest the state of emergency declared by president hussain 
muhammad ershad 
journalists went on strike to protest press censorship and none 
of the major newspapers published in dhaka ershad had said reports 
on the political unrest had to be approved by the interior ministry 
before publication 
ershads declaration tuesday night suspended all civil rights 
and imposed a curfew it followed six weeks of oftenviolent 
protests led by opposition parties who are demanding ershad resign 
in one confrontation on a major downtown street this morning a 
mob of 3000 people attacked about 30 riot police the police fired 
tear gas but retreated when the crowd charged 
similar clashes were reported in a dozen other places in dhaka 
a city of 7 million people demonstrators set piles of tires on 
fire 
in chittagong 125 miles southeast of dhaka groups of 50 to 200 
people marched through the streets denouncing ershad residents 
reported a few people set off small homemade bombs and police 
fired tear gas 
no injuries were reported in either city although gunfire was 
heard 
at least 10 people have been killed and 1000 injured in clashes 
between opposition workers and supporters of the government in the 
last six weeks 
troops in trucks and jeeps patrolled dhakas streets this 
morning to regain control of the city 
communications between bangladesh and new delhi hong kong 
london and other points went out about 1230 pm 130 am est 
international telephone operators in new delhi said their 
counterparts in dhaka did not respond 
a 60yearold former army general ershad took power in a 1982 
bloodless coup opponents charge that he rigged the three 
subsequent presidential and parliamentary elections to ensure 
victories for himself and his jatiya party 
i am declaring a state of emergency nationwide with immediate 
effect as destructive activities by a section of opposition 
parties have threatened internal security and the national 
economy ershad said in his 15minute television address tuesday 
night to bangladeshs 110 million people 
the awami league and the bangladesh nationalist party the 
countrys two major opposition parties have been agitating for 
ershads resignation for years their campaign faded out after the 
1988 parliamentary elections because of differences between them 
the two groups recently ended their dispute 
the awami league leader sheik hasina was placed under house 
arrest tuesday night but was freed several hours later aide mrinal 
kanti said 
kanti said that after police were withdrawn from her home ms 
hasina told supporters the people will defy the curfew and all 
restrictions ershads last days have arrived 
ms hasina is the daughter of bangladeshs first president 
sheik mujibur rahman who was assassinated during a military coup 
in 1975 
there was no firm word on the whereabouts of the other top 
oppositiion leader khaleda zia mrs zia leader of the bangladesh 
nationalist party and the widow of another assassinated president 
fled her house shortly before it was raided by police tuesday 
night her supporters said 
her late husband ziaur rahman was killed in 1981 during one of 
the coups that became commonplace after bangladesh broke away from 
pakistan in a 1971 civil war in its 19 years of independence 
bangladesh has never changed leaders through the ballot box 
last month ms hasina and mrs zia put aside their personal 
rivalries and combined forces to launch a new series of antiershad 
protests and strikes 
they want ershad to resign before the presidential elections 
scheduled for june 1991 and hand over power to a caretaker 
government ershad has declared he will seek reelection to a 
second fiveyear term

the deputy prime minister said today 
president bush should initiate a dialogue with iraq to restore 
peace in the persian gulf another official denied that baghdad is 
preventing soviets from leaving 
iraq has called for dialogue with the united states previously 
but us officials have said there is nothing to discuss as long as 
iraq refuses to free all foreign hostages and withdraw 
unconditionally from kuwait 
minister taha yassin ramadan called for talks one day before the 
un security council was expected to vote on a ussponsored 
resolution setting jan 15 as a deadline for iraq to withdraw from 
kuwait or face possible attack 
the ruling baath party newspaper reiterated today iraqs 
rejection of such a resolution 
in his remarks to an arab youth solidarity conference ramadan 
said bush is leading the entire world to a ruinous war 
he said bush has no choice other than to come to his senses 
and initiate a dialogue that will allow the region to avoid the 
catastrophes of war 
he indicated however that iraq had not softened its position 
on kuwait saying baghdad was intent on ousting aggressors and 
traitors from arab territory 
iraq is determined to defeat the forces of evil and emerge 
victorious if war breaks out he said iraqi forces possess a 
substantial quantity o sophisticated arms and experienced 
fighters he said 
the soviet foreign ministry on monday accused baghdad of 
breaking a promise to allow hundreds of soviets in iraq to leave 
and threatened a tougher attitude if they were not granted 
freedom 
but an iraqi foreign ministry spokesman said today the soviets 
are working in iraq according to contracts 
we told the soviet officials that iraq will allow any soviet 
to leave iraq when his contract ends he said on condition of 
anonymity 
iraq has taken no illegal measures against soviets he said 
indicating that they are not hostages 
more than 8000 soviets were in iraq and kuwait before baghdads 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait fewer than half that number remain many 
soviets worked in oil fields and as specialists at military 
installations 
soviet sources in baghdad say more than 2000 have applied for 
exit visas but they are not getting them from iraqi officials 
before the gulf crisis the soviet union was baghdads chief 
weapons supplier and a key ally 
on tuesday the soviet union and the united states two of the 
security councils five permanent members agreed to set jan 15 as 
iraqs deadline to pull its troops from kuwait 
but althawra the official party newspaper said today that 
security council members supporting the latest resolution could 
cause a war 
the great iraq decisively and categorically refuses to be 
dictated to by anybody whomever this could be the paper said in 
a frontpage editorial 
those who will gather tomorrow to pass the americandictated 
resolution will be responsible for unleashing the us aggression 
under the flag of the united nations althawra said

a palestinian teenager today stabbed a swedish 
nurse in the back in a gaza strip hospital and left a note attached 
to the knife that protested foreign interference in the persian 
gulf 
the victim was in stable condition with a wound in her shoulder 
said dr tori farsund a swede who is director of the ahli arab 
hospital in gaza city police could not be reached for immediate 
comment on the attack 
palestinian witnesses said the victim ingrid idden 28 of 
stockholm apparently stood out as a foreigner because of her blond 
hair 
the witnesses said the attacker a palestinian wearing blue 
jeans and a brown shirt walked into the hospital shouted the 
islamic war cry allahu akbar god is great and plunged a 
knife into the womans upper back 
the attacker fled he was not wearing a mask over his face as 
many palestinian militants do when carrying out acts of violence 
the witnesses said but ms idden reached by telephone later said 
she could not identify her attacker because she only saw him from 
behind as he fled 
she said she was unsure whether she would return to sweden 
the attack followed leaflets from the moslem fundamentalist 
group hamas or zeal condemning the foreign presence in the gulf 
region the united states has gathered a coalition of western and 
arab countries against iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the attackers note began with the opening lines of moslem 
prayers in the name of god most gracious most merciful 
it said in black ink the knight of al aqsa claims 
responsibility for the stabbing attack in revenge for foreign 
interference in the gulf this is the beginning of bigger attacks 
against foreign tourists 
the knight of al aqsa does not belong to any faction it 
added 
the reference was to jerusalems al aqsa mosque one of the 
holiest landmarks of islam and the site of riots last month in 
which 17 palestinians were killed by israeli police gunfire 
farsund said he believed it was the first such attack on a 
foreigner in the hospital which has treated thousands of wounded 
palestinians during the 3yearold uprising against israeli 
occupation of gaza and the west bank

passenger rail service resumed in eastern germany 
today but striking rail employees kept nearly 500 freight trains 
waiting at the former nations borders officials said 
bargainers for the union of german rail workers and the rail 
system the reichsbahn resumed talks today aimed at ending the 
walkout 
the union promised late tuesday to resume passenger service but 
continued to halt freight service reichsbahn spokesman joachim 
miethling said up to 500 freight trains were standing idle at the 
formrr east germanys borders 
but passenger service was only running slightly behind schedule 
he said 
the unions decision to resume at least partial service came in 
the wake of growing public resentment of the strike most eastern 
germans do not have cars and must rely on rail transport to visit 
other cities 
about 260000 reichsbahn employees went on strike monday after 
negotiations with the rail system broke down 
strike leaders fear up to 68000 workers in the five new eastern 
states will be laid off as the reichsbahn undergoes capitalist 
restructuring the strikers are demanding protection against 
widespread layoffs and pay increases 
the strike was the first major labor dispute since the two 
germanys unified oct 3 and some experts fear it could begin 
widespread labor unrest 
the former communist country making a swift transition to the 
free market is expected to experience nearly 50 percent 
unemployment next year as former staterun enterprises collapse in 
the face of western competition

a woman accused of negligent homicide in the 
death of her leukemiastricken son told police she never took the 
boy to a doctor because it was up to god to heal him according to 
a tape played in court

anneta williamson 43 and police detective tim oliver shortly 
after the death of her 5yearold son don 
coroner vincent cefalu testified that the boy died of acute 
lymphocytic leukemia in june 1989 
he said there is a 7075 percent chance of the disease going 
into remission when chemotherapy is administered

her son who had not been seen by a doctor since the day he was 
born she is a member of the oak grove church of god which

1985 state law that recognizes religious healing in cases involving 
children 
if convicted by the sixmember district court jury she faces a 
maximum sentence of five years in prison and a 5000 fine 
about 50 members of her church packed the small courtroom 
tuesday several wept as they listened to the recording of oliver

yes sir mrs williamson said i loved my son he was 
very precious to me i prayed and i fasted and i looked to the lord 
to heal him but he had other plans

the official bta news agency said today 
that andrei lukanov will resign as premier he told journalists the 
report was premature but did not directly deny it 
bta said it learned from a source close to president zhelyu 
zhelev that lukanov a socialist who took office in february 
would be replaced by a politician who is a member of neither the 
socialist party nor the main opposition union of democratic forces 
such an agreement could put an end to repeated protests in 
bulgaria against lukanovs government of former communists and end 
a political stalemate that has blocked action to remedy the 
countrys severe economic problems 
lukanov a former communist turned reformer became increasingly 
unpopular as bulgaria faced its worst economic crisis since world 
war ii 
electricity many foodstuffs and consumer goods are rationed or 
simply unavailable in sofia and throughout this balkan country of 9 
million people the country cannot make the payments on its 11 
billion foreign debt 
early today police beat students who barred a main intersection 
in the capital and a general strike called by the podkrepa trade 
union entered its third day the strike called to bring down the 
lukanov government appeared to be gaining momentum 
bta reported it had learned a deal would be announced later 
today giving bulgaria a new caretaker cabinet and a new premier 
there was no independent confirmation of the report 
lukanov did not deny a deal was being worked out but he said 
the composition of a new government had not yet been discussed 
i hope this will happen soon because the current situation 
must not continue he told reporters in sofia 
he reiterated that the country needs a coalition government and 
calm negotiations lukanov previously has tried to draw the 
opposition into a coalition headed by socialists 
the premier last week survived a noconfidence vote in 
parliament and won approval of his austerity budget after the 
opposition walked out of the chamber he had threatened to resign 
if the budget was not approved but said he could not be heckled 
into quitting 
president zhelev brought together socialist and opposition 
leaders on tuesday to work out a compromise spokesmen for the 
socialists and the opposition coalition said on tuesday they have 
agreed to set up a panel to work out a timetable for enacting key 
economic laws and a new constitution 
this morning riot police confronted protesters on eagles 
bridge where about 2000 demonstrators gathered to demand 
lukanovs resignation shouting lukanov resign and this will 
continue every day 
two student protesters were arrested and one policeman was 
injured in the clash sofia radio reported a doctor said the 
arrested students also were injured 
about 200 students formed a human chain across the bridge at 7 
am bringing rush hour traffic to a standstill 
the blockade was joined by stranded bus passengers and workers 
and sympathetic drivers parked four trolley buses across the 
bridge many protesters wore blue armbands the color of the union 
of democratic forces 
riot police arrived at the bridge using shields to clear a path 
and driving away one parked bus officers beat a few dozen 
protesters with batons after the demonstrators pressed forward to 
try to stop a second bus from being removed after brief scuffles 
police and demonstrators retreated 
a police spokesman told the radio the bridge was cleared by 10 
am adding strikers also tried to stop trams and buses in other 
parts of the capital 
dr nedelcho terdiski said the two arrested students were 
brought to his hospital from sofia central police station with 
injuries apparently caused by beatings the radio reported 
mayor alexander karakachanov also interviewed on radio 
described the police intervention as impermissible he promised 
strict measures would be taken against any officers found 
guilty of beating detainees 
the general strike appeared to gain strength today 
the national airline balkan suspended all flights because of the 
strike radio reports said and striking teachers thronged the 
education ministry in the capital miners from the town of pernik 
arrived in sofia to demonstrate 
radi and television workers announced they supported the strike 
but would continue to broadcast the news 
podkrepa said on tuesday that 790000 bulgarians took part in 
the general strike including 220000 in sofia 
bta reported 500000 workers about 11 percent of the work 
force were on strike tuesday the government said only one worker 
out of 100 struck 
also today the new york times published an interview with todor 
zhivkov the communist dictator who ruled bulgaria for 35 years 
until being forced out in 1989 he said bulgaria should have allied 
itself with the west long ago 
the nation is on the verge of selfdestruction national 
suicide he said it doesnt matter anymore whether the system 
is called socialism or capitalism

the legislature today rejected a bid to make 
hong kongs election laws more liberal and some activists said the 
move would make it easier for china to break a promise of selfrule 
for the territory 
the activists fear if the democracy does not gain root in hong 
kong before beijing assumes control in 1997 china will easily be 
able to break its promise allowing the territory to rule itself for 
50 years 
lawmakers rebuffed attempts to lower the territorys voting age 
to 18 and establish an independent election commission also 
rejected were calls to allow the use of names of political parties 
on ballot sheets and absentee balloting 
the actions came as the legislature known as the legislative 
council passed a law designed to ready the territory for its first 
direct elections of the legislature next year more than half of 
the lawmakers in the body largely considered a rubber stamp for 
government policies are government appointees 
rather than seek to develop the institutions and practices 
that will enable hong kong people to rule hong kong the government 
has sought to stifle the development of democratic institutions 
lawmaker martin lee during a sometimes heated debate today 
lee and two other lawmakers in the 56member body had sought the 
amendments to the election bill in a lastditch effort to bring 
hong kongs election law in line with those of most western 
democracies 
in britain for example the voting age is 18 in australia an 
independent election commission helps decide critical issues such 
as the boundaries of constituencies most western nations also 
allow absentee balloting 
in hong kong voters have to be 21 years or older all critical 
issues regarding the election are decided by the colonial 
government and absentee voting is prohibited 
in the direct elections for the legislative council next year 
18 of the legislatures then60 seats will be chosen by direct 
vote the remaining seats will either be appointed by the 
government or elected by special interest groups such as teachers 
and businessmen 
the hong kong government has said it opposed the amendments 
because it did not have enough time to consider them the 
government has been working on its election law since february 
1988 
lee and other activists have charged however that the 
government has fought the amendments because they would make hong 
kong more democratic 
they say hong kongs most politically active generation is 
between 18 and 21 years old and the colonial government does not 
want to give them the vote

a piece of a b17 bomber buried for 48 
years in the greenland icecap was presented today to the woman 
whose name was painted on the piece of metal by her pilot husband 
before he flew off to fight the nazis 
explorers who found the bomber buried in the arctic icecap 
presented the keepsake to phyllis arlene hanna this morning at 
peachtreedekalb airport north of atlanta 
in return mrs hanna of st louis gave keys to the plane 
tuesday to the explorers who set out nine years ago to locate eight 
american warplanes that crashlanded in greenland in july 1942 on 
their way to england 
the two b17s and six p38 lightning fighters ran out of fuel 
after receiving false radio transmissions from german submarines 
the crews camped for nine days until rescuers arrived on dog sled 
one of those rescued was mrs hannas husband joe d hanna jr 
who had painted her name under his cckpit window hanna died in 
1981 the year the greenland expedition society was formed to find 
and maybe even fly the planes out 
theyve been in my basement 48 years mrs hanna said of the 
keys id much rather have a piece of the plane with my name on 
it 
the expedition which raised donations located the bomber with 
radar in 1988 and used a borer to cut a 3footwide hole and take 
the piece with mrs hannas name on it last summer the explorers 
cut a much larger cavern 20 feet long on one side 
the fuselage of the bomber was found to have collapsed under the 
weight of 250 feet of ice movement within the glacier had broken 
it apart 
it was of course a disappointment said pat epps 
cofounder of the expedition explorers removed the top turret of 
the b17 and two machine guns ammunition instruments and other 
memorabilia 
the b17 is certainly not flyable said epps we expect 
when the p38s are excavated they would not be flyable from the 
icecap 
because of technical problems and water from the glacier filling 
their hole as fast as they could pump it out the expedition didnt 
get to a fighter 
next year we are giving our full attention to the p38 
epps said

three americans and 10 britons left amman 
for europe today one day after being freed by iraqi authorities 
and 77 italians left baghdad aboard an iraqi airways flight 
five freed germans were also preparing to leave jordan for home 
and six of the 47 canadians held in iraq and kuwati will be freed 
robert cordett a member of canadas parliament said in baghdad 
meanwhile britains foreign office said today that 55 britons 
detained in baghdad have been moved to strategic sites in iraq 
there are about 500 britons hiding in kuwait and about 350 being 
held at strategic sites in iraq 
in iraq president saddam hussein today directed his parliament 
to discuss freeing belgian hostages and an iraqi official denied 
that baghdad was stopping soviets from leaving 
the americans and their families were flying to frankfurt aboard 
a royal jordanian flight another royal jordanian flight for london 
took off shoftly afterward carrying the 10 former british hostages 
and their families 
the freed europeans and americans had been held at strategic 
sites to deter attack by the multinational forces that assembled in 
the persian gulf after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
about 2000 westerners remain captive and many are belived in 
hiding in the occupied emirate 
the five germans who were in hiding before emerging saturday to 
take advantage of an iraqi decision to free all german nationals 
were to fly to frankfurt aboard a lufthansa flight thursday 
according to the german embassy 
the italian embassy said the italians would leave for rome 
aboard a chartered alitalia jetliner shortly after arriving in 
amman 
the britons and americans were released after their families 
flew to baghdad and appealed to saddam to free them 
the state department which has said iraq should free all 
hostages unconditionally warned american relatives of hostages not 
to travel to iraq saying they could become hostages themselves or 
play into the hands of iraqi propagandists the british government 
took a similar stance 
but briton dorothy goodwin 55 whose husband peter was a 
pilot with kuwait airways said she did not feel her group had been 
manipulated by the iraqis 
mrs goodwin expressed concern on the plight of men currently 
held at iraqi military sites 
i saw men aboslutely breaking down others went into pieces to 
make phone calls to their families others were ashamed to cry in 
front of you it was a tragic situation she said 
the freed americans are john stevenson of panama city fla 
clyde jesse of buffalo grove ill and fred harrington of 
bellevue wash 
stevenson a computer specialist who worked in kuwait for 11 
years was freed after his twin mary trundy of brockton mass 
and his brothers bill stevenson of panama city and james 
stevenson of sarasota fla visited baghdad 
harringon was freed when his son vala fouroohi flew to 
baghdad 
jesses wife honey also flew to baghdad 
saddam has offered to free foreigners in exchange for guarantees 
he will not be attacked on nov 18 he offered to free all 
foreigners between dec 25 and march 25 provided no hostilities 
break out 
he has released hostges on a piecemeal basis in reponse to 
pleas from visiting dignitaries from several nations washington 
has condemned the sporadic releases as aimed at dividing the 
alliance arrayed against iraq 
today the official iraqi news agency said saddam had decided 
parliament should discuss the status of belgian hostages the 
mechanism used in the past for freeing french bulgarians swedes 
swiss and others 
the report did not specify how many of the about 30 belgians in 
iraq and kuwait would be set free ina said the measure came in 
response to statements made by the belgian government about finding 
a peaceful solution to the crisis 
the soviet foreign ministry on monday accused baghdad of 
breaking a promise to allow hundreds of soviets in iraq to leave 
and threatened a tougher attitude if they were not granted 
freedom 
but an iraqi foreign ministry spokesman said today the soviets 
were fulfilling work contracts in iraq and would be allowed to 
leave when the contracts were up 
more than 8000 soviets were in iraq and kuwait before the 
invasion fewer than half that number remain

a federal judge today lifted his ban against cable 
news networks broadcast of manuel noriegas prison phone calls to 
his legal team 
the ban on cnns use of the tape had sparked a fierce 
constitutional debate pitting the right of free speech against the 
right to a fair trial 
the tapes may be published as cnn wishes to publish them 
said us district judge william hoeveler during a morning hearing 
noriegas attorney frank rubino said he no longer had any 
objection to cnns use of the tapes the only tape he challenged 
was a conversation between noriega and his defense team which had 
already been broadcast by cnn 
it does no good to close the barn door after the horse is 
out rubino said today 
the judge also ordered the federal bureau of prisons to stop its 
practice of sharing taperecorded conversations in the noriega case 
with other government agencies 
hoeveler last month temporarily barred cnn from using parts of 
taped conversations between noriega and his attorneys who said 
airing the tapes would destroy the ousted panamanian dictators 
defense against drug charges 
cnn broadcast some tapes including a conversation between 
noriega and rubinos secretary who acted as a translator for 
rubinos investigator 
an appeals court and the us supreme court refused to lift the 
order and cnn last week turned over the tapes it had obtained to 
hoeveler for review 
in atlanta cnn spokesman steve haworth said it was doubtful 
that cnn would broadcast any of the tapes today 
rubino after the hearing said he still intended to ask for 
contempt penalties against cnn for airing the tapes despite 
hoevelers order 
steven korn attorney for cnn parent turner broadcasting system 
inc said the network contended from the beginning that prior 
restraint was wrong 
its fizzled no prior restraint is ever appropriate korn 
said outside the courtroom he also said he considered the contempt 
issue moot 
korn emphasized the judges order to the bureau of prisons 
saying that was the correct approach to dealing with the taping of 
noriegas phone calls 
noreiga who is awaiting trial on charges of taking 46 million 
in payoffs to protect cocaine trade through panama is being held 
in a federal prison near miami federal prison authorities monitor 
and tape record all inmates telephone conversations except those 
between inmates and their lawyers 
the government has maintained that noriega knew the calls were 
being taped and that the calls were not protected by the 
attorneyclient privelege 
information from the noriega tapes already is in the hands of at 
least one additional party the government of panama according to 
an affidavit filed tuesday by that nations attorney in the united 
states gregory craig 
the affidavit sought to persuade another judge hearing panamas 
65 billion racketeering lawsuit against the deposed dictator to 
freeze all noriegas assets 
craig refused to disclose how he obtained information about the 
taped conversations but the affidavit appeared to include 
information not broadcast by cnn 
noriegas attorneys have alleged that the us government made 
the tapes and supplied them to panama which in turn leaked them to 
cnn but craig refused to comment 
the affidavit said tapes of noriegas calls show that while in 
custody he has been using the telephone for the purpose of moving 
assets wrongfully obtained by him that are the property of the 
republic of panama 
noriega spoke on the tapes to his daughter sandra noriega his 
mistress vicki amado his mistresss mother and seven others 
including former pronoriega presidential candidate carlos duque 
the documents said 
noriega directed and continues to direct the movement of 
assets from hong kong israel singapore australia and brazil 
the funds were moved to banks in europe as well as through costa 
rica to panama craig said 
craig would not say how much money was involved in the taped 
conversations but added weve said from the beginning that we 
think there is 300 million to 500 million of assets out there 
noriegas attorney in the civil case stephen zukoff disputed 
the legality of craigs affidavit during hearing tuesday before 
us district judge edward davis who is presiding over the civil 
case i dont know where hes getting his information from he 
certainly should have identified it zukoff said 
he said he could not discuss whether the information was 
accurate without examining it further 
during the hearing john kester another attorney for panama 
noted the tapes appeared to show noriega was moving money from one 
account to another while telling hoeveler he had no assets and 
could not pay his attorneys 
he cant have it both ways kester said 
hoeveler has said he will appoint governmentpaid defense 
attorneys if the fee dispute is not settled soon

britain and syria today restored diplomatic 
relations severed four years ago when britain accused syria of 
sponsoring terrorism the two governments announced 
foreign secretary douglas hurd told the house of commons that 
britain had received assurances from the syrian government that it 
rejects acts of international terrorism and will take action 
against convicted terrorists 
the resumption of ties was also announced in damascus 
a communique carried by the official syrian arab news agency 
said the heads of interest sections in the respective capitals 
would be elevated immediately to the post of charge daffaires 
the syrian communique confirmed that the damascus government 
renounced terrorism but added syria does not consider 
resistance against israeli occupation as terrorism 
the syrian government said britain had pledged to try to resolve 
the arabisraeli dispute support the syrianbacked government in 
lebanon and work to improve ties between damascus and the rest of 
europe 
hurd told british lawmakers the syrians had promised to continue 
strenuous efforts to obtain the release of the 13 western 
hostages believed held by proiranian extremists in lebanon 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon with 40000 troops 
based there under an arab league mandate it helped obtain the 
release of americans robert polhill and frank reed in april and 
irishman brian keenan in august 
the syrian government newspaper tishrin said earlier this month 
that britain should resume relations with syria if it wanted the 
remaining captives freed they are six americans four britons two 
germans and an italian 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press was taken hostage march 16 1985 and is the 
longestheld captive 
the restoration of ties follows recent meetings in damascus 
between british lawmakers and a foreign office official and syrian 
president hafez assad and his foreign minister farouk alsharaa 
britain severed relations with syria in october 1986 hours 
after a london jury convicted jordanian nezar hindawi of attempting 
to bomb an el al jet departing londons heathrow airport with 375 
people aboard on april 17 1986 
the 32yearold hindawi who planted plastic explosives in the 
hand luggage of his pregnant irish fiancee was sentenced to 45 
years in prison 
britain said hindawi acted on orders from syrian intelligence 
traveled on a syrian passport and met syrian ambassador loutfallah 
haydar at the syrian embassy after the bomb plot was uncovered 
syrian denied any involvement in terrorism on british soil 
hurd said today that britain had received confidential account 
of the syrian position on the hindawi affair he did not 
elaborate 
lebanon has represented syrian interests in britain while 
australia has represented britains interests in syria since the 
ties were severed 
britains improved relations follow a similar move by the united 
states 
ussyrian ties improved this summer when damascus sided with 
the alliance against saddam hussein following iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait syria has committed nearly 20000 troops to a 
military buildup in the persian gulf 
syria is on a state departments list of countries that sponsor 
terrorism but secretary of state james a baker iii visited 
damascus in september and president bush met with assad in geneva 
last week

various sources 
carbon dioxide a colorless odorless gas is a major focus of 
the socalled greenhouse warming problem scientists fear carbon

thousands of filipino world war ii veterans 
will be eligible for us citizenship under a new immigration law 
but the poorest may not be able to afford to take advantage of the 
offer 
it has not been decided whether filipino veterans may obtain 
citizenship without making a costly trip to the united states 
the justice department favors a plan requiring that citizenship 
be granted only in the united states immigration officials have 
five months to draw up the rules for applying 
the provision part of a sweeping immigration bill president 
bush is expected to sign thursday would take effect may 1 and give 
veterans including guerrilla fighters two years to apply for 
citizenship 
this bill is a first step toward truly recognizing the 
contributions of the veterans and fulfilling our world war ii 
promise said rep mervyn dymally dcalif who had been trying 
for six years to get the law enacted 
the law does not deal with the issue of veterans benefits 
claimed by filipinos 
dymally contends denial of the claims is unjust and that 
payment should be based on service within the armed forces and 
not nationality 
many of the veterans were called to duty as part of us forces 
when the philippines was an american colony the united states 
recognized philippine independence in 1946 
more than half the 200000 filipinos who fought the fouryear 
japanese occupation were killed filipino veterans group estimate 
that about 50000 veterans most of them living in the philippines 
may be eligible for citizenship 
the fight for recognition by filipino veterans dates to 1942 
when those who served in us forces were left out of the 
implementation of a new citizenship law immigration agents 
couldnt enter the occupied country 
that law gave citizenship to aliens serving in us forces but 
it expired in 1946 without being applied to filipinos the newly 
independent philippine government was trying to reduce the flow of 
emigrants to america 
courts since have ruled that citizenship should be given to 
filipino veterans but the supreme court said it would take an act 
of congress 
the new law affecting only filipino world war ii veterans 
would grant citizenship to those who fought in the us forces as 
well as those who were part of the elite philippine scouts or any 
recognized guerrilla group 
it is only sad to see that these brave men who were willing to 
sacrifice their lives in defense of the united states of america 
were forced to wait over 40 years until our promise of citizenship 
to them is fulfilled said dymally whose legislative district 
includes thousands of filipino americans 
filipinos are behind only mexico in emigration to the united 
states making them the largest and fastestgrowing asian minority 
in america

text of the statement by prime minister john major 
following his confirmation in office wednesday 
may i say firstly that i am extremely grateful for the trust 
that my parliamentary colleagues have put in me and for the 
tremendous support that we have already had from so many people up 
and down the country i hope in the next few years that i will be 
able to prove that that trust is justified 
i am grateful also for the enormous achievements that i 
inherit from margaret thatcher i think history will record that 
she was a towering prime minister who left her country in a far 
better condition that she found it 11 years ago i hope in the next 
few years to build on those achievements 
i certainly hope in those years to build a society of 
opportunity by that i mean an open society a society in which 
what people fulfill will depend upon their talent their 
application and their good fortune what people achieve should 
depend particularly upon those things and i hope increasingly in 
the future that that will be the case 
i believe very firmly in the 1990s that we will have a decade 
of the most remarkable opportunities we have soon the full opening 
and the flowering of the single market in europe 
we have seen in the last few years the remarkable ending of 
the cold war and the bringing together of nations in a fashion that 
which no one would have imagined just a few years ago we have in 
front of us the building and development of an entirely new europe 
a building and development in which this country will play a full 
and leading role 
in the past week we have seen openly and publicly the uniting 
of the conservative party i would like to express again my thanks 
to all members of the party and particularly douglas hurd and 
michael heseltine for the enormous contributions they have made 
during the leadership contest to ensure that the party can remain 
united for the future there is no illfeeling at the end of this 
contest at the end of this week for the leadership of the 
conservative party at the end of this week i believe that there is 
a smile on the face of the party that will mean we are fully united 
for the future 
i hope in the next few years that we will carry on with much 
of the work that has been done in the last few years in particular 
i want to build a country that is at ease with itself a country 
that is confident and a country that is prepared and willing to 
make the changes necessary to provide a better quality of life for 
all our citizens 
i dont promise you that it will be easy and i dont promise 
you that it will be quick but i believe it is an immensely 
worthwhile job to do because it will be neither easy nor quick if 
you forgive me i will go into no 10 straight away and make a 
start right now thank you very much indeed

ministers 
margaret thatcher was due first on a chilly damp morning 
bringing her resignation to queen elizabeth ii john major mrs 
thatchers successor as prime minister was due afterward 
the guards division sentries were doing their duty in the 
forecourt in long coats tall busbies and automatic rifles the 
royal standard armorial banner of the queen flew at the masthead 
to show the monarch was in residence 
on the wide sidewalk outside the wroughtiron railings more 
than the usual number of sightseers mingled with camera crews 
barbara cerrato and her husband lou 74 a retired restaurant 
manager from los angeles admired a bronze cherub on the lock of a 
palace gate 
we waited 30 years to come to london and we saw on tv last 
night that mrs thatcher and mr major would come here today so we 
came too i wish we had been invited inside mrs cerrato said 
this is the closest we have come to people running a country 
we saw reagan run for governor of california its nice here when 
i was in washington i couldnt even stand in front of the white 
house because the police keep you moving she said 
mrs thatcher she added has a lot of admirers back home 
more people waited watching in the mall the long processional 
avenue with double rows of plane trees leading to whitehall the 
seat of government and downing street 
a japanese couple kiyo takatori and her husband tadashi were 
on a threeday group visit to london and seized the chance to be on 
the scene wednesday 
we like the tradition mrs takatori said we are so 
excited by our new emperor

the inner courtyard within the palace mrs thatcher resigned at a

give us your kin your skills and your moneyed 
masses will be one message when president bush on thursday signs 
into law the most sweeping changes in us immigration policy in a 
quartercentury 
the new law will increase by 400000 the number of immigrants it 
will accept in the three years beginning next october it will also 
ease restrictions on visitors once barred for professing communist 
or other unacceptable opinions 
the changes are being enacted as millions of people are leaving 
their homes because of the persian gulf crisis and the collapse of 
communism in east europe 
but congress in approving the biggest change in immigration 
policy since 1965 was moved not so much by those events as the 
need to balance large influxes from asia and latin america by 
giving europeans a better chance and the new law seeks to bring in 
wealthier and better skilled immigrants 
refugee problems are dealt with separately this year 131000 
refugees are being accepted primarily from indochina and the 
soviet union us authorities have helped get many of the refugees 
from the gulf crisis back to their own countries 
the new threeyear total is 21 million visas for permanent 
residence up from 17 million for the previous threeyear period 
numbers of people arriving to settle will still remain below the 
peak years early in the century when the statue of liberty welcomed 
newcomers with the words give us your tired your poor your 
huddled masses yearning to breathe free in the year 1907 alone 
13 million immigrants were admitted 
the new law continues the current policy of trying to reunite 
families by favoring applicants with relatives in this country 
setting aside 465000 visas for such immigrants 
and it increases emphasis on getting skilled workers some 
140000 visas a year are reserved for immigrants with special 
skills up from 54000 in the past 
under this category some 10000 visas are for applicants with 
at least 500000 to invest in businesses that create new jobs in 
this country the immigrants will get two years to show what they 
can do with the money 
canada and australia have similar policies in proportion to 
their population they take more settlers than the united states 
does and put greater emphasis on getting people with skills 
he us law makes it harder for authorities to keep out 
foreigners either visitors or settlers because of their opinions 
british novelist graham greene and french singer yves montand are 
among those who ran into difficulties as prospective visitors in 
the past 
greene once said that after josef stalins disappearance he 
would rather live in the soviet union than in the united states 
montand declined to say whether he was a communist 
the new law eliminates many grounds for excluding people because 
of their beliefs advocates of polygamy are no longer specifically 
barred nor are members of the communist party if they have 
relatives in this country polygamists may visit but are not 
acceptable as immigrants 
the residence visas and the traditional green cards that go 
with them they now are actually white allow foreigners to take 
jobs visitors and students are forbidden to work although many do 
illegally 
a large proportion of the residence visas will be issued to 
people already in this country many are being given under a 
special amnesty law to mexicans and others who came illegally in 
the past and have been working in this country only 402000 out of 
1091000 residence visas issued in 1989 went to new arrivals 
widespread illegal immigration continues along the 1960mile 
mexican border mexican president carlos salinas de gortari urged 
bush during his visit to mexico this week to respect the human 
rights of illegal immigrants 
the new law makes 48000 visas available for people from 
ireland irish applications for visas have increased in recent 
years in part because of economic problems at home 
us officials estimate that 40000 to 110000 irish are already 
in this country illegally 
some 72000 visas are reserved for citizens of 35 other 
countries mostly in europe considered to have been 
disadvantaged many are expected to be taken up by people from 
poland and italy among other favored countries are algeria 
argentina bermuda guadeloupe indonesia japan new caledonia and 
tunisia 
there is a special provision to help local employees of us 
companies who would rather not stay in hong kong when china takes 
over the british colony in 1997

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the 
united states and abroad 
 
nov 2 
the arizona republic phoenix on presidential war powers 
as a rule the federal courts have been reluctant to horn in on 
disputes between the executive branch and congress 
so it seems unlikely that the lawsuit brought by 45 house 
democrats will impede the slide toward war in the persian gulf if 
war is what george bush has in mind the plaintiffs may stand 
athwart the road to armageddon but the courts will be reluctant to 
stand with them 
twice before in recent years members of congress have sought 
to define the presidents warmaking authority in each case the 
courts have run for cover 
bush makes no secret of his objectives in the gulf and they 
offer scant comfort to those who define americas interests 
narrowly his stated goals continue to include the restoration of 
the kuwaiti monarchy of marginal interest to americans at best 
and unconditional withdrawal of all iraqi forces though a 
negotiated withdrawal might save countless lives and much treasure 
if war is his intention the president is among a shrinking 
minority according to the latest polls 70 percent of the american 
people resist the idea of military action against iraq this 
before the body bags start arriving home 
enthusiasm for a shooting war also is absent in congress even 
among the presidents own loyalists if bush turns his back on 
such realities he will face the same icy blast that finally swept 
lyndon johnson out of office

enterprisejournal mccomb miss on the persian gulf 
is the united states going to war in the saudi arabiankuwait 
desert 
as us military forces continue their buildup it surely looks 
that way 
immediately after iraqs invasion of oilrich kuwait american 
applauded president bushs decisive response and his tough stance 
but as the crisis drags out apprehension in congress and 
throughout the nation grows 
do we really want american boys to die in the desert for kuwait 
do we want them to die over the price of gasoline to boot out 
saddam hussein a vicious cruel ruler for arab states like iran 
or syria whose actions have been as bad as iraqs 
we are confident if war comes the united states and its allies 
would prevail but at what price in us casualties twenty 
thousand 50000 100000 and what price in civilian casualties to 
iraq should iraqi cities get caught in us air attacks hundred of 
thousands millions 
we wonder too what would be the ultimate effect of such a war 
on the middle east would arab nations become even more hostile to 
the united states as us aircraft killed arab men women and 
children and who would be the ultimate gainer probably not the 
united states probably iran and syria no friends of ours 
moreover should such a war not end quickly and as us 
casualties mounted american public opposition would surely grow 
that leads us to hope that bush wont get impatient and pursue a 
military solution before exhausting all avenues of negotiation 
its hard to figure how saddam can hold out against such united 
condemnation even though it might take a little longer us 
troops bivouacking in a hot desert is much preferable to the body 
bags we recall from vietnam 
 
nov 23 
capital journal pierre sd on the persian gulf 
congressmen on both sides of the aisle are asking for a bigger 
role in the united states military buildup in the persian gulf 
the word from the white house is that president bush doesnt need 
any help or vindication from congress 
as the massive us military presence in saudi arabia drags on 
what this country needs is debate about the buildup and its future 
letting the fate of 400000 troops hang on the decisions of one man 
is scary even if that man is the president of the united states 
bush has already gotten this country into a desert stalemate 
half a world away his best course of action is to court congress 
and seek some sort of joint official action rather than shutting 
out its members if he insists on making all the decisions himself 
he may face another protracted deadlock right in washington dc

statesman journal salem ore on holidays and war 
last year we had big news to celebrate at thanksgiving peace 
had broken out 
for the first time in 45 years the superpowers no longer faced 
each other with nucleartipped missiles while threatening to blow 
themselves and the rest of the world to smithereens we looked 
forward to a year of peace in the world and progress at home and 
we hoped by this thanksgiving to see as much progress at home as we 
had seen overseas 
that didnt happen 
thanks to saddam hussein a year that started out with great 
hopes ended up as so many others had in war or war preparation 
our money our resources and our hopes for a changed world and a 
rebuilt united states now are stuck in the sands of saudi arabia 
its easy to be thankful when everything is going well as it 
was last year what takes devotion and optimism is to be hopeful 
when you feel the disappointment of failure fortunately we still 
have optimism 
let us give thanks for what we can still do to try in the middle 
east the key that brought peace in europe there is still time to 
avoid the ruins of war 
let us give thanks that although disappointed we still have 
endless blessings ourselves and we can still share them with those 
around the world nnd at home who need our help 
every year brings new problems and new opportunities though 
disappointed by lost opportunities of the past year we must 
recognize our good fortune in what we have ourselves and in what we 
can do between now and next thanksgiving for our country and our 
world

the capital times madison wis on congress 
heres a saga of pettiness and arrogance run amok 
last february the inhouse magazine of the national park 
service contained a column by the agencys legislative specialist 
the column began by needling congress for raising its members pay 
that offended the congressional staff member who handles the 
agencys budget 
when park service officials learned that neal sigmon of the 
house appropriations interior subcommittee was upset they went out 
of their way to apologize to him 
a lot of good it did them 
when the house and senate worked out a compromise version of the 
interior appropriations bill for the coming year 75000 was 
deleted from the park service budget the 75000 allocated for 
publishing the magazine 
on the record everyone claims to be mystified by the deletion 
off the record one congressional staff member said from time to 
time signals are sent to agencies when theyve been bad 
it did not seem to matter whether or not the inhouse newsletter 
served a useful function in communicating with park service 
employees who of course are scattered all across the country all 
that mattered was that a congressional staff member felt that 
congressional pride had been wounded

roswell nm daily record on congress 
despite all the talk about american voters throwing the bums out 
of congress on nov 6 fully 96 percent of house members and 97 
percent of senators who sought reelection were victorious 
members of congress are so entrenched that there literally is 
more turnover in the supreme soviet and this undemocratic 
situation will continue as long as big money corrupts the electoral 
process 
the cleanest way to put an end to vote buying by special 
interests is to outlaw political action committee contributions in 
federal elections if a flat ban proves to be unconstitutional 
there should at least be strictly enforced caps on such 
contributions 
no less important a reform is shutting down the softmoney 
system that enables political parties to launder large 
contributions through generic getoutthevote drives these 
efforts are unfair because they almost always benefit incumbents 
also lets end the widespread abuse of the congressional frank 
or free mailers at election time

daily news los angeles on michael milken 
michael r milken learned a tough lesson the more power 
you get the more you are obliged not to abuse it us district 
judge kimba m wood said essentially that in handing out a stiff 
but appropriate sentence of 10 years in prison to the former 
junkbond financier who pleaded guilty earlier this year to six 
felony charges of securities fraud and conspiracy 
legitimate investors can do without the contempt for the rules 
that milken brought with him in his pursuit of profit whatever 
contributions milken made to the financial world those were offset 
by a combination of greed ego and deceit that turned securities 
markets into personal playgrounds for the unethical

the providence ri journalbulletin on legal services 
a recent issue of the economist the british news weekly said 
of the evergrowing demand for legal services in the united states 
much of the demand for the output of this swollen industry is 
created not by clients but by other members of the lawsuit 
industry as if doctors went around injecting diseases for other 
doctors to cure is this really a boost to living standards 
thats a good question to which we suspect the answer might be 
no 
so its a good sign for our economy that at least some big 
american companies are trying to do something about this disease 
the same magazine enthusiastically reports that earlier this month 
the chief executives of 17 of the countrys biggest companies sent 
out a group letter urging their fellow executives to negotiate 
and settle disputes early before litigation takes on a life of 
its own 
the endless use of lawsuits threatened and actual to resolve 
disputes in our society has diverted time and money from what are 
usually more productive ends let us hope that in taking a pledge 
to try to avoid litigation big business provides some useful 
suggestions to individuals of the numerous ways in which arguments 
can be resolved to everyones satisfaction without lawsuits 
an america with less litigation would probably be a richer and 
happier country

the tennessean nashville tenn on mikhail gorbachev and boris 
yeltsin 
in the united states the old adage in determining the political 
fallout of a major decision is how it will play in peoria 
but in the soviet union the final determination of a decisions 
merit has become how it will play with yeltsin 
boris yeltsin president of the republic of russia has become 
the ultimate reviewer of reform measures in the troubled nation 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev must sometimes wonder if 
yeltsin is his political subordinate or vice versa 
gorbachev responding to continued turmoil in his country over 
economic conditions announced an emergency revamping of the soviet 
government recently the plan included the elimination of the 
position held by prime minister nikolai i ryszhkov it boosted the 
authority of the council of the federation comprised of leaders of 
the 15 soviet republics but it also created a new security council 
to oversee military and police activity reporting to the 
president and it created a system of presidential representatives 
to enforce orders from the center 
the plan had the effect of tightening gorbachevs grip on 
power it was quickly approved by parliament but there was an 
initial silence from yeltsin who has pushed for swifter 
reforms after a couple of days of weighing the plan yeltsin 
announced his verdict thumbs down 
yeltsin protests that the plan denies the republics the right of 
approval over executive decisions he says that gorbachevs 
overtures at sharing power are not strong enough he said the plan 
would not improve but only worsen the situation in the 
country 
yeltsins voice is so strong on these matters because he is 
speaking for so many soviet people gorbachev knows that 
ultimately the peoples support is the factor that will 
determine the fate of the soviet economy the only leader who will 
succeed is the one who has the support of the people

cumhuriyet istanbul turkey on margaret thatcher 
british prime minister margaret thatcher tried to implement 
capitalism in the most savage fashion until the end because of 
that she had to face little words she could not stand like 
socialism social unions 
she always aimed at belittling the state and reducing the 
economic and social structure to the lowest point privatization 
was the top priority of her economic policy she constantly chipped 
off the states contributions to social health and education she 
lost no opportunity in trying to break the unions 
yet it cannot be said that she was unsuccessful all together 
but the actual social cost of that success proved to be 
considerable

the times of india new delhi on margaret thatcher 
from the start british prime minister margaret thatcher 
was combative relishing the combat more than the outcome in the 
11 long years she ran britain and the tories she made perhaps more 
political enemies than friends and admirers 
but neither the prospect nor the reality of unpopularity 
deterred her from doing what she was convinced was right in a 
fundamental sense she turned postwar britain upside down and 
inside out britain has always been in disraelis phrase two 
nations mrs thatcher made it even more so 
what in the end turned many of her supporters against her was 
her grudging acceptance of a european role for britain her fears 
over britains loss of sovereignity through acquiring a wider 
european identity made her seem to look backwards rather than 
ahead

straits times singapore on problems in eastern and central 
europe 
the primary problem in the eastern and central european 
countries is economic but there are indications already that the 
economic crisis is reviving old ethnic animosities which if not 
contained could shape into a fascist subversion of the fledgling 
democracies and irredentist pressures on national borders 
indeed in the understandable but nevertheless hasty 
dismantling of an existing political order before the economic 
underpinnings of a new order were in place the eastern european 
countries opened themselves to possible anarchy

lord pearce chairman of a government panel in 
1972 that rejected a proposed settlement in the then rebel colony 
of rhodesia on grounds most blacks opposed it has died newspapers 
reported wednesday he was 89

village of crowborough in the county of sussex in southern england 
no cause of death was given 
pearce visited what was then rhodesia and is now zimbabwe as 
head of the government panel in 1972 
his presence was regarded as the first genuine and independent 
outlet for black majority opinion in many years 
on nov 11 1965 the then white minority government of ian 
smith had declared itself free of all remaining colonial links with 
britain 
britain was hoping to steer rhodesia to full independence under 
eventual black rule it said the independence declaration was 
illegal and that independence under continuing white rule as 
sought by smith must be acceptable to the entire population 
pearces panel was set up to determine whether proposals for a 
constitutional settlement with smiths administration for 
continuing white rule were acceptable on this basis 
the commission ruled that the proposals were unacceptable to 
most africans there who distrusted the smith administration 
subsequent negotiations between britain and smiths 
administration failed 
the issue was resolved by a conference in london in 1979

one day before the united nations votes on a ussponsored 
resolution demanding iraq withdraw from kuwait by jan 15 or face 
possible attack a leading us congressman said today he opposes 
using force against iraq soon 
as congress debated persian gulf policy federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan said today that skyrocketing oil prices and 
a growing shortage of credit have substantially weakened the 
american economy 
all indications are that a meaningful downturn in aggregate 
output occurred as we moved through october into november 
greenspan said 
speaking to the house banking committee in washington greenspan 
said it was too soon to determine whether the country was 
experiencing a recession but he conceded that economic growth as 
measured by the gross national product probably would turn 
negative in the octoberdecember quarter 
in baghdad meanwhile iraqs deputy foreign minister today 
urged president bush to open talks on restoring peace in the 
persian gulf although he did not offer concessions regarding 
kuwait 
iraq has called for dialogue with the united states previously 
but us officials have said there is nothing to discuss as long 
iraq refuses to free all foreign hostages and withdraw 
unconditionally from kuwait 
another iraqi official denied today that baghdad was preventing 
soviets from leaving the country on monday the soviet foreign 
ministry accused baghdad of breaking a promise to allow soviets in 
iraq to leave and threatened a tougher attitude if they were 
not granted freedom 
chinas foreign minister qian qichen said in beijing today his 
country would not vote for the un useofforce resolution but he 
refused to say whether china would veto the measure which it could 
do as one of five permanent members of the un security council 
us officials say the chinese have promised not to oppose the 
resolution 
qian was to meet with secretary of state james a baker iii 
tonight and may be seeking concessions in return for abstaining 
during thursdays un vote 
china wants washington to lift economic sanctions it imposed 
following the june 1989 military crackdown that crushed chinas 
prodemocracy movement qians is the first official visit by a 
chinese minister since the crackdown 
today the white house faced criticism in its drive for a un 
resolution authorizing force house majority leader richard 
gephardt said he opposed using force against iraq now and that the 
us should stick to sanctions 
stay the course stick with the sanctions do not try to mount 
an offensive military action in the near future the missouri 
democrat said in a speech the united nations has imposed trade 
sanctions against iraq and they are being vigorously enforced by 
the multinational force in the persian gulf 
it was the first public break among the democratic leadership 
last week democrats said the bush administration would have a 
better chance of winning congressional approval for an attack if it 
received un backing 
gephardts remarks came as the senate armed services committee 
began its second session to debate a un resolution authorizing 
military force 
under the resolution to be voted on thursday iraq will have 
until jan 15 to withdraw its troops from kuwait before facing the 
prospect of military action soviet and us diplomats fixed the 
deadline in the last 24 hours western diplomats said on condition 
of anonymity 
the resolution authorizes all necessary means to get iraq 
out of kuwait after that date 
but iraq today called for dialogue iraqs deputy prime 
minister taha yassin ramadan said bush is leading the entire 
world to a ruinous war and has no choice other than to come to 
his senses and initiate a dialogue 
ramadan indicated however iraq had not softened its position 
on kuwait saying it was intent on ousting aggressors and 
traitors from arab land 
also today an iraqi foreign ministry spokesman denied soviets 
were being held like other westerners in iraq soviets are 
working in iraq according to contracts he said on condition of 
anonymity 
we told the soviet officials that iraq will allow any soviet 
to leave iraq when his contract ends the official said iraq has 
taken no illegal measures against soviets he said indicating 
that they are not hostages 
more than 8000 soviets were in iraq and kuwait before baghdads 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait fewer than half that number remain many 
soviets worked in oil fields and as specialists at military 
installations 
before leaving jordan for home today some freed americans 
hostages whose families had traveled to iraq to plead with saddam 
for their release told reporters in jordan that the bush 
administration had ignored their plight 
saddam said on tuesday after meeting with boxing great muhammad 
ali that an unspecified number of americans would soon be allowed 
to leave 
saddam has been releasing foreign hostages on a piecemeal basis 
the bush administration has condemned the sporadic releases as 
aimed at dividing the alliance arrayed against iraq

the white house today disputed an 
international commissions finding that there is no evidence iraq 
is building a nuclear weapon with highly enriched reactor fuel 
the international atomic energy agency is wrong marlin 
fitzwater president bushs spokesman said at a daily briefing 
they see only what iraq wants them to see he said of the 
agencys inspectors who made the determination after a trip to 
baghdad we dont believe they saw all the information 
fitzwater said 
the spokesman declined however to discuss in detail what 
evidence the administration has that iraq is developing an atomic 
bomb 
in a report released in vienna austria tuesday the atomic 
energy agency said a nigerian and a soviet inspector toured a 
storage plant and a fuelproducing plant nov 1922 at baghdads 
invitation 
they apparently checked on a 27pound mass of highly enriched 
uranium that iraq salvaged from its osirak nuclear reactor which 
was destroyed by an israeli air attack in 1981 they concluded none 
of the uranium had been diverted to make a nuclear weapon 
the sixmonth inspections carried out by the iaea are viewed as 
foolproof by technical experts however they do not take into 
account a countrys longterm nuclear plans 
lawrence eagleburger deputy secretary of state said tuesday 
that not all nuclear materials in iraq are under iaea safeguards 
the iaea report came as a number of independent analysts 
questioned the bush administrations contention that iraq is on the 
verge of producing nuclear weapons that could be used against us 
troops in saudi arabia 
urgency i dont think so said former cia director james 
schlesinger when asked if americans should be immediately concerned 
about iraqs potential nuclear threat 
schlesinger testifying tuesday before the senate armed services 
committee estimated it would take iraq five years to develop 
nuclear weapons if it received help from the outside without help 
it would probably take a decade he said 
displaying skepticism about the administrations recent 
statements on the subject schlesinger said its not an 
accident that a recent poll suggested americans would support 
military involvement in the persian gulf to eliminate any nuclear 
threat 
since then bush and other officials have raised the specter of 
iraq attacking with nuclear weapons he said 
bush told us troops in saudi arabia on thanksgiving day their 
mission was marked by a real sense of urgency because of saddam 
husseins progress in acquiring nuclear arms but he added no 
one knows precisely how near iraq is to becoming a nuclear power 
gary milhollin of the wisconsin project on nuclear arms control 
said the administration is exaggerating the danger of iraqs 
nuclear program in an effort to gain support for a united nations 
security council resolution authorizing use of force the vote is 
scheduled for thursday 
milhollin a nuclear expert said he didnt think it was a 
credible scenario that iraq would have nuclear weapons in less 
than a year 
administration officials meanwhile continued to assert that 
iraq could obtain some kind of nuclear device soon 
pete williams defense secretary dick cheneys spokesman said 
cheney is aware that they iraq could have some kind of crude 
device in less than a year 
such a device might not be delivered from an airplane or 
weaponized in the traditional sense of a nuclear weapon but it 
would be capable of doing some damage of producing some kind of 
yield he said 
asked if the pentagon believes the 230000 us troops in the 
persian gulf area are under any threat of nuclear attack williams 
said it would be accurate to say were concerned about it 
the pentagons intelligence estimates indicate it would take 
iraq less than a year to have some kind of crude device and 
between five to 10 years to have a deliverable system williams 
said 
eagleburger said the administrations estimates are based on 
fairly substantial evidence on our part that there is substantial 
unsafeguarded nuclear activity going on in iraq 
baghdad has repeatedly denied allegations by western media and 
israel that it is developing nuclear arms 
richard rhodes author of the making of the atomic bomb 
wrote in tuesdays editions of the new york times that bushs 
invocation of an imminent iraqi nuclear threat was a red 
herring 
expert estimates put iraqi acquisition of a limited nuclear 
arsenal at least 10 years away he said 
sen edward kennedy dmass a member of the senate armed 
services committee said information he has received shows iraq 
could not acquire nuclear weapons within two years he has urged 
that economic sanctions against iraq remain in place for a year or 
two before any military action is taken 
a recent congressional research survey concluded iraq lacks the 
uranium and the facilities to produce weaponsgrade plutonium 
needed to make a nuclear warhead 
the worldwide embargo on iraq has hampered saddam husseins 
efforts to obtain the manpower and material to develop a nuclear 
program the study said

a bankruptcy judge agreed struggling eastern 
airlines would have trouble attracting passengers if it had to 
plead for cash every few weeks and let the carrier tap 135 million 
to keep flying through the winter 
creditors had tried to block the request for a withdrawal from 
an eastern escrow fund repeating that the airline cannot make a go 
of it and should be liquidated while there is enough money for an 
orderly shutdown 
but us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland said tuesday that 
courtappointed trustee martin r shugrue jr should be given the 
chance to see whether eastern can indeed turn the corner to 
profitability next year 
shugrue predicted today the ailing carrier can become profitable 
without seeking more cash 
we have no intention of being back in court seeking further 
cash drawdowns shugrue told a news conference it is simply 
not going to be required 
shugrue refused to say whether he would be willing to give up on 
eastern 
we will make whatever changes we need as we move through the 
business plan shugrue said 
in his decision lifland cited concerns that chaos would occur 
if eastern closed down during the holiday season 
eastern has been in bankruptcy court since a crippling strike in 
1989 
after the hearing shugrue praised the judges vote of 
confidence in eastern 
its a christmas present for everybody who works at eastern 
airline spokesman jim ashlock said you can see what this enables 
us to do it takes away the uncertainty and gives us a chance to 
make good on what we know we can do 
less than two weeks ago the judge agreed to give eastern 15 
million and held out the possibility of another 15 million in 
early december 
eastern said in asking for even more money tuesday that bad 
publicity surrounding the creditors move to have it closed had 
driven away passengers and made creditcard companies nervous about 
doing business with the airline 
shugrue told the court he needed 135 million to keep eastern 
alive and he needed it all at once to avoid more damaging news 
coverage 
we simply cannot run the business on a rolling 15day time 
frame he said 
the judge agreed chastising the creditors for their 
campaign against eastern 
under all these circumstances it seems inappropriate to 
constantly come back at these short intervals where the adverse 
publicity will be repeated again and again lifland said 
an attorney for the creditors joel b zweibel said he was not 
sure what their next move would be the creditors include aircraft 
companies banks unions and others who are owed about 1 billion 
by eastern 
zweibel had argued in court papers that liquidation was 
inevitable and should begin now before further funds are wasted 
and while christmas holiday travelers have several weeks to 
rearrange their plans 
charles bryan the leader of easterns striking machinists said 
shugrue has no chance of turning the carrier around and is 
bleeding the last drop out of eastern

the first family to buy a renovated 
house at the former love canal chemicalwaste site is moving in 
this week 3 months after homes were offered for sale 
a state judge meanwhile rejected the latest bid by 
environmentalists to block the love canal area revitalization 
agencys efforts to resettle the neighborhood it now calls black 
creek village 
the agency has signed contracts with 12 buyers for houses near 
the toxic dump site and is scheduled to close the first of those 
deals next week its executive director william broderick said 
tuesday 
the first buyer sandra devantier is being allowed to move in 
before the closing because she needs to vacate her old home 
broderick said 
shes kind of moving in around us laying the carpet down and 
finishing up the rest of the work broderick said 
sales have been slower than the agency predicted when it began 
showing the homes to buyers in midaugust in large part because 
area banks have been reluctant to write mortgages on love canal 
property 
devantier was able to close the sale quickly because she is 
paying 54000 cash for the property broderick said 
devantier could not be reached for comment she does not have a 
listed telephone number in the niagara falls or buffalo areas the 
revitalization agency refused to say how she could be contacted 
saying she requested privacy 
love canal became a symbol of the nations hazardous waste 
problems when chemicals dumped in the 1940s and 1950s began leaking 
into a middleclass neighborhood late built on the site 
the revitalization agency was formed to renovate and sell some 
of the 1100 homes vacated by residents after the leaks were 
discovered in the late 1970s 
it plans to sell about 250 homes most of the rest have been or 
will be demolished because they are in areas deemed too 
contaminated for living 
some groups contend the entire area is unsafe for human 
habitation but a lawsuit making that argument was dismissed 
tuesday by state supreme court justice joseph mintz who said the 
environmentalists had no standing to sue and had waited too long to 
raise their complaints 
richard lippes a lawyer for the environmental groups said they 
would appeal no court yet has addressed the merits of our 
claim he said

an attorney for arizona sen dennis deconcini 
today attacked the testimony of former top thrift regulator edwin 
gray jr the chief accuser of the socalled keating five senators 
under scrutiny by the senate ethics committee 
james hamilton lawyer for the arizona democrat engaged in 
contentious exchanges with gray and other lawyers as he sought to 
point out inconsistencies in the former regulators allegations 
he sought to show that gray had more information about charles 
keating jrs lincoln savings and loan than he admitted during a 
nowdisputed meeting with deconcini and three other senators on 
april 2 1987 
on tuesday gray former head of the federal home loan bank 
board said that in that meeting deconcini offered him a deal in 
an effort to relax regulations for the californiabased thrift 
whose owner was a major financial contributor to each of each of 
the senators campaigns and causes 
crossexamining gray hamilton cited written denials from other 
senators who were present and said is there any reason the 
american public should believe you and disbelieve four prominent 
american senators 
gray responded the american public can believe whoever they 
will i had nothing to gain whatsoever by not telling the 
truth 
gray asserted that deconcini had been leader of the april 2 
1987 meeting which he described as an intimidating and 
pressurepacked session aimed at winning help for keatings thrift 
he said deconcini referred to keating as our friend at lincoln 
and that he interpreted the other senators silence as agreement 
with the request 
none of the five senators under investigation by the ethics 
committee was present as gray resumed his third day in the witness 
chair 
hamilton read from a 1989 letter gray wrote to sen john glenn 
dohio recounting his assertion that he had told the senators he 
had no information about lincoln during that disputed meeting 
hamilton said this statement i read it really wasnt true was 
it 
gray well as a matter of fact yes it was true 
hamilton you really knew more than you let on didnt you 
hamilton pointed to evidence that gray had received information 
from the bank boards top californiabased regulator who had said 
their examination had revealed a number of areas of concern at 
lincoln including heavy direct investment in real estate 
gray said it had been eight months since he had seen that 
regulators memo and he considered it incomplete and out of date 
the committee is holding hearings into allegations the five 
senators intervened improperly on behalf of keating and his thrift 
institution keating and his associated contributed 13 million to 
the campaigns and causes of the five senators 
the collapse of lincoln has been estimated to cost taxpayers 2 
billion in bailout costs keating is under indictment in 
california where the thrift is based 
besides deconcini senators under scrutiny by the panel are 
republican john mccain of arizona and democrats glenn alan 
cranston of california and donald riegle of michigan all but 
riegle attended that april 2 meeting 
testifying tuesday gray told the panel of the april 2 1987 
meeting 
i considered it improper gray testified the whole 
setting was an intimidating one 
deconcini said were very concerned about this direct 
investment regulation of yours wed like you to withdraw it 
until we can find out if its constitutional if you can do that 
well get our friend at lincoln to make more home loans 
gray described the three other senators in the april 2 meeting 
as silently acquiescing to deconcinis request under 
crossexamination by glenns lawyer charles ruff he acknowledged 
hearing no verbal agreement 
i thought i saw a nod but maybe i didnt he said the 
point is there was no objection nobody said he speaks for 
himself 
gray contended the meeting was improper and that he felt awkward 
and pressured by the senators he said he took no action as a 
result of the meeting nor did other regulators 
we did not succumb to that pressure he said

john major who rose from poverty to become 
britains youngest prime minister of the 20th century took office 
today pledging to build a society of opportunity 
moving quickly to reorganize the government major brought his 
defeated rival michael heseltine into the cabinet heseltines 
challenge for the leadership of the conservative party had pushed 
prime minister margaret thatcher into retirement 
i want to see us build a country that is at ease with itself 
a country that is confident and a country that is prepared and 
willing to make the changes necessary to provide a better quality 
of life for all its citizens major said minutes after being 
confirmed in office by queen elizabeth ii 
i dont promise you that it will easy and i dont promise you 
that it will be quick major said standing with his wife norma 
outside the prime ministers official residence at 10 downing st 
if you will forgive me he added i will go into no 10 
straight away and make a start right now 
major 47 had won his parliamentary seat in mrs thatchers 
first election victory of 1979 she had elevated him to the cabinet 
in 1987 and backed major as her successor after concluding that 
she could no longer hold on to power 
we leave the united kingdom in a very much better state than 
when we came here 11 years ago mrs thatcher 65 said as she 
paused for a last time in downing st 
now it is time for a new chapter to open and i wish john major 
all the luck in the world he has the makings of a great prime 
minister thank you very much and goodbye she added 
hundreds of people many clapping and cheering pressed to the 
railings of buckingham palace as mrs thatcher arrived she left 
with her husband denis in a private car for the their new life in 
a southeast london suburban home 
major representing a new generation of european leaders with no 
memory of world war ii was elected as leader of the conservative 
party tuesday evening 
we have in front us of the building and development of an 
entirely new europe a building and development in which this 
country will play a full and leading role the new prime minister 
said today 
majors immediate tasks however are to unify a party and 
reshape a government traumatized by the abrupt collapse of the 
thatcher era 
in addition to making heseltine his secretary of the 
environment major kept the third leadership candidate douglas 
hurd in his post as foreign secretary 
even before major took office transport secretary cecil 
parkinson a close thatcher aide resigned today from the 22member 
cabinet 
derided as mrs thatchers poodle by the opposition and 
picked by worried tories as their new hope of keeping power major 
was elected in a secret ballot by the 372 conservative legislators 
he fell two votes short of the required 187 votes but was 
declared winner after heseltine and foreign secretary douglas hurd 
conceded defeat 
the son of a onetime circus performer major was raised in the 
rundown brixton section of london and left school at 16 he was 
briefly on welfare and worked as a laborer before becoming a 
successful banker 
major arrived in the house of commons in 1979 the year mrs 
thatcher won power but was quickly plucked from obscurity and 
entered the cabinet in 1987 as treasury secretary and later 
briefly as foreign secretary 
while major said during his campaign that he would stick to mrs 
thatchers policies of tight spending and privatization he said he 
would review mrs thatchers unpopular per capita poll tax for 
local services and would be liberal on social issues 
the opposition disagreed 
john major is a thatcherette that is how he sought election 
and that is how he got elected it means that the policies that 
brought the poll tax recession heavy mortgages and rising 
unemployment will go on said labor party leader neil kinnock 
major took a congratulatory call tuesday night from president 
bush and was cheered wildly by tories when he showed up in the 
house of commons to vote against an opposition motion on teachers 
pay 
it was the climax of four weeks of turmoil that upended the 
british political landscape and drove the western worlds longest 
serving leader from office to a new life in a large suburban house 
in dulwich south london 
the spark was a new dispute a month ago over mrs thatchers 
combative attitude toward the rest of the european community her 
deputy sir geoffrey howe resigned and accused her of undermining 
britains interests heseltine then challenged and won enough votes 
to force a runoff 
persuaded by party leaders she could not win mrs thatcher 
withdrew

said could rip apart the main link between seattle and its eastern 
suburbs 
seven tugboats held the interstate 90 bridge in place late 
tuesday while workers welded broken cables and dropped ships 
anchors weighing several tons apiece in an effort to secure it 
two temporary replacement cables were being installed today and 
seven could be in place by the end of the week officials said 
the bridge was damaged sunday when the adjacent lake washington 
bridge collapsed after a driving rainstorm and crashed into the 
i90 spans support cables

house majority leader richard gephardt said 
today he opposes the use of military force in the near future to 
oust iraq from kuwait urging president bush to follow a policy of 
patient strength 
stay the course stick with the sanctions do not try to mount 
an offensive military action in the near future the missouri 
democrat said in a speech 
gephardts opposition to any congressional resolution 
authorizing use of force is the first public break among the 
democratic leadership who said last week that bush would have a 
better chance of winning congressional approval for the use of 
force in the persian gulf if the united nations first backed such a 
move 
his remarks came as the senate armed services committee began 
its second day of hearings on the prospects of us military action 
against iraq democrats on tuesday demanded that bush give congress 
the same opportunity as the united nations to debate a resolution 
authorizing military force 
former secretary of state henry kissinger told the panel today 
he did not believe the united states could sustain nearly 430000 
troops in the gulf for an extended period of time 
the issue in arabia is not american staying power but the host 
countrys domestic stability conditions in the gulf are not even 
remotely comparable to europe or northeast asia kissinger said 
the former nixon administration official contended that the 
sanctions and the possible use of military force are not successive 
phases of the same policy 
they will prove mutually exclusive because by the time it is 
evident that sanctions alone cannot succeed a credible military 
option will probably no longer exist kissinger said 
gephardt in a speech to the us chamber of commerce said 
before we resort to offensive military action congress and the 
american people will need to be convinced that the policy of 
pressure isolation and sanctions has failed president bush has 
yet to make such an argument 
the policy of patient strength is i think our best hope 
gephardt said 
gephardt made his comments while two former chairmen of the 
joint chiefs of staff bolstered the democratic challenge to bush to 
give united nations sanctions time to work 
my main concern with this latest scheduled reinforcement isnt 
that we might choose to fight but rather that the deployment might 
cause us to fight perhaps prematurely and perhaps 
unnecessarily david c jones told the armed services committee 
both jones and retired adm william crowe said the sanctions are 
the best option at this time and expressed concern about the 
longterm effect of military action in the middle east 
i counsel patience war is not neat its not tidy its a 
mess crowe said at the hearing 
president bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater declined to 
respond directly to the statements by gephardt and the former 
chairmen of the joint chiefs 
obviously there are going to be different opinions 
fitzwater told reporters 
fitzwater said bush does not plan to ask congress for authority 
to launch hostilities under the war powers act the president 
maintains he has the authority to take such action with or without 
congressional approval 
in later testimony today crowe said he saw no significant 
breaks in the international sanctions and urged the 
administration and congress to give them a year to 18 months to 
take effect 
the issue is not whether an embargo will work but whether we 
have the patience to let it take effect crowe said 
the retired admiral said he believed the american people who 
waited out 40 years of the cold war have the patience for the 
sanctions 
it would be a sad commentary if saddam hussein a twobit 
tyrant who sits on 17 million people and possesses a gross national 
product of 40 billion proved to be more patient than the united 
states the worlds most affluent and powerful nation crowe 
said 
sen robert c byrd dwva the president pro tem of the 
senate agreed that the american people have the patience 
when we view grandmothers and grandfathers who lost not one 
but two three grandchildren and they feel we took the action too 
hastily i think well all have the time to be sorry byrd said 
the american people are willing to sacrifice he added 
on tuesday committee chairman sam nunn dga told the hearing 
that an expected un resolution authorizing the use of military 
force to eject iraq from kuwait is not a substitute for fully 
informing the american people of our own nations objectives and 
strategy 
rep lee hamilton dind the no 2 democrat on the house 
foreign affairs committee told reporters he believed bush should 
send an emissary to baghdad to make sure saddam isnt confused 
about the us position 
while agreeing that no talk of compromise can be made until iraq 
withdraws from kuwait hamilton said a strong argument can be 
made to talk to him directly or indirectly i dont see we have a 
lot to lose

workrelated injury and death reduce adverse health effects for 
the public and prevent environmental contamination said acting 
labor secretary roderick a dearment 
the environmental protection agency and the occupational safety 
and health administration a part of the labor department will 
conduct joint inspections and training as well as exchange 
information on violations 
the agencies initially will focus on petrochemical plants and 
lead smelters the agreement calls for setting priorities and 
targeting different industries each year 
last summer osha issued regulations governing the petrochemical 
industry after two accidents near houston killed 40 workers epa 
has agreed to give osha a list of the chemicals and data on 
accidental releases at selected plants 
epa already has targeted 28 lead smelters and osha will provide 
data on inspections and violations 
epa administrator william k reilly said cooperation will help 
our two agencies monitor and reduce pollutants inside facilities 
where workers are most likely to be directly exposed to toxic and 
hazardous chemicals

president bush on wednesday signed into law a 
fiveyear 170 billion farm bill that curbs federal subsidies and 
champions environmental protection 
this is the most environmentally progressive farm bill ever 
signed bush said at a white house signing ceremony as 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and key farmstate lawmakers 
looked on 
the measure approved by congress in october also renews for 
five years the food stamp program that helps feeds the nations 
poor it freezes minimum commodity target prices at 1990 levels and 
cuts subsidized acreage 15 percent a provision some senators 
opposed 
the federal deficitreduction plan approved last month requires 
a 13 billion cut in spending on farm programs through fiscal 1995 
bush said the new law builds on the success of the 1985 farm 
bill which has led to record farm income in recent years 
its a marketoriented bill that lets farmers make more of 
their own production decisions based on the market rather than on 
government support prices he said at the signing ceremony 
driven indoors from the rose garden by a drizzle 
it also encourages the research that is so crucial to helping 
our farmers maintain their global lead in agriculture he said 
the bill pegs the basic loan rates for wheat and feed grain to 
85 percent of the fiveyear moving average of market prices 
excluding the high and low years 
it establishes national standards for organic farming a rural 
development administration within the agriculture department to 
help communities recover economically from loss of farms and a 
matching fund program for rural businesses 
this farm bill will help farmers protect water quality and 
wildlife habitat and its greater flexibility will boost crop 
rotation in turn helping to control weeds and pests and erosion 
bush said 
it creates a wetlands reserve and bolsters an existing 
conservation reserve program that pays farmers to plant trees on 
highly erodible cropland the goal is to enroll 40 million to 45 
million new acres in the reserve 
it also sets up a program to encourage farmers to prevent 
contamination of ground and surface water on 10 million acres of 
land and requires the agriculture department to help farmers meet 
state and federal environmental standards 
additional provisions require farmers to keep records of 
hazardous pesticide use and authorize the first effort to assess 
the threat of global climate change on agriculture 
the bill sets new limits on restructuring farmers home 
administration loans to help delinquent borrowers satisfy their 
debt obligations borrowers will have a lifetime maximum of 
300000 in debt forgiveness under restructuring and buyouts 
it authorizes governmenttogovernment grant food assistance for 
developing countries and increases by 1 billion the credit 
guarantees available to promote us agricultural exports to 
emerging democracies 
bush pledged to bring home a fair deal for american farmers 
in global trade talks that are nearing completion he promised not 
to sign any agreement he considers unfair

the scientist who said an earthquake was 
probable in the midwest this weekend now reportedly thinks a quake 
is more likely outside the united states 
dr iben browning created a furor across the midwest when he 
said there was a strong chance of a major earthquake dec 23 in an 
area that includes the new madrid fault from arkansas through 
missouri to illinois 
but san francisco radio station kcbs today reported that a woman 
who said she was brownings daughter said he now believes theres a 
5050 chance of a major quake outside the united states the woman 
answered the phone at brownings home in new mexico and identified 
itself as evelyn browninggarriss 
theres a smaller chance in the midwest and almost no chance one 
will hit the san francisco bay areas hayward fault she said 
browning has insisted he never predicted an earthquake for the 
midwest he said he only suggested it was probable based on his 
observations of powerful high tides caused by the alignment of the 
earth moon and sun 
he says such forces can trigger earthquakes he pointed out that 
on dec 2 there will be the highest tidal force in 60 years 
the high tidal forces are going to be affecting 30 to 60 
degrees north latitude which includes almost all of america 
japan parts of china and the middle east and we were concerned 
about a number of places said browninggarriss 
browninggarriss could not be reached today by the associated 
press the telephone at brownings residence in tijeras outside 
albuquerque was repeatedly busy today and the operator said it was 
off the hook on tuesday a woman who said she was brownings 
daughter said he browning was on vacation and unavailable

the us economy staggered ahead at an annual 
rate of 17 percent even weaker than first reported from july 
through september the government said wednesday 
the commerce department based its downward revision in the gross 
national product the total output of goods and services on new 
information about economic performance in the third quarter 
originally the department had said the gnp rose 18 percent 
consumer spending was revised from a 36 percent gain to a 32 
percent advance inventories fell faster than first reported 
dropping 44 billion instead of the originally estimated 17 
billion 
housing construction was off 192 percent instead of 154 
percent while government spending rose just 06 percent rather than 
the 13 percent gain first reported 
the largest upward revision in the gnp came from an improvement 
in the nations trade deficit from 79 billion to just 500 
million 
business investment expanded 82 percent from july through 
september even higher than the 74 percent gain first reported 
last month 
the changes meant the total gnp was growing at an 
inflationadjusted annual rate of 417 trillion in the third 
quarter a gain of 18 billion over the second quarter 
kermit baker of cahners economics in newton mass suggested 
the revision meant the economy was tailing off a bit at the end 
of the quarter 
the economy clearly has weakened a lot baker added saying 
the third quarter gnp is not at all reflective of what well see 
in the fourth quarter 
worse federal reserve chairman alan greenspan usually cautious 
in describing the economy said wednesday all indications are 
that a meaningful downturn in aggregate output occurred as we moved 
through october into november 
economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch capital markets in 
new york agreed i think the fourth quarter weakness is very 
widespread he said 
many analysts believe the economy slipped into a recession 
following the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait and the subsequent 
oil price increases a recession generally is defined as two 
consecutive quarterly declines in the gnp 
the commerce department also reported that orders to us 
factories for durable goods jumped 36 percent in october to a 
seasonally adjusted 1294 billion after falling 16 percent the 
previous month 
excluding a 146 percent gain in the transportation sector 
however durablegoods orders actually fell 04 percent most of 
the transportation orders were for aircraft 
nevertheless nondefense capital goods orders often a 
barometer of future business investment plans rose 83 percent and 
continued to be one of the few improvements reflected in the 
thirdquarter gnp report 
in a third report the department said corporate aftertax 
profits jumped 67 percent during the third quarter although 
steinberg attributed most of that gain to inflation 
the department also reported that a gnp measure of inflation 
rose at an annual rate of 42 percent up slightly from 41 percent 
in the initial report a 39 percent inflation rate was posted in 
the second quarter a 64 percent rate in the first

women using estrogen after menopause run a 
slightly greater risk of breast cancer according to a study of 
more than 118000 nurses 
but the authors of the study which appears in wednesdays 
journal of the american medical association emphasized that the 
increased risk was modest and noted estrogen therapy holds many 
benefits for postmenopausal women 
while this study adds to a large body of information i would 
not recommend that a woman change her current use of estrogen 
therapy based on these data alone said one of the authors dr 
meir stampfer of the harvard school of public health in boston 
the researchers led by graham colditz of bostons brigham and 
womens hospital also said the additional risk of breast cancer 
dropped a year after the women stopped taking the female sex 
hormones 
taking estrogen after menopause can help prevent calcium loss 
from bones and may help to prevent heart disease the leading 
killer of older women 
even so these data suggest the need for caution in the use of 
estrogens the authors wrote 
researchers found the postmenopausal women taking estrogen were 
35 percent to 40 percent more likely to develop breast cancer than 
those who did not take the hormone but the risk was only about 
half that a woman might face if her mother had breast cancer 
researchers said 
the article analyzed data collected from 1976 to 1986 from more 
than 118000 women from the nurses health study 
the nurses health study established to study risk factors for 
cancer and other diseases was begun in 1976 with a group of more 
than 121000 female registered nurses 30 to 55 years old 
the data analyzed 367187 personyears of followup among 
postmenopausal women the researchers said in all 722 incidents 
of breast cancer were identified among these women

a federal judge wednesday lifted a ban on 
broadcasting tapes of manuel noriegas prison telephone calls 
defusing a confrontation between the rights of the media and those 
of a criminal defendant 
while cnn hailed the decision as a victory over censorship 
noriegas defense and constitutional specialists said the case 
showed the us supreme court was willing to accept at least 
temporary restrictions on the press 
us district judge william hoevelers decision ended a 
threeweek legal battle between noriega and the network which 
aired some of the tapes before the judge ordered cnn to stop 
cnn president tom johnson said the decision would allow the 
network to pursue its story on the governments taping of the 
ousted panamanian leaders conversations 
cnns coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this 
judicial prior restraint on press freedom he said despite the 
unfortunate delay cnns reporting of government taping of noriega 
phone conversations will continue 
the judge ruled after he and the attorneys reviewed transcripts 
of seven tapes the network submitted to the court last week 
following the supreme courts refusal to overturn hoevelers 
initial ban 
at wednesdays hearing noiega defense attorney frank rubino 
told the judge he would withdraw his request to stop the 
broadcasts he said the only tape that appeared to violate 
lawyerclient privilege already had been broadcast 
the problem today is that the tapes out its been published 
to the world rubino said 
it does no good to close the barn door after the horse is 
out 
federal prosecutors said they had no objections to lifting the 
ban once again insisting that noriegas rights were never violated 
by the routine prison taping 
rubino said outside the courtroom that the case has already left 
its mark in the balancing of first amendment protections for 
freedom of speech and sixth amendment guarantees of a fair trial 
the supreme court has upheld prior restraint and ordered cnn 
to turn the tapes over to the court and cnn complied with the 
court rubino said prior restraint is in full force and 
effect 
rodney smolla a william and mary law professor who heads the 
schools institute of bill of rights law also said the case has 
left a legacy in part because the supreme court refused to halt 
the ban 
he said it would have been better had the issue returned to the 
high court for a final resolution 
it casts its shadow and the shadow is negative said 
smolla other lawyers will aggressively pursue these sorts of 
strategies against news organization the battle isnt over yet 
jane kirtley head of the reporters committee for freedom of the 
press said the ruling showed the gag order should never have been 
issued in the first place but she added she was worried about the 
precedent set 
the unfortunate effect of that is that a new organization has 
been unconstitutionally constrained for several weeks from bringing 
information lawfully obtained to the attention of the general 
public she said that damage cannot be rectified 
cnns legal problems havent ended noriegas defense attorneys 
contend they want the judge to find cnn in contempt of court for 
airing one of the tapes even after the judges initial ban and 
fine the network 300000 per violation the judge has not said 
whether he will schedule a contempt hearing 
such a hearing could reopen the issue of whether the prior 
restraint was permissible said william greenhalgh a law professor 
at georgetown university 
now its much ado about nothing he said weve avoided 
the constitutional issue but if there is a contempt proceeding 
then we would really get into it 
the tape that touched off the dispute was between noriega and 
one of rubinos investigators with the lawyers spanishspeaking 
secretary serving as an interpreter in the conversation noriega 
is asked about two recently arrested panamanians and speculates 
that prosecutors intend to use them as witnesses against him 
rubino went into court nov 8 and hoeveler ordered cnn not to 
broadcast any tapes that interfere with attorneyclient privilege 
the network aired the tape later that day but withdrew it the 
following day when the 11th us circuit court of appeals backed 
hoeveler 
the supreme court then refused to intervene on a 72 vote 
forcing cnn to submit the tapes to the judge for review 
the government has acknowledged routine taping of prisoners 
phone calls at federal prisons including the metropolitan 
correctional center where noriega is being held on drugsmuggling 
charges noriega signed a release acknowledging his calls were 
being monitored but the defense said that release does not apply 
to conversations with his attorneys 
hoeveler on wednesday ordered the bureau of prisons to cease 
sharing noriegas tapes with other government agencies unless he 
approves 
following the hearing the judge returned the tapes to cnns 
attorneys the judges clerk said the tape transcripts remained 
sealed at the request of the network 
rubino has accused president guillermo endaras government in 
panama of giving the tapes to cnn after obtaining them from the 
us government ridiculing an ongoing fbi probe of the leak 
gregory craig an attorney for panama in that nations 65 
billion racketeering lawsuit against noriega submitted an 
affidavit in that case tuesday indicating he had received 
information from the tapes including items never broadcast by 
cnn 
craig strongly denied wednesday that he had heard the actual 
tapes however but refused to say whether his information came 
from the panamanian government 
noriega is charged with drug trafficking in a february 1988 
indictment accusing him of accepting 46 million in bribes from 
the medellin drug cartel to protect cocaine shipments to the united 
states

holiday shoppers who buy mailorder food 
should be mindful of a few safety rules the agriculture department 
said wednesday 
many consumers mistakenly think that because a meat or poultry 
product is vacuum packaged canned or smoked it doesnt need 
refrigeration said sue templin of the departments food safety 
and inspection service 
in fact she said most of these products must be 
refrigerated consumers should check the label or ordering 
information to see if refrigeration is required 
templin who manages the agencys tollfree consumer hotline 
said mailorder companies are responsible for shipping perishable 
meat and poultry products safely often using frozen gel packs or 
dry ice and insulated containers to keep products below 40 degrees 
fahrenheit during shipment 
food technologist robert savage said turkeys hams and other 
meats are smoked for flavor not preservation country hams on the 
other hand have a high salt content and are dry these are safe at 
room temperature for up to a year if uncooked and unsliced 
also he said hard dry sausages or processed cheeses can be 
kept at room temperatures for four to six weeks if unopened but 
some do require refrigeration 
questions about food safety for mailorder gifts may be referred 
to the departments meat and poultry hotline weekdays from 10 am 
to 4 pm est at 18005354555 in the washington dc area

members of a gubernatorial commission are 
recommending dramatic changes in landuse practices in maryland 
because they are alarmed that population growth will doom the 
chesapeake bay 
the proposal unveiled tuesday also recognizes political 
realities and tries to steer a middle course 
the drafting committee of the governors commission on growth in 
the chesapeake region urged passage of legislation designed to 
direct growth to areas where its environmental effects will be 
minimized 
the time has come not to stop growth but to grow in a 
logical efficient pattern thats the goal of this legislation 
said walter a frey iii chairman of the panel 
this is not an issue of growth versus nogrowth frey said 
the committees recommendations emphasized the need to protect 
both the environment and the states economy because economic 
development is a key part of marylands quality of life 
the draft plan would require local governments to submit for 
state approval 30year growth management programs the programs 
would have to outlaw all new growth in environmentally sensitive 
areas such as land around streams and key wildlife habitats 
the local plans also would have to restrict new development on 
farmland and in forests to one housing unit for every 20 acres 
in general the proposal is designed to ensure that most new 
building take place in existing communities or be clustered to 
save as much land as possible 
frey said by ending the sprawl that characterizes current 
development trends in maryland as much as twothirds of the land 
that would have been used for building can be saved 
despite the dramatic changes proposed by the panel the 
commissions chairman characterized the proposal as a moderate 
approach 
its my feeling what we are proposing is a minimal program 
said former rep michael d barnes dmd i wish we could go 
much further 
we have in the bay today 1 percent of the oysters that were 
there in our grandfathers time our grandchildren are not going to 
have crabs if we dont change 
the draft plan will now be considered by the full commission and 
then submitted to gov william donald schaefer in january in time 
for consideration by the 1991 general assembly session 
alarmed by projections that marylands population would jump by 
1 million during the next 30 years and the environmental 
implications of that increase schaefer last fall formed the barnes 
commission at the time he called for an action agenda

video we passed on it she said 
the madonnathon will go on as planned she added

the three factions that have fought an 
11month war for control of liberia signed a ceasefire accord 
wednesday raising hopes for an end to massacres that have claimed 
more than 10000 lives 
nigerias president said a regional military task force will 
remain in liberia indefinitely to monitor the truce 
the agreement was signed at the end of a summit convened in this 
west african nation to seek a settlement of the liberian civil war 
leaders of 13 nations attended 
signing the agreement according to witnesses were charles 
taylor head of the main rebel faction a representative of prince 
johnson leader of a breakaway rebel force and wilmot diggs a 
liberian army officer representing the followers of slain president 
samuel doe 
also signing was gambias head of state sir dawda jawara 
chairman of the west african regional organization that sponsored 
the talks 
details of the ceasefires provisions were not immediately 
available 
president ibrahim babangida of nigeria military ruler of the 
regions most powerful nation was among those at the summit he 
said nigeria would offer development aid to liberia and that a 
military task force would stay on to oversee the ceasefire 
we have a commitment to assist the country in its 
rehabilitation efforts when peace returns and i am hoping that 
will be in the next six months babangida told reporters 
he depicted taylor as a patriot who would cooperate in the peace 
process 
the summit took place in malis capital bamako 400 miles 
northeast of the liberian capital monrovia 
it marked the first time that leaders of all three liberian 
factions negotiated face to face taylor had refused to attend 
previous peace talks 
he began the uprising by invading liberia from the ivory coast 
on dec 24 he has declared himself president and says his forces 
control most of liberia founded in 1847 by freed american slaves 
the faction led by prince johnson broke with taylor and 
johnsons fighters killed doe in september 
the 8000strong west african task force arrived in liberia on 
aug 5 and was attacked by taylors rebels it replied with bombing 
raids and heavy bombardments that forced taylors fighters from 
monrovias eastern suburbs 
the west african task force is made up of soldiers from nigeria 
ghana guinea gambia and sierra leone the leaders of all of those 
countries were at the conference in mali except guinea which sent 
a cabinet minister 
also at the conference was veteran opposition politician amos 
sawyer who was installed as liberian president with the backing of 
the west african task force 
taylor last week began shelling the port of monrovia where the 
west africans have set up headquarters and hundreds of civilians 
have sought refuge 
johnson and government officials agreed previously to a 
ceasefire and had accepted sawyers mandate to organize fair 
elections 
most of the casualties in the war have been civilians about 
half of liberias 23 million people have sought refuge in 
neighboring nations 
the west african task force says it controls monrovia but 
refugees who fled this week said does former soldiers and 
johnsons guerrillas terrorize and kill civilians in the capital

last friday president bush met in geneva with 
the president of syria on sunday the washington representative of 
cuban president fidel castro was invited to chat with the state 
departments no 3 official 
bush must be serious about the persian gulf crisis a third of 
the countries on the official terrorism list got highlevel access 
in a space of 48 hours 
and the wooing of cuba continued wednesday when secretary of 
state james a baker iii scheduled an evening meeting with that 
nations foreign minister 
these are classic examples of what is known in diplomatic 
parlance as a competing interest 
under normal circumstances the united states does not deal at 
senior levels with syrian or cuban representatives but the persian 
gulf crisis is of such magnitude that a businessasusual posture 
does not apply 
because of a competing interest the roosevelt administration 
overlooked stalins slaughter of millions during the 1930s in order 
to make common cause with the soviet union against nazi germany in 
the 1940s not many people inquired about stalins human rights 
record 
thirty years later when the soviets were the pariah president 
nixon jetted off to china during the height of the cultural 
revolution another example of mass repression because he saw 
china as a useful counterweight to moscow 
human rights took a back seat because of a competing interest 
the same mentality is at work now in the us effort to stop 
saddam hussein 
the gulf crisis has enabled china to break out part way from its 
diplomatic isolation resulting from the crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators 18 months ago 
chinas foreign minister will visit washington on friday it is 
an invitation he might not have received were it not for the 
campaign the administration has waged with security council members 
for support for a resolution authorizing the use of force against 
iraq 
at a minimum china has indicated it will not use its veto power 
to kill the resolution 
last weekend newspapers were awash with photos showing bush in 
a playful mood with syrian president hafez assad a leader whose 
human rights record is viewed by some experts as being on a par 
with saddams 
justifying the encounter bush said i have no problem sitting 
down with him assad for this common objective 
bush felt syrias front line role in the multinational 
force including its commitment eventually to deploy 20000 troops 
warranted highlevel us recognition 
the meeting did not go unnoticed in israel where officials 
noted that bush has yet to stop for a visit 
on wednesday however bush agreed to meet with yitzhak shamir 
next month when the israeli prime minister makes a private visit to 
the united states 
syria has been on the state departments terrorism list since 
1986 it is alleged to have masterminded an attempt to blow up an 
israeli airliner in london 
cuba has been a diplomatic outcast in washington for years not 
since before president reagans 1981 inaugural has a cuban official 
been on a state department invitation list even for a social 
gathering 
the last highlevel uscuban oneonone meeting veteran cuba 
watchers say there havent been any since castro met with vice 
president nixon in 1959 
thus it was highly unusual when the departments thirdranking 
official under secretary robert kimmitt invited castros chief 
diplomat in washington jose arbesu for a chat sunday 
both countries are members of the united nations security 
council and both made it clear the discussion was limited to the 
persian gulf crisis for its part the bush administration has no 
interest in discussing bilateral political topics with cuba 
theres little doubt that washington would be quite pleased if 
cuba came around to the us view of the gulf crisis but that 
seems highly unlikely given cubas opposition to some previous 
council resolutions on the gulf 
the other countries on the state department terrorism list are 
north korea libya iran and of course iraq

the bush administration is being accused of 
ignoring mexican human rights abuses and election fraud in its 
eagerness for the free trade pact that dominated talks at the 
usmexico summit 
it has become indispensable for washingtons interests that 
mexico appears to be an example of democracy and respect for human 
rights one of mexicos oldest human rights groups the eureka 
committee said in an open letter to president bush and president 
carlos salinas de gortari 
but everyday reality is just the opposite the will of 
citizens is not respected in the ballot boxes nor are the most 
elemental social and human rights the letter said it was 
published tuesday 
salinas spokesman carlos garcia on wednesday declined comment 
on the eureka committee letter 
there was no immediate comment from the bush administration 
mexico has been sharply criticized by international human rights 
organizations such as amnesty international and americas watch 
election fraud is so common that mexicans have an extensive slang 
vocabulary for the myriad ways to cheat at the polls 
salinas whose institutional revolutionary party or pri has 
governed mexico for the last 61 years has promised democratic 
reforms but not at the expense of what he calls political 
stability 
skeptics say the pris idea of political stability is continued 
oneparty domination of mexico a country peruvian novelist mario 
vargas llosa recently dubbed the perfect dictatorship 
salinas has been widely praised in the united states for his 
aggressive moves to open mexicos long protected economy his 
slowness on political reform has gone largely unremarked 
the pri in power means a guarantee of forging ahead with the 
free trade agreement riordan roett head of the latin american 
studies program at johns hopkins university in washington told the 
daily el financiero 
bush and salinas said in advance that mexicos internal affairs 
would be offlimits at this weeks summit 
bush doesnt want to embarrass salinas susan kaufman 
purcell vice president of the new york citybased americas 
society said in a telephone interview wednesday 
the nonprofit society headed by david rockefeller is an 
umbrella organization for business and professional interests in 
latin america 
us opponents of the free trade agreement can use arguments 
for more democracy in mexico to help defeat the agreement and it 
works the same way in mexico purcell said 
mexicans are nearly as ambivalent about pressure from washington 
as american officials are about disturbing salinas national 
sovereignty is a near obsession in mexico and even the fiercest 
opponents of the pri are reluctant to see outsiders get involved 
nonetheless several opposition parties and human rights groups 
held small demonstrations during the twoday summit protests that 
were overshadowed by the official events 
the eureka committee founded by mothers of people who have 
disappeared marked bushs arrival with a protest in monterrey 
demanding the government account for 500 political prisoners

poachers beware robodeer is here 
the state division of natural resources has used a 
remotecontrol der decoy complete with a 12point rack of 
antlers to arrest 120 hunters who illegally shot at the decoy from 
roads during the last three weeks 
the states gun deer hunting season began nov 19 and ends 
monday 
a lot of roadhunters were getting wise to our nonmoving 
decoys so we decided to make one that moves said kenny painter 
a dnr law enforcement captain so far it seems to work just 
fine 
its interesting and fun work because funny things happen 
sometimes but its really serious because this sort of thing 
really reflects badly on hunters and hunting said painter who 
operate the decoy dubbed robodeer 
previous decoys were little more than antlers and deer hides 
tacked to crude frames but a wiggle to the control joystick gives 
a flick of the tail or turn of the head 
instead of setting the decoy in a grassy field where it would 
be obvious painter places the buck in a brushy area to make sure 
the decoy isnt used to entrap hunters into committing illegal 
acts 
we dont want to make it too tempting he said we could 
put a set of antlers on him that would knock your eyes out but 
again we dont want to be so much of a temptation that no one 
could pass up a shot 
its trickery sure but it isnt entrapment he said

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
wednesday that oilprice problems from the persian gulf crisis have 
pushed the economy into a meaningful downturn confirming 
private analysts recession talk 
appearing before the house banking committee he also said the 
central bank can do little to cushion the effect of higher oil 
prices on americans standard of living 
separately the commerce department reported that the economy 
as measured by the gross national product grew at a lackluster 17 
percent annual rate in the julyseptember quarter even worse than 
the previously reported 18 percent rate 
most private analysts believe the economy has weakened sharply 
since the quarter ended an assessment greenspan confirmed but he 
carefully avoided describing the deterioration as a recession 
which is defined as a contraction of six months or more in the gnp 
all indications are that a meaningful downturn in aggregate 
output occurred as we moved through october into november 
greenspan told the committee 
rep charles schumer dny responded this seems to me to 
be a nice way of saying weve entered a recession 
greenspan cautioned however that we wont know whether it is 
the beginning of a recession or just some aberration in economic 
activity for quite a while we couldnt conceivably know for 
certain until april or may of next year 
he said that another commerce department report wednesday did 
not fit with the weak data orders to us factories for big 
ticket durable goods designed to last three or more years rose 
more strongly than anticipated in october jumping 36 percent 
driven by orders for automobiles and aircraft 
it is clearly the case that the world out there when you 
look at the hard data is not in as bad shape as it feels he 
said 
greenspan conceded though that the gnp will contract in the 
current quarter if the decline begun in october persists 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the economy 
is not in a recession yet but added i think everyone 
acknowledges were in a slow period 
greenspan said oil prices which have risen from 20 a barrel 
before the iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 to around 33 now 
are cutting the spending power of businesses and consumers that 
weakness is heightened he said by the enormous uncertainty 
about how and when the tensions in the persian gulf will be 
resolved he said 
the clearest manifestation of the oil shock is in the labor 
market where private employment and hours of work dropped 
markedly in october he said 
the drop in employment and hours is causing personal income to 
decline at the very time that rising energy prices are squeezing 
many household budgets this drop in rea purchasing power along 
with plunging consumer sentiment does not bode well for the 
nearterm trends in consumer demand he said 
also weakening the economy is a shortage of credit for 
businesses which greenspan said has proceeded somewhat further 
than when he first noted it publicly in july 
the available anecdotal information clearly suggests that many 
types of businesses are encountering greater difficulty obtaining 
financing he said 
the fed has responded to the deteriorating economy by cutting 
interest rates twice this month greenspan confirmed that the fed 
lowered the federal funds rate which banks charge among themselves 
for overnight loans to 75 percent from 8 percent at the start of 
the month 
he resisted panel members efforts to lure him into indicating 
whether the fed would continue to loosen its rein on credit 
i could give you a qualified answer but it would be so 
muddled id just as soon not inflict it on you he said 
in his opening statement greenspan said i can only offer the 
assurance that the federal reserve will seek as we have in the 
past to foster economic stability and sustainable growth 
he cautioned however there is no policy initiative that can 
in the end prevent the transfer of wealth and cut in our standard 
of living that stems from higher prices for imported oil 
the central banks strategy is to raise interest rates to dampen 
inflationary pressures and to cut rates when the economy needs a 
boost the bank must be careful in fighting a recession now because 
of the inflationary effect of higher oil prices 
greenspan said prices are rising for goods and services heavily 
dependent on oil such as airline tickets but he said that at the 
moment the evidence suggests the oil shock has not passed into 
wages

prime minister john major welcomed his defeated 
rivals into his cabinet on wednesday and called for a nation in 
which all may prosper according to their talent their 
application and their good fortune 
i dont promise you that it will be easy and i dont promise 
you that it will be quick major said outside 10 downing st 
after being confirmed as prime minister by queen elizabeth ii 
if you forgive me he added i will go into no 10 
straight away and make a start right now 
major at 47 the youngest prime minister of the century had 
displayed both talent and tenacity in overcoming childhood poverty 
and rising rapidly through the government 
it was his fortune to be the popular choice of a party torn by 
rebellion against his patron margaret thatcher 
hours after saying farewell to her major announced a new 
cabinet lineup that reached across the bruised wings of the 
conservative party 
michael heseltine the aggressor in a leadership race that 
toppled mrs thatcher was appointed secretary of the environment 
and major thanked him for his contributions to party unity 
chris patten the former environment secretary and a tory 
liberal was installed as chairman of the party the rightleaning 
former chairman kenneth baker who had spent the past two weeks 
sniping at heseltine was given the cabinet post of home secretary 
douglas hurd who ran third in the leadership race was kept as 
foreign secretary and tom king stayed as defense secretary 
emphasizing the continuity of britains tough stance in the persian 
gulf crisis 
the government also announced wednesday that it was resuming 
diplomatic relations with syria completing a rapprochement which 
began under mrs thatcher 
major said he hoped to build on the achievements of his 
predecessor who said in her own farewell speech that we leave 
the united kingdom in a very much better state than when we came 
here 11 years ago 
now it is time for a new chapter to open and i wish john major 
all the luck in hhe world said mrs thatcher leaving downing 
street for a home in suburban dulwich 
major one of only two men in the cabinet who did not attend a 
university said he wanted to build a society of opportunity 
by that i mean an open society a society in which what people 
fulfill will depend upon their talent their application and their 
good fortune he said 
in particular i want to build a country that is at ease with 
itself a country that is confident and a country that is prepared 
and willing to make the changes necessary to provide a better 
quality of life for all our citizens said major 
the environment post was an ironic reward for the 57yearold 
heseltine it makes him responsible for revising the deeply 
unpopular local tax known as the poll tax the issue he had 
turned very effectively against mrs thatcher 
it also brought heseltine back to the office he occupied in mrs 
thatchers first cabinet of 1979 he became defense secretary in 
1983 and abruptly resigned in 1986 in a bitter dispute with the 
prime minister 
earlier in the day thatcher loyalist cecil parkinson had 
resigned as secretary of transportation 
a british prime minister takes office without parades brass 
bands and inaugural balls and with only the briefest of speeches 
major is due to take his first turn answering prime ministers 
questions in the house of commons on thursday one week after he 
announced he was a candidate for the job 
as the candidate endorsed by mrs thatcher major could risk 
antagonizing the partys right wing by bringing heseltine back into 
the government 
heseltine and hurd had taken the initiative to begin the healing 
within the party conceding defeat within minutes of one another on 
tuesday night although major had fallen two votes short of the 
majority required under party rules 
some insiders saw the big swing to major as due partly to what 
one called the guilt factor about dumping mrs thatcher and 
partly to his status as her protege 
there is no ill feeling at the end of this contest major 
said i believe that there is a smile on the face of the party 
that will mean we are fully united for the future

residents of two lowincome neighborhoods have 
become so frustrated with crime that groups of them ar patrolling 
streets with shotguns a city councilwoman said 
there is significant crime within the dallas area however 
there is greater crime in poor neighborhoods deputy mayor pro 
tem diane ragsdale said tuesday to that end neighborhoods have 
looked for a means of survival 
another proposal for fighting crime enlisting the help of the 
national guard was withdrawn at a council meeting wednesday after 
members of the south dallas community objected 
police are predicting record levels of violent crime in dallas 
the homicide tally for the year is a record 400 but officers said 
the civilian patrols could result in an increased number of 
shootings 
we certainly encourage citizens to get involved to help the 
police fight crime we do not encourage citizens to arm themselves 
to do this said police spokesman sgt jim chandler 
ms ragsdale said the shotgun patrols began in two poor 
neighborhoods in south dallas because the communities are 
dissatisfied with police protection are just looking for ways to 
cope 
i think a lot of it is out of frustration she said the 
police department constantly says that theyre overworked and 
underpaid and stretched too thin and so the community is looking 
for constructive ways to help themselves 
she wouldnt identify the neighborhoods or say how many 
civilians were patrolling 
middleclass neighborhoods can hire offduty police 
officers or security officers poor neighborhoods cannot afford 
that luxury she said we do live in america and people have a 
right to defend themselves and their neighborhoods and their 
families as long as its within the law 
ms ragsdale denied the groups were made up of vigilantes 
these are responsible people that are doing this these arent 
irresponsible people she said 
but chandler said armed civilian patrols are dangerous 
theres no telling who they might encounter when theyre out 
there doing that he said

radcliffe college has given the smithsonian 
institution a set of the papers of amelia earhart the aviatrix 
whose legend endures more than a halfcentury after she disappeared 
into the pacific skies 
earharts letters to her mother telegrams of congratulations 
from admirers and quack theories that she is still living somewhere 
on an isolated pacific reef are among the 11 reels of microfilm 
given to smithsonians national air and space museum in a ceremony 
tuesday evening 
to think that im standing here looking right at her airplane 
is very special to me said patricia king director of 
radcliffes schlesinger library she said the papers donated 
during the 1960s by earharts sister are among the most prized at 
the university 
they attract the attention of scholars and students we get 
letters from sixth graders from the midwest who want to know more 
about amelia earhart king said 
in 1932 earhart gained worldwide fame by becoming the first 
woman to cross the atlantic alone that same year she also became 
the first to fly crosscountry alone and in january 1935 earhart 
made the first solo flight by anyone from honolulu to the us 
mainland 
earharts bright red lockheed vega 5b used in the 
transatlantic and crosscountry flights along with her flight 
jacket and radio are on display at the museum 
the project involved a gamble but gambling is a human frailty 
and i suppose there is a certain extra fascination in playing for 
high stakes earhart wrote in an article contained in the 
collection the stakes on this throw of course was my life 
against the joy of doing something i wanted to do very much 
earhart often discussed the subject of courage and declared 
women at least the equal of men she insisted that women should 
have the same freedoms as men and in a speech to the daughters of 
the american revolution in 1933 said women should be drafted in 
war along with men 
she worried publicly about becoming a heavyhanded feminist 
but accepted the label saying i become increasingly weary of 
male superiority unquestioned 
earharts disappearance over the pacific while attempting a 
roundtheworld flight in 1937 turned a popular heroine into a cult 
figure shrouded in mystery 
the fate of the beautiful dashing flier remains the stuff of 
tabloid headlines a favorite theory one detailed in 
correspondence included in the earhart collection is that she was 
captured and executed by the japanese most scholars accept the 
more mundane hypothesis that she ran out of gas 
at this point it really doesnt matter how she died except to 
satisfy the morbidly curious said fay gillis wells a veteran 
pilot who flew together with earhart i hope she went quickly the 
way she always wanted to go

the administration on wednesday took on the 
international atomic energy agency saying its inspectors had been 
misled into concluding iraq wasnt developing nuclear weapons 
the comments are the latest in a concerted campaign by president 
bush and his top aides to warn that iraq could have a nuclear 
weapon within months 
the administration has briefed some members of the 15nation 
un security council about its contentions that iraq has secret 
nuclear plans said one official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the decision to share the topsecret information was apparently 
part of an intense administration effort to win as many votes as 
possible for a resolution allowing military force to dislodge iraq 
from kuwait 
two inspectors of the viennabased iaea which monitors 
compliance with the nuclear nonproliferation treaty visited 
nuclear sites in iraq last week and announced they had not found 
any evidence of atomic weapons development 
we think the international atomic energy agency is wrong 
said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater they see only what 
iraq wants them to see 
fitzwater said president bush had received briefings from 
intelligence officials that led him to reveal several days ago that 
iraq had a nuclear capability that could come to fruition within 
months 
the inspectors who conduct sixmonth checks in iraq toured a 
storage plant and a fuelproducing plant nov 1922 at baghdads 
invitation they apparently checked on a 27pound mass of highly 
enriched uranium that iraq salvaged from its osirak nuclear reactor 
which was destroyed by an israeli air attack in 1981 
fitzwater said he did not know whether congress which is 
holding hearings on us involvement in the gulf had received 
similar briefings 
another administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said us intelligence agencies were asked to prepare an 
assessment of iraqs nuclear program following its aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait 
analysts concluded that in a worst case scenario iraq 
could cobble together a crude device using the technology and 
enriched uranium now in its possession he said but they also 
questioned the value of such a device which would be highly 
inaccurate 
iraq could use the uranium just inspected by the iaea or it 
might have a small amount of weaponsgrade uranium smuggled in from 
another source experts said 
to put together a basic weapon iraq would need at least 33 
pounds of uranium whereas the quantity under iaea inspection is 
only 27 pounds said peter clausen a nuclear nonproliferation 
expert at the union of concerned scientists 
government analysts have not changed their basic assessment that 
it would take iraq at least five years before it was ready with a 
tested weapon that could accurately deliver nuclear material to a 
specific target said the administration official 
it would be the late 1990s before they could have a militarily 
significant weapon he said 
during testimony before the senate armed services committee two 
former chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff raised serious doubts 
about the bush administrations statements on iraqs potential 
nuclear capability 
recent reports of near term are not right they are 
exaggerated retired adm william crowe said in reference to 
comments made by bush and other administration officials 
david c jones said the issue of nuclear weapons and iraq is a 
longterm issue 
israeli officials have put the timetable at three to 10 years 
an israeli official agreed with the us assessment that iraq 
could quickly put together a primitive weapon but wondered whether 
president saddam hussein would risk the inevitable retaliation by 
the united states and its allies 
he would only have a oneshot deal with this one primitive 
weapon said the official who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
experts say saddam could drop such a device from a plane or put 
it on a truck and ram the vehicle into an enemy target 
all the analysts agreed iraq does not have the ability to enrich 
uranium the process whereby uranium is turned into weaponsgrade 
material iraq has been trying to buy components and knowhow to 
assemble a chain of gas centrifuges for uranium enrichment but is 
still several years away from completing such a project said the 
official

aftertax corporate profits jumped 67 percent 
from july through september the government reported wednesday 
some analysts said the rise was due primarily to inflation 
most of the gain was basically inflation profits said 
economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch capital markets in new 
york if you take away those profits actually were declining in 
the third quarter 
nevertheless the commerce department said the gain was the 
largest since an 89 percent advance in the first quarter of 1988 
it followed a 06 percent decline in the second quarter which 
erased a weak 05 percent increase in the first 
analysts attribute the sluggish aftertax profit picture to the 
weak economy the department reported on wednesday that the gross 
national product the nations total output of goods and services 
advanced at a lackluster 17 percent annual rate from july 
through september 
many analysts believe the economy now is in a recession where 
profits typically decline 15 percent to 20 percent some believe 
however that the downturn will be mild and shortlived leading to 
a smaller decline 
aftertax profits totaled 1772 billion at an annual rate in 
the third quarter of 1990 
among the details of the report 
beforetax profits which totaled 3154 billion at an annual 
rate rose 54 percent in the second quarter beforetax profits 
were up 08 percent in the second quarter and 24 percent in the

the philippine government is 
negotiating with a representative of ferdinand marcos family for 
the return of 5 billion in assets of the late president an 
official said wednesday 
david castro chairman of the presidential commission on good 
government declined to say what conditions had been set for the 
return of the assets 
he said the assets were a combination of money and property 
in other countries which he did not identify 
the presidential commission is charged with recovering wealth 
amassed by marcos and his cronies during his 20year rule a 
popular uprising drove marcos into exile in hawaii in 1986 he died 
there in september 1989 
on wednesday solicitor general francisco chavez said he will 
ask president corazon aquino to relieve him of responsibility for 
handling lawsuits against the marcos family and their associates 
because he had not been consulted on a recent outofcourt 
settlement 
the solicitor general referred to a deal between the 
presidential commission and roberto benedicto a former marcos 
associate in which the government recovered 78 million in assets 
legislators said the nov 3 pact with benedicto was immoral and 
illegal because it enabled him to retain allegedly embezzled funds 
under the agreement benedicto retained 357 million in various 
firms the government also agreed to drop civil suits against him 
and grant him immunity from future suits 
despite claims that marcos and his allies stole up to 10 
billion the government has yet to win a single lawsuit against the 
late presidents family

local prosecutors ought to be immune from 
lawsuits over the advice they give to police just as they are 
immune from lawsuits in most other parts of their jobs the justice 
department argued in the supreme court on monday 
the departments position was offered in the case of an indiana 
woman hypnotized by police because they suspected she shot her 
children 
the justices who heard 60 minutes of arguments in the case are 
expected to decide by july whether cathy burns of muncie may sue 
the prosecutor who advised police to hypnotize her 
prosecutors nationwide enjoy absolute protection against being 
sued for filing charges seeking convictions in court and most 
other official duties 
at issue is whether they are entitled to such protection if they 
advise police to violate peoples rights an appeals court in the 
indiana case ruled that the prosecutor could not be sued but other 
appeals courts have disagreed in other cases 
michael sutherlin mrs burns lawyer said the advicegiving 
function of prosecutors should not be covered by the absolute 
shield 
only conduct that is the exclusive prerogative of the 
prosecutor should be protected by absolute immunity he said 
but justice antonin scalia said he found it difficult to draw 
the line 
a prosecutor is safe from suit if he filed an indictment that 
was a pack of lies scalia said what is the distinction between 
that and telling police to violate someones rights he asked 
the former example is closely connected to the judicial process 
sutherlin replied we must tolerate those cases of egregious 
conduct he said but not for letting a prosecutor shoot from 
the hip when telling police what to do 
the bush administration sided with the indiana attorney 
generals office in urging more protection for prosecutors 
justice department lawyer michael lazerwitz argued that 
prosecutors will be loathe to share their expertise with police if 
they risk being sued the advicegiving function moreover is 
closely connected to the judicial process when carried out by a 
prosecutor he said 
justice thurgood marshall said the governments position could 
lead to more abuses of peoples rights 
the rule we get is if youre the police and you want to 
violate someones rights get a prosecutors advice he said 
police enjoy limited immunity from being sued they cannot be 
sued successfully if they acted in good faith and believed what 
they were doing was lawful 
chief counsel robert spear of the indiana attorney generals 
office said absolute immunity should extend even to lawyers hired 
by police to give them advice about investigations 
mrs burns came under police suspicion after a shooting at her 
home on sept 2 1982 she said an intruder knocked her unconscious 
and wounded her two sons eddie griffin and denny sells while they 
slept 
when police asked chief deputy prosecutor richard red of 
delaware county ind whether they should hypnotize her he 
recommended it 
the police officers said they doubted the technique was lawful 
because they had been told during their police academy training 
that hypnotizing suspects was not acceptable 
under hypnosis mrs burns identified the assailant as katie 
and also referred to herself at one point by the same name the 
police said 
the officers concluded she had a split personality and regarded 
her statement under hypnosis as a confession 
they then obtained a search warrant from a judge without 
revealing that the alleged confession was made under hypnosis when 
the police asked the judge for the warrant reed questioned them 
without mentioning the hypnosis 
the judge later ruled the statement given under hypnosis 
inadmissible and reed dropped the charges against mrs burns 
she then sued reed and the police accusing them of violating 
her rights her suit said she was fired from her job as a muncie 
police dispatcher lost custody of her children and was ostracized 
by her neighbors 
she received 250000 to settle her claims against the officers 
a federal judge dismissed the suit against reed who was elected 
delaware county prosecutor this month 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals agreed that reed was 
absolutely immune from suit when acting as a legal adviser to the 
police but federal appeals courts elsewhere have held that 
prosecutors do not enjoy such immunity for giving advice to police

goh chok tong was sworn in as prime minister of 
singapore on wednesday and promised to continue the course of his 
predecessor who helped change the nation from a slumridden port 
to a clean economic dynamo 
my mission is clear to ensure that singapore thrives and 
grows after lee kuan yew to build a nation of character and 
grace where people can live lives of dignity and fulfillment and 
care for one another goh said 
goh took the oath of office in a lowkey 35minute ceremony at 
city hall it was held in the same chamber where lee was sworn in 
as prime minister 31 years ago 
the authoritarian lee credited with shaping modern singapore 
sat nearby in his new role as elder statesman lee submitted his 
resignation monday after years of preparing for a smooth transfer 
of power 
since he expects to preside over continuity not a break with 
the past goh said earlier the changeover is seen as a 
nonevent 
the new leader spent 13 years as an understudy in lees cabinet 
he took over most daytoday decisionmaking after becoming deputy 
prime minister more than five years ago 
goh 49 was trained as an economist and headed the government

scrap the paternalistic approach of lee 
echoing president bush goh said in a speech in parliament in 
june the society which we want to bring about will be more 
refined more compassionate kinder and gentler 
nothing would be in greater contrast to his predecessors 
combative style 
in lees later years his opponents found themselves subject to 
arrest detention without charge or trial public humiliation and 
general harassment by an administration reluctant to acknowledge 
dissent 
we decide what is right never mind what the people want 
lee said several years ago 
a fit 67 lee is not passing completely from the scene and his 
influence is expected to remain as strong as he cares to make it 
he was sworn in with gohs cabinet as senior minister without 
portfolio 
lee will continue in charge of the countrys only significant 
political organization the peoples action party which controls 
80 of the 81 elected seats in parliament

boxing great mohammed ali is expected to 
leave baghdad iraq with at least 14 american hostages saturday 
his spokesman said in an interview wednesday 
spokesman jaber mohammed said ali and his entourage expected to 
receive a list of the hostages thursday when they would know the 
exact number 
he said iraqi officials assured them it would be at least 14 
and allowed them to pick their departure date 
rivate 
groups and industry to utilize a wide variety of approaches to 
meet housing needs the white house said 
other provisions include 
increasing public housing grants to 160 million for drug 
elimination efforts and youth sports programs 
reauthorizing the mckinney act programs for the homeless 
emphasizing government assistance for rehabilitation over new 
construction and requiring higher state and local contributions 
where new construction of public housing is deemed necessary 
federal housing administration assessment of new annual 
premium on borrowers of fhabacked loans that increases minimum 
upfront closing costs 
combining housing assistance with support services for the 
elderly 
the national affordable housing act gives people the best kind 
of government assistance it provides opportunity and it 
encourages responsibility without the shackles of dependency 
bush said wednesdaywe want public housing to become a 
springboard for independence not a bottomless pit for 
dependency 
the white house and housing and urban development secretary jack 
kemp have touted their new housing program as an example of how to 
empower the poor to help themselves 
a cornerstone of our effort to reduce the heavy hand of 
government is this idea of empowering people not bureaucracies 
bush said in a signing ceremony in the east room 
empowerment is a theme that has generated controversy within 
the administration with richard darman director of the office of 
management and budget recently dismissing it in a speech as a 
meaningless catch phrase 
but bush has set up within his domestic policy council a task 
force on empowerment chaired by kemp 
the general philosophy say those involved is to give people 
tools to help themselves rather than having government social 
programs do it for them 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater asked wednesday 
what bush thinks of the apparent rift between conservatives within 
the administration who are pushing empowerment and those who pooh 
pooh it as mere rhetoric responded were all one big happy 
family here everybody is working together 
earlier wednesday kemp briefed members of the domestic policy 
council on possible initiatives under consideration for the state 
of the union address and fiscal 1992 budget kemp has been a 
longtime backer of housing vouchers and other selfhelp programs 
for the poor 
among the administration officials who attended the briefing 
were vice president dan quayle darman and white house chief of 
staff john sununu

the united states sent an ambassador back to 
lebanon the state department announced wednesday after pulling 
out all us officials from beirut last year because of heavy 
fighting among rival lebanese militias 
ambassador ryan crocker arrived in beirut wednesday after a us 
security team inspected the situation in the lebanese capital last 
weekend said deputy spokesman richard boucher the state 
department wants to return additional diplomats to beirut once 
their security can be guaranteed he said 
the decision to send in crocker despite the stilltenuous 
security situation reflects the administrations strong support for 
the new government of elias hrawi which is trying to impose its 
control over the divided country 
the administration discussed its decision with syria which 
backs hrawi with 40000 troops in lebanon said one official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
crocker who was named to his post by president bush five months 
ago will present his credentials to hrawi soon boucher said a 
date has not yet been set 
hrawi implementing an arab leaguebrokered peace plan to end 
lebanons 15year civil war has managed to convince the countrys 
eight major moslem and christian militias to evacuate beirut and 
its suburbs with their weapons this month 
compliance by the militias who are believed responsible for 
most of the estimated 150000 war deaths clears the way for 
government troops to take over control of beirut 
syria used its troops and air force last month to remove another 
major obstacle to unifying lebanon a mutiny by christian gen 
michel aoun who barricaded himself with his loyalists at the 
presidential palace 
pessimists argue the two previous bids to unite beirut collapsed 
in renewed warfare despite the presence of the syrian army in 1976 
and an international peacekeeping force in 1984 
us officials say crocker a career foreign service officer who 
has served in lebanon before will stay as long as its deemed 
safe 
the question on how long he stays is really a daytoday 
judgment said boucher hes there today

its elementary for doc watson to sniff out 
forbidden fruit at the honolulu post office but then doc has the 
nose for it the agriculture department said wednesday 
doc watson is an elite member of the departments beagle 
brigade a band of dogs trained to sniff arriving overseas luggage 
at us airports to detect illegal fruit meat and other items that 
might contain harmful agricultural pests 
a 1989 federal law prohibits the mailing of forbidden fruit but 
usda officials in honolulu had to seek criminal warrants to search 
suspected parcels headed for the mainland 
so doc watson last may was called in as part of a pilot program 
to narrow the odds of finding contraband 
the departments animal and plant health inspection service said 
that as of oct 31 the beagle had sniffed out 477 illegal parcels 
of produce 
overall the take weighed 4229 pounds and included 177 
interceptions of fruit flies foreign weeds diseases and other 
exotic pests 
some fruits sniffed out by doc watson are small a few 
miniature oranges mailed with other goods the agency said 
some finds are huge like a 30pound jackfruit taat outweighed 
doc by about 10 pounds

a man who claims to be a former israeli 
intelligence agent was acquitted wednesday of chput aside consumer 
worries about being stuck if the carrier folded shugrue said the 
new money will ensure the carriers operations through the end of 
march when he says eastern will be ready to make a profit 
the reaction has been incredible said eastern spokesman jim 
ashlock for the first time that a great many of us veteran 
people have seen in a long time people are rooting for us 
shugrue plans a meeting with employees here thursday night 
its a christmas present for everybody who works at eastern 
ashlock said of us bankruptcy judge burton r liflands decision 
less than two weeks ago shugrue had asked the court to release 
30 million saying he would need an additional 50 million in two 
payments through early january the carriers unsecured creditors 
urged the judge to liquidate the airline instead 
the judge agreed to give eastern 15 million and another 15 
million in early december provided eastern was keeping on track 
with its business projections 
but eastern said in asking for even more money tuesday that it 
had suffered up to 70 million in damage from publicity surrounding 
the creditors move to have it closed 
shugrue argued that forcing eastern to return periodically to 
withdraw from its escrow account made the airline look as if it 
could fail at any moment lifland agreed and even scolded the 
creditors for hurting easterns business 
unsecured creditors nevertheless renewed their argument that the 
carrier cannot become viable and the fund should not be depleted 
further 
the unsecured creditors who include aircraft companies banks 
labor unions and others owed an estimated 1 billion by eastern 
had not yet determined their next move by late wednesday afternoon 
there are a lot of broad options im not in a position to 
discuss them lawyer adam harris said 
eastern would have only an estimated 37 million available in 
its escrow account after the current draw but shugrue said it 
wont be needed his corporate rate strategy in which eastern 
has nearly doubled its firstclass cabin space and offered business 
travelers discount fares is helping eastern build up its passenger 
base he said 
easterns unions had said they saw the breakup and sale of 
eastern in parts as their only hope for winning back their jobs 
but on wednesday machinists union leader charles e bryan urged 
shugrue to try again to settle the strike that began march 4 1989 
a nearly paralyzed eastern filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy five 
days later and has been losing 1 million to 2 million a day 
since 
shugrue appointed trustee by the court last april said then 
that achieving labor peace was a priority 
ashlock said in discussions shugrue has had with the unions the 
roadblock has been union insistence that replacement workers be 
displaced which shugrue refuses to do 
the machinists plan a large demonstration saturday at the miami 
international airport

a drop in the value of some major commodities 
at the farm level will be a key factor in holding down consumer 
food prices next year an agriculture department economist said 
wednesday 
larger supplies of farmproduced foods will have a strong 
influence on food prices in 1991 ralph l parlett jr told the 
departments annual outlook conference 
the farm value of food that portion of the consumer dollar 
which goes to farmers is expected to average nearly 6 percent 
below 1990 he said 
parletts comments followed the usdas forecast on tuesday that 
consumer food prices in 1991 will climb only 2 percent to 5 
percent compared with a 6 percent gain this year and 58 percent 
in 1989 
retail food prices in the past two years have shown the sharpest 
backtoback increases since they jumped 86 percent in 1980 and 
78 percent in 1981 
after that burst food prices rose mostly at an annual rate of 2 
percent to 4 percent until the last two years 
parlett said farm prices costs of processing and distribution 
and consumer demand are the three major factors affecting food 
prices 
farm prices were pushed up in 1990 because of tight supplies 
of some farm commodities he said costs beyond the farm gate 
for processing and distributing food increased about 7 percent 
reflecting increased use of inputs and higher input prices 
also consumer demand for food remained relatively strong in the 
first half of 1990 although parlett said decreasing real 
disposable income in the second half has probably dampened that 
demand 
looking at the new forecast for 1991 parlett said it involves a 
number of uncertainties concerning the general economy and the 
crisis in the persian gulf but larger supplies of some 
commodities including dairy products and poultry will help the 
overall price average from soaring 
in any case a slowdown of the economy will have a dampening 
effect on retail prices he said declines in personal income 
weaken consumer demand and reduce inflationary pressure on 
prices 
parlett said higher oil prices will have a limited effect on 
the costs of processing and distributing foods next year

a report on the risk of developing cancer after 
exposure to lowlevel radiation may have overstated the danger and 
scared patients away from needed xrays researchers said 
wednesday 
the problems we should be looking for when we take an xray 
are substantially more important from a medical and patient 
standpoint that a slight theoretical risk of cancer 20 years from 
now dr fred a mettler told the radiological society of north 
america conference 
mettler is professor and chairman of nuclear medicineand 
general radiology at the university of new mexico in albuquerque 
mettler and other conference participants linked the publics 
fear of xrays to a 1989 news release on the findings of a national 
research council study 
the releases first sentence said the possibility of developing 
cancer from lowlevel xrays and gamma rays might be three to four 
times higher than previously estimated 
arthur c upton chairman of the committee responsible for the 
report said the news release was misleading and might have 
needlessly alarmed the public 
i think knowing the reaction that has occurred i would have 
urged that that opening sentence be modified said upton 
chairman of the department of environmental medicine at new york 
university medical center it does suggest a magnitude of change 
that did not necessarily occur 
the threetofourtimes higher statement was based upon 
comparison of the 1989 study and a 1980 national research council 
study but upton noted that the studies were not conclusive and 
said other studies have reported different estimates of the dangers 
radiation poses 
i could not find that statement anywhere in the study my 
problem is that the information is out there and my patients are 
reacting to it said joel gray professor of radiological physics 
at the mayo clinic and foundation 
gray said relatively few patients have refused xrays because of 
the report but several of his patients delay xrays each week 
because of it 
the 1989 study used new data developed from studies of survivors 
of world war ii bombings of japan from irradiated populations 
such as workers in atomic industries and from animal studies

bernard ingham the press secretary who used his 
tongue as a sword against margaret thatchers enemies was the 
first casualty of the prime ministers fall 
almost never quoted by name the gruff civil servant was the 
downing street source who derided cabinet ministers that lost 
favor fought a guerrilla war with liberal journalists enraged 
elected politicians and enjoyed mrs thatchers absolute 
protection 
when she lost her job so did he 
ingham 58 and a few other officials who surrounded mrs 
thatcher were accused by her enemies by keeping her increasingly 
isolated and unwittingly helping to bring her down 
whenever political skulduggery was afoot the victims invrriably 
detected inghams hand though friends claimed he was often 
innocent 
for britains political reporters the redhaired yorkshireman 
with beetling eye brows and a glowering mien was a prime source of 
information 
my job was to represent her views he said this week i 
hope i have done that with reasonable accuracy 
that was an understatement 
in 11 years with mrs thatcher ingham became perhaps the most 
influential press secretary ever to operate at 10 downing street 
he was by her side to the end a protective arm raised as she 
met journalists in paris the night her conservative party denied 
her reelection 
two days later choosing resignation rather than defeat mrs 
thatcher spat defiance at old foes in a bravura encore in the house 
of commons while ingham sat forlornly in the gallery head in 
hands 
soon after being elected tuesday night as the next prime 
minister john major appointed gus odonnell 36 as his press 
spokesman 
ingham in effect was fired but he hadnt expected anything 
else 
for every journalist who valued ingham as a source another 
seemingly reviled him as a manipulator 
robert harris political columnist of the liberal london weekly 
the observer said ingham was key to the way in which mrs 
thatcher was able to centralize power in downing street 
undercutting the authority of ministers 
he helped establish her and in the end it was that that 
brought her down her style of government 
inghams words were often mrs thatchers words his thoughts 
her thoughts served up to british journalists at twicedaily 
briefings 
ingham briefed foreign correspondents in two separate weekly 
sessions 
he signaled the imminent departure of foreign secretary francis 
pym in 1983 by labeling him mona lott suggesting he moans 
alot john biffen was dropped from the cabinet after ingham labeled 
him semidetached 
in 1986 ingham and mrs thatcher nearly sank together after the 
leak of a government document damaging to michael heseltine soon 
to resign as defense secretary in a bitter row with the leader 
mrs thatcher denied she was responsible and refused demands in 
the house of commons for ingham to be questioned 
through it all her loyalty to ingham never faltered bernard 
is wonderful she often commented at news media events 
at international summits ingham became something of a star 
attraction at the openhouse notforattribution british 
briefings even if the commentary defied translation 
bunkum and balderdash were favorite words for dismissing 
grand plans for greater european union 
when the end came the downing street source took it 
manfully 
its a rough old world and i dont think shed want it any 
other way ingham said 
and of himself he laughed whod want an old hasbeen like

at least 14 american hostages his spokesman said wednesday 
ali met with president saddam hussein of iraq on tuesday for 50 
minutes the 48yearold boxing great went to baghdad at the 
invitation of the iraqi government 
alis spokesman jaber mohammed said the former champion and 
his entourage expect to leave baghdad on saturday but hope to 
receive a list of the hostages thursday that will provide them with 
the exact number to be freed 
baghdads government has prevented hundreds of foreigners from 
leaving since its aug 2 invasion of kuwait but in recent weeks 
it has allowed some to leave with visiting politicians prominent 
figures and peace groups 
there are almost 1000 americans remaining in iraq and kuwait 
more than 100 held as human shields at strategic military and 
industrial sites in iraq 
three former us hostages left iraq on tuesday after their 
relatives had traveled to baghdad to plead their case 
alis spokesman said iraqi officials promised that a minimum of 
14 american hostages would be permitted to go and allowed ali and 
his staff to pick the departure date 
we picked saturday because juma friday is the holy day and 
we did not want to interrupt our prayers the spokesman said ali 
converted to islam in 1964 and changed his name from cassius clay 
ali suffers from parkinsons disease marked by slurred speech 
and shaking limbs he generally uses hand signals to communicate 
his statements to his spokesman who speaks to the press 
the spokesman interviewed wednesday by telephone from nicosia 
said the group planned to go to the united states via amman the 
jordanian capital 
we feel very pleased with the trip we feel we got to 
understand the situation of the people here their aspirations and 
thank god we can take at least 14 back with us jaber said 
jaber said ali expects the united nations to pass a resolution 
authorizing the multinational force in the region to use force 
against iraq after jan 15 the vote in the security council is due 
later this week 
but our prayers are that even if the resolution passes they 
will not use force he said

cigarette distributors say they will recall 
their vending machines instead of modifying them to accept tokens 
in compliance with a new law designed to curb the sale of 
cigarettes to minors 
the law scheduled to go into effect in january requires that 
all machines in areas frequented by minors be modified to accept 
tokens rather than coins 
les frank president of royal cigarette service inc of 
homestead said his 250 machines affected by the law would either 
be returned or recalled 
he said it would cost 400 to modify each machine and the law 
would mean more bookkeeping work counterfeit coins and fraud 
making them unprofitable 
it isnt cost effective its not pragmatic and it isnt 
workable he said 
vending distributors said many of their customers already have 
returned the machines and adopted overthecounter cigarette sales 
instead 
city councilwoman michelle madoff initially introduced 
legislation that would have banned cigarette machines from all 
places frequented by minors the council later adopted the 
compromise token bill 
i say hallelujah theyre taking the machines out mrs 
madoff said for every child who may not get hooked on 
cigarettes im thrilled

bill walters failure to repay the loans helped bring on the 
1988 collapse of denverbased silverado regulators say the 
institutions failure is expected to cost taxpayers up to 1 
billion 
the lawsuit filed tuesday in us bankruptcy court in santa ana 
by a courtappointed trustee contends that much of the property 
transfer occurred just days after walters married in 1986 
walters told a congressional committee earlier this year that he 
was broke 
walters business ties to neil bush a silverado director and 
son of president bush led to conflict of interest allegations 
against the younger bush 
its the belief of the trustee that there have been 
significant assets of this debtor that have been secreted away 
said ronald rus an attorney for a firm hired by trustee r neil 
rodgers to help liquidate walters assets 
the complaint asks us bankruptcy judge john wilson to order 
the seizure and sale of the property 
the lawsuit contends walters transferred more than 2 million to 
a trust set up to purchase a newport beach home for his wife 
jacqueline the couple live in the home today 
the complaint also says jacqueline walters sold for 47 million 
three parcels of land in colorado that her husband deeded to her 
immediately after their marriage 
there is no telephone listing for walters in newport beach 
the court appointed rodgers to oversee the liquidation of 
walters assets after walters filed for bankruptcy earlier this 
month 
court documents filed by walters indicate the former contractor 
owes more than 250 million to dozens of creditors 
mrs walters also received from her husband two riverside county 
condominiums and several luxury automobiles including a 1982 
ferrari a 1986 bentley a rollsroyce and two mercedesbenzes the 
lawsuit contends 
the lawsuit accuses walters and his wife of trying to hinder 
delay and defraud his creditors

better macdonald said itll have to be finished one way or 
another 
the troops training in the desert are about 7000 miles away 
from the un debate on setting a jan 15 deadline for iraqi 
president saddam hussein to back down and have his 450000 forces 
leave kuwait talk of a firm date boosted the spirits of the us 
marines who arrived here three months ago 
its a target to get everybody psychologically prepared for 
battle somebodys finally saying theyre going to do something 
said lt col michael brooks 45 company commander of the marines

here are excerpts from testimony wednesday 
before the senate armed services committee about the persian gulf 
crisis testifying were two former chairmen of the joint chiefs of 
staff david c jones and william crowe and former secretary of 
state henry kissinger 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
jones i want to begin by stating my unqualified endorsement for 
the presidents swift and adroit response to the invasion of kuwait 
in august i am absolutely convinced that his decisive action 
prevented a wider aggression which would have been enormously more 
difficult to reverse much less contain 
we must do whatever is necessary to expel iraqi forces from 
kuwait but we should do everything in our power to ensure common 
ends and means especially among the leading arab as well as 
nonarab nations 
my reading of the public mood is that they back the president 
but they want to know what they are in for this means that the 
administration must be prepared to set out a convincing case for 
the range of actions to which we could be committed 
in return i think the nation and specifically the congress 
should devise some vehicle to express to the world at large 
that the united states is patient but its patience is not 
inexhaustible that we are determined that aggression against 
neighbors shall not be condoned 
this could not be considered a blank check and certainly not 
a declaration of war but it would strengthen the presidents hands 
considerably in the critical weeks and months ahead 
i must confess to a nagging concern about the means and ends by 
calling for an offensive military option and increasing the 
projected desert shield force levels the president has clearly 
decided to send a strong message to saddam hussein about the 
seriousness of the us resolve this highrisk tactic might 
succeed in forcing an acceptable political resolution to the 
crisis or if combat is unavoidable will give us the forces needed 
to prevail alongside our coalition partners if so i will applaud 
the presidents nerve and foresight 
my main concern with this latest scheduled reinforcement isnt 
that we might choose to fight but rather that the deployment might 
cause us to fight perhaps prematurely and perhaps unnecessarily i 
would stress that this is a risk not a certainty but one that 
ought to be taken seriously 
the risk is that the problems inherent in maintaining the 
offensive military option could create irresistible pressures to 
initiate combat irrespective of the progress of the un sanctions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
crowe president bush acted quickly and in my opinion 
correctly to constrain hussein militarily to defend saudi arabia 
and to clamp a tight economic quarantine on iraq 
granted the embargo is not working as rapidly as many would 
prefer but if we wanted economic results in two or three months 
then a quarantine was the wrong way to go about it the issue 
is not whether an embargo will work but whether we have the 
patience to let it take effect 
the presidents initial moves have already achieved a great 
deal the argument that saddam is winning and being rewarded i 
believe is both weird and wrong i believe the burning question 
now confronting the president as well as our public is what 
next in its most extreme form we are talking about 
deliberately initiating offensive military operations in other 
words war 
i would submit that posturing ourselves to promote stability for 
the longterm is our primary national interest in the middle east 
 
it is not obvious to me that we are currently looking at the 
crisis in this light our dislike for hussein sems to have crowded 
out many other considerations 
i firmly believe that saddam hussein must be pushed out of 
kuwait he must leave kuwait at the same time given the larger 
context i judge it highly desirable to achieve this goal in a 
peaceful fashion if that is possible in other words i would 
argue that we should give sanctions a fair chance before we discard 
them 
i believe the bulk of the american people are willing to put up 
with a great deal to avoid war and to avoid casualties a long ways 
from home in fact in my judgment we are selling our country 
short by jumping to the conclusion that we cant stare down our 
opponent 
it would be a sad commentary if saddam hussein a twobit tyrant 
who sits on 17 million people and possesses a gross national 
product of 40 billion proved to be more patient than the united 
states the worlds most affluent and powerful nation 
i counsel patience war is not neat its not tidy and once 
you resort to it its uncertain and its a mess and you should 
be sure the stakes justify what youre doing before you just 
voluntarily jump into a mess

kissinger i have the most serious doubt whether it will be 
possible to maintain the present military deployment in saudi 
arabia for an extended period of time and i would be interested to 
see an intelligence estimate to which i have no access of whether 
we believe that the present level of deployment can be maintained 
during the pilgrimage and much beyond ramadan 
i believe that as this large american deployment in the area is 
maintained the pressures against it will multiply 
the presence of a large force puts a pressure on saddam hussein 
but it also makes it more difficult to sustain it for an indefinite 
period of time and this is why we will come to a point of 
decision in my view sometime in the next few months where we will 
have to choose between the military option and the sanctions 
option 
i would prefer for the sanctions to work i do not believe that 
it is likely that the two can be kept in harness 
from the beginning it has been my position that if military 
action becomes unavoidable the preferable strategy would be to 
rely on our air and naval power and to use our ground forces to 
prevent a response rather than to launch a largescale attack 
i am also profoundly concerned about the impact on the countries 
with which we are associated in the area of something that begins 
to look like a substantial american withdrawal which might then 
start a rush towards accommodation and undermine all moderate 
governments in the area 
i am very nervous about having a very large american ground 
establishment in a region in which iraqi forces are in front of it 
iranian forces are at the flank of it and political instabilities 
all around them because we could easily become the subject of 
totally unpredictable events and be drawn into things that were not 
part of our original mission

a prosecutor asked jurors wednesday 
for a firstdegree murder conviction in a case featuring testimony 
of a woman who claims she long repressed the memory of seeing her 
father kill her childhood friend 
eileen franklinlipsker testified during the trial that she had 
a flashback late last year of watching her father george franklin 
sr molest her best friend 8yearold susan nason then smash her 
skull with a rock 20 years before 
were here because george franklin sr chose to murder a 
little girl rather than be identified as a child molester 
prosecutor elaine tipton said during closing arguments 
she died because she trusted the defendant ms tipton said 
that was the price she paid for trusting her best friends 
father 
franklin has pleaded innocent to the charges if convicted he 
faces life in prison 
the defense was to present its closing argument later wednesday 
tuesday superior judge thomas mcginn smith told jurors they 
could consider only a possible verdict of firstdegree murder 
also tuesday the prosecution played a tape of a nov 21 1989 
telephone conversation between ms franklinlipsker and a district 
attorneys office investigator 
in the call ms franklinlipsker describes the crime but does 
not identify the killer or herself she tells the investigator she 
had buried the memory of the killing for two decades 
nason vanished from her foster city neighborhood sept 22 1969 
her body was found 10 weeks later in a ravine east of half moon 
bay 
franklinlipsker 29 maintains the longrepressed memory came 
back to her as she gazed at her own young daughter she testified 
during the trial that she now remembers her father threatening to 
kill her if she told anyone what she had seen 
the defense has hinted that franklinlipsker and another sister 
may have concocted the repressedmemory account as revenge for 
years of sexual and physical abuse that their father allegedly 
inflicted upon his family

prime minister andrei lukanovs 
government of former communists appeared on the verge of collapse 
wednesday following angry street protests and a threat by 
bulgarias largest union to join a nationwide strike 
the official bta news agency said an agreement was struck under 
which lukanov would resign but lukanov called the report 
premature 
asked by reporters if he would quit lukanov replied not 
now he said he did not know exactly when he would resign 
bta had said president zhelyu zhelev would appoint a caretaker 
cabinet headed by a premier who will be neither of the socialist 
party the renamed communist party nor of the union of 
democratic forces main opposition 
pressure on the 52yearold socialist premier increased hourly 
he has been increasingly blamed for the political paralysis and 
economic chaos in this balkan country of 9 million people 
krastyo petkov chairman of the main confederation of 
independent trade unions said his organization would join a 
3dayold strike by the smaller more radical podkrepa union on 
thursday unless the political stalemate was settled his union had 
opposed the strike 
ognyan kromov the confederations vice president said it would 
start shutting down heavy industry thursday 
kromov said the union insists on forming a working cabinet 
that would be a competent and stable partner in negotiations 
podkrepa said 870000 workers were on strike thursday in 91 
cities throughout bulgaria including 230000 in sofia the 
government put the total at 40000 
bulgaria is suffering through its worst crisis since world war 
ii electricity is rationed foodstuffs and many other basics are 
rationed or unavailable the country cannot make payments on its 
11 billion foreign debt 
the political stalemate has blocked officials from acting to 
improve the economic situation 
reflecting the turmoil parliament could not meet wednesday 
because it lacked a quorum the opposition walked out last friday 
and is boycotting sessions 
talks aimed at political compromise held among all political 
parties and trade unions at zhelevs suggestion were suspended 
without result 
the talks are expected to produce an agreeement on a future 
coalition government and on setting a timetable for drafting key 
economic legislation and a new constitution 
on wednesday evening hundreds of protesters blocked eagles 
bridge sofias main intersection and the scene of a morning 
confrontation between riot police and demonstrators 
traffic in downtown sofia came to a nearstandstill police who 
used clubs to disperse protesters earlier did not intervene 
podkrepa said the government had begun using military vehicles 
to ensure transport so the union was extending the strike to sofia 
airport the petrochemical complex in burgas and to dock workers 
in that black sea port 
the national airline balkan suspended flights bta said later 
only international flights would operate 
lukanov said composition of a new government had not yet been 
discussed i hope this will happen soon because the current 
situation must not continue he added 
bta quoted opposition leader petar beron as telling a rally 
lukanovs final condition for quitting was to be allowed to do it 
with dignity 
lukanov has said he will not let the opposition hound him out of 
office 
the communists ruled bulgaria for more than four decades they 
renamed themselves socialists last spring and won june elections 
lukanov is among reformminded party members who helped oust 
longtime communist leader todor zhivkov in november 1989 appointed 
premier on feb 3 he has governed bulgaria during a period of 
increasingly polarized politics deteriorating living standards and 
growing public anger 
he used his majority to pass an austerity budget last week 
the opposition wants smaller price increases it refuses to 
cooperate with lukanov and demands he resign it wants to name the 
premier and key ministers in a new government

a 76yearold state appeals judge won the right 
to stay on the bench wednesday when a judge ruled an illinois law 
requiring his retirement was unconstitutional 
the law bars state appeals judges from seeking another 10year 
term after they turn 75 
i think any mandatory retirement age is unfair appellate 
judge william white said after the ruling judges ought to be 
individually evaluated 
a majority of voters cast ballots nov 6 in favor of white who 
ran to retain his seat two other judges also ran for the seat 
john tully a circuit court judge who came in second challenged 
whites election victory in court saying white was too old to 
retain the job 
tully said he would appeal the ruling 
im not surprised by anything in our court system tully 
said but i think justice will be served in the end 
circuit judge joseph schneider ruled white was denied equal 
protection under the law he also said the mandatory retirement law 
was flawed 
under the law a judge can run for reelection at age 74 and 
remain on the bench until he was 84 schneider said but a 
75yearold judge could not run for reelection 
the us supreme court this week agreed to consider a similar 
case in missouri in which two judges challenged a state law forcing 
mandatory retirement at 70 
the missouri judges maintain state law violates federal law and 
unconstitutionally treats them differently than other state 
employees

will contribute to an estimated 129 percent increase in premiums 
next year for patients of health maintenance organizations an 
industry group said wednesday

projection on a survey of 44 hmos enrolling more than 11 million 
people

additional factors in the premium increases hmos reported in the 
survey 
increases in premiums for hmos have been somewhat below the 
increases for other types of health insurance said marsha gold 
director of research and analysis for the group health association 
of america 
but hmo premiums are rising more rapidly than health care costs 
generally said ron pollack executive director of families usa a

a high school closed and slated for 
replacement as part of a city desegregation effort was demolished 
wednesday despite a lastminute legal effort to save the 
64yearold building 
a plume of dust rose into the sky when explosives went off the 
dust settled within minutes revealing a large pile of debris where 
paseo high school once stood 
three corners of the school left standing were to be knocked 
down with a wrecking ball 
former students and neighborhood residents had fought to have 
the limestone building renovated instead of razed but school 
district officials said replacing the building would cost 3 
million less than renovating it 
a high school and middle school focused on the arts are 
scheduled to open at the site in september 1992 
i hate this said former student mary webb who was among a 
crowd of people who gathered to watch the demolition it was a 
beautiful building they shouldnt have done this 
the group opposing the demolition fought this year to save the 
school but lost their case in us district court they filed 
another motion tuesday contending the district had lied about 
construction costs but judge russell g clark did not consider it 
before the building fell 
i didnt expect him to said mack harnden a leader of the 
opposition group i felt that once judge clark had made a 
decision he wouldnt change his mind i had kind of begun my 
grieving process 
during the summer clark found the school district and the state 
of missouri guilty of causing illegal racial segregation of 
students spurring the desegregation plan

former navy secretary john f lehman and 
two other navy officials were cleared of liability in a lawsuit 
filed by an arms company employee who said he was fired for 
criticizing military spnding 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals on tuesday rejected 
lawrence j korbs claim that pentagon officials violated his free 
speech rights by telling his superiors at raytheon corp that they 
were displeased with his criticism of the military 
korb who was an assistant secretary of defense during president 
reagans administration filed the lawsuit after he was forced out 
of his job as a vice president for raytheon 
the dismissal came after korb held a news conference in 1986 in 
which he suggested that defense spending be cut by 200 billion 
over five years in part by scaling back plans for a 600ship navy 
he was speaking as a member of the committee for national security 
a group of private citizens concerned with defense issues 
although lehman and two assistant navy secretaries melvyn r 
paisley and everett pyatt told raytheon officials they were 
displeased with korbs remarks they did not suggest that korb be 
fired court records show 
raytheon said korb was dismissed because of a variety of 
complaints about his job performance 
the appeals panel agreed with us district judge claude m 
hilton that navy officials were entitled to qualified immunity 
because their actions did not violate korbs constitutional rights

a cia study predicts yugoslavia will break 
apart soon and probably decline into civil war official sources 
said wednesday 
one source speaking on condition he not be identified said 
members of the intelligence community have been making dire 
predictions like that for some time but that they are not shared 
by other foreignpolicy specialists in the government 
an official who has read the most recent central intelligence 
agency assessment circulated several weeks ago in what is called a 
national intelligence estimate said it predicts the various ethnic 
groups that make up yugoslavia will begin fighting each other in a 
scenario likely to lead to civil war 
but that same official and another who is familiar with 
administration views on the issue said the us embassy in 
belgrade state department specialists in washington and bush 
administration policymakers dont agree the situation is as serious 
as the cia report indicates 
these officials and others discussed the content of the cia 
report on condition that they not be identified 
existence of the report was disclosed wednesday by the new york 
times which quoted unidentified sources who had read it 
yugoslavia was created as an independent monarchy after world 
war i with the addition of various territories to the old kingdom 
of serbia it became a communistruled federation after world war 
ii consisting of six republics with a long history of ethnic and 
economic rivalry 
the country has more divisions among its people than most two 
alphabets are in use the roman and the cyrillic the roman 
catholic the eastern orthodox and the moslem faiths all have large 
followings 
the state was held together for 35 years under the strong hand 
guerrila leader josip broz better known under the name tito whose 
partisans emerged victorious at the end of world war ii 
after titos death in 1980 a revolving presidency guaranteeing 
each republic a term of leadership was established in an attempt to 
preserve the tenuous union 
but attempts by serbia the largest republic to control the 
substantial albanian minority in kosovo province has led to 
repeated outbreaks of violence and serbia more recently has become 
embroiled in an economic rivalry with the more prosperous northern 
republic of slovenia spurring nationalist forces in both 
republics 
runaway inflation high unemployment and collapsing productivity 
have exacerbated the various regional and ethnic conflicts 
prime minister ante markovic is attempting to install economic 
reforms designed to halt the downward spiral stabilize the 
currency and pursue democratic elections which in some cases have 
led to election of divisive nationalists 
markovic wants to be a unity figure and has established a 
noncommunist democratic and prounity government that has had 
mixed results one us official said the economic reforms 
under imf international monetary fund supervision had some 
success initially but have become wrapped up in the ethnic 
problem 
a state department official however said he believes the cia 
report was alarmist and came at a time when there was some new 
cause for optimism 
theyve got very serious problems and you cant rule out 
things coming apart the official said but im more optimistic 
than these people are 
he said recent republic elections have tended to sap the 
political strength of serbian president slobodan milosevic who is 
regarded by us observers as a key divisive force who has 
encouraged ethnic hatreds and opposed market reforms

suspects is entirely new 
this is just one of the many things this newspaper is doing to 
raise public awareness that there is a drug problem he said 
titled drug watch the daily column begun nov 15 requires 
one staff photographer and up to 30 inches of newsprint last 
weekends edition carried photos of nine men ranging in age from 
17 to 39 arrested for possession of various drugs possession with 
intent to distribute and conspiracy to violate drug laws 
mayor john bullard praised the papers efforts he said new 
bedfords drug problem and its ancillary crimes are 
overwhelming more than 2000 drug arrests were made in new bedford 
in the first 10 months of 1990 
bullard acknowledged that publishing photos may not prevent 
hardcore drug use 
but for those people who buy drugs and think they can stay 
undercover this should be a deterrent he said tuesday 
reaction to drug watch has been varied with many local 
officials and residents applauding the attempt and some journalists 
and lawyers questioning the ethics involved 
sarah wunsch a lawyer for the massachusetts civil liberties 
union called the policy sensationalistic she and others said the 
publication of pictures threatens a defendants right to a fair 
trial 
ragsdale said his newspaper will make every effort to print the 
outcome of each court hearing even if that happens months or years 
after initial publication

president bush signed a bill wednesday 
prohibiting tuna fishing within 200 miles of the us coast by 
foreign ships unless they have federal permits 
the measure also would set labeling standards for tuna products 
billed as dolphin safe 
to bear such a label the tuna could not be harvested through 
driftnet fishing or purse seine nets which also trap dolphins as 
well as other marine mammals seabirds and fish other than tuna 
the restriction on tuna fishing by foreign vessels will take 
effect jan 1 1992 it will give the united states the same 
authority to manage tuna fishing that that many other nations 
already have off their coasts

president bush signed legislation wednesday 
easing a federal mandate to harvest 45 billion board feet of 
timber per decade from the tongass national forest in alaska 
environmentalists have charged a 1980 law that establishes the 
us forest services general timber sale policy was forcing 
reckless cutting in the 168 millionacre forest 
the legislation establishes new criteria for managing the vast 
forest that streches across the alaska panhandle and shelters a 
rich array of wildife from grizzly bears to bald eagles 
the new management plan calls for the us forest service to 
prepare only enough timber for sale to meet market demand instead 
of an automatic 450 million board feet annually 
legislation enacted by congress this year also establishes an 
additional 1 million acres of the tongass forest offlimits to 
timber harvesting and creates buffers along rivers and streams from 
which trees many not be taken 
environmentalists have said the actions to curtail timber 
cutting in the forest were a step in the right direction but that 
they do not go far enough 
half a rain forest is better than no rain forest at all 
george frampton president of the wilderness society said last 
month when the legislation cleared congress

security council ambassadors on wednesday 
predicted adoption of a resolution allowing use of military force 
to liberate kuwait if 450000 iraqi troops do not withdraw by jan 
15 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze told reporters on 
arriving in new york either we will build civilized relations 
between states a new world order and new policy or will live by 
the law of the jungle 
that is the question we must answer tomorrow thursday and i 
believe we will answer it 
cuba opposes the measure but expects it to pass it is quite 
obvious that the resolution will be adopted cuban ambassador 
ricardo alarcon said 
the only other time the united nations sanctioned military force 
to counter aggression was in 1950 during the korean conflict 
thirteen of the 15 council members are expected to be 
represented by foreign ministers making it one of the 
highestlevel such sessions in un history 
china had indicated it would support the measure but shifted its 
position wednesday foreign minister qian qichen said he would not 
vote in favor 
the statement was widely viewed as a move to win political 
concessions from washington which acted to punish beijing after 
the june 1989 military crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
diplomats suggested china might abstain but probably would not 
veto the measure 
the five permanent security council members the united states 
the soviet union china france and britain have veto power 
it seems rather clear that theyre not thinking of vetoing 
said british ambassador david hannay 
on wednesday the council ended debate on allegations of iraqi 
atrocities in kuwait and adopted a resolution 150 asking the 
united nations to take custody of kuwaits census records smuggled 
out by the kuwaiti resistance 
iraq has been destroying records in a bid to erase kuwaitis 
national identity it moved more than 100000 iraqis into occupied 
kuwait to change its demographic character 
us ambassador thomas r pickering told wednesdays session 
the record of rape plunder torture and murder compiled by 
iraqi authorities since their invasion of kuwait has posed a direct 
challenge to the purposes for which this organization was founded 
 
iraqs policy must fail as members of the united nations we 
are all bound by our charter obligations to oppose iraqs policy 
accomplish the withdrawal of iraqi forces from kuwait and to 
obtain the reestablishment of kuwaiti authority may that day come 
shortly 
the draft resolution gives iraq a final chance to withdraw from 
kuwait by jan 15 after that the measure authorizes all 
necessary means to dislodge the iraqi forces 
the measure also calls on iraq to free all foreign hostages and 
restore the rule of the kuwaiti royal family 
baghdad has ignored a series of un resolutions demanding it 
withdraw from kuwait which iraq overran aug 2 
there is political will to adopt another resolution said 
canadian ambassador yves fortier i predict that an additional 
resolution will be adopted 
the british envoy said the measure provides a breathing space 
of time for thought by saddam hussein to reflect really carefully 
on what would follow if he didnt come into line with the security 
council resolutions by the date fixed in the resolution 
it does very clearly mean that after that date it will be 
possible though it is not certain and it is not in itself 
automatic it will be possible for members of the united nations 
to use force to bring iraq into conformity with these 
resolutions hannay said 
soviet sources said extensive armtwisting would be applied 
to baghdad in the next six weeks and that it was likely there be 
a deal cut under the table for an iraqi withdrawal 
chinese ambassador li daoyu presided over the meetings of the 
five permanent members of the council that resulted in the draft 
resolution approved by them monday soviet ambassador yuliy 
vorontsov had said then there was broad agreement on the 
measure 
china opposes the iraqi invasion but is reluctant to sanction 
force 
qian is meeting with secretary of state james a baker iii 
before thursday afternoons vote and diplomats suggested he would 
be seeking concessions 
those might include an end to us opposition to world bank 
loans to china that do not address humanitarian needs a resumption 
of defense cooperation and military sales and agreement not to 
link chinas human rights record to its mostfavorednation trade 
status 
baker will preside over thursdays security council meeting 
permanent members america britain france and soviet union are 
expected to vote for the resolution as are at least seven 
nonpermanent members canada finland romania ivory coast 
malaysia zaire and ethiopia 
colombia has been reluctant to endorse use of force however 
like china it voted for the 10 previous resolutions and is 
expected to back this one in the end 
cuba says it will not vote in favor and yemen the councils 
only arab member is believed likely to abstain or vote against it 
a resolution requires at least nine votes to pass so long as no 
permanent member vetoes it 
the proposed resolution gives the united states and other allied 
powers permission to act without any direct un control member 
states will only have to keep the council regularly informed on 
the progress of actions they undertake

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze will meet with president bush next month to make 
preparations for a moscow summit that could be held as early as 
january the soviet official said wednesday 
the timing of the moscow summit depends on progress on a treaty 
to cut the superpowers longrange nuclear weapons shevardnadze 
said 
before he sees bush the foreign minister will meet dec 1011 
in houston with secretary of state james a baker iii 
there shevardnadze said they also will take up the issue of 
the prolonged crisis in the persian gulf in a very serious and 
substantive way 
there is still hope there will be a peaceful resolution of 
this conflict shevardnadze told reporters after a meeting with 
baker at the soviet mission to the united nations 
houston is bakers hometown shevardnandze referring to a 
productive meeting they held this year in wyoming said with a 
smile that he and baker seem to work best outside their capitals 
a natural enviornment helps shevardnadze said 
bush had hoped to go to moscow to see soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev and sign a new ussoviet strategic arms limitation 
treaty in december but several unsettled issues including the 
kinds of tests the soviets will be permitted with longrange ss18 
missiles have slowed completion of the accord 
asked if the summit could now be held in january shevardnadze 
said i dont know if january or perhaps a little later to a 
large extent this will depend on what we will be able to do with 
the start strategic arms reduction treaty 
he said the two sides were quite realistic about being able to 
complete it and said there is a lot of work we will have to 
do 
the treaty would cut us and soviet arsenals of longrange 
nuclear missiles bombers and submarines by about 30 percent

sixtyeight italians 10 britons and three 
americans who had been held hostage by iraq made their way home 
wednesday via amman iraqi officials said they would soon be 
freeing other foreigners as well 
at least three of the former italian hostages said they had been 
held at strategic military and industrial sites in iraq the first 
reports that italians were used as human shields 
earlier only americans britons and japanese were reported held 
at such sites with all germans and french released iraq has been 
using human shields in the hopes it will deter attacks by the 
multinational forces assembled in the persian gulf 
the 68 italians arrived in rome late wednesday aboard a special 
md80 alitalia jet from this capital they were freed through the 
intervention of a syrianborn catholic archbishop in addition the 
italian government had sent a plane full of medicine to iraq 
we palestinians have an incalculable debt toward the italian 
people and government for the human and political solidarity they 
have shown us said the archbishop hilarion capucci as he 
stepped off the plane in rome 
hostages heading toward a crowd of waiting relatives burst into 
applause at his words 
capucci a syrianborn melchite catholic who lives in italy is 
a member of the palestine national council a sort of 
parliamentinexile he had been jailed for nearly three years in 
israel on charges of smuggling arms to palestinians but was 
released in 1977 after an appeal by pope paul vi 
melchite catholics are arab christians who have formed an 
easternright branch of the roman catholic church they recognize 
the primacy of the pope but exercise much independence 
iraqi leader saddam hussein had agreed to free 70 italians after 
the appeal by capucci and a group of italian peace activists 
one italian who had suffered a brain hemorrhage was flown home 
on monday while another man identified as luigi canino chose to 
remain in baghdad according to the italian news agency ansa 
the hostages who arrived in rome spoke briefly with reporters 
about their months of detention 
we feared the outbreak of war and made plans recalled a man 
who identified himself as giancarlo formica there was that fear 
for your own skin 
he urged italian politicians to make trips to baghdad to seek 
the liberty of hostages even if only a few are allowed to leave at 
a time 
we believe that with bringing home 50 or 60 people 50 or 60 
families return to life he said 
we were treated well deluxe hostages said another man 
but he said that those remaining behind are bitter they think 
not enough is being done here by the government he said 
iraq is still holding about 200 italians among an estimated 
2000 westerners 
on the stop in amman capucci told reporters he would attend a 
conference called happy be the peacemakers scheduled to open in 
baghdad on monday he said clergymen from all over the world will 
be there 
he said on this next trip he will try to bring out some sick 
hostages and perhaps others both italians and nonitalians 
the three freed americans and their families flew to frankfurt 
germany aboard a royal jordanian flight another royal jordanian 
flight for london took off later carrying the 10 former british 
hostages and their families 
both groups were released after their families flew to baghdad 
and appealed to saddam to free them 
the state department which has said iraq should free all 
hostages unconditionally has advised american relatives of 
hostages not to travel to iraq saying they could become hostages 
themselves or play into the hands of iraqi propagandists 
boxing great muhammed ali said wednesday he has been promised 
the release of at least 14 us hostages and plans to fly home on 
saturday 
britains foreign office said wednesday that 55 more britons 
detained in baghdad have been moved to strategic sites in iraq 
raising the total held at such installations to about 350 
in other developments saddam on wednesday directed his 
parliament to discuss freeing belgian hostages thirty belgians are 
being held 
in addition an iraqi official denied that baghdad was stopping 
soviets from leaving 
the soviet foreign ministry on monday accused baghdad of 
breaking a promise to allow hundreds of soviets in iraq to leave 
and threatened a tougher attitude if they were not granted 
freedom 
but the iraqi foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday the 
soviets are fulfilling work contracts in iraq and will be allowed 
to leave when the contracts expire 
more than 8000 soviets were in iraq and kuwait before the aug 
2 invasion of kuwait fewer than half that number remain 
five freed germans were also preparing wednesday to leave jordan 
for home 
the germans who were in hiding before emerging saturday to take 
advantage of an iraqi decision to free all german nationals were 
to fly to frankfurt aboard a lufthansa flight thursday according 
to the german embassy 
in addition robert cordett a member of canadas parliament 
said in baghdad that six of the 47 canadians held in iraq and 
kuwati will be freed 
the irish embassy in baghdad said 12 of the more than 200 irish 
citizens in iraq and kuwait were also told they could go home 
saddam has offered to free foreigners in exchange for guarantees 
he will not be attacked on nov 18 he offered to free all 
foreigners between dec 25 and march 25 provided the atmosphere 
remains peaceful 
he has released hostages on a piecemeal basis in reponse to 
pleas from visiting dignitaries

twenty us lawmakers said 
wednesday a un resolution setting a jan 15 deadline for iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait should send saddam hussein a message that war 
would be suicide 
after talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo and a 
day of visiting us troops in the saudi arabian desert the 
congressional members told a news conference the united states and 
its allies want peace but would decisively win any war 
we are trying to convince the man in iraq that he is in a 
suicidal position we have got to convince him that he cannot win 
and thats the reason for the resolution before the united 
nations said rep nicholas mavroules dmass who led the 
congressional delegation 
he said the resolution showed dedication on the part of those 
who want peace 
i think the resolution tends to squeeze more and more and 
tighter and tighter each day the message were trying to get across 
to mr saddam hussein thats the meaning of the resolution and we 
hope its going to work he said 
the un security council is expected to vote thursday on the 
resolution that would authorize the use of force against iraq after 
jan 15 unless it withdraws its 450000 troops from kuwait 
rep robert w davis rmich said mubarak told the delegation 
a lot of pressure is going to be applied from a lot of other 
country leaders trying to convince saddam hussein that he 
cannot win in a war with the united states and these other nations 
we are going to defeat him and defeat him decisively if in 
fact we have to go to war davis said 
rep larry j hopkins of kentucky the ranking republican on the 
house armed services investigations subcommittee said i would 
strongly advise him after witnessing and seeing what we have here 
already what we know is coming in the future to come to his 
senses because he has nothing in store but a lot of grief and death 
from his part of the world 
he said the iraqi invasion of kuwait was completely different 
than any previous crisis this century because for the first time 
the superpowers can no longer be played off against each 
other 
rep marilyn lloyd dtenn said every single leader the 
delegation spoke to wanted economic sanctions against iraq to work 
we did not meet with a single leader who said hey we want 
to go out in a shooting war certainly the mission if at all 
possible is to avert war she said 
members of the delegation were divided on the effectiveness of 
sanctions 
rep robert k dornan a republican hawk from southern 
california predicted saddams demise because of the effectiveness 
of sanctions 
hell be overthrown in three months hell be assassinated 
within two to four months no doubt in my mind about it at all 
sanctions are working the pressure is incredible its going to 
build and his officers will kill him within four months im 
taking bets he said 
mavroules chairman of the house armed services investigations 
subcommittee said iraq was losing 2 billion a month because it 
couldnt export oil and it was suffering from a shortage of spare 
parts common sense tells you the man cannot survive he said 
but davis said even though sanctions are working he wasnt 
confident they were working well enough to drive saddam out of 
kuwait 
the delegation praised the high morale of us troops living 
under difficult conditions in the desert 
but rep mary rose oakar dohio stressed that the frontline 
troops were not living in penthouse conditions its a 
tremendous sacrifice 
some soldiers she said had complained about feeling isolated 
the lack of communications with their families and news from the 
outside world and the boredom of waiting for something to happen 
the morale i thought was very high and it got higher as we got 
closer to the kuwaiti border said rep robert j lagomarsino a 
california republican the more primitive the conditions the 
higher the morale and thats not accidental because the people in 
the more primitive conditions are the combat infantry the combat 
marine forces that were trained in the desert so they know what 
theyre doing

nicaragua granted refugee status 
wednesday to two cuban doctors who said they feared returning home 
and defected officials said costa rica gave them tourist visas 
and they left for there later in the day 
mario antonio reyes morales 29 and gilberto marcelino perez 
franco 30 were part of a medical team cuba sent to work in 
nicaraguan hospitals before the leftist sandinista government lost 
power in feb 25 elections 
both specialized in newborn babies they arrived here the spring 
of 1989 and defected last friday 
the doctors asked nicaragua for political asylum but had been 
housed at the costa rican embassy 
foreign ministry spokeswoman claudia paniagua said nicaragua 
granted them refugee status and gave them travel documents so they 
could fly to neighboring costa rica 
she said it was the first time under president violeta 
chamorros 7monthold government that any cuban worker asked 
asylum 
despite the change of government cuban medical workers have 
remained in hospitals here to make up for the severe shortage of 
healthcare specialists most of whom left the country during the 
decade of sandinista rule 
in san jose costa ricas foreign minister bernd niehaus said 
his government decided to grant the doctors 30day tourist visas 
while authorities there checked their request for political asylum 
if we can prove they are politically persecuted well give 
them asylum niehaus said

two former us military chiefs urged caution 
in the persian gulf on wednesday even as president bush sent 
secretary of state james a baker iii to press the united nations 
for formal support of a possible attack against iraq 
i counsel patience said retired adm william crowe who was 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under president reaganwar 
is not neat its not tidy and once you resort to it its 
uncertain and its a mess 
retired air force gen david c jones chairman of the joint 
chiefs under president carter voiced concern with the latest troop 
deployment in which bush is sending 200000 more to bolster the 
230000 already in the gulf and to add an offensive capability 
jones said his fear isnt that we might choose to fight but 
rather that the deployment might cause us to fight perhaps 
prematurely and perhaps unnecessarily 
the former chiefs comments were generally in line with those of 
lawmakers mainly democrats whose objections have risen in 
volume as a shooting war has seemed more likely in the weeks since 
congress adjourned for the year 
postadjournment hearings by a range of committees are occurring 
this week and next though top bush officials wont testify until 
next week after the un security council action 
baker went to new york wednesday to personally take charge of 
the us effort to win formal international support of the idea of 
a lastresort attack to free kuwait from saddam husseins forces 
which invaded on aug 2 
sen bob dole rkan the senate minority leader said in a 
statement wednesday evening the chances were better than 5050 
for a special session to deal with the gulf probably before 
christmas he didnt say who would call it the president or 
congressional leaders 
doles statement attracted attention because he put it out after 
a chat with the president but the white house said no decision had 
been made on whether to seek a special session 
the question is how much pain we administer and how quickly 
and whether we do it with the embargo or the use of force said 
sen sam nunn dga whose armed services committee began its 
hearings tuesday 
later nunn expressed doubts about the size of the us forces 
saying the number is much too large to be able to be sustained 
politically and perhaps even logistically 
meanwhile house majority leader richard gephardt broke with the 
administration and stepped ahead of other party leaders on the 
subject of military confrontation with saddam announcing his 
opposition to the use of us military force in the near future 
and rep lee hamilton chairman of the house foreign affairs 
middle east subcommittee said he believes it is time for bush to 
send an envoy to baghdad to open talks with saddam with the aim of 
making us intentions clear and exploring nonmilitary solutions 
to the crisis 
on the republican side sen nancy kassebaum of kansas said in 
an interview that a special envoy accompanied by other 
international officials should be sent to make sure saddam 
understands there is a deadline there and it will be met and 
were serious about it 
democrats some suggesting the united states is careening 
inexorably toward war in the middle east are using the hearings to 
try and muscle their way into decisionmaking on the gulf 
sen robert c byrd of west virginia the former senate 
democratic leader told armed services committee colleagues he 
believed the world would welcome patience rather than 
impetuousness before any us decision to go to war 
when we view grandmothers and grandfathers who lost not one 
but two three grandchildren and they feel we took the action too 
hastily i think well all have the time to be sorry byrd said 
this came just hours after gephardt dmo formally announced 
his opposition to the use of force during a breakfast speech to a 
us chamber of commerce audience across lafayette park from the 
white house 
the policy of patient strength is i think our best hope 
gephardt said and he made clear he was opposing any congressional 
resolution authorizing the use of force in so doing he parted 
company with other democratic leaders who said bush would have a 
better chance of winning congressional backing for the use of force 
if the united nations first endorsed this option 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater declined to respond 
directly to the statements by gephardt and the former chairmen of 
the joint chiefs 
obviously there are going to be different opinions 
fitzwater told reporters 
fitzwater said bush does not plan to ask congress for authority 
to launch any attack under the war powers act the president 
maintains he already has the authority to take such action 
on capitol hill crowe and jones recommended that the united 
states give economic sanctions against iraq a year to 18 months to 
work before opting for military force 
and crowe said that bush must consider the future implications 
of attacking an arab nation in the tenuous middle east situation 
i am persuaded that the us initiating hostilities could well 
exacerbate many of the tensions i have cited and further polarize 
the arab world crowe said 
former secretary of state henry a kissinger testified i do 
not believe we can maintain 400000 troops much beyond the spring 
of next year and therefore our general position will be yes we 
will be driven to a decision on whether to go to war 
meanwhile hamilton dind said debate now on a congressional 
resolution could lead saddam to believe us resolve was weakening 
i dont know whether it would carry or not if put to a vote 
in congress but there would be a large number of votes against 
it he said 
democrats werent alone in questioning bushs strategy in the 
gulf 
rep henry hyde rill said bushs decision to double the us 
military presence in saudi arabia has painted us into a very 
difficult corner 
hyde normally hawkish on defense matters urged bush to work 
out a rotation that would gradually replace us troops with those 
of allies and get down our presence for the long haul to a more 
manageable structure

tavern owners jammed jukeboxes with earthshaking tunes and 
worried residents squirreled away water and flashlights wednesday 
as the questionable countdown progressed for a major earthquake as 
early as next week on the new madrid fault 
the commotion is over a projection made by dr iben browning 
who said there was a strong chance of a major earthquake dec 23 
in an area that includes the new madrid fault from arkansas 
through missouri to illinois 
were ready for it i have 13 gallon jugs of water blankets 
two sleeping bags a pipe wrench canned food a flashlight and a 
radio with extra batteries said debbie brunk of bonne terre 
mo which is about 50 miles from the new madrid fault zone 
others took the projections a little more lightly 
bumper stickers saying its iben brownings fault have 
started popping up on cars in the region 
one tavern owner has come up with a list of songs having to do 
with earthquakes 
joe edwards owner of the blueberry hill tavern in st louis 
said hes filling his jukebox with earthquake songs and serving 
special drinks to help our customers cope with any anxiety they 
might be feeling 
he had culled more than 150 songs including dancin on the 
ceiling church bells may ring if we make it through 
december and at least 13 titles containing the word shake 
meanwhile iben brownings daughter evelyn garriss stood by 
her fathers projection after san francisco radio station kcbs 
reported that she said her father believes theres a 5050 chance 
of a major quake outside the united states 
we are less concerned about san francisco bay areas hayward 
fault recently than we continue to be about some of the other 
places like japan she said 
later wednesday she said the earlier forecast for a major quake 
striking the midwest was still valid brownings family said he was 
on vacation and refused to disclose where he has refused in the 
past to make any additional comment on the projection 
we have not changed our projection she told the associated 
press at her home in tijares nm outside albuquerque 
earthquake experts and other scientists have repeatedly said 
that brownings projection which relies on the measurement of the 
pull of tidal forces on the earth was nothing more than a random 
guess 
on tuesday a scientist for the us geological survey strongly 
discounted the projection in a briefing of congressional staff 
members in washington 
i can summarize our findings by saying there is no reason 
that a large earthquake is more likely to occur dec 2 or 3 
than it is today three weeks from today or any day in the 
future said randall updike associate chief of the surveys 
office of earthquake volcanoes and engineering 
scientists agree there is a longterm threat of a major 
earthquake in the midwest but there is no scientific way to 
pinpoint a date for when it will occur 
the seven states near or along the fault zone are missouri 
arkansas tennessee mississippi kentucky indiana and illinois 
some residents dont put much stock in the projection but many 
arent taking any chances 
earthquake insurance sales have skyrocketed and state regulators 
from the region have formed a special committee to monitor the 
availability of policies amid reports that some companies have 
stopped selling earthquake insurance 
schools districts up and down the fault zone which runs from 
marked tree ark northeast through missouri to cairo ill have 
canceled classes for dec 3 and 4 and some local governments also 
have decided to shut down 
other state and local officials are gearing up for earthquake 
drills 
sales of survival kits and other emergency preparedness items 
also have increased in the region as businesses scramble to take 
advantage of the sudden interest in earthquakes

federico pena the only hispanic mayor of a major 
us city announced wednesday that he will not seek reelection in 
1991 
pena who parlayed skillful political knowhow and a cadre of 
dedicated volunteers into two terms as denver mayor said his time 
in office has been the most thrilling and rewarding time of my 
life 
but now i am going to graciously step aside as mayor of this 
great city and allow a new generation of leadership to take this 
city into that decade he said 
the decision came as no surprise to some staff members but it 
stunned potential candidates who didnt know pena would announce 
his plans seven months before the end of his term 
figuring into penas decision was the fact that he has held 
public office for 12 years including four years in the colorado 
house 
sometimes people in public office continue to run and run and 
run and i dont think thats what voters want he said more 
of us in public office ought to say its time 
penas decision left democrats looking for a possible successor 
in the heavily democratic city of 500000 and republicans hopeful 
of gaining a foothold 
the mayors job ostensibly is a nonpartisan position but 
democrats have dominated the office for years

hawaii has the nations lowest rate of 
preventable deaths from chronic diseases and michigan has the 
highest the federal centers for disease control said wednesday 
the cdc found that the 50 states and the district of columbia 
could have prevented at least 26 percent of their deaths from nine 
leading chronic diseases in 1986 by reducing such risks as smoking 
and cholesterol levels 
the bottom line is there are a lot of these deaths that are 
potentially preventable said steven m teutsch a cdc 
epidemiologist who helped research the study 
what we are hoping states do is look at where they fall in 
terms of these chronic disease deaths and then examine the specific 
problems in their states 
the study found that hawaii had the lowest rate of preventable 
deaths with 264 percent of 2817 deaths that year labeled as 
preventable north dakota and utah both with 332 percent tied 
for the second lowest rate new mexico with 372 percent and 
minnesota with 377 percent rounded out the lowest five 
michigan had the highest rate 535 percent followed by west 
virginias 533 percent new yorks 526 percent ohios 521 
percent and kentuckys 52 percent 
the cdc study published in this weeks journal of the american 
medical association found that if each state reduced a risk for 
its most prevalent disease the national life expectancy of 737 
years would increase by four years 
teutsch said the study was the first federal effort to track 
preventable deaths which it considered stroke coronary heart 
disease diabetes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease chronic 
liver disease and lung breast cervical and colorectal cancers in 
1986 the latest year data were available 
teutsch said the differences in rates of preventable deaths are 
potentially explainable by isolating various factors 
for instance he said michigans high rate may be attributable 
to it being a highly industrialized state with high minority 
populations where knowledge about risk of disease is low 
in hawaii on the other hand the diet leans strongly toward 
seafood and vegetables which contributes to lower cholesterol 
rates and less heart disease 
researchers figured out which state had the lowest mortality 
rate of each of the diseases and added those rates to create a 
mythical utopian state with the lowest death rate in all nine 
diseases about 224 per 100000 population then they compared 
each state to the ideal 
hawaii came the closest to the utopian state with 3047 
deaths per 100000 or 8034 above the ideal thus 264 percent of 
its deaths were considered preventable 
teutsch said researchers have found that reducing even one of 
the known risks for these diseases such as smoking for lung 
cancer and cholesterol for heart disease dramatically lowers 
chances of developing the illnesses 
what weve seen is whats been achieved in some state 
teutsch said pointing out that hawaii has the nations low heart 
disease rate if thats been achieved in some state it 
presumably can be achieved in another state 
the study found cigarette smoking contributed to the most deaths 
from the nine diseases 33 percent obesity a sedentary lifestyle 
high cholesterol hypertension and diabetes followed 
it also found that use of mammography and pap screening for 
breast and cervical cancers could lower deaths from those diseases

lech walesa revealed wednesday he has 
asked for help from prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki now 
eliminated from the presidential race in walesas dec 9 runoff 
against emigre businessman stanislaw tyminski 
the solidarity leader told state radio he telephoned his 
defeated rival and also called two mazowiecki supporters 
bronislaw geremek former chief of the solidarity parliament 
caucus and roman catholic newspaper editor jerzy turowicz 
last sundays election was expected to be a contest between 
walesa and mazowiecki over the pace of restructuring the economy 
and achieving fiscal responsibility following the end last year of 
more than four decades of communist rule 
darkhorse candidate tyminski who returned to poland only 
months ago after making a fortune in the canada and peru stunned 
the politicians by finishing second to walesa he scored big by 
promising the electorate immediate raises and a quick economic 
turnaround 
walesa got 40 percent of the vote tyminski drew 23 percent and 
mazowiecki 18 percent 
that meant the top two candidates walesa and tyminski will 
face off in a decisive vote in less than two weeks 
walesa said he made the calls because i want to be the 
president of all poles and i want to find possibilities of 
cooperation with anyone whose supreme goal is the good of all 
poland i will make such moves to achieve this 
earlier an informed source said walesa was expected to ask 
mazowiecki to withdraw his resignation and stay on as prime 
minister until parliamentary elections in the spring mazowiecki 
announced his resignation monday the source spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
walesa picked mazowiecki to be the east blocs first 
noncommunist prime minister but they split in the spring over the 
pace of reform with walesa urging greater speed and mazowiecki 
advocating a steady measured course 
the solidarity movement that had presented a united front 
against communism also divided 
the presidential election was expected to be a battle between 
walesa and mazowiecki over how quickly to restructure the economy 
and achieve fiscal responsibility 
tyminski who recently returned to poland after making a fortune 
in the west changed all that by focusing on the entire direction 
of the reforms he promised immediate raises and a quick economic 
turnaround 
a special meeting of the solidarity parliament caucus was 
scheduled for tonight to consider endorsing walesas candidacy 
against tyminski 
jaroslaw kaczynski a top walesa adviser and the editor of the 
union newspaper weekly solidarity predicted solidarity will easily 
win the runoff 
nothing could pose a threat to walesas victory kaczynski 
said its only a question of what the proportions of victory 
will be

henry lee lucas said he was prepared to 
die monday for a 1979 texas slaying and believes his execution is 
the states revenge for false confessions he made to nearly 600 
killings around the nation 
im not a mass murderer he said wednesday in an interview 
they dont want me to prove i didnt commit the crimes i gave 
law enforcement a black eye 
lucas 54 faces lethal injection for the slaying of a female 
hitchhiker whose body was found oct 31 1979 next to a culvert 
north of georgetown the unidentified woman is known only as 
orange socks which is all she was wearing when she was found 
im worried im not scared lucas said of his execution 
i guess anybody who goes through this is worried 
the drifter previously confessed to nearly 600 slayings before 
he began recanting them and now admits only to one the beating 
death of his mother in tecumseh mich in 1960 
ill go to heaven lucas said ive been forgiven for 
that 
he contends he was in florida at the time of the orange socks 
slaying and was forced by police to confess 
i tried to explain he said of the confessions the more i 
tried the more it became impossible to do i know what they told 
me i only repeated it back to them 
lucas attorneys awaited the outcome of appeals to halt the 
execution which would be the 143rd in the united states since the 
1976 us supreme court ruling allowing states to resume use of the 
death penalty it would be the 38th execution in the state since 
texas resumed capital punishment in 1982 
lucas said he might have confessed to as many as 4000 crimes 
under duress from police and prosecutors 
the orange socks conviction is lucas only death sentence 
although he has at least six other life terms two 75year 
sentences and a 60year term for other texas convictions he is 
wanted in florida on three firstdegree murder charges for slayings 
in 1980 and 1981 
i wonder what its going to be like he said of his death 
i think theres another world to go to hopefully ill make it 
some day id rather go the right way than the wrong way

a blind minister who was barred from the 
pulpit when he brought his guide dog to services has been accused 
by the churchs head pastor of alleged insubordination disrespect 
and causing dissension 
the rev le roy singleton will get a chance to argue his case 
before the 128member congregation of the mt zion ame church on 
dec 9 the head pastor the rev ellsworth coleman said 
wednesday 
coleman said he levied the allegations during a monday church 
meeting 
i said to him he was out of line by going outside of the 
church to the news media with these problems i told him that 
what he had done has caused dissension within our church i said 
he was disrespectful of the church laws coleman said 
coleman did not mention any possible discipline against 
singleton 
singleton had sat in the pulpit ever since he was ordained in 
1988 but when he got the dog from a training center in september 
the pastor the rev ellsworth coleman banished the pair to the 
back of the church 
the whole thing stems from one thing he does not want the dog 
in the church singleton said 
singleton has maintained that he and digby a german 
shepherdcollie mix should be allowed to sit anywhere in the 
church including the front pew with other ministers 
if coleman doesnt invite me up there in the pulpit i can 
accept it but i feel that i should be able to walk into the church 
and sit anywhere i choose to be seated singleton said 
since being barred from the pulpit singleton has contacted the 
local chapter of the national federation of the blind which called 
the news media about the dispute 
he also has gone over colemans head to complain to his boss 
the rev joseph d tull presiding elder of the african methodist 
episcopal church in central and southern delaware 
coleman told a church meeting on monday that he has received 
hate mail and malicious telephone calls 
they were animal lovers and they werent from delaware 
coleman said 
coleman had not talked about the dispute publicly until 
wednesday 
earlene a hughes president of the delaware chapter of the 
national federation of the blind expressed outrage 
this is a disgraceful situation she said its an insult 
to every blind person in this country

america succeeded wednesday in delaying a 
vote on protecting palestinians in israelioccupied lands 
thwarting arab states that wanted to put it ahead of a resolution 
on using force against iraq diplomats said 
it represented a tactical victory for the united states which 
is trying to avoid angering its arab allies in the multinational 
force arrayed against iraq 
the united states november president of the un security 
council won support for delaying the palestinian vote until 
sometime after the council votes thursday on authorizing use of 
force in the persian gulf western diplomats said no specific date 
was set 
m nasser alkidwa the acting palestinian observer told 
reporters so far the us president of the council has 
blocked it referring to the plobacked resolution to deploy 
un observers to protect palestinians 
on thursday the council is certain to adopt the us initiative 
giving iraq until jan 15 to withdraw from kuwait or face a 
possible military strike diplomats say 
arab diplomats had said the palestinian issue might be raised 
thursday during the meeting on the useofforce resolution the 
session is expected to be attended by 13 foreign miniters 
any motion to discuss the palestinian issue at thursdays 
meeting now is expected to be defeated 
the arab pressure placed the united states in the awkward 
position of appearing to care less about the palestinians after 23 
years of israeli occupation than about the kuwaitis whose country 
was invaded aug 2 by iraq 
the palestine liberation organization arab states and some 
nonaligned nations contend the united states and the security 
council are applying a double standard acting firmly and swiftly 
against iraq but doing nothing concrete to help palestinians 
the united states wants to duck having to veto or abstain from 
voting on what it considers to be an unacceptable resolution aimed 
at helping palestinians 
israel opposes the resolution and will not cooperate with an 
outside ombudsman investigating israeli practices but diplomats 
said the latest draft is weaker than earlier proposals and israel 
may not seek a us veto or abstention 
as one of the five permanent council members the united states 
can veto any resolution america frequently cast a veto over the 
years to protect its israeli ally 
the latest draft resolution on the territories calls in 
principle for a un ombudsman and an increased international 
presence in the territories to safeguard the rights of 
palestinians it also would welcome but not mandate an 
international meeting to ensure that israel complies with the 
fourth geneva convention on protection of civilians in occupied 
territories

a former us attorney general clergymen 
veterans and others urged the united nations on wednesday to reject 
any use of force to counter iraqi aggression and not to become an 
instrument of war 
on thursday the un security council is scheduled to approve 
overwhelmingly a us initiative which would authorize the use of 
military force to liberate kuwait if iraqi invaders do not 
withdraw by jan 15 it would approve but not mandate usled 
military action 
the united nations must not become an instrument of war 
said a statement by the group the coalition to stop us 
intervention in the middle east 
its purpose at its creation expressed throughout its 
charter was to end the scourge of war said the statement 
released at a news conference 
the statement said that a resolution authorizing force against 
iraq after decades of un inaction in south african and israeli 
aggresions and human rights violations will permanently damage un 
credibility 
ramsey clark a former us attorney general told the news 
conference that less than one year ago the united states had no 
more right to invade panama which it did dec 20 than had iraq 
when it invaded kuwait on aug 2 
he and others said that all nonviolent means sanctions reason 
and dialogue have not been exhausted the un charter itself he 
said only provides for military action to counter aggression after 
all other possibilities have failed 
there can be no recourse to military means to resolve 
disputes he said 
other speakers said that if the united states goes to war 
against iraq demonstrations will erupt across the united states 
they blamed the militaryindustrial complex in the united states 
for fanning a war

desert must be impeded how many lives per gallon will be

us health secretary louis sullivan was 
heckled wednesday by aids activists during a speech urging 
americans to avoid selfdestructive behavior 
sullivan who spoke at yale university dropped a line from his 
prepared speech that identified highrisk sexual behavior as a 
hazard he went ahead and identified smoking reckless driving and 
excessive drinking as things to stay away from 
the speech was interrupted more than 150 times by about a dozen 
members of the aids coalition to unleash power or actup among 
them was the national groups founder authoractivist larry 
kramer who was on campus to address a business class 
scattered throughout an audience of about 200 actup members 
shouted questions accusations and obscenities at the health 
secretary saying he was doing too little to battle the aids crisis 
and blaming the victims 
it was a repeat of sullivans summer appearance at the sixth 
international conference on aids in san francisco where actup 
members drowned out his speech 
dr bernard lytton a yale professor who served as moderator 
was shouted down himself when he tried to persuade the activists 
not to interrupt sullivan 
lytton stopped the speech midway to warn that further 
disruptions would get the activists thrown out although the 
heckling got worse no one was ejected 
sullivan responded to the hecklers at least twice once telling 
them if you think this adolescent demonstration does anything to 
help your cause you are mistaken 
during the speech and a question period afterward sullivan said 
the government is spending far more on aids research than any other 
disease including heart disease which last year claimed 20 times 
more victims than aids 
thatgroup represents a fringe group he told a news 
conference after the speech that doesnt represent the broad 
aids community 
sullivans speech was the second in a series of five major 
speeches he plans to give at universities across the country 
the secretary suffered no such interruptions when he spoke to an 
invitationonly audience at the stanford medical center last month 
yale university had initially agreed at sullivans request to 
allow only members of the yale community to attend the speech 
university officials said but the school eventually decided not to 
check credentials and to let everyone attend

an american hostage used as a human shield in 
iraq returned wednesday to the united states surrounded by 
relatives who met with saddam hussein in their effort to have him 
freed 
after his release tuesday john stevenson criticized the us 
government for leaving his rescue to his sister and brotherswho 
traveled to the middle east despite state department 
recommendations that americans stay away 
god has blessed me with my family said stevenson 44 a 
computer specialist who was in kuwait for 11 years there are no 
words for freedom im very proud to be back and im very proud to 
be an american 
accompanying him were his twin sister mary trundy of brockton 
mass and brothers bill stevenson of panama city fla and james 
stevenson of sarasota fla 
they traveled to baghdad during the thanksgiving holiday and met 
with saddam on monday fifteen minutes after the meeting they were 
told their brother would be released 
the bush administration has refused to negotiate the release of 
american hostages saying iraq should free them all 
unconditionally the state department has urged americans not to go 
to iraq saying they could become hostages themselves or play into 
the hands of iraqi propagandists 
trundy said she felt fantastic about her brothers freedom 
when asked to comment on those who thought it was wrong to travel 
to iraq she said to each his own its my brother

russian leader boris yeltsin locked in a power 
struggle with soviet president mikhail gorbachev said in an 
interview published wednesday that their personal differences are 
still causing political trouble 
the statements appearing in the liberal weekly moscow news 
were yeltsins first indication that the leaders personal conflict 
still plays a role in the political crisis gripping the country in 
recent weeks 
yeltsin also reiterated his conditions for the kremlin to win 
his support for a new union treaty to hold the country together he 
said gorbachev must agree to share more power with the 15 republics 
and recognize their declarations of autonomy 
the kremlins proposed treaty stands at the center of the 
political standoff that pits gorbachev representing central power 
against yeltsin who has the backing of most republics their 
conflicting orders have paralyzed power in the country 
i think personalities have a lot of significance in 
politics yeltsin said in the interview 
realizing all the difficulties of the current moment i am 
trying to be free from every negative thing that has happened in 
our relationship with gorbachev so that it doesnt cast a shadow 
on our business relations 
yeltsin said two private meetings with gorbachev one last 
summer and the latest nov 10 have helped us make some progress 
in our relations but there are still many difficulties 
their personal relations are moving forward even though each 
time we have to negotiate over obstacles there are many ahead 
he said 
the newspaper did not say when the interview was given 
his comments were published a day after he clashed with 
gorbachevs supporters in the russian republics legislature over 
consideration of the treaty which was submitted last week for 
review by the republics 
yeltsin who wants a popular referendum on the treaty agreed to 
let russian lawmakers debate the document but without taking a 
final vote 
gorbachev in a separate interview published wednesday called 
the decision a breakthrough 
the soviet president also told the daily rabochaya tribuna that 
republics envisioning a more loosely organized federation are 
ignoring their historic ties 
when i see someone trying to create the impression that all 
nations have been dropped on this land by a parachute only two 
weeks ago and are just now beginning to think of how to coexist i 
feel very bad gorbachev was quoted as saying 
gorbachev had helped yeltsin rise in the communist party in the 
mid1980s then ousted him from the ruling politburo in 1988 after 
yeltsin criticized the slow pace of reforms

a white policeman initially cleared of 
wrongdoing in the slaying of a black teenager was charged with 
manslaughter wednesday in the killing that led to race rioting 
gary spath faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of 
reckless manslaughter in the teaneck shooting of phillip pannell 
16 spath claimed pannell was reaching for a weapon when he fired 
witnesses disputed that claim arguing that pannell had his 
hands raised overhead in surrender when he was shot in the back 
april 10 a report from a pathologist hired by the boys family 
supported that contention 
i know the truth in this matter spath said at a news 
conference one good thing about this is that the truth will come 
out 
the killing heightened racial tension in teaneck an ethnically 
mixed suburb of about 39000 residents across the hudson river from 
new york city 
a candlelight vigil in memory of pannell turned into a rampage 
april 11 as dozens of youths overturned police cars smashed 
windows and looted stores 
since then pannell supporters have held periodic marches the 
rev jesse jackson and nation of islam leader louis farrakhan have 
visited the town and police officers and other supporters of 
spath 29 staged a large rally 
a grand jury initially declined to indict spath but attorney 
general robert del tufo sent the case to a second grand jury 
because of what he called flawed evidence presented to the first 
panel 
in a statement wednesday tufo said the first panel ruled based 
on incorrect forensic and medical conclusions and the major 
error only detected late in the game could not be properly 
corrected 
critics including many new jersey police chiefs and spaths 
lawyer robert galantucci claimed del tufos motivations for 
keeping the case alive were political 
this is an obvious example of the attorney general in the 
state of new jersey throwing a bone to a segment of the 
community glantucci said in the process hes thrown officer 
spath to the wolves but thats only temporarily 
in september police chiefs across the state urged gov jim 
florio to replace del tufo with a special prosecutor florio 
declined 
the grand jury has completed its work florio said in a 
statement wednesday the matter now shifts to the courts where 
all the evidence will be weighed and the process of justice will 
continue 
pannells family who lived in river edge when the boy was 
killed welcomed the indictment 
del tufo gave us a fair chance said thelma pannell 36 the 
victims mother no matter whether youre black or white you 
have a fair chance 
its a good sign that the grand jurors have decided that his 
conduct has some blameworthiness said walter nealy a lawyer 
representing the african council an organization of 
africanamerican groups that supported the pannell family 
i think its a hopeful sign that there was an indictment but 
we still have to monitor the rest of the criminal justice system in 
this case he said 
officer wayne blanco spaths backup at the scene has said he 
frisked pannell and felt a gun before the foot chase and has 
denied that pannells arms were raised when he was shot

the pace of extinction is such that about 1000 living species

a gradual warming of the planet is altering climate changing 
the worlds weather patterns and worsening the crisis facing 
biological diversity he said 
slowly governments are accepting the wisdom of the late indian

is codestruction mansfield said 
the world conservation union includes 110 government agencies 
and 450 nongovernment organizations in 119 countries

it has been estimated that something like one quarter of the 
worlds living species will become extinct within the next 30 
years he said 
there can be no doubt that the bulk of past and future 
extinctions are the direct consequence of the massive increase in 
human population and the growth in the per capita demand for 
natural resources

the philippine government is 
negotiating with a representative of late president ferdinand 
marcos family for the return of 5 billion in assets an official 
said wednesday 
meanwhile the governments chief lawyer threatened to stop 
representing the presidential commission on good government in 
lawsuits against the marcoses and their associates to protest 
recent outofcourt settlements 
commission chairman david castro declined to specify conditions 
set for the return of the marcos assets 
he added that the negotiations with a close trustee of the 
marcoses were delicate and involved risk of life he did not 
elaborate 
castro said the assets comprised a combination of money and 
property in other countries which he did not identify 
he said it would be impossible to recover the money through the 
courts because the evidence would not be admissible 
the commission is charged with recovering alleged illgotten 
wealth amassed by marcos and his cronies during his 20year rule 
in 1986 a people power revolution drove marcos into exile in 
hawaii where he died in september 1989 
castro said president corazon aquino had been informed of the 
offer to return the assets but philippine officials did not pursue 
the proposal he did not identify the officials 
castro said recovering the assets by the time mrs aquino 
finishes her term in 1992 was a reasonable expectation 
despite claims marcos and his allies stole up to 10 billion 
the philippine government has yet to win a single lawsuit here or 
abroad against his family

the scene resembles a graduate seminar more 
than a public high school a handful of students sit slumped in 
swivel chairs so absorbed in the equations on the board that they 
forget to finish the doughnuts on the table 
the course is mathematical modeling the problem is to find an 
equation for building a road that offers the driver a clear view 
for a specified distance 
the students are on the wrong track and probably wont realize 
it for a few more days but instructor dan teague says the solving 
process is the point of the exercise 
you can really spend a lot of time talking with students about 
what theyre doing and why theyre doing it he said 
for 10 years teachers like teague have been helping make a 
success out of the north carolina school of science and 
mathematics the countrys first residential public high school 
here juniors and seniors with an exceptional aptitude for math 
and science are united under one roof for the sole purpose of 
learning 
the school gives them room and board teachers with extensive 
training in their fields and the latest in laboratories and 
computers all it asks in return is a commitment to learning 
something its students have always been willing to supply 
this is an environment in which you will find the library 
packed every chair taken until 1030 at night said principal 
william youngblood home is school and school is home 
what began as an experiment credited to former gov jim hunt is 
moving more into the mainstream a decade later today facilities 
modeled on the school of science and mathematics exist or are 
planned in mississippi alabama south carolina texas oklahoma 
indiana and florida 
the school has churned out hundreds of topnotch scientists 
doctors engineers and mathematicians 
many of its whiz kids win distinction while still at the school 
with highbrow awards such as the national mathematical contest in 
modeling three years ago its students became the first from a 
high school to place in the collegelevel contest 
we keep getting letters from kids who keep saying this was the 
best educational experience they ever had youngblood said 
many of the students who came to this school tell me its the 
first time theyve felt they belonged 
seventynine percent of the more than 1700 alumni contacted in 
a recent survey already have spent time in graduate school or have 
plans to do so he said 
a large majority of alumni also completed their undergraduate 
college studies at least a year ahead of their peers he said 
as word of that performance has spread enrollment at the school 
has nearly quadrupled to 550 of the some 900 students who apply 
each year only about a third are accepted 
demographics in addition to grades scores and recommendations 
play a role in the competition the school may favor a teenager 
from a poor rural area for example over his rich city cousin 
those who make the grade have their work cut out for them 
juniors and seniors often put in 12hour days television is 
restricted when they need a break these kids may take in a 
shakespeare play at nearby duke university 
about 3 percent eventually decide to return to more conventional 
schools 
i dont like science any more im getting tired said jason 
parker half in earnest as he emerged from a biology class its 
like it never ends here you never get done with anything 
but the 16yearold from jacksonville has no plans to leave 
you get to meet a lot of people and get away from home he 
said 
for others its the challenge that counts 
laura poole 17 of boone said the school is the most 
incredible thing thats ever happened to her on her desk lies a 
copy of the print she designed for a tshirt in art class the 
mind is a muscle it says 
youre happier here because youre with more people who are 
like you said 18yearold brian sauls of benson as he tried to 
debug a computer program that quizzes people on their knowledge of 
trivia 
occasionally a student may get his hands on some alcohol but 
the school has few of the problems plaguing most public high 
schools no drugs teen pregnancy or suicide attempts youngblood 
said 
we dont have knifings in the halls he said 
instead of graffiti walls bear statements of mind power 
wonders never cease as long as you never cease to wonder says 
a poster in the genetics engineering laboratory 
the school which also teaches the traditional subjects in 
addition to math and science has its critics who contend it is 
draining the brain power of other north carolina schools 
it also costs the state more to educate these students about 
11000 apiece by the latest estimate from the state education 
department compared to 3715 per student in regular public 
schools 
the school tries to repay that debt by sharing its learning 
experiences offering seminars that train teachers from other 
schools in new methods of instruction 
we can take risks and learn from those risks and take what we 
learn back to schools youngblood said its a grand concept

clouds of war distressing to most adults can 
be nightmarish to children 
such traumas are the special concern of pastors and others who 
counsel families separated by the persian gulf crisis 
but other people are indirectly affected by the crisis and it 
can be particularly frightening to youngsters says a new york 
minister who has counseled children 
with television focused on deployment of troops and guns 
coupled with the sights and sounds of everyday violence in home 
communities children need special reassurance to allay anxieties 
about danger and loss of security the rev arthur caliandro said 
news clips and stories of mothers and fathers going off to a 
threatened war pictures of weapons and soldiers on the move all 
seem to give a sense of foreboding to our children he said 
he said children are at a stage when safety and certainty are 
especially important 
caliandro senior minister of new yorks historic marble 
collegiate church with postgraduate training in psychology has 
conducted classes for 6to 13yearolds on dealing with the crisis 
he offers several suggestions to parents on how to help 
youngsters cope 
dont shield them from the realities of a troubled world 
recognizing that children have seen that people can at times be bad 
toward one another 
dont blame god for the threatened conflict god doesnt make 
war people do and people are responsibile for making peace too 
discuss the gulf crisis and their fears with sensitivity 
assuring them by word and by your presence that they are loved and 
wont be abandoned 
be careful not to teach children to hate others to encourage 
a blanket hatred of iraqis or moslems or any other group will 
complicate their growth point out that almost all people get angry 
and many have waged war and also that families of other religions 
and nationalities are like us 
with older children acknowledge the dangers in our troubled 
and violent world point out that hardship and losses are part of 
life and acceptance of danger helps deal with any pain it may 
bring 
encourage optimistic attitudes tell the story of eastern 
europe becoming free helping them believe things can get better 
being optimistic is not naive pessimism never improves bad 
situations 
use the opportunity to teach the difference between anger and 
peace between worry and trust in their own lives helping them 
learn to seek peace and to make their minds more peaceful so they 
sometimes can teach others how 
no matter how tense the situation gets encourage them to hold 
on to hope and to know that historys most heroic moments were 
sustained by hoping and praying against impossible odds 
help them face the fact that ours is not an ideal world and 
it is up to each of us to make it a little better 
in a similar vein the justice for womens committee of the 
presbyterian church usa issued a special call to prayer for 
women and children affected by the gulf crisis 
the special prayer goes in part 
almighty god we lift our hearts to you as we share the 
pain and fear of families of all those who are affected by the 
volatile situation in the middle east and especially women 
and the children who suffer as a result 
roman catholic bishop francis quinn of sacramento calif 
offered what he termed an awkward prayer for about 120 national 
guard soldiers recently as they left for duty in the persian gulf 
divine parent in heaven the prayer began protect these 
loved ones whom we now send forth we find it awkward to pray to 
you today lord all sides in the present conflict read sacred 
scriptures and pray to the same god 
and each invokes your aid lord against the other the 
prayers of all cannot be answered you god have your own purposes 
and plans 
the prayer then centered on sustaining the individual soldier 
and included moslem and buddhist as well as biblical invocations 
concluding with this paraphrasing of abraham linclon during the 
civil war 
fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this threatening 
scourge of war may surely pass away amen

at senate hearings on president bushs persian 
gulf policy the answers count less than the questions 
and a question thats being asked repeatedly is why the 
administration seems to be in a hurry to risk military action 
instead of waiting for economic sanctions to force iraq out of 
kuwait 
there is no answer threatening a military offensive doesnt 
mean theres going to be one but as long as its credible a 
threat can be a weapon too 
the president is talking to many audiences said james r 
schlesinger the former secretary of defense and cia director he 
is not only talking to the american people he is talking to the 
united nations he is trying to convey to saddam hussein that he is 
prepared if need arise to use military power 
schlesinger leadoff witness at the senate armed services 
committee said he doesnt know that bush really has turned to the 
military option and so he cant judge it to be premature 
he favors waiting while the sanctions exact their toll on iraq 
he also says that bushs order nearly doubling us forces is 
evidence of american determination and will strengthen the 
sanctions 
democrats tended to agree on the first point but not the second 
they say that the nov 8 order changed the mission from defense and 
sanctions to one in which offensive action is an option 
its the questions and comments of the senators that carry the 
message in senate armed services committee hearings this weeks 
witnesses former officials retired generals and cabinet officers 
are offering expert opinions but they do not make decisions any 
more senators do or will after congress reconvenes in january 
the administrations decision makers are in reserve unavailable 
until next week thats when the white house expects to have in 
hand a united nations security council resolution authorizing the 
use of force to drive iraq out of occupied kuwait unless saddam 
hussein withdraws in the next six weeks 
sen sam nunn dga the committee chairman said he favors the 
un resolution as a warning to the iraqi leader this un 
resolution however is not a substitute for fully informing the 
american people of our own nations objectives and strategy nunn 
said in opening the hearings on tuesday 
nunn said the hearing schedule was set in the first place to 
accommodate secretary of defense dick cheney and gen colin powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the officials he wanted to 
lead off but he said the administration chose not have them 
testify this week they will appear on monday 
secretary of state james abaker iii is to testify next 
wednesday at companion hearings before the senate foreign relations 
committee 
sen john warner rva said cheney stayed away this week 
because he felt and it was the administrations belief that his 
appearance might in some way conflict with the work in the 
united nations he said the administration supported having the 
hearings proceed 
but there were political strains nunn had taken the lead in 
criticizing the order doubling troop strength telling bush that it 
represented a fundamental change in policy and that hed need a 
declaration of war to order the liberation of kuwait a republican 
senator said nunn had timed the hearings for political purposes 
the chairman is opening a presidential campaign sen 
malcolm wallop of wyoming said before the hearings began 
nunn is a fixture on the guess list of potential democratic 
presidential candidates but a challenge to gulf policy at this 
point would be a risky beginning for any campaign too many open 
questions 
the central one of course is war or peace nunn said he does 
not question that military action is justified the question is 
whether military action is wise at this time and in our own 
national interest he said 
sen albert gore jr dtenn said there is no lack of sympathy 
for the problems bush confronts we all here understand that it 
is an awful lot easier to ask questions than to answer questions 
he said 
im concerned that our debating in public what our strategy is 
going to be simply plays into saddam husseins strategy said 
sen dan coats rind 
sen william s cohen rmaine said there is a danger that 
saddam will view debate as dissension and dissension as a 
political defeat for president bush but he said it is worth 
taking that risk so that bush will know whether congress and the 
american people support his policy before any shots are fired 
so the questions continue some with builtin answers like 
nunns on the desirability of waiting for the sanctions to work 
would you believe it would be advisable for us to begin acting 
as though time is on our side and that we do as a nation have the 
patience to see this through he asked

many longterm investors in mutual funds who 
usually dont worry much about the timing of their decisions are 
making an exception to that rule right now 
heading into december they start picking their spots carefully 
to dodge a potential pitfall that can arise from yearend 
distributions by funds that invest for capital gains 
the strategy they follow as summarized by the mutualfund 
specialists at donoghues moneyletter in holliston mass dont 
invest any new money in a domestic stock fund from now until after 
the fund has declared its yearend capital gains distribution 
by law funds that accumulate capital gains by selling stocks or 
other securities at a profit must pass those gains through to their 
shareholders in order to stay clear of tax problems of their own 
until a few years ago these distributions were commonly made in 
the year after the gains were realized now the law requires that 
they must be declared before dec 31 
investors normally are happy to see these gains being achieved 
and recognize that they must sooner or later share the bounty with 
uncle sam 
but many experts on mutualfund investing say the unwary can 
incur a needless tax problem if they put new money into a fund when 
a distribution is about to be made 
to see how that can work against you consider this example on 
dec 15 you invest 1000 in the hypothetical fund at 10 a share 
giving you 100 shares then on dec 18 the fund declares a 2 per 
share capital gains distribution payable jan 5 
you will be credited with a 200 payout whether you receive 
distributions in cash or reinvest the proceeds and it will be 
taxable as 1990 income 
by contrast if you waited until dec 19 to make your 
investment none of your money would be cycled back to you after 
the payout the pershare value would have dropped to 8 and your 
1000 would buy you 125 shares 
in either case the net value of the investors position is the 
same but any predistribution buyer who is in say the 28 percent 
tax bracket faces a tax bill of 56 
he has not benefited from the distribution only incurred a 
tax liability says sheldon jacobs in his annual handbook for 
noload fund investors 
predistribution buyers who reinvest their payouts get some 
compensating relief by adding the amount of the money they reinvest 
to the cost basis of the shares they own 
but whatever tax savings this might bring them cant be realized 
until they eventually sell their fund shares it may never produce 
any benefit at all if for instance they still own the fund 
investment when they die and it passes to their heirs 
in any case should you wish to plan a fund purchase around a 
distribution you need to know when a given fund intends to set its 
record date and about how much it expects to pay out this 
information is easier to get in advance from some funds than from 
others 
try calling your fund or watching closely for such an 
announcement in the mail or at least in the mutual fund listing in 
your newspaper donoghues advises and do it all in the name 
of responsible tax planning

black africas only 
international school for electrical engineers is turning out 20 a 
year and the world bank calls it an undoubted success 
the engineers would seem essential to development on a continent 
where insufficient unreliable electric power hinders industrial 
expansion yet the school whose facilities include the latest 
electronic gear and a hightension laboratory may be forced to 
close 
africa is in economic decline and the national utilities that 
own the college have been forced to reduce the number of students 
they send to it that raises the cost of operation and causes 
further reductions in enrollment 
a world bank report said the interafrican electrical engineering 
college is an undoubted success in that it produces a high 
quality immediately useful graduate 
it nestles among groves of oil palms in bingerville the old 
colonial capital of this former french possession the school was 
designed for 250 students but now has only 103 
the electric utilities of 20 member countries founded the 
college in 1979 the government provided land next to its national 
training facility for electricians in bingerville six miles east 
of abidjan the modern capital 
issiaka b ly a malian who has been at the school since it 
opened recalled i was regularly visited by snakes in the 
dormitory i had a whole floor to myself 
ly in charge of language studies said one goal of the school 
was to help african utilities work together and eventually link up 
in power grids language instruction is a priority so graduates 
will be bilingual in french and english the two main international 
languages spoken in member countries 
students begin the fiveyear program with seven hours of study a 
day in either french or english for five weeks 
students follow the traditional curriculum of subjects pursued 
by electrical engineers in the developed world but also must study 
management including how to run a business 
a chief weakness of african utilities has been their failure to 
collect bills and control expenses 
bingerville students also have to dig ditches and climb utility 
poles they spend summers working for member utilities 
after graduating an engineer must spend 10 years with the 
sponsoring national utility 
nathalie kouassie 22 of adzope ivory coast said it is our 
duty to work for our country because they paid for our education 
fellow fifthyear student alain kouma 25 of franceville 
gabon said manual labor is a useful part of the training because 
it is necessary to know the difficulties people face we must be 
able to do it 
cooperative programs with universities and electrical utilities 
in europe assure that the universitys graduates meet international 
standards 
even with the school established however member utilities that 
own it often prefer to send students overseas said francois acho 
achiepi the colleges director 
african leaders are used to sending students overseas he 
said its almost psychological 
achiepi conceded it costs up to 25 percent more to send a 
student to his school butadded we pay everything here from 
medical care to clothes to pocket money all the student has to do 
is go to class 
colleges in developed countries do not pay those costs and he 
said the bingerville school is competitive if they are counted 
emergency aid from foreign donors helped the school get through 
this year but more help will be needed in 1991 twothirds of the 
operating budget comes from the utilities that own it 
declining enrollments have meant less aid from the owners and 
the world bank report says the school responded by cutting costs 
basic facilities must be maintained including an adequate 
teaching staff whatever the number of students but only greater 
enrollment can reduce the cost per student 
the world bank and other donors have suggested the school earn 
extra money by using its facilities for adult education programs

prime minister toshiki kaifu sits at the worlds 
summits but the pinnacle of japanese political power is occupied 
by the man who got him the job 
shin kanemaru the sleepyfaced kingmaker has spent 32 years in 
parliament as the representative of yamanashi prefecture just 
outside tokyo where mount fuji rises majestically 
he arranged the sudden rise of kaifu as prime minister last 
year when virtually all the more powerful and betterknown 
candidates were tainted by scandal 
kanemaru also is expected to play a key role in determining how 
long kaifu whose popularity ratings are dropping stays in office 
when not managing politics at home kanemaru often can be found 
flying around asia on one of his controversial but sometimes 
effective personal diplomatic jaunts 
kim il sung the north korean dictator gave kanemaru a warm 
welcome in pyongyang last month and talks soon began between the 
two nations on establishing diplomatic relations 
the mission to pyongyang also prompted criticism of his 
judgment when kanemaru promised north korea compensation not only 
for 36 years of japanese colonial rule but for losses in the 
ensuing 45 years 
when he proposed recently that japan accept the return of only 
two of four sovietheld islands it claims the stunned foreign 
ministry declared quickly that it was only a personal opinion the 
islands are a delicate issue that has revented real improvement of 
sovietjapanese relations since world war ii 
despite the flaps kanemarus position remains largely intact 
among those who often consult with him is michael armacost the 
us ambassador armacost met with kanemaru after the north korean 
trip and a previous visit to china 
kanemaru is the creature of japans politics which puts 
extremely heavy emphasis on personal networks said takeshi 
sasaki a political science professor at tokyo university i 
think analyzing the secret of his influence will bring to light the 
enigma of japanese politics 
little was heard of kanemaru until he was chosen to lead the 
largest of five factions of parliament members from the liberal 
democratic party which has governed japan since its formation in 
1955 
his group includes 107 of the 395 liberal democratic members 
the factions called habatsus are the most important unit of 
political power in japan 
habatsus are not designed to promote particular policies or 
ideologies but to raise campaign funds and propel members to high 
government office lawmakers are devoted to their faction leaders 
who share out cash for elections 
negotiations among the factions determine who will be prime 
minister and serve in the cabinet leaders of the most powerful 
factions usually take turns as prime minister 
an apparent willingness not to hold top government jobs enhances 
kanemarus power the highest level he reached was deputy prime 
minister a largely ceremonial position 
one of the secrets of his power is that he never tries to 
obtain official posts such as prime minister or house speaker to 
make his influence visible said keiichiro nakamura a political 
analyst who advised former prime minister takeo miki it leaves 
him free of political enemies 
instead of asking other party elders to support his 
leadership kanemaru knows that it is better to wait for others to 
come to him that gives him a considerable edge over other faction 
leaders most of whom have strong aspirations to become prime 
minister one day 
analysts who follow kanemaru closely say he does not appear to 
have any guiding vision of the future for japan his public image 
is that of an oldschool moneytainted politician primarily 
concerned with porkbarrel politics and amassing power 
kanemarus office refused repeated requests for an interview 
two years ago when scores of senior lawmakers were implicated 
in a stock scandal kanemaru began to emerge clearly as japans 
political kingmaker 
the scandal forced kanemarus mentor noboru takeshita to 
resign as prime minister and sidelined most candidates for the 
succession 
last year kanemaru engineered the choice of kaifu a former 
education minister who belongs to one of the smaller factions and 
has virtually no power base of his own 
political analysts say kanemarus extensive personal network 
includes opposition party leaders business executives and elite 
bureaucrats 
there must be at least 10 top opposition party officials who 
would be willing to comply with my request on the strength of a 
single phone call kanemaru once boasted 
his wife etsuko often describes his personality as childlike 
and once said she believed this allows him to say many 
controversial things and get away with it 
a political ally senior lawmaker toshio yamaguchi said 
kanemaru gets away with it because he holds no high official post 
to lose

prisoners who come under religious influence while theyre 
behind the walls do better once theyre back on the outside and in 
society than those who lack the religious influence researchers 
say 
the findings of the firstofitskind study on the 
rehabilitative effect of religion on prisoners could have wide 
implications for the prison system although more study is needed 
the researchers say 
the results are phenomenal said john gartner of baltimore 
a clinical psychologist who headed the fivemember research team 
there havent been any findings of effectiveness that were this 
strong 
it was found that prisoners who received religious instruction 
while in prison had a lower rate of recidivism return to crime 
after being freed than did those who had no such instruction 
results show that religion may be a powerful and until now 
neglected method of rehabilitation the report says adding that 
the previous scant clues about it make the results very 
encouraging 
the study was commissioned by prison fellowship of washington 
which was founded by exwatergate prisoner charles chuck colson 
and now runs farflung programs for prisoners in about 550 state 
and federal prisons 
colson a hardworking advocate of reform of the overcrowded and 
highcost prison system said the findings were highly important to 
making the system work better 
what the study does is to show by objective and scientific 
means that prison ministry brings about lasting change in 
individuals he said 
combined with that finding a review of other studies of 
recidivism found that few included even surface religious 
variables making any previous findings in that category 
inconclusive the researchers said 
researchers usually ignore religion gartner said in an 
interview they look at all aspects of persons but religion is a 
gap its a blind spot in the social sciences not even consistent 
with the spirit of science 
considering the extent of prison ministries the report said 
it is ironic that religious factors have been largely ignored 
in studies on factors that might affect a prisoners chances for 
successful rehabilitation 
while results of the new study were positive gartner stressed 
that his teams report adds it is important to remember that 
research conclusions are not determined by one particular study 
this is especially so when a new area of research is opening up 
 
the groups study involved 190 prisoners who between 1975 and 
1979 had taken part in christian discipleship training and a 
similar number who had not matched by age race gender and other 
factors 
both groups had been released from prison eight to 14 years 
prior to the study 
it found that the religiontrained ones had an 11 percentage 
point lower recidivism rate than the control group forty percent 
of the religionschooled group committed new offenses while 51 
percent of the others did so 
the religiously trained group also had a longer crimefree 
period following release and when they did commit new crimes the 
crimes were less severe compared to past offenses the control 
group had increased crimeseverity 
the recidivisim rate for women who took religious training was 
even lower only 19 percent compared to 47 percent among the 
control group of women 
among men only the differential was only seven points 
burt rosen director of research and development for prison 
fellowship said the greatest surprise was that women religious 
participants showed a recidivism drop four times greater than the 
men 
he said the small number of women involved may have skewed the 
results somewhat but that women generally are more religious and 
the findings suggest they may be more amenable to religious 
rehabilitation programs 
blacks involved in the study showed religious participation had 
little impact on them but rosen said this may be because the 
program in those early years had not developed crosscultural 
sensitivity but now has done so 
the study report says the findings indicate that prison 
fellowship is indeed fulfilling its mission statement by helping 
a significant number of prisoners become productive members of 
society 
the study is the first part of a threeyear project a second 
phase of which is now going on among prisoners in new york state 
including expanded detailed scrutiny of the effect of religion on 
recidivism 
findings of the first study demonstrate that the potentially 
beneficial relationship between religious invovlement and criminal 
rehabilitation is an underresearched relationship in need of 
further study the report says 
only one previous study was turned up that dealt directly with 
the possible impact of religion on prisoners and that focused on 
transcendental meditation which is considered by many to be more a 
relaxation technique than a religion 
the few other studies that touched on religion noted only 
denominational variables thus leaving the field unexplored 
no one before had ever looked at the effect of religion on 
recidivism gartner said i find that quite amazing

once a shoefactory town with vacant 
storefronts this village has become a veritable shopping nirvana 
though it has only 7500 residents freeport boasts 110 outlet 
stores 65 in a sevenblock area of downtown alone including 
such wellknown names as ll bean dansk and j crew 
freeports unusual range of stores has enabled it to weather the 
recession better than most other towns in maine and other new 
england states business and government officials say 
its the disney world of shopping right here sai jclyn 
mclennan manager of the mikasa outlet store i havent felt the 
hurt of the economy ive heard a lot about it but i havent felt 
it or seen it 
but the retailing success has come at a price 
some longtime residents complain the town is so clogged with 
traffic it can take a halfhour to drive from one end to the other 
and they say the outlet stores cater to tourists and dont carry 
the products such as groceries needed for daily living 
i think it stinks said betty wentworth 69 who has lived 
in freeport since 1952 theyve got a lot of stores but retired 
people or people of an average income cant afford to shop there 
as mrs wentworth talked in her kitchen on a recent fall day 
kathleen brodie of northboro mass hunted for bargains a 
halfmile away in downtown freeport 
im on my way home from canada she said i made an effort 
to leave canada early so id have time to come by here 
brodie who treks to freeport about four times a year said many 
of the towns outlets sell merchandise at prices at least 25 
percent lower than similar stores in boston 
a block away meg and kate schwartz sisters from brielle nj 
marveled at freeports array of stores the stores dont look 
like outlet warehouses they look like regular stores said meg 
21 its a nice atmosphere and a pretty town 
the town has capitalized on two retailing trends the popularity 
of outlet shopping and the american pastime of shopping as 
recreation said beth gleason executive director of the freeport 
merchants association 
the american people are becoming savvier consumers looking for 
the best bargain gleason said the other thing is that 
shopping has become a family event that replaces other forms of 
recreation 
thats why freeport has been such a success she said we 
also have ll bean which is unique in the world 
the companys namesake ll bean began selling hunting shoes 
by mail in 1912 he later added other clothing for hunting such as 
wool shirts and socks 
as people started receiving the catalog they decided they 
wanted to stop in here in freeport said company spokesman kilton 
andrew there wasnt any store there people would just meet them 
at the door and take them to the areas where they stocked the 
merchandise and sell them what they wanted 
then people started showing up in the middle of the night and 
they literally rousted ll out of bed he said 
so in the 1930s bean set aside space for a retail store and 
kept it open roundtheclock every day of the year after beans 
death in 1967 at age 94 his grandson leon a gorman expanded the 
business taking its appeal beyond hunters and fishermen to 
outdoors enthusiasts of all types 
but as beans business grew freeports economic heart shoe 
manufacturing began to slump in the early 1980s 
town manager dale olmstead recalls that when he first moved to 
freeport in 1982 the downtown was quite rundown 
things began looking up in the summer of 1982 when dansk opened 
the first namebrand outlet in downtown freeport 
apparently andrew said the wizards of the where do you 
put stores business decided this was a happening place and boom 
look what happened as the 80s heated up business in freeport 
just grew and grew freeport has achieved critical mass as a 
shopping destination 
word of freeports shopping attractions quickly spread along the 
tour bus and tourist circuit 
when promoting maine gleason said tourism officials will 
sell lobsters the beautiful rocky coast of maine and theyll 
sell ll bean 
bus tours if they can fit it in their itinerary will always 
stop in freeport she said ive seen as many as 16 to 30 buses 
in here on a busy day 
i think weve weathered the recession better than other 
communities said olmstead the town manager 
mrs wentworth and her husband ran a dry cleaning service on 
main street from 1953 until they sold their building in 1984 at the 
start of the outlet boom 
paul wentworth acknowledges the couple made a tidy profit on the 
sale but still laments what the outlet boom has done to life in 
freeport 
they dont sell the products you need for everyday life since 
this commercial explosion started he said 
like other freeport residents the wentworths must drive eight 
miles north to brunswick or five miles south to yarmouth to shop in 
a supermarket 
the couple lives a halfmile from the center of town but say 
its easier to walk downtown than drive because of the traffic 
congestion

re midseason 
sit down are you sitting down sit down im so excited why i 
have an idea plus a concept for the midseason replacement more i 
have finished the treatment for the concept for tv in the 90s im 
talking about a series with more than just that twin peaksrescue 
911thirtysomething feel this is actually about something 
im sending over the treatment and pilot episode for wheres 
harry because i know itll set you on fire pardon the pun as 
youll see from the script 
its the hourlong adventures of harry unman a handsome 
clever witty serial killer whos embraced a nomadic lifestyle 
while struggling to cope with his problem were talking 
dramedy with a vengeance violent slapstick death incredible 
tension irony an audience torn between wanting him to get caught 
and wanting him to get away with it well have celebrity guests 
lining up to get knocked off a status thing 
and we dont have to show you know every single murder we can 
use a cute little sound effect like the bong of the frying 
pan they used in the movie eating raoul maybe we can have 
harry use a cute murder weapon were working on it 
harry speaks to something in all of us i mean this is a guy 
who has problems in his relationships as all of us do the 
difference with harry is that he cant have them relationships i 
mean he blows into town gets a job pumping gas or slinging hash 
and tries to get his life in order 
but that lunar killing cycle kicks in and harrys back behind 
the wheel of that 69 plymouth roadrunner with something cold and 
sticky in the trunk the horror the tension the ratings 
hes a romantic hero attractive and dangerous if harry asks 
you out on a date youll remember it for the rest of your life 
because you go home in the trunk wrapped in 100 pounds of chain 
the great thing is its not a ripoff of some other concept 
its kind of a cross between route 66 and the fugitive and 
i save the best for last 
i think we can get tom selleck to do it 
 
from moey 
to mikey 
re midseason 
get selleck 
i spoke to my guy at the network and they are believe me hot 
to the point of whitehot for us to go forward on wheres 
harry in fact he says harryshmarry we work for this guy 
just kidding you know how scared they are all i had to do was 
whisper women 18 to 49 key demographics and a 30 rating 
and a 21 share then their piggy little eyes lit up theyre 
desperate for anything thatll bring in even a piece of the 
audience my guy is running it through their legal people and 
standards amp practices 
get selleck 
 
from mikey 
to moey 
re midseason 
we cant get selleck he has a movie deal with lord run run 
shaws people how about johnny depp anybody who can fit 21 jump 
street and john waters cry baby into the same career could 
handle a serial killer we can get johnny depp 
 
from moe 
to mike 
re wheres harry 
get johnny depp meanwhile we have some problems i had my guy 
run the treatment through network standards amp practices before they 
shut down the department no problem they said then he ran it 
past their legal people problem 
theyre worried about the serial killer angle mostly their 
concern is over how harry does his victims they say if we 
happen to match the wrong set of circumstances method motive and 
opportunity well have nuisance lawsuits from every serial killer 
working on a book deal in north america 
heres a suggestion from the network people instead of being a 
serial killer can we make him gay it would be basically the same 
deal minus the murdering and the shallow graves a handsome 
troubled guy who goes around doing good deeds and trying to 
overcome his you know his gayness or something like that 
problem is if we do it that way then we probably couldnt get 
johnny depp 
 
from michael 
to maurice 
re harry 
moe you cant be serious television is ready for a serial 
killer not a homosexual violent senseless death is ok 
alternative lifestyles are still a nono remember what 
happened with sidney 
anyway it turns out we cant get johnny depp 
 
from moey 
to mikey 
re wh project 
hey mikey i never liked johnny depp for the part anyway and 
anyway are we sure that it has to be wheres harry 
i mean are we married to the idea of a male serial killer 
brace yourself for some great news 
valerie harpers people say she is and this is a direct quote 
very interested in doing a wheres rhoda approach 
hold on just think about it imagine a female serial killer 
who has a weight problem and a domineering mom gee ma one 
phone call with you and i just want to go out and kill somebody 
laughter 
were checking with nancy walkers people too they sound very 
excited 
please run this past your creative team and get back to me 
 
from moey 
to mikey 
re wheres rhoda 
at last i think weve got a concept here that can really take 
off i knew that you of all people could develop a series that you 
believed in its no wonder youve been a success in this business 
for 30 years with something new and different every year 
youll probably want mark to executive produce it hes very 
comfortable with the format

more than two dozen countries dispatched troops to the middle 
east after saddam hussein invaded kuwait the troops first aim was 
to block a possible assault on saudi arabia but now many wonder 
whether the usled coalition should strike first and if so 
when and under what circumstances 
the associated press put that question to eight people 
including a vietnam veteran the wife of a hostage and two former 
defense department officials here are their answers

they certainly shouldnt wait any longer and i think that the 
object of the attack should be to remove saddam hussein from 
control and neutralize his ability to use weapons of mass 
destruction 
with each passing day the likely costs and degree of difficulty 
of an attack increase thats because saddam hussein is trying to 
make his forces more resilient feverishly trying to bring to bear 
more capable weapons systems if this crisis should result in a 
perpetuation of his power well see those costs increase 
exponentially because then he will have weapons far more dangerous 
than those currently available to him 
meanwhile its unclear how long it will take before the 
sanctions even get his attention saddam hussein is nothing if not 
indifferent to the condition of his people 
in short i think its reasonably clear that neither the iraqi 
people nor the military are going to be sufficiently affected by 
the sanctions between now and the closing of whats called the 
window of opportunity for an attack namely the end of march or 
so 
time is not on our side saddam hussein is playing a waiting 
game and thinks he can succeed at it

i think the best way to proceed is to try to negotiate a 
settlement the first issue that brought us there was the invasion 
of kuwait and thats the primary issue the primary issue is as 
far as im concerned negotiable in terms of the withdrawal of 
iraqi forces 
the escalation has come since we started talking about an 
offensive straight through into iraq im not sure i understand the 
reason for that except saddam hussein is a quote madman and 
in four years theyll have the power to construct a nuclear bomb i 
dont necessarily get the connection between those two facts and an 
incredible amount of blood shed by poor boys from boston 
dorchester and roxbury 
as someone who works with veterans i see that right now the va 
is unable to handle the problems of an aging veteran population or 
the problems of the vietnam generation of veterans issues of agent 
orange and posttraumatic stress disorder and many of the states 
who are sending these national guard units are closing their 
programs for veterans 
in massachusetts you have the case where theyre discussing 
closing the soldiers homes and the outreach centers for 
vietnamgeneration veterans here were sending these guys off to 
war and at the same time were cutting back all the support systems 
for people who have gone through our previous wars that kind of 
inconsistency is something that carries throughout the whole policy 
and what were doing in the persian gulf

i want to know what gives our president the power to decide that 
on a certain date were going to start a war what gives him the 
power in the month of november to say that in january were going 
to start a war 
i think its a horrifying thing to be doing what frightens me 
is that the decision is in the hands of people who are not actively 
involved in all of congress there are only two people who have a 
family member in saudi arabia 
us troops went to saudi arabia to prevent an attack but 
now president bush is leading the pack into war 
everything is being drummed up to keep the flames of war 
brightly lit first we heard about the oil then we heard about 
saddam being an evil aggressor and now were hearing about his 
possible atomic capabilities 
we should be over there in a defensive mode and at this time 
nothing more it should not be an american military offensive as a 
presidential option but as an act of congress and the people 
congress is supposed to represent

we ought to give the sanctions time to work and we should only 
attack if we are provoked by iraq we ought to let saddam hussein 
know we are there until hell freezes over in six months his 
aircraft will run out of spare parts and there will be other parts 
shortages as well so what if it takes us a year or two or three 
it took us 40 years to win the cold war i dont even think we 
should be beefing up our force there id probably get the 
deployment down to 150000 200000 maximum in the area and 
announce a rotation policy for the troops 
if there were a provocation and you did have a war i would bomb 
his military facilities the chemicals the nuclear and his 
munitions factories id cut off his supply lines and i might pick 
out one of his divisions in kuwait and bomb the hell out of it too 
and then say ok now get out or well bomb another division and 
then another

they should not attack history has taught us that when other 
countries tolerate invasion such as japans invasion of china and 
germanys invasion of poland it can lead to world war but now 
with the development of missiles and nuclear weapons the meaning 
of war has changed it may result in the total destruction of 
mankind secondly united nations efforts and international 
economic sanctions have made great progress world opinion can 
end iraqs occupation

a solution through negotiations should get top priority the 
solution should be one that not only solves the problem of iraq 
but also brings about future stability in the middle east an 
attack should be avoided as much as possible and there is no need 
for one now but taking military action may become necessary if 
there is any inhumane treatment of the hostages such as depriving 
them of food or executing them military action should not be 
used for the purpose of forcing iraqi troops to withdraw from 
kuwait

the usled coalition which in fact embraces the united 
nations as a whole practically of course wants to implement and 
has to implement the united nations security councils resolutions 
this is the reason the coalition was founded its iraq which 
has to obey these resolutions and of course it is necessary to 
show an aggressor that there is the entire civilized world against 
him and that there is military power 
they should do their very best to achieve the goals set and 
having this military force in saudi arabia is definitely one of the 
means to get closer to a peaceful solution than the other way 
around

the dilemma of the united states is to know whether one can 
punish aggression without resorting to war the blockade and the 
diplomatic isolation were meant precisely to fulfill that role it 
doesnt seem to be working the worst thing would be to leave 
aggression unpunished at a time when the international system is in 
a period of transition and is setting new rules it would be tragic 
if the example of a state that redraws by force new boundaries by 
annexing a country was left unpunished 
the international system makes punishment of aggression an 
absolute necessity but the regional environment makes the prospect 
of war very bloody and unsettling 
if all political pressures are used and fail leaving the iraqis 
in kuwait that would be the worst scenario even worse than war 
itself im not triggerhappy but i think war may be necessary it 
is a matter of months and in my mind should come before ramadan 
in midmarch

forecasters in the agriculture department 
think 1991 will be a pretty good year for american farmers with 
larger production and with some exceptions fairly steady prices 
but as all economists know when it comes to predicting 
agricultural production and farm income the weather is most 
important 
a year ago for example consumer food prices were expected to 
rise 3 percent to 5 percent in 1990 but hard freezes in december 
and other weatherrelated factors helped push prices up an average 
of nearly 6 percent 
looking at 1991 last weeks annual usda outlook conference was 
told that food prices probably will gain 2 percent to 5 percent 
predictions also are clouded by uncertainties on the nations 
general economic outlook the possibility of war in the persian 
gulf and what that might do to world oil supplies and prices 
however no usda forecast is carved in granite and the 
professionals in the departments economic research service are 
quick to revise projections when conditions change significantly 
james r donald chairman of the departments world agricultural 
outlook board said the current situation points to a year of 
nearrecord incomes for us farmers as larger production and 
higher prices for a few commodities put muscle into the 1991 farm 
economy 
new farm legislation signed into law by president bush last week 
will help boost plantings of some crops as farmers take advantage 
of new flexibility provisions in the program he said 
the net cash income of farmers nationally in 1991 was projected 
at 55 billion to 60 billion compared to the record this year of 
59 billion thats money left over from gross cash receipts after 
paying cash expenses 
some of the commodity highlights as outlined by donald and other 
usda forecasters 
wheat us wheat production in 1991 probably will decline 
substantially because of weak prices higher acreagereduction 
requirements in the federal program and reduced payments allowed 
under the new farm law 
relatively low world prices could also result in smaller foreign 
production although this could be limited by a lack of better 
alternative crops 
rice given normal weather global rice production should 
expand next year forcing prices down further the governments 
marketing loan program which is keyed to world prices should keep 
us rice competitive 
feed grains world trade in corn and other socalled coarse 
grains will slip from the relatively high level of 198990 smaller 
imports by the soviet union mexico japan and several smaller 
users are expected to bring a 10 percent reduction in world coarse 
grain trade us exports led by corn are forecast to drop by 
more than 15 percent 
us corn production probably will increase in 1991 assuming 
yields remain on track 
soybeans world soybean production may decline slightly in 
199091 with reductions in both the united states and south 
america 
domestically soybean supplies are expected to exceed total use 
in 199091 leading to a further buildup in inventories at the end 
of the season prices probably will average near 198990 levels as 
stocks build 
additionally prospective larger plantings in 1991 may act to 
restrain prices later in the year 
cotton there will be a continuing close balance between 
global cotton production and consumption with leftover inventories 
at the end of 199091 at the lowest level in a decade 
the us situation for 199091 indicates relatively strong 
demand and extremely tight stocks the early season outlook for 
next season points to larger production and a rebuilding of 
stockpiles in 199192 
looking at livestock and poultry analysts said the world output 
of animal products probably will increase by slightly more than 2 
percent in 1991 following a rise of less than 1 percent in 1990 
total meat production in the united states in 1991 is expected 
to increase over 3 percent from this years record large output 
donald told the conference increases in beef pork and broilers 
are expected 
the us cattle inventory last jan 1 was 993 million head up 
only 02 percent from the jan 1 1989 level he said a small 
increase in the 1991 inventory is probable 
pork production is down about 3 percent this year and an 
increase of about 3 percent is anticipated for 1991 he said 
producers have had good returns for over a year and the response 
to these returns shows more restraint than in the past 
broiler production is gaining about 6 percent this year and 
prices have slumped from the relatively high levels of 1989 
production is expected to increase again in 1991 but at a slightly 
slower pace 
dairy farmers have boosted milk production and further gains 
are expected in 1991 donald said milk prices will be down from a 
year earlier

toyotas decision to nearly double us 
production of camry cars and increase the amount of americanmade 
parts it uses makes good political and financial sense analysts 
say 
toyota announced tuesday it will spend 800 million to boost its 
production of camry models in scott county ky and add 1500 
jobs 
company officials also said the domestic content of the 
camrys is now at 65 percent and will meet the goal of 75 percent by 
1991 
its in their interest as well as our interest said charles 
brady an auto industry analyst with oppenheimer amp co in new york 
he said the company decreases its exposure to the volatile foreign 
exchange market by building cars in the country where they are 
sold 
also toyota has found it is cheaper to build cars here than ship 
them from japan said david healy an analyst with barclays de 
zoete wedd in new york 
theres certainly nothing politically wrong with that 
either healy said 
toyota expects to build 217000 camry models in scott county 
this year the expansion will have the capacity to produce another 
200000 the company already has 3450 workers and an investment of 
12 billion in the camry assembly and engine production 
operations 
the expansion is an indication of the strong american appetite 
for toyota cars and furthers the companys desire to grab an even 
larger chunk of the us market said bob mccurry executive vice 
president for sales in north america 
us sales of toyota cars and light trucks in 1990 numbered 119 
million through oct 31 up 31 percent from the same period last 
year industry figures show the companys goal is to increase 
sales to 15 million annually by the middle of the decade 
by comparison the big three us automakers general motors 
corp ford motor co and chrysler corp sold 83 million cars 
and light trucks through oct 31 a 69 percent drop 
the increasing american content of toyota vehicles is reflected 
in purchases of us parts and supplies which were 70 million a 
few years ago but should grow to 720 million this year said alex 
warren senior vice president of toyota motor manufacturing usa 
with production capacity doubled potential purchases of domestic 
supplies will increase by a like amount warren added 
warren said he expects the construction contract for the 37 
million squarefoot addition would go to a us company 
toyotas selection of a japanese general contractor for its 
original plant caused some discontent in the construction field as 
well as union ill will 
toyota will not sell all of the georgetown camrys in this 
country 
fujio cho president and chief executive officer of toyota motor 
manufacturing said the company already exports some camry models 
to taiwan and will soon begin production of righthanddrive models 
for export to japan some 40000 of those models and up to 100000 
engines produced in georgetown will be shipped to japan 
keneyoshi kusunoki chairman of toyotas north american 
operations said the company could expand its engine production at 
georgetown if quality and demand remain high 
toyota is now using about 500 acres of the 1300 acres provided 
by the state along interstate 75 just north of georgetown 
officials said there will probably be room for further expansion 
even after the new camry line is added 
kusunoki said the location of the scott county plant to 
suppliers and markets was an important factor in the decision to 
add to the site he said there were 10 states competing for the 
plant though he declined to identify them 
toyota officials were also unanimous in their praise of the work 
force in scott county 
it is truly a tribute to each and every team member that we 
have had warren said 
toyota did not seek state incentives for the expansion a marked 
difference from the 135 million package offered to lure the 
automaker 
we have gotten all of the support from kentucky that we 
need warren said today is the day were able to give back and 
provide a return for that investment 
during his 1987 campaign gov wallace wilkinson produced a 
television commercial claiming the state paid far too much for the 
plant and saying the state had become a laughingstock from 
tennessee to tokyo 
wilkinson refused tuesday to say whether he had reconsidered 
that opinion

prices auto companies have avoided excess inventories in 1990

civil charges against a key michael milken 
associate describe widespread lawbreaking but defense lawyers 
criticized the government for airing the case at a time when the 
convicted financier has no recourse 
former money manager david a solomon on tuesday agreed to pay 
79 million to settle securities and exchange commission charges 
of insider trading income tax fraud and other violations directly 
involving milken 
some of the claims in the civil complaint were central to the 
guilty plea of milken the oncepowerful drexel burnham lambert 
inc executive who was sentenced last week to 10 years in prison 
the complaint against solomon alleges a pattern of fraudulent 
activity with milken including allegations milken never was 
charged with and others his defense lawyers repeatedly denied 
three of the six felony counts to which milken pleaded guilty 
involved solomon but milken did not admit to insider trading and 
us district judge kimba wood ruled that prosecutors failed during 
a presentencing hearing for milken to prove he committed the 
violation 
michael armstrong an attorney for milkens brother lowell who 
was named in connection with two allegations against solomon 
criticized the government for levying charges when the milkens 
cant respond 
if solomon had anything to say why didnt the government allow 
him to testify in the presentencing hearing where he could have 
been crossexamined armstrong said its trial by press 
release 
through a spokesman lawyers for milken declined to comment 
sec assistant enforcement director james coffman said the agency 
included information we deem necessary in order to make the 
complaint understandable we believe everything weve done is 
consistent with all standards of fairness 
solomon was granted immunity from criminal prosecution in 
exchange for providing information against milken he settled the 
sec charges without admitting or denying guilt 
under the settlement solomon agreed to return 73 million in 
alleged illegal profits 588870 for insider trading and about 
67 million for other violations the money is to be placed into 
two funds to compensate wronged investors solomon also must pay 
661674 in civil insider trading penalties 
the 46yearold former head of solomon asset management inc was 
one of milkens biggest buyers of risky and often lucrative 
highyield bonds and the two had a relationship dating to the 
early 1970s 
solomon agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in october 1989 
his testimony gave the government information that elevated the 
case against milken beyond limited charges leveled by convicted 
speculator ivan boesky 
the sec alleged that solomon investment advisory clients and 
drexel investment banking clients were defrauded from at least 1983 
through 1986 
the complaint alleges that solomon personally gained from deals 
through confidential information supplied by milken or other drexel 
employees on transactions in which drexel was involved 
sec chief litigation counsel thomas newkirk said the charges 
show how drexel and milken and those who worked with them in 
their wrongdoing were scratching each others backs and lining each 
others pockets 
but individuals close to milkens defense noted that most of the 
charges were not included in the governments presentencing memo 
against milken which listed numerous additional allegations of 
criminal wrongdoing they minimized the charges saying the us 
attorneys office must have considered them too weak to bring 
against milken 
among the allegations 
insider trading in the securities of drexel clients tiger 
international inc lorimar inc and republic airlines inc the sec 
alleged that milken passed on information about pending deals to 
solomon 
the lorimar charge was included in the governments 
presentencing memo the tiger international and republic charges 
were said to be part of an expanded indictment of milken made moot 
by his decision to plead guilty 
fraud in the 1984 sale of charter co bonds owned by a solomon 
client the sec claimed milken via drexel agreed to purchase the 
bonds to help the client avoid losses solomon in return agreed to 
reimburse drexel for 250000 in losses through other transactions 
the sec claimed 
fraud in a series of transactions by solomon to pay back 
drexel the sec claimed that solomon took certain concessions from 
securities transactions that belonged to investment advisory 
clients 
solomon also allegedly adjusted the prices of securities bought 
from or sold to drexel to repay his debt to drexel making clients 
pay more or receive less than they should have 
prearranged transactions with milken to create phony losses to 
help solomon evade personal income taxes in 1983 and 1985 that 
charge was included in the milken plea

program at northwestern university 
only three of the seven major hollywood studios remain 
domestically owned walt disney studios warner bros and 
paramount 
radnor pointed out that the united states is far more tolerant 
of foreign ownership of cultural treasures than france or many 
other countries over the years australias news corp has 
purchased 20th century fox japans sony corp bought columbia and 
italiancontrolled pathe communications bought mgmua 
still theres an argument that we have to be careful who 
controls the organs of mass communications radnor said 
if a guy wants to make a very critical movie of hirohito does 
it make it tougher now that two of the biggest companies are not in 
us hands he asked 
perhaps but radnor and other observers said they believe the 
profit motive will prevail after all foreigners are buying 
american studios precisely because no other countrys entertainment 
is so popular worldwide 
companies like sony and matsushita are unlikely to try to censor 
us entertainment said barbara pfeiffer a senior associate at 
ulmer bros investment bank which specializes in mergers of 
american and japanese companies 
we all grow up with the movies as our best friend weve been 
in front of the tv and thats the baby sitter and prior to that it 
was the darkened movie house and news reels its such a 
traditional american pastime that its understandable that there 
are fears she said 
but when you get down to it this is a moneymaking enterprise 
and the old saying is if it aint broke dont fix it ms 
pfeiffer said 
steven spielberg will still be making steven spielberg films 
he wont be making steven spielberg goes to japan 
at a news conference monday in japan matsushita president akio 
tanii was asked if he would object to mca making a 
japanbashing film or one critical of the late emperor 
hirohitos role in world war ii 
something like that shouldnt emerge said tanii looking 
agitated mca executives will have the proper judgment with 
regards to the social impact filmmakers must create films that are 
inspirational that will be enjoyable for everybody i cant even 
imagine a case like that 
david geffen whose record company was bought for mca stock that 
brought more than 700on in the matsushita deal said those 
who worry about japanese influence on hollywood are showing 
latent racism 
few people worry about swiss or british ownership of domestic 
companies he said nor are questions raised about whether say 
paramount chairman frank mancuso would shy away from a movie that 
might offend catholics because of his religion geffen said 
more likely than films being censored said ms pfeiffer is 
that more movies tailored to foreign audiences be they british or 
japanese will be produced in addition to material aimed at 
traditional us audiences 
i think were looking at expansion not change she said 
examples of that are as near as movie theaters showing the film 
reversal of fortune about the socialite claus von bulow who was 
accused of trying to kill his wife sunny a topic more morbid 
than general studio fare 
the major us studios turned down the movie when independent 
producer ed pressman brought it to them he instead approached 
shochiku co a japanese film distributor that wanted to back 
another project of his the cyberpunk sciencefiction movie 
called new rose hotel set in japan 
pressman offered to produce both shochiku agreed and warner 
bros is now providing domestic distribution for reversal of 
fortune which is a modest success in limited release this fall 
it shows a breadth of interest in japanese investment which 
would be very healthy for the film industry pressman said 
japan is a longstanding film community with entities that have 
been in existence as long as warner bros and mgm and respect that 
goes beyond the bottom line 
he noted that sonys video arm helped finance another unusual 
project the critically acclaimed to sleep with anger with an 
allblack cast starring danny glover 
the longterm investment strategies plentiful cash and advanced 
technology of the japanese may have the strongest effects on 
technical innovations 
harley neuman a senior manager with the deloitte amp touche 
accounting firms entertainment group noted that us companies 
have often opposed technologies that prove to be huge moneymakers 
for them like vcrs 
the joint ownership of hardware and the entertainment 
program software to be displayed on it will hasten the 
introduction of new consumer electronics like digital audiotape and 
recordable compact discs he said 
why were there no other bidders for a company as successful and 
established as mca 
neuman said that while us lending sources have dried up 
financing from japanese banks is still available for companies as 
big and cash heavy as matsushita 
for that matter matsushita could virtually write a check for 
65 billion how many companies in the world could do that 
neuman asked 
and japanese investors are more willing to tolerate the 
hitthisyear bombthenext nature of the entertainment business 
he said 
the us shareholder is looking for results every quarter 
neuman said the japanese are much longer thinkers as a result 
theyre willing to take their lumps in the short term 
mcas movie chief tom pollock said matsushitas longterm 
attitude is a blessing 
he said hell be able to undertake bigger and better projects 
now given the japanese tendency to invest for the long term 
to not have to worry about whats happening this quarter is a 
great luxury he said

mcdonalds corp is shifting part of its mammoth 
advertising account from leo burnett co to ddb needham which 
handled the fastfood giants national account until 1981 
mcdonalds in the midst of a sales slowdown in the united 
states said tuesday that needham would handle various promotions 
and ads for young adults teens and preteens 
about onesixth of the burnett account was reassigned to 
needham a new yorkbased omnicom group agency mcdonalds said 
industry experts said that could mean as much as 55 million in new 
ad billings for needham 
mcdonalds national ad account estimated at 300 million has 
most recently been handled entirely by burnett 
the oak brookbased mcdonalds said it was making the move 
because of the growth of our business over the years as well as 
the increasing demands and workload 
its a matter of work load said chuck rubner a spokesman 
for mcdonalds the account has really grown over the last 10 
years 
burnett has created mcdonalds good times great taste and 
food folks amp fun campaigns 
burnett chairman hall adams said the loss was an occupational 
hazard but added we dont like losing any assignment 
some industry analysts have criticized the burnett food folks 
amp fun campaign as lacking the punch of earlier campaigns such as 
the you deserve a break today campaign devised by needham 
nearly 20 years ago 
since losing the national account in 1981 needham had served as 
a local agency for mcdonalds in several us cities

nearly half of japans hardworking salaried 
employees are afraid their jobs will drive them to early deaths a 
survey reported today found 
the fukoku life insurance co conducted the survey in october 
among 500 employees with more than 15 years at the same companies 
in metropolitan tokyo 
its results indicated that the fabled workaholicism of japanese 
whitecollar employees takes its toll many dread and fear their 
jobs 
these people with no interest in their job and relationship 
seem to drag themselves to work every day the survey researchers 
concluded 
the poll revealed a strong fear of karoshi death from 
overwork researchers have said the number of such deaths among 
married japanese businessmen is growing at an alarming rate 
dr kiyoyasu arikawa who advises executives how to reduce their 
risk said the number of karoshi grew from 10 in 1969 to about 150 
in 1987 
the labor ministry received 777 applications for compensation 
because of sudden death at work up from about 500 requests 
three years ago researchers believe many such cases are actually 
karoshi 
about 70 percent of the respondents in the survey said they feel 
stressed 444 percent feel constant fatigue 28 percent 
have no creativity and motivation and 233 percent feel a 
frequent desire to call in sick 
asked whether they feared death by overwork 428 percent said 
yes 
fierce competition among employees as well as a strong sense of 
responsibility to their companies lead many workers to stay at the 
office well into the night and refuse to take all their vacation 
time 
nearly twothirds of respondents to the survey take less than 10 
days of vacation a year 
although japanese employees are said to have a strong sense of 
company loyalty three out of 10 respondents said 15 years with the 
same firm was a long time 
more than 60 percent said they have no excitement or incentives 
on the job and another 566 percent said their relationship with 
their bosses and colleagues was bothersome 
to ease workrelated fatigue 853 percent of respondents said 
they just want to sleep more 
the poll did not give a margin of error japanese pollsters do 
not calculate such margins claiming that publication of a precise 
margin of error might mislead readers into thinking a poll is more 
accurate than it really is

the us economy grew at a 17 percent annual 
rate in the third quarter a bit less than previously thought the 
government reported today and federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan said there had been a meaningful downturn in the 
nations economic output 
the commerce department said its downward revision in the gross 
national product showed the economy advanced even more slowly from 
july through september than the 18 percent first reported last 
month 
the gnp is the nations total output of goods and services and 
its broadest measure of economic activity 
greenspan who has been cautious in describing the economy told 
congress the oil shock resulting from the iraqi occupation of 
kuwait and a credit shortage have brought about further weakness 
all indications are that a meaningful downturn in aggregate 
output occurred as we moved through october into november 
greenspan told the house banking committee 
the central bank chief said oil prices which have risen from 
20 a barrel before the iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 to 33 
now are cutting into the spending power of both businesses and 
consumers 
greenspan also said the socalled credit crunch which he 
first publicly noted in july has proceeded somewhat further 
he said anecdotal information clearly suggests that many types of 
businesses are encountering greater difficulty obtaining 
financing 
recent surveys of professional economic forecasters show that 
most believe the economy has tumbled into a recession informally 
defined as two consecutive declines in the gnp for many the 
question is when it began 
some analysts contend most of the thirdquarter growth was 
concentrated in the first part of the period and was tapering off 
at the end after iraq stormed kuwait on aug 2 and the subsequent 
oilprice shock to the economy 
even president bush and his chief economic adviser michael 
boskin have said publicly the economy has weakened in recent 
months bush calls it a slowdown boskin says it is a lull 
the department also reported that a gnp measure of inflation 
rose even more than previously thought at an annual rate of 42 
percent it first was reported to have risen 41 percent after a 
39 percent gain in the second quarter inflation advanced at a 64 
percent rate in the first quarter 
at the same time it said aftertax profits earned by american 
corporations jumped 67 percent during the third quarter 
corporate profits dropped 06 percent in the second quarter 
erasing a 05 percent gain in the first 
in another report the department said orders to us factories 
for bigticket durable goods rebounded 36 percent in october 
driven by a 148 percent jump in transportation orders 
it reported that orders for durable goods bigticket items 
expected to last more than three years totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 1294 billion following declines of 16 percent in 
september and 09 percent in august 
leading the downward revision in the gnp was a 32 percent gain 
in consumer spending down from the 36 percent advance first 
reported 
at the same time inventories declined 44 billion rather than 
the 17 billion in the initial report 
housing construction was off 192 percent instead of 154 
percent while government spending rose just 06 percent rather than 
the 13 percent gain first reported 
on the other hand business investment was up 82 percent 
instead of 74 percent in the initial report while the trade 
deficit narrowed to 500 million rather than the 79 billion 
reported last month 
each quarters gnp is revised twice as more complete data 
becomes available the final revision in the thirdquarter report 
is due next month 
the changes meant the total gnp the broadest measure of the 
nations economic activity was growing at an annual rate of 417 
trillion in the third quarter when adjusted for inflation that 
was a gain of 180 billion over the second quarter 
despite the thirdquarter growth many economists believe the 
recession began during the period if not before 
elliott platt an economist with donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
securities dealers in new york notes that the us economy has 
experienced growth during the first quarter of five of the eight 
recessions since world war ii 
thus he says the 17 percent growth rate in the third quarter 
does not preclude the possibility that the recession began during 
that quarter 
the gnp expanded at a 17 percent rate during the first quarter 
then fell to a barely perceptible 04 percent rate in the second 
it had grown 25 percent in 1989 after a 45 percent increase a 
year earlier 
if the economy is in a recession it has concluded an expansion 
that would have been eight years old this month the last recession 
ended in november 1982 after 16 months of decline 
many economists believe a current recession would be 
shortlived with the economy posting negative growth in this 
quarter and next before resuming its expansion in the second 
quarter of 1991

city planners fishing for new sources of revenue 
are riding a wave of fascination with life under the sea 
in recent years nearly 30 american cities have built a new 
aquarium are planning one or are renovating aging facilities the 
hope is to hook the imagination of a generation jolted by polluted 
beaches and awestruck by the rescue of whales 
todays aquariums utilize the latest innovations in acrylics to 
build clear tank walls sometimes several stories high marine 
research has helped create nearly perfect replicas of watery 
habitat 
it all makes for a good show but aquarium directors say their 
aim is not just to entertain 
the thing that is driving all this interest in aquariums in 
the general public is a growing awareness that the aquatic world is 
very important said paul boyle director of programs and 
exhibits at the 21yearold new england aquarium which is planning 
a move to a 150 million facility in the charlestown section of the 
city 
the payoff can be substantial new england aquarium officials 
say the facilitys 12 million annual visitors have a direct annual 
economic impact of 170 million to the city 
the boston aquariums expansion reflects a growing worldwide 
fascination with life under the sea even in japan where whales 
are still seen as a source of meat a major aquarium opened in 
july in osaka 
the number of aquariums under construction or being planned 
is really significant it seems to have blossomed in the last five 
or six years said roger kolsek curator of fishes for the shedd 
aquarium in chicago 
from 1980 to 1987 attendance at american and canadian aquariums 
increased by nearly 50 percent from 7968000 to 11944000 
according to the american association of zoological parks and 
aquariums 
in early september the 42 million aquarium of the americas 
opened in new orleans more than 10000 people toured the facility 
on its first day 
the texas state aquarium which opened in july in corpus 
christi is the first to focus on life in the gulf of mexico and 
the caribbean aquariums are also planned in san antonio texas 
tampa fla camden nj and the canadian cities of ottawa and 
toronto boyle said 
expansions are planned for the monterey bay aquarium which 
opened just five years ago baltimores natoonal aquarium which 
debuted in 1981 and the shedd aquarium in chicago one of the 
oldest that has been open since 1929 
city officials hope these aquariums can be used to both draw 
tourist dollars and function as educational institutions 
i guess you could say that in new england baltimore monterey 
and now in new orleans its proved to be an attractive asset both 
physically and economically said bill flynn president of the 
tennessee aquarium a new facility being billed as the countrys 
only major freshwater aquarium it will be built in chattanooga in 
1992 
with more than a million visitors a year the new england 
aquarium in boston already is overcrowded boyle said the new 
facility to be completed in 1996 will include a 45million 
gallon whale and dolphin tank with a pedestrian concourses 
surrounded by water expanded marine research facilities and new 
exhibits 
but the dawning of the age of aquariums is not without limits 
norwalk conn officials hoped a 30 million waterfront complex 
including an aquarium cinema and maritime museum that opened 
in july of 1988 would continue the revitalization of that rundown 
area but attendance and revenue figures were half of what was 
projected leading norwalk city officials to order a management 
shakeup and budget cuts the city eventually had to jump in with 4 
million to pay for advertising operating expenses and bond debt

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan all 
but declaring the nation in a recession said today that 
skyrocketing oil prices and a growing shortage of credit have 
substantially weakened the economy 
all indications are that a meaningful downturn in aggregate 
output occurred as we moved through october into november 
greenspan told the house banking committee 
in response to a question from rep charles schumer greenspan 
said it was too soon to determine whether the country was 
experiencing a recession but he conceded that economic growth as 
measured by the gross national product probably would turn 
negative in the octoberdecember quarter 
this seems to me to be a nice way of saying weve entered a 
recession said schumer dny 
the central bank chief said oil prices which have risen from 
20 a barrel before the iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 to 33 
now are cutting into the spending power of both businesses and 
consumers 
he said the clearest manifestation of the oil shock is in the 
labor market where private employment and hours of work dropped 
markedly in october 
the drop in employment and hours is causing personal income to 
decline at the very time that rising energy prices are squeezing 
many household budgets this drop in real purchasing power along 
with plunging consumer sentiment does not bode well for the 
nearterm trends in consumer demand he said 
although world oil supplies have rebounded to what greenspan 
described as comfortable levels he said uncertainty about what 
will happen in the persian gulf is keeping the price of oil high 
and is causing consumers and businesses to hold off on purchases in 
general 
greenspan also said the socalled credit crunch which he 
first publicly noted in july has proceeded somewhat further 
the available anecdotal information clearly suggests that many 
types of businesses are encountering greater difficulty obtaining 
financing he said 
the central bank chairman confirmed that the fed has moved in 
recent weeks to cut interest rates in an effort to stimulate the 
economy 
and he said i can only offer the assurance that the federal 
reserve will seek as we have in the past to foster economic 
stability and sustainable growth 
however he cautioned there is no policy initiative that can 
in the end prevent the transfer of wealth and cut in our standard 
of living that stems from higher prices for imported oil 
the government reported today that the us economy grew at a 
17 percent annual rate in the third quarter a bit less than 
previously thought the commerce department said its revision in 
the gross national product showed the economy advanced even more 
slowly from july through september than the 18 percent first 
reported last month 
some analysts contend most of the thirdquarter growth was 
concentrated in the first part of the period and was tapering off 
at the end after iraq stormed kuwait on aug 2 and the subsequent 
oilprice shock to the economy 
thus far greenspan has been cautious in describing the state of 
the economy even though the fed cut interest rates twice this 
month 
but even president bush and his chief economic adviser michael 
boskin have said publicly the economy has weakened in recent 
months bush calls it a slowdown boskin says it is a lull 
a recession defined as at least a sixmonth contraction of 
economic output as measured by the gross national product is 
political poison that is why politicians generally avoid the term 
most private economists say the nation has already toppled into 
one 
recession is here the national association of business 
economists declared tuesday after polling 51 professional 
forecasters and finding threequarters of them believe the downturn 
has already begun 
in a congressional appearance in midseptember greenspan said 
the jump in oil prices following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
had increased the threat of both higher inflation and a recession 
he warned then of new and substantial risks to the economy 
the central banks actions since then show that it has clearly 
been more concerned about the recession risk than the inflation 
risk it cut the federal funds rate a key interestrate measure 
twice this month each time by a quarter point the rate now at 7 
percent is what banks charge each other for overnight loans 
the central banks strategy is to raise the rate to dampen 
inflationary pressures and to cut it when the economy needs a 
boost

pork producers and meatpackers asked the 
us government wendesday to impose retaliatory trade sanctions on 
the european community for its bans on us meat shipments 
the complaint was filed with us trade representative carla 
hills by the national pork producers council and the american meat 
institute 
retaliatory steps could include a ban on 250 million in ec meat 
shipments to the united states 
our petition is designed to get the ec to open its market 
not to close ours said mike wehler a farmer from plain wis 
who heads the pork council 
wehler said the application for sanctions will get the clock 
ticking on a timetable for reprisals in case negotiations fail to 
resolve the dispute 
the us pork industry has used great restraint so that the ec 
and us negotiators could eliminate this artificial trade barrier 
through consultations with the us trade representatives 
office wehler said however the ec has shown no willingness 
to use scientific standards as the guide for meat trade between our 
countries therefore we are requesting formal action against the 
ec because us pork producers refuse to stand by idly while the ec 
runs amok with unfair trade barriers against our product 
the pork group said the trade representative has 45 days to 
decide whether to accept the petition if accepted the united 
states may then seek sanctions from the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade an international trade organization or act 
alone in imposing restrictions on ec exports 
as of nov 1 the ec had stopped imports of pork tongues 
hearts livers and kidneys on grounds that plants producing the 
meats had failed to meet ec sanitary standards the 12nation group 
also has banned imports of beef from animals given hormones and 
will ban all us beef as of dec 31 
pork producers and meatpackers deny any health problems exist 
they say twothirds of the meat consumed in the ec does not meet 
such standards and call the ec action a blatant artificial trade 
barrier 
gene leman an executive at meatpacking giant ibp inc said the 
ban is costing the pork trade 40 million to 45 million a year 
even though it only affects 13 million in pork exports with fewer 
variety cuts being shipped abroad domestic prices are plunging he 
said

once considered river trash the 
whiskered catfish is turning up in avantgarde restaurants and on 
fastfood menus from coast to coast 
i eat in a lot of places around this country many of them 
now have catfish on the menu says craig claiborne cookbook 
author and retired new york times food editor 
last year sales of farmraised catfish ranked the variety as 
one of the nations top five seafoods behind only tuna shrimp 
cod and alaska pollock 
but despite its rising popularity the boon predicted for the 
aquaculture industry in the 1960s hasnt fully come to pass 
the pie is getting larger but the pieces are getting 
smaller said roger barlow catfish marketing director for the 
mississippi department of agriculture 
nutritional value and the consistent taste brought by 
highprotein feed allowed the catfish industry to grow 
dramatically but that growth also brought more competition 
especially in processing barlow said 
catfish farmers also are facing rising costs labor demands and 
softening sales 
catfish farming started in mississippi in 1966 with 40 acres 
now the industry is the states fourth leading agricultural crop 
contributing more than 300 million to the state economy in 1989 
many farmers in the mississippi delta region switched to catfish 
in the early 1980s because the traditional agriculture industry was 
slumping aquaculture allowed them to use their land and skills and 
brought new economic strength to the state 
the new industry also provided thousands of new jobs for 
unskilled and semiskilled workers idled when machinery replaced 
many jobs throughout the delta region 
the states catfish industry now employs more than 6000 people 
with an annual payroll of more than 76 million according to the 
catfish institute in belzoni which is located in humphreys county 
the catfish capital of the world 
this year catfish operations in the state will raise harvest 
and process more than 380 million pounds of fresh catfish 
the fish is processed by 25 to 30 companies most of which are 
in the state including the nations largest two 
but a glut in processing forced four processing plants to close 
in 198990 and many processors say they are pinched by higher 
prices they pay to farmers 
about 85 percent of the catfish supplied to processors in 
mississippi is produced by members of the catfish bargaining 
association which fixes selling prices for processors processors 
are paying farmers 80 cents a pound this year compared to 71 or 72 
cents last year 
some processors say this years price is about 10 cents too 
high 
the nations secondlargest processor isolabased country 
skillet catfish co has even threatened to expand into farming 
unless it can secure lower prices from farmers 
if were faced with no option well start farming said 
dick stevens country skillets president we cant afford to buy 
fish at what prices are today we have to buy raw materials 
relevant to market prices 
country skillets retail sales and sales of live fish are 
slowing because of the higher prices stevens said 
i guess the farmers wanted to make a sackful of money he 
said instead of creating a good situation farmers have created 
a nightmare 
country skillet which is owned by food processing giant conagra 
inc of omaha neb is among the major catfish processors in the 
delta region rebelling against efforts by farmers to control the 
price of whole fish 
but many processors are cooperatives of catfish growers who 
benefit from higher base prices 
delta pride catfish inc of indianola the nations largest 
catfish processor is owned by a 180member farmer cooperative 
and it supports fixed prices 
that hasnt stopped workers from the united food and commercial 
workers unions from going on strike at two delta pride plants 
the workers walked out sept 12 after turning down a contract 
proposal offering a 48 percent average wage increase in the first 
year and pay increases averaging 35 to 90 cents per hour over the 
remaining two years of the pact 
the workers many of whom are unskilled or semiskilled black 
women say the raises are not enough negotiations are to resume 
dec 12 
the increased demand for catfish due no doubt to its more 
refined taste and image is one of the best safeguards that the 
industry will survive barlow said 
in years past the fishytasting river variety of catfish were 
caught with a cane pole with worm bait they were cleaned rolled 
in cornmeal and deepfried and usually served with hush puppies 
small fried balls of cornmeal dough 
now consumers can buy pondfed catfish in grocery stores as 
whole dressed fish steaks filets strips and nuggets recipes 
offer ways to poach barbecue broil smoke stirfry fry bake 
steam braise stew blacken saute or grill dishes 
french chefs ive talked with are fond of both the flavor and 
texture of pondraised catfish claiborne said

italys auto giant fiat looking ahead to a 
recovery in world markets in 1993 and beyond announced wednesday 
it will build two new production plants in southern italy 
the plan unveiled by fiat chairman giovanni agnelli to premier 
giulio andreotti will require an investment of 5 trillion lire or 
about 45 billion over the next three years and will create 8300 
new jobs in the economically depressed south 
one plant designed to produce 1800 cars a day will be built 
in the basilicata region this factory will employ some 7000 
people and will be about equal in size to fiats highly automated 
plant in cassino near rome 
fiat also plans to expand and remodel an existing car components 
factory near avellino in the campania region into a plant 
producing 3600 engines a day and employing around 1300 people 
construction will be completed by the end of 1993 or the 
beginning of 1994 a fiat spokesman said 
the announcement of the plans coincided with a slump in the 
italian and european car markets which forced fiat to temporarily 
layoff 70000 workers earlier this month to cut its 
overproduction 
a fiat spokesman said wednesday that fiat geotech spa which 
makes farming and other equipment would briefly lay off 2000 
workers in the next few months due to poor market conditions 
fiat has said it expects the market slump to last through 1992 
but that demand is expected to pick up again in 1993 and beyond 
fiat officials said the italian group must be ready to operate 
in conditions of absolute competitiveness with the major auto 
makers including the japanese 
fiats automobile production totaled 22 million in 1989 and is 
expected to settle at about 2 million this year 
unions hailed the project of the turinbased group italys 
largest private sector industrial conglomerate fiat is controlled 
by the agnelli family

it can best be reorganized to improve efficiency and cut costs 
where its needed marshall said he said employees who lose 
their jobs are being offered a severance package and counseling on 
seeking a new job 
he said the layoffs would affect the companys cherry hill 
headquarters and a pennsauken facility as well as regional offices 
across the nation about 60 percent of subarus work force is in 
new jersey

industries ltd of japan which builds the cars sold under the

the european communitys commission on 
wednesday proposed changing the ecs fishing policy to halt 
overfishing that it said has virtually wiped out major species 
in ec waters 
in a report to the 12 member states ec fisheries commissioner 
manuel marin called for a 40 percent cut in fishing capacity 
fishing bans to let stocks renew themselves and tougher enforcement 
of fishing quotas 
he told reporters too many fishing boats and lax enforcement of 
fishing quotas by the ec governments have undermined the goal set 
in 1983 of maintaining fish stocks 
there is not a proper monitoring of fish quotas it is one 
area where the member states have to accept that we take a 
different approach he said 
marins proposal is bound to run into opposition from the ec 
states which under pressure from national industries that provide 
work for an estimated 2 million people have long resisted deep 
cuts in capacity 
marin said in the north atlantic the north sea and the baltic 
sea years of overfishing had put stocks of haddock cod sprat and 
herring in danger of extinction 
but he said refoms could help maintain the industry 
the ec is the worlds fourth largest fishing power after japan 
the soviet union and china 
in 1987 the last year for which complete figures are available 
its output was 7 million metric tons about 75 percent of world 
production 
to soften the blow to the industry of capacity cuts marin said 
the ec states should consider paying fishermen for not fishing and 
to impose annual fishing bans of several months to generate a 
replenishment of stocks 
he cited a british law that keeps scottish fishermen ashore for 
10 days each month it would not be absurd for the community to 
cofinance the 10 days not actually spent fishing marin said 
his report on the state of the ec fishing sector and the 
proposed overhaul of the fishing policy was drafted by independent 
experts 
but it is likely to upset the ec states that have long debated 
quotas types of fishing nets and other conservation methods

during 50 years in hollywood lew 
wasserman made thousands of deals from raising ronald reagans 
salary to improving joan crawfords dressing room 
yet his biggest deal came last week the 66 billion sale of 
mca inc to the japanese electronics giant matsushita electric 
industrial co 
hollywoods premiere dealmaker took an active part in the four 
months of behindthescenes negotiations during which rumors of a 
collapse circulated then on monday an agreement was announced 
after a few comments to the press wasserman returned to the 
relative anonymity that he has maintained throughout his career 
he has said little about his future plans although matsushita 
promised to keep current mca management in place wasserman stands 
to reap more than 350 million in cash and stock from the takeover 
the wasserman success story is so clicheridden that his own 
scriptwriters would be embarrassed to write it born march 15 
1913 in cleveland he started work at 12 hawking candy in a 
burlesque house during high school he ushered in a movie house 
acquiring his lifelong habit of getting by on five hours of sleep 
nightly 
at 21 he became vice president for advertising and promotion at 
a theaterrestaurant the mayfair casino a newspaperman introduced 
wasserman to a darkhaired beauty who clerked for the may co 
edith beckerman he offered her two passes to the nightclub 
i leaped at the offer because he was a very attractive man 
the woman who would become edie wasserman recalled later i paid 
more attention to lew than the show after that i chased him for a 
year until he caught me 
through the night club wasserman met jules stein who supplied 
bigname bands through his talent agency music corporation of 
america stein a former chicago eye doctor who had become 
intrigued by show business offered the young man a job as national 
advertising director of mca at 60 a week 
the job has a great future he told edie 
what so great about it she asked 
stein is an old man hes 40 
in the 1930s the visionary stein sought to broaden mca by 
invading hollywood where big money could be made in movies and 
radio stein and wasserman brought a new image to the hollywood 
agent who was stigmatized as a cigarchomping loudmouth in a 
checkered suit mca agents were wellspoken and dressed in tailored 
grey 
they also were tough 
during one of his rare interviews wasserman was asked about his 
reputation as a hard ruthless man his reply 
if negotiating in an attempt to arrive at a favorable deal 
comes under the heading of being hard i would stipulate that im 
hard actually i dont think the word ruthless fits our time 
it is outmoded its a carryover from robber baron days 
in 1946 stein became chairman of mca and named wasserman 33 
his successor as president wasserman virtually invented the 
package deal selling movie contracts that included script stars 
producer and director all mca clients 
the postwar years were cataclysmic for hollywood television 
would eventually cut movie attendance in half and wipe out network 
radio wasserman was determined that mca would get its share of the 
new medium 
revue productions was founded to supply the need for a huge 
amount of entertainment to fill the nations television screens 
series like wagon train m squad and highway patrol 
were ground out on tight budgets often with overthehill mca 
clients 
by the late 1950s the oldtime hollywood studios were plagued by 
empty stages and shuttering theaters none was in worse shape than 
universal which had undergone a series of ownerships stein and 
wasserman made their move 
in 1959 mca bought universal studios paying 113 million for 
the prime property in the hills just north of hollywood the 
justice department decreed that mca would have to leave the agency 
business if it owned a studio no problem the beverly hills agency 
was closed and steins collection of antique english furniture 
moved to universal city 
from his penthouse office in the studios black tower wasserman 
commanded the evergrowing mca empire unlike harry cohn jack 
warner and darryl zanuck of the previous era wasserman did not 
meddle daily in creative matters he preferred to direct overall 
policy leaving the nittygritty of filmmaking to executives and 
producers im just a paperpusher he claimed 
his influence extended far beyond the studio boundaries from 
john kennedy to george bush wasserman has had a personal 
relationship with us presidents as well as leading members of 
congress thus he has been able to influence legislation and agency 
policy affecting the film industry 
wasserman also earned a reputation as hollywoods peacemaker 
during bitter contract negotiations and industrywide strikes he 
often provided the solution that would get cameras rolling again 
hes also been a target for demonstrators when universal 
released the controversial last temptation of christ in 1988 
wassermans home was a picket site 
at 77 wasserman presents an imposing figure 6 feet 2 inches 
tall 160 pounds with a healthy crop of graying hair atop his 
broad brow his single nod toward eccentricity is the everpresent 
pair of outsized blackrimmed spectacles 
he and edie who have a daughter lynne and two grandchildren 
live in a comfortable but not overly grand house on the west side 
of los angeles the furnishings are 18th century english and the 
wall decorations are by picasso degas matisse and others 
both wassermans are active in charities particularly the motion 
picture country house and hospital they entertain modestly 
except for their 50th wedding anniversary gala four years ago 
guests from the political financial and show worlds entered on 
universals new york street and dined in the back to the future 
town square one of several sets recently destroyed in a fire the 
celebrants included clients wasserman once represented as an agent 
bob hope lucille ball jimmy stewart charlton heston audrey 
hepburn cary grant ginger rogers 
the new hollywood was represented by producers steven spielberg 
and henry winkler actor don johnson and studio moguls michael 
eisner of disney and rupert murdoch of fox 
from the political scene lady bird johnson alan cranston pete 
wilson lloyd bentsen howard metzenbaum george mitchell also 
wassermans first client when he arrived in hollywood president 
reagan who toasted lew and edie lets all get together on their 
75th

crabs for christmas 
sounds strange but tiny hermit tree crabs that local teenagers 
are buying as pets and wearing on chains around their necks may be 
one of the hot new gifts under or perhaps climbing up the tree 
this year 
when theyre on the person it usually takes five or six 
minutes before hell feel comfortable enough to come out of his 
shell and crawl around on the persons clothes said james 
allemon owner of indian harbor a rockford gift shop that began 
selling the 1inch caribbean crabs in september 
he first sold the crabs supplied by a tennessee company as 
pets in miniature terrariums but when allemon and his wife noticed 
loops on some of the crabs goldtone trimmed seashells they 
decided the crustaceans would make the perfect pendant 
hes sold about 50 of the 695 crab necklaces mostly to 
teenagers in the last two months and about 500 in cages 
rockford high school sophomore monica leeuwenburg has only worn 
her crab named future to school a couple of times she knows a 
few other students who wear the crabs as necklaces and several mores for 
protection they can 
live to be 70 years old 
leeuwenburg said future spends most of his time in a stonelined 
fish bowl where he eats vegetables and his favorite snack peanut 
butter 
and he always comes out of his shell when theres music on 
she said with a giggle i dont know if hes dancing or what 
but animal rights advocates arent amused 
we are against any unnecessary activity which may impede an 
animals natural life ken johnson an investigator for the 
humane society of the united states said from washington i 
think that this would restrict the crabs from living naturally due 
to the fact that they wouldnt have access to food and water when 
they need it 
but allemon said his crab necklaces are sold with a book about 
their care 
were not doing this for the shock value allemon said 
the crab comes with responsibilities like any pet 
gardner enterprises of hendersonville tenn which sells the 
crabs to pet and gift shops only recently heard that the crabs 
were being sold as jewelry in a few cities 
gardner manager yolanda alexander said crabs popularity as pets 
is growing noting the comaany has sold about 50000 crabs of all 
sizes in the past two months 
but im surprised people want to wear them around their 
necks she said

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade amid speculation the 
soviet union will use money borrowed from saudi arabia to buy us 
grain 
analysts said commercial grain dealers were large buyers of both 
futures contracts and cash grain perhaps indicating their belief 
that new export business is on the horizon 
doug jackson grains analyst with farmers commodities corp of 
des moines iowa said the rally was sparked by news that saudi 
arabia loaned the soviet union 4 billion 
some traders believe the united states urged the saudis to lend 
the money so the soviets can buy the approximately 12 million 
metric tons of us wheat and 600000 metric tons of us corn 
still remaining under a longterm grain agreement that expires at 
the end of the year 
the soviets say they cant buy the grain without credit but the 
united states has refused to grant them export credits until the 
soviets formally liberalize their emigration policies 
jackson viewed the situation with skepticism weve been 
through this roller coaster almost daily for the last three weeks 
and attitudes can change just as dramatically in the morning he 
said 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 3 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in december at 243 a bushel corn was 
1 cents to 3 cents higher with december at 220 a bushel oats 
were cent lower to 1 cents higher with december at 107 a 
bushel soybeans were cent to 5 cents higher with january at

orders to us factories for durable goods 
rose 36 percent in october propelled mostly by orders for 
airplanes the government said wednesday excluding the 
transportation sector orders fell 04 percent 
the rise was all aircraft orders said economist bruce 
steinberg of merrill lynch capital markets in new york we seem 
to have a oneindustry economy the aircraft industry has 
enough orders to last for the rest of the century 
the commerce department reported that orders for durable goods 
items expected to last more than three years totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 1294 billion it was the largest advance since a 41 
percent gain in may and followed declines of 16 percent in 
september and 09 percent in august 
transportation orders jumped 146 percent to 3789 billion 
following a 61 percent decline a month earlier a commerce 
spokesman said more than half of the october gain reflected 
aircraft orders 
since reaching a high in december 1988 of 1321 billion 
orders have been unstable fluctuating around a monthly average of 
1259 billion the department said much of the volatility was 
attributable to transportation equipment 
the boeing co reported more than 10 billion in orders for 
air gray wrote to sen john glenn 
dohio recounting his assertion that he had told the senators he 
had no information about lincoln during that disputed meeting 
hamilton said this statement i read it really wasnt true was 
it 
gray well as a matter of fact yes it was true 
hamilton you really knew more than you let on didnt you 
hamilton pointed to evidence that gray had received information 
from the bank boards top californiabased regulator who had said 
their examination had revealed a number of areas of concern at 
lincoln including heavy direct investment in real estate 
gray said it had been eight months since he had seen that 
regulators memo and he considered it incomplete and out of date 
the committee is holding hearings into allegations the five 
senators intervened improperly on behalf of keating and his thrift 
institution keating and his associated contributed 13 million to

the rapid expansion of pier 1 imports 
inc which began five years ago when the company updated its 
60sstyle merchandise and look is facing its first big sales test 
a lackluster holiday season 
the serape and incense store has grown up and out changing its 
image with an open layout and a merchandise mix that places greater 
emphasis on fashion and color 
since 1985 pier 1 has been the nations fastestgrowing home 
furnishings retailer the number of stores jumped to 554 from 265 
sales doubled and profits tripled during that time 
but pier 1s sales fell in september for the first time since 
the facelift and expansion began in october sales at stores that 
have been open at least a year were again off 73 percent and the 
company moved into the holiday retailing period with lower 
expectations 
the economy is in an uncertain period certainly the middle 
east crisis is affecting people buying things that pier 1 
sells said marvin girouard president and chief operating 
officer we dont sell needs we sell wants and thats the first 
thing that people start being concerned about 
pier 1s move to higherpriced merchandise has made them more 
sensitive to the economy agreed dan wewer an analyst for 
robinson humphrey in atlanta they are now much more 
vulnerable 
while conceding that this holiday season is as uncertain as 
any weve gone into in recent years girouard said our mix is 
appropriate the stores are merchandised very very well were 
ready for christmas 
company officials were bolstered some by sales after 
thanksgiving considered the busiest time for retailers with 15 
percent more stores than in the same period last year pier 1 said 
its sales were 18 percent higher during the week that ended nov 
24 the company said it didnt have sales figures for just the 
stores open a year or more 
theyre set up as well as a specialty retailer can be set 
up said analyst dennis van zelfden of rauscher pierce in dallas 
pier 1s growth has been successful enough that the company will 
be able to keep expanding though at a slower pace through the 
retailing slowdown girouard said 
in some ways no one is our competitor he said in some 
ways everyone is because were selling things that you buy with 
your discretionary dollar what we have to do is be more accessible 
and available 
pier 1 opened 85 stores in the 1989 fiscal year ended feb 28 
and will open 74 by the end of this fiscal year 
store building will slow down during the next few years but 
girouard said pier 1 is on target to reach 1 billion in sales by 
1994 and have 1000 stores by 2000 
profits have been up in the most recent fiscal year although 
theyve been down lately 
the company earned 255 million or 71 cents a share on 5169 
million in sales during the 12 months ended feb 28 in the 
previous fiscal year net income totaled 219 million or 70 cents 
a share on sales of 4146 million 
in its second quarter ended sept 1 pier 1 netted 26 million 
or 7 cents a share on 1496 million in sales that was off 64 
percent from yearago earnings of 73 million or 20 cents and 
1349 million in sales 
since 1985 weve opened over 350 stores and theres only 
about eight or 10 of them that we might not open today he said 
what that rapid expansion gave us was some markets where we 
didnt have much presence and now we feel very well covered in los 
angeles chicago boston dallas and houston now were looking at 
single sites and regional shopping areas 
fort worth entrepreneur charles tandy who also started tandy 
corp and radio shack opened pier 1s first store near san 
francisco in 1962 the far east goods he sold at bargain prices 
caught on with the bay areas flower children 
tandy sold the chain in the early 1970s and it went public 
shortly after 
the chain went through a lean period from 1975 to 1985 closing 
or relocating 175 stores 
the company now is being approached by developers who want a 
pier 1 store on their property girouard said 
about 40 percent of pier 1s merchandise mix changes each year 
but the company has built strong relationships with suppliers 
girouard said 
you dont just show up in afghanistan and place an order for 
10000 candlesticks because you dont know if they can ship so a 
lot of the big purchases are done with people that have proven who 
they are and what they can do he said 
girouard said political changes in eastern europe and the soviet 
union could give pier 1 potential new suppliers from which to 
choose merchandise 
they have got to sort out who can do what and organize so they 
dont come rushing over to users and we dont know who to buy 
from girouard said 
our biggest thing is knowing who we buy from we cant replace 
a purchase that doesnt show up when its expected to be 
shipped

can workers on the brink of unemployment afford to 
walk off their jobs and demand a pay raise not in the former east 
germany economists say 
an abrupt paralyzing strike by 260000 railroad workers was a 
jarring wakeup call a reminder that much of the former nations 
future hinges on how its workers react in the months ahead 
economists say the walkout which began sunday and ended 
wednesday was a crucial first test for 8 million working people 
who are grasping for higher living standards even as they try to 
hang on to their jobs 
the rail strike the first big labor dispute since the german 
nation united on oct 3 halted passenger and freight service in a 
nation where most people lack cars or drivers licenses 
in talks between the union of german rail workers and the rail 
system the reichsbahn the workers were granted a shortened 
40hour work week starting in april and 34 per child per month in 
social benefits 
talks on the wage scale are to be concluded by the end of may 
and more talks are needed on job security said union leader rudi 
schaefer 
labor experts say the walkout sends a message to politicians 
likely to win the united german elections on sunday promising 
eastern germans quick prosperity will fuel demands for fatter 
paychecks before they are possible 
the rail workers were demanding not only job protection in an 
industry likely to face large job losses but a degree of wage 
parity with their wealthier counterparts in the former west 
germany 
there is a great trend to increase the wage level in eastern 
germany said wolfgang scherement labor market specialist for 
the berlinbased institute for german economics 
but he said giving eastern germans wage parity too soon will 
eliminate one of the few advantages they have over other western 
europeans trying to lure new businesses 
the telephone system is terrible the roads are bad and the 
environment is one of the most polluted on the continent but 
eastern germans are relatively skilled people who make only about 
40 percent to 50 percent of what western germans make 
we in the institute think one chance for development is the 
lower wages scherement said wednesday 
experts differ on whether the railroad strike which virtually 
froze freight trade with other countries is only the beginning of 
labor unrest 
it is not a single development scherement said i believe 
that next year there will be many more strikes to increase the east 
german wage level 
but economist benedikt thanner said he believes high 
unemployment will deter such strikes 
the labor market situation will be worse this will 
automatically stop wage demands said thanner an economist at 
the ifoinstitute for economics in munich and head of a research 
group studying eastwest integration 
chancellor helmut kohl and his conservative christian democratic 
union which has dominated eastern german politics with promises 
that the former nation will soon enjoy western wealth is heavily 
favored to win the united elections on sunday 
thanner said he believes the partys persistent message has 
fueled eastern eagerness for westernstyle wages 
i think people trust kohls promises so much that they think 
it is justified to demand higher wages he said 
unions however point out that eastern germany already is 
experiencing westernstyle living costs because of the end of the 
old communist subsidies on food and shelter they say eastern 
germans need higher wages just to maintain their old living 
standards 
according to official figures eastern germany had about 537000 
unemployed last month about 61 percent of the work force 
however experts say the jobless rate will rise to perhaps 4 
million nearly 50 percent when credit runs out for most 
enterprises and foreign contracts expire in the first quarter of 
next year 
that essentially will be rock botton for the economy but many 
economists say a recovery could begin soon afterward 
thanner said his institute will release a surprisingly 
optimistic report next week that predicts up to 16 billion in 
western investment in the region next year 
scherement said his institute believes that former east 
germanys economic growth will begin increasing in mid1991 but 
they say how workers weather this transition will be a key to its 
success

stocks dropped slightly today in choppy 
cautious trading after the latest set of economic data was released 
and the federal reserve chairman acknowledged the economy had 
entered a meaningful downturn 
analysts said some investors were optimistic interest rates 
could be heading lower following the governments release today of 
new economic data and testimony by fed chief alan greenspan before 
the house banking committee 
the commerce department said the economy as measured by the 
gross natonal product grew at a 17 percent annual rate in the 
third quarter a downward revision from the 18 percent first 
reported last month 
the gnp is the nations total output of goods and services and 
its broadest measure of economic activity 
in comments before the banking committee greenspan all but 
declared the nation in a recession noting that skyrocketing oil 
prices and a growing shortage of credit have substantially weakened 
the economy 
all indications are that a meaningful downturn in aggregate 
output occurred as we moved through october into november he 
said 
hugh johnson senior vice president for first albany corp said 
greenspans comments were encouraging as far as the interest rate 
outlook was concerned 
but he also noted the fed has given no clear indication that it 
intends to aggressively lower rates to jumpstart the economy in 
the near term 
the fed is going to be characteristically very measured in 
changing monetary policy johnson said

with an uncertain christmas season under way toy 
company executives said wednesday they are looking for more 
business opportunities overseas to offset the sluggish us retail 
market 
the outlook in international markets is brighter john w 
amerman chief executive officer of mattel inc said at a toy 
industry conference sponsored by the investment firm bear stearns 
amp co inc 
executives generally agreed their industry will feel pressure 
from the sagging us economy during the holiday season although 
strong products should continue to sell well toy sales have 
slipped along with sales of other merchandise as consumers 
uncertain about the economy and the middle east curtailed their 
spending in recent months 
its really a mixed question said alan hassenfeld chief 
executive officer of hasbro inc 
while hasbro expects a healthy performance from its cabbage 
patch dolls and milton bradley board games it might not be a 
buoyant christmas season hassenfeld said 
overall the us toy industry has seen slow growth in recent 
years rising from a 124 billion market in 1986 to 134 billion 
last year according to estimates from the toy manufacturers of 
america a trade group 
this year the figure is expected to climb to 14 billion 
those totals do not include video games which were hotselling 
items during the 1980s nintendo of america inc projects that the 
company and its licensees will sell about 4 billion worth of video 
game products this year 
but even nintendo which dominates the us video game market 
expects to see a drop in sales of its hardware systems this year 
the company does project strong growth in its software game 
cartridges 
rumors of our demise continue to be premature peter t 
main vice president of marketing for nintendo said in prepared 
remarks at the conference 
main said that as the market for his companys products matures 
software will continue to be the critical ingredient 
hassenfeld said a maturing video game market is a positive sign 
for makers of board games such as milton bradley 
another encouraging trend is the growth in international sales 
he said hasbro which does about onethird of its business abroad 
expects international sales to increase by more than 30 percent 
this year he said 
tyco toys inc with 13 percent of its sales coming in foreign 
countries has a smaller international base but also hopes to 
expand it quickly said richard e grey chief executive officer of 
the company 
while tyco expects its sales to grow by about 14 percent in the 
next three years it projects international growth at 30 percent 
over the same period 
at mattel which does about half of its business abroad 
international sales grew by 31 percent during the first three 
quarters of 1990 compared with overall growth of 19 percent 
amerman said the company hopes to strengthen its foreign 
business in the near future in 1991 mattel plans to introduce a 
new line of barbie dolls in conjunction with bennetton the italian 
apparel retailer 
mattel which makes disney toys also hopes to see a boost in 
business when a new disneyland opens in europe in 1992 he said 
amerman said europe has about twice as many young children as 
the united states and while there might be less disposable income 
in some european countries the sheer weight of numbers assures 
mattel consistent growth in the early 1990s

businessmen interviewed in surveys in the united states and 
europe ranked london first in overall facilities and said it was 
the city most likely to be the financial center of europe five 
years from now said realtors healey amp baker 
european senior management chooses london because of its easy 
access to markets firstclass telecommunications and low cost of 
quality labor said senior partner paul orchardlisle 
john coppedge a director at new yorkbased realtors cushman and 
wakefield which supervised the us survey said american 
executives preferred london because of its traditional role as an 
important financial center and the fact that english is the common 
business language 
orchardlisle said paris scored high for quality of life and 
beat london on transport infrastructure 
frankfurt germany was considered the most likely future 
manufacturing capital of europe and brussels the capital of 
belgium was ranked no 1 for languages spoken and availability of 
office space he said 
asked to predict future european centers of manufacturing 
politics and finance those interviewed always mentioned berlin in 
the top three he said in the choice of a future political 
capital berlin ranked second only to brussels home of the 
european commission executive body of the 12nation european 
community 
the respondents said amsterdam netherlands had the best 
governmentcreated climate for business because of its tax policies 
and financial incentives while glasgow scotland ranked first in 
valueformoney office space 
eastern european cities ranked low in both polls but most 
interviewees said the business climate there would improve 
orchardlisle said berlin was considered the most promising 
followed by moscow and prague the capital of czechoslovakia

american companies already have facilities in europe 
among us business executives the 10 favorites were london 
frankfurt and brussels tie paris amsterdam geneva and milan

grain and soybean futures prices rose wednesday 
on the chicago board of trade amid speculation the soviet union 
will use money borrowed from saudi arabia to buy us grain 
grain markets also were supported by a report that president 
bush would take under advisement the issue of food export 
credits to the soviets although some analysts viewed the situation 
skeptically 
on other commodity markets livestock and meat futures fell led 
by a sharp drop in the pork markets energy futures were mixed and 
precious metals were mixed 
wheat futures settled cent to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 242 a bushel corn was 2 
cents to 3 cents higher with december at 220 a bushel oats were 
cent to cent lower with december at 107 a bushel soybeans 
were 1 cent to 7 cents higher with january at 586 a bushel 
the rally began at the opening bell following overnight reports 
that saudi arabia loaned the soviet union 4 billion some analysts 
saw the loan as a way around the longrunning ussoviet standoff 
over food export credits 
traders figured the united states told the saudis to loan them 
4 billion so the soviets can come back here and buy the grain they 
need to fulfill their obligations under the longterm grain 
agreement said john frazier director of agricultural trading 
for gerald inc in chicago 
the soviet union is required to buy about 12 million metric 
tons of us wheat and 600000 metric tons of us corn by the end 
of the year to fulfull the current grain agreement 
the soviets say they cant buy the grain without us credits 
but the united states has refused to grant credits until the 
soviets formally liberalize emigration policies to allow more jews 
to leave 
a dearth of export sales to the soviets and other traditional 
customers has contributed to drop in us wheat futures prices to 
13year lows 
the grain markets also got a boost from reports attributed to 
sen richard lugar rind that bush said he would take under 
advisement a request from a group of highranking senators to 
provide us export credits to the soviets 
doug jackson grains analyst with farmers commodities corp in 
des moines iowa said volatility in the grain markets was likely 
to continue until the question of credits is decided 
weve been through this roller coaster almost daily for the 
last three weeks and attitudes can change just as dramatically in 
the morning he said 
livestock and meat futures retreated on the chicago mercantile 
exchange paced by a steep decline in the hog and pork belly 
markets 
the selling was centered in the hog pit and reflected 
profittaking and perceptions that cash hog prices likely will fall 
thursday because meatpackers picked up adequate supplies wednesday 
said phil stanley a chicagobased consultant with dec futures inc 
live hogs finished 35 cent to 132 cents lower with december at 
5132 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 15 cents to the 
permitted daily limit of 2 cents lower with february at 6815 cents 
a pound live cattle were 20 cent to 58 cent lower with december 
at 7875 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 20 cent 
lower with january at 8735 cents a pound 
energy futures ended mostly higher on the new york mercantile 
exchange heating oil led a late rally after the national weather 
service issued a 90day forecast projecting belownormal 
temperatures in much of the eastern united states for december 
through february 
analysts said prices also were bolstered by speculation the 
united nations security council will vote thursday in favor of the 
usbacked resolution authorizing force to drive iraq from kuwait 
light sweet crude oil futures settled 31 cents to 44 cents 
higher with january at 3328 a barrel heating oil was 65 cent to 
122 cents higher with december at 8270 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 97 cent lower to 20 cent higher with december at 
8375 cents a gallon natural gas futures were 35 cents lower to 
35 cents higher with january at 2505 per 1000 cubic feet 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold futures finished 10 cents 
to 30 cents lower with december at 38570 a troy ounce silver was 
23 cents to 38 cents higher with december at 4125 a troy ounce

council vote on thursday that could authorize the use of force to 
expel iraq from kuwait 
greenspans observation of a meaningful downturn did not 
alarm too many traders because quite a few had already decided for

the fed is going to be characteristically very measured in

eastern airlines officials claimed business surged 
wednesday after the carrier gained breathing room with a massive 
cash infusion from a bankruptcy court escrow account 
the leader of the striking machinists union meanwhile urge 
new talks to settle the unions 21monthold strike 
the phones are ringing off the hook consumers are viewing 
this as a substantial vote of confidence eastern boss martin 
shugrue said in new york where a federal bankruptcy judge tuesday 
agreed to shugrues request to release up to 135 million from the 
carriers escrow fund 
calls to eastern reservation offices which had run at 100000 
calls a day recently were running 5 percent higher wednesday said 
eastern spokesman jim ashlock he said about 65 percent of the 
calls were to book reservations about 15 percent higher than 
usual 
everybody in the reservations office is on a high right now 
he said 
travel agents said the move had temporarily put aside consumer 
worries about being stuck if the carrier folded shugrue said the 
new money will ensure the carriers operations through the end of 
march when he says eastern will be ready to make a profit 
eastern is alive and well thank you said henry yaniz 
president of hollywood travel 
yaniz said his eastern bookings were up nearly 20 percent after 
falling about that much in the past two weeks 
the reaction has been incredible said ashlock for the 
first time that a great many of us veteran people have seen in a 
long time people are rooting for us 
shugrue plans a mass meeting with eastern employees here 
thursday night and will exhort them to take advantage of the 
opportunity the airlines been given 
its a christmas present for everybody who works at eastern 
ashlock said of us bankruptcy judge burton r liflands decision 
you can see what this enables us to do it takes away the 
uncertainty and gives us a chance to make good on what we know we 
can do 
less than two weeks ago shugrue had asked the court to release 
30 million saying he would need an additional 50 million in two 
payments through early january the carriers unsecured creditors 
urged the judge to liquidate the airline instead 
the judge agreed to give eastern 15 million and another 15 
million in early december provided eastern was keeping on track 
with its business projections 
but eastern said in asking for even more money tuesday that it 
had suffered up to 70 million in damage from publicity surrounding 
the creditors move to have it closed among the problems cited by 
eastern were canceled reservations and a demand from american 
express that the airline deposit 10 million to cover any losses 
that could occur if eastern stopped flying 
shugrue argued that forcing eastern to return periodically to 
withdraw from its escrow account made the airline look as if it 
could fail at any moment lifland agreed and even scolded the 
creditors for hurting easterns business 
unsecured creditors nevertheless renewed their argument that the 
carrier cannot become viable and the fund should not be depleted 
further 
the unsecured creditors who include aircraft companies banks 
labor unions and others owed an estimated 1 billion by eastern 
are expected to meet soon to determine their next move but no time 
for the meeting had been set as of late wednesday afternoon 
there are a lot of broad options im not in a position to 
discuss them lawyer adam harris said 
standard amp poors corp one of two major ratings agencies said 
the 135 million averts a shortterm liquidity crisis for eastern 
but longterm prospects remain poor due to weakening economy high 
fuel prices and industrywide fare promotions aimed at vacationers 
unsecured creditors who had opposed the request by easterns 
trustee now have even less hope of recovering anything from any 
future liquidation the bankruptcy judge made it clear that public 
interest and the interests of eastern employees would take 
precedence over claims of unsecured creditors in the attempted 
reorganization sampp said 
eastern would have only an estimated 37 million available in 
its escrow account after the current draw but shugrue said it 
wont be needed his corporate rate strategy in which eastern 
has nearly doubled its firstclass cabin space and offered business 
travelers discount fares is helping eastern build up its passenger 
base he said 
easterns unions had said they saw the breakup and sale of 
eastern in parts as their only hope for winning back their jobs 
but on wednesday machinists union leader charles e bryan urged 
shugrue to try again to settle the strike that began march 4 1989 
a nearly paralyzed eastern filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy five 
days later and has been losing 1 million to 2 million a day 
since 
shugrue appointed trustee by the court last april said then 
that achieving labor peace was a priority 
its a problem shugrue said referring to continued pickets 
by the machinists its very frustrating to us that we have not 
been able to put that matter to rest 
bryan said with the added time easterns been given shugrue 
could help the airlines market value by settling the strike 
that would be a tremendous enhancement of the value of the 
estate if we could get a contract settlement bryan said it 
does give us time to have a fully operational airline with some 
time to meet and continue to get a negotiated settlement 
ashlock said in discussions shugrue has had with the unions the 
roadblock has been union insistence that replacement workers be 
displaced which shugrue refuses to do 
the machinists meanwhile plan a large demonstration saturday 
at the miami international airport

oil prices were up moderately wednesday as 
traders grew uncertain about passage of a united nations proposal 
authorizing the use of military force in the persian gulf 
light sweet crude settled up 42 cents a barrel at 3328 for 
january delivery on the new york mercantile exchange the contract 
had been off by more than a dollar a barrel largely in response to 
comments by chinese foreign minister qian qichen that his country 
will not vote in favor of the resolution when it comes before the 
un security council on thursdsay 
it kind of takes some of the absoluteness out of the 
resolutions passage said brian tagler an oil broker for lehman 
brothers inc china appears to be the wild card 
qichen refused to say whether china would veto the measure a 
unanimous vote is required to pass the proposal under which iraq 
must withdraw its nearly halfmillion troops from occupied kuwait 
before jan 15 or face all necessary means to force them from 
the emirate 
passage of the resolution is widely viewed as increasing the 
likelihood of armed conflict in the persian gulf which could 
result in significant oil shortages 
however traders said the market turned bullish again on reports 
that us officials were reiterating that the chinese have promised 
not to oppose the resolution 
it was a fairy lowvolume day it didnt take too much action 
in the pit to move prices said bob baker senior energy analyst 
at prudentialbache securities 
also adding some strength to the market was the release late 
tuesday of figures from the american petroleum institute shwwing a 
lowerthanexpected domestic stockpile of crude oil 
contracts for delivery of crude in later months also settled 
higher 
home heating oil for december settled 122 cents higher at 9271 
cents a gallon some traders said it was lifted by a forecast for 
decidedly colder weather this winter while other analysts noted 
regional weakness in the nations stockpile of heating oil that 
showed up in tuesdays api report 
unleaded gasoline for december settled down 97 cent at 8375 
cents a gallon with other delivery months mixed 
natural gas for january settled down 35 cents to 2505 per 
1000 cubic feet

rh macy amp co inc has told creditors it lost 
66 million in the first fiscal quarter nearly twice the 
retailers loss of a year earlier published reports said 
wednesday 
the disclosure indicated the privately owned company is having 
the same troubles as other retailers whose sales and profits have 
been hurt by the weakening economy and eroding consumer confidence 
it also indicated macy which already has an enormous debt is 
under increased pressure during this critical christmas season 
the wall street journal and the new york times citing a 
confidential memo macy reportedly circulated to creditors and 
potential investors said the retailer lost 66 million in the 
three months ended oct 31 compared with a 331 million in the 
same period a year earlier 
the memo reportedly said macys sales fell 95 percent to 155 
billion in the latest quarter from 171 billion a year earlier 
maureen burgess a macy spokeswoman said she could not confirm 
the report or comment on it 
macys first quarter began aug 1 the day before the middle 
east crisis erupted and sent oil prices sharply higher sales at 
most of the nations big retailers slumped immediately as consumers 
found themselves with less money to spend on clothing furniture 
and appliances the core business of stores like macy 
macy is not alone in a poor showing for the quarter several 
big publiclyheld major retailers reported their profits fell 
during the period however macy is under more pressure than other 
companies because of its enormous interest payments 
the company still has 5 billion in debt following its 374 
billion leveraged buyout in 1986 and its 1988 acquisition of the 
bullocks and the i magnin store chains in california 
macy has come under sharp scrutiny since it lost 39 million in 
its second quarter a year ago which included a disastrous 
christmas season the company was forced to reduce its prices 
sharply to compete with other retailers and its earnings suffered 
the journal said potential investors briefed by macy were told 
the retailer expects to do better for the rest of fiscal 1991 
which ends july 31 and that it has ample cash to meet its needs 
the period covered in the latest earnings report is not 
considered as crucial to retailers as the current quarter which 
includes christmas gift sales however retailers and economists 
are expecting this to be a difficult holiday season because 
consumers are still hesitant to spend freely with a recession and 
possible middle east war looming 
the company has been seeking an infusion of equity to retire 
some of its highyield junk bonds which are selling at 
depressed prices it has also sold off its credit operations to 
remove 15 billion in debt from its balance sheet 
like many other retailers it has slashed its inventory levels 
hoping to avoid a repeat of 1989s devastating christmas markdowns 
besides its flagship macy stores located mainly in the east and 
texas and i magnin and bullocks the retailer also owns 
specialty stores including charter club fantasies by morgan taylor 
and aeropostale which are stocked with macys private label 
apparel brands

a federal judge wednesday asked lawyers for the 
government and michael milken to calculate the total amount of 
fraud in milkens crimes to help authorities determine how much 
prison time he must serve 
federal parole officials need an estimate to recommend when 
milken will be eligible for parole and the number could affect the 
length of incarceration by more than two years 
us district judge kimba wood last week sentenced the formerdrexel 
burnham lambert inc financier to 10 years in prison for six 
felony counts related to illegal securities trading 
at a hearing in manhattan federal court wednesday wood said 
because of the nature of milkens crimes it was not easy to 
calculate losses to victims she said the parole commission never 
had anything like this in mind 
while the parole commission makes its own calculation on such 
losses wood said she wants to present officials with a number 
agreeable to both sides 
under parole guidelines a first offender such as milken would 
face a minimum prison term of 24 months to 36 months if victims 
losses ranged from 200000 to 1 million if the fraud exceeds 1 
million milkens recommended prison term before parole would equal 
40 months to 52 months but the parole commission is not bound by 
the guidelines 
milken attorney arthur liman said at the hearing that he 
believed the amount would not exceed 1 million wood scheduled a 
dec 6 hearing on the matter 
as part of his plea deal milken agreed to pay 200 million in 
criminal fines and penalties and place 400 million into a fund to 
compensate investors hurt by his crimes but that figure does not 
constitute an estimate of losses 
milkens lawyers have 10 days from the date the sentence 
judgment was entered formally in us district court to appeal the 
10year term court officials said the sentence judgment was to 
occur wednesday after judge wood allocated 15 million as a 
criminal fine and the remainder of the 200 million as a penalty 
completing details of the sentencing 
liman declined to comment on a published report wednesday that 
he planned to appeal the sentence and was considering asking 
harvard university law professor lawrence tribe to argue the 
appeal 
an appeal would delay the 120 days from sentencing during which 
milkens lawyers can request a reduction in the prison term based 
on his cooperation with prosecutors but milken still would be 
required to report to federal custody on march 4 as wood ordered

federal prosecutors joined a 
whistleblower lawsuit accusing two teledyne inc subsidiaries 
of padding defense contracts by up to 40 percent robbing taxpayers 
of tens of millions of dollars a year for nearly a decade 
teledyne hid its true cost estimates in green folders and 
submitted grossly inflated estimates to the government in white 
folders according to the suit which was unsealed tuesday in 
federal court 
top managers directed the deception the lawsuit alleges 
teledyne spokesman berkley j baker didnt return telephone 
calls requesting comment the company is expected to answer the 
complaint in 30 to 60 days 
the lawsuit was filed in may 1989 by klaus kirchhoff who worked 
as a senior pricing specialist at teledyne systems co from may to 
september 1988 
teledyne systems with annual sales of up to 300 million 
builds military computers navigation systems and radar jamming 
gear it is now separately incorporated from teledyne inc but was 
a division of the parent conglomerate at the time both are named 
as defendants 
the suit was filed under the federal false claims act which 
allows citizens to seek damages on behalf of the government 
as customary in such cases the suit was kept secret while the 
justice department looked into the claims it was unsealed because 
the government decided last week to become a plaintiff and help 
pursue it 
there was a very long investigation by the government said 
leon dayan one of kirchhoffs lawyers the government has joined 
entirely in our complaint 
us attorney lourdes g baird issued a statement saying the 
government will later file its own complaint but in joining the 
lawsuit it agrees generally with the whistleblowers allegations of 
how teledyne has defrauded the united states 
the allegations in kirchhoffs suit dont specify how much the 
government lost dayan said it still wasnt clear although it 
could reach into the hundreds of illions of dollars 
under the false claims act if teledyne is found liable it can 
be required to repay three times the amount of the overcharges and 
pay substantial civil fines as well 
kirchhoff would be entitled to 15 percent to 25 percent of the 
trebled damages 
the alleged false claims occurred under negotiated solesource 
contracts or subcontracts in which there is no price competition 
to ensure a fair price for the work done the contractor is 
required to provide true estimates of its work costs then a fair 
profit is built into the final price
