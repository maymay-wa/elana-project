hydro quebec spokesman jeanguy ouimet said the breakdown began 
on a power line between churchill falls labrador and the arnaud 
generating station near septiles quebec but the cause was was 
not known 
the problem came from the churchill falls power house for 
some reason the power stopped coming and that caused an overload 
on other lines he said 
power was being restored in one area at a time he added 
cities on the new york side of the border were not affected 
because the state does not operate on the same system according to 
a spokesman for new york state electric and gas 
in montreal street lights and traffic signals blinked out and 
passengers were rescued from stalled subway trains hospitals used 
emergency generating systems and said there were no serious 
problems

polls gave the lead to gov michael dukakis in 
the last campaign day before new yorks democratic presidential 
primary but jesse jackson was within striking distance and turnout 
was considered critical 
while dukakis led by 10 or more points pollsters said to watch 
the turnout tuesday particularly among nonjewish whites a 
potential swing vote if many stayed home they said jackson could 
come from behind 
nobody can predict for sure what the final combination of 
blacks jews hispanics and white catholics will be said abc 
news pollster john brennan we could all be wrong new york is a 
killer 
polling monday by abc and the washington post found dukakis 
holding the ground he gained sunday after a dip friday and 
saturday while jackson slid a bit the combined sundaymonday 
results gave dukakis 51 percent and jackson 34 the fridaysaturday 
totals had been 4640 
meanwhile sen albert gore jr had 9 percent in the final 
abcpost poll down from 11 percent friday and saturday 
a cbs news survey saturday and sunday had a slightly narrower 
spread with dukakis at 43 percent jackson at 33 and gore at 12 a 
gallup poll done friday through sunday put the race at dukakis 45 
jackson 32 and gore 10 
the abcpost poll had a 6point margin of error cbss 4 
gallups 5 
pollsters said gore after an upward blip late last week 
settled back to his previous comparatively low level of support 
and did not seem likely to draw enough votes to affect the outcome 
greatly gore was up slightly in the cbs poll but down a tick in 
the abcpost and gallup polls 
gore does not appear to have gotten into the numbers where he 
will close the margin said lee miringoff chief of the marist 
college institute for public opinion that leaves the next level 
of analysis turnout 
jews who can make up roughly 25 percent of new yorks primary 
vote strongly favored dukakis blacks who can make up about the 
same proportion of the vote backed jackson overwhelmingly jackson 
had roughly 20 percent of the nonjewish white vote the abcpost 
poll said 
jackson is not getting enough whites he needs a large black 
turnout and low white ethnic turnout to close what is a 
moderatesize dukakis lead at this point miringoff said white 
ethnics are solidly behind dukakis the question is whether they go 
and vote 
the abcpost and cbs polls said jacksons supporters were 
significantly more committed to their candidate than were dukakis 
backers miringoff said analyses of only the most likely voters 
narrowed dukakis lead 
but in new york even when black voters are committed to a 
candidate even in the best of times that doesnt mean as good a 
turnout as the jewish turnout said cbs poll chief warren 
mitofsky the jewish vote always turns out 
it remained to be seen if dukakis would retain that vote 
mitofsky said moreover he noted that a cbs poll late last week 
said as many as onefifth of the voters had not decided making 
the candidates final efforts on the stump and in advertising 
particularly important even the cbs poll that was completed sunday 
night said 9 percent remained undecided 
id take these last few days very seriously mitofsky said 
the abcpost poll which presses respondents to make a choice 
had only 3 percent undecided the biggest group of wafflers right 
now about 10 percent of the electorate is trying to decide 
between dukakis and gore said brennan 
there were other imponderables including the new conflict in 
the persian gulf voters could turn to dukakis as a safer vote 
brennan conjectured or to jackson as a protest vote or to gore 
because of his experience in military matters

the late afternoon sun casts long 
shadows over the clapboard houses that line main street in walpack 
center its dead still but thats not unusual 
walpack township is dying 
and walpack center the oncethriving hub of the community is 
nearly a ghost town having faded year by year since the federal 
government bought up the surrounding countryside to build a dam 
and then changed its mind 
there seems to be no trace of what was here like it never 
happened township clerk virginia e fuller said as she and her 
husband mayor raymond fuller settled into chairs on the 
glassenclosed front porch of their home outside walpack center 
it was an active community she recalled we had a fire 
department and a ladies auxilliary we used to take the bus to the 
city every now and then 
its like it was all erased she added 
suits me fine her husband said trying to appear 
cantankerous but breaking into booming laughter 
only the municipal building an old oneroom schoolhouse and 
the rescue squad garage are still owned by the township 
the federal government owns the former methodist church which 
is now locked along with six houses and a post office that make up 
the rest of walpack center 
the houses all are painted the same beige with green trim 
lending an eerie quality to the silence the post office is open 
only two hours six days a week 
spreading from the township center are acres of what once was 
pasture but the farmhouses the fences and barns are long gone 
the death knell for walpack sounded in 1962 when congress 
authorized a plan to build a dam at tocks island a few miles north 
up the delaware river the idea was to create a 12000acre lake 
along 37 miles of the delaware river from port jervis ny to the 
delaware water gap 
the federal government spent 9 million on engineering for the 
proposed dam between pennsylvania and new jersey an additional 
752 million bought land for the lake and a surrounding park the 
lake was to be used for recreation and water supply while the dam 
would provide hydroelectric power and flood control 
but congress never appropriated money to build the dam because 
of environmental and economic objections 
in 1978 it turned the project over from the army corps of 
engineers to the national park service which is turning the land 
and river into the 69000acre delaware water gap national 
recreation area 
the federal government now owns all but about 5000 acres of the 
land it intends to incorporate into the park that land in new 
jersey and pennsylvania is still privately owned 
the fullers whose home is on a halfacre plot are among about 
90 residents left in walpack township a 45squaremile community 
that falls entirely within the recreation area 
the fullers both 62 say they intend to stay in walpack and 
serve as mayor and clerk as long as they are able they wont sell 
out to the government as their neighbors did 
people think were crazy for staying but its great mrs 
fuller said gazing across a deep ravine to the pines on a far 
ridge 
the governments objective for the area is to provide 
opportunities for outdoor recreation said richard ring the park 
services assistant superintendent of the area 
probably got just as much use before mrs fuller said 
more said her husband 
but ring says 25 million people visit the recreation area 
annually to hunt fish swim ride bikes hike and go boating and 
canoeing on the river officials expect the number to double in the 
next decade he said 
to accommodate the visitors the park service plans to set up 
restrooms picnic areas refreshment stands boat landings and 
trails for hiking and biking 
there also are a number of historic facilities that folks can 
come and tour ring said 
among those historic facilities are homes once owned by people 
like the fullers the buildings in walpack center may eventually 
house country inns craft shops art galleries museums 
restaurants or other facilities consistent with the 
governments objectives for the area ring said 
thousands of other houses that were deemed to have no historic 
or cultural value were torn down 
we fought it like the devil fuller said of opposition to 
the federal plans 
walpack established in the 1750s had a yearround population 
of about 375 in the early 1960s with numbers swelling to about 
3000 in the summer the fullers said most residents were dairy 
farmers and most summer people came for the fishing and hunting or 
the solitude 
sometimes its hard to remember what it was like mrs 
fuller said

she never went to acting school but sonia 
braga has managed to convey highvoltage excitement in such films 
as dona flora and her two husbands and kiss of the spider 
woman now shes doing the same in robert redfords the milagro 
beanfield war 
braga plays ruby a tenacious garage owner who organizes a civic 
revolt against the land marauders of a new mexico village its 
another remarkable performance for the actress who began her career 
in brazilian soap operas 
here for the opening of the milagro beanfield war braga 
recently talked about her career in an interview that covered a 
wide range of subjects usually in brief bursts of conversation 
her english is amazingly good considering her recent acquaintance 
with the language 
i started learning english about four years ago she said 
i went to visit a friend in new york and since i wasnt doing 
anything at the time i decided to stay and learn the language 
im glad that i did that language can be a big barrier between 
people if you want to know a people you have to learn the 
language 
the actress first heard about milagro while she was serving 
on the jury of the cannes film festival three years ago her agent 
told her that robert redford wanted to talk with her about a role 
in the film on her way home to brazil she stopped in new york 
i read the script and i really really loved it she said 
then i met robert and we talked i was too excited about the 
character to be nervous i was very very touched that someone 
would want to make a movie about milagro 
then i made a screen test three times i had three or four 
more interviews with the producers and the director then i went to 
new mexico 
in the movie a new mexico hamlet is being squeezed to death by 
a resort developer with the help of the state governor and his 
venal staff the officials even send a hatchet man to terrorize the 
residents mostly hispanic when they grow restive under the rape 
of their land 
the reluctant leader of the revolt is a small landowner who 
inadvertently diverts the land barons water into his beanfield he 
becomes defiant and others strive to make it a crusade especially 
braga 
whats it like to be directed by robert redford 
hes very sensitive braga said i think thats not only 
because hes an actor and he understands the problems of actors 
thats the quality that some people have he is very into certain 
important things like the environment 
he is totally open to suggestion if youre doing well hell 
just let you go for instance ruben blades who plays sheriff 
montoya is a natural actor he was so much the character that 
robert just watched him do it but when he sees that you are going 
the wrong way he leads you back to the right way for the movie if 
you have any suggestions about the character he will listen to you 
and make some changes 
the darkhaired beauty has been working since she was 14 after 
playing children she did a production of hair for two years 
then i started doing soap operas she said one of the 
soap operas gabriella was written by jorge amada who also 
wrote dona flor 
the film brought her international acclaim as did kiss of the 
spider woman her first film in english 
she welcomes more opportunities abroad since the brazilian film 
industry has been ailing because of the countrys financial woes 
the countrys major filmmakers have abandoned brazil for hollywood 
making movies in english instead of portuguese hector babenco 
kiss of the spider woman shot ironweed with meryl streep 
and jack nicholson in albany ny

recent protests by blacks at predominantly white universities 
differed in their immediate causes but academic observers say the 
incidents reflect increasing tensions 
there is such a rawness to race relations on campus now 
troy duster a professor of sociology at the university of 
california at berkeley said last week 
a lot of black students are feeling besieged and beleaguered 
they feel that their fellow students and professors wonder why they 
are there in the first place he said 
provocations for protests have run the gamut from an assault at 
the university of massachusetts to verbal harassment at denison 
college in ohio to a stolen bicycle in berkeley 
in every single one of these instances there has been some 
local incident or an accumulation of things the straw that 
broke the camels back as it were said mary frances berry a 
member of the us commission on civil rights and sigal professor 
of history at the university of pennsylvania 
but if one looks generally one sees that on these campuses 
you have the basic sort of reaction against the expansion of 
opportunity for blacks she said 
although black college enrollment has increased by about 25000 
between 1976 and 1986 according to the us department of 
education the proportion of blacks has declined from 96 percent 
to 88 percent of the national student body largely because of a 
decline in the number of black male students 
whites accounted for 79 percent of the students in 1986 down 
from 82 percent in 1976 
charles willie professor of education and urban affairs at 
harvard university said the protests are based on a sense of 
despair about the reagan administrations commitment to securing 
equal opportunities 
when there is a belief that there are others who are acting on 
ones own behalf there is a tendency for minorities to accommodate 
shortcomings and faults and abuses minor abuses on the basis 
that help is on its way willie said in a telephone interview 
the sense of abandonment leads to a sense of despair and then 
there is a tendency to strike out at all kinds of harm instead of 
accommodating where there is a sense of despair the level of 
toleration is certainly reduced 
last week denison university banished two white students from 
its granville ohio campus for the remainder of the academic year 
for harassing a black student 
the students had been found guilty of harassing aaron laramore 
a black senior by pounding on the wall of his dormitory room and 
yelling racial epithets 
in other recent incidents 
in durham nc about 300 people staged a protest friday at 
duke university saying there were not enough black faculty members 
and calling the prestigious school a racist institution joseph 
di bona an associate professor in the education department said 
the shortage of black faculty members means that blacks at duke 
lead disembodied lives 
about 100 students marched to city hall in lexington ky on 
april 8 to protest a racial epithet used by abhappy chandler 
the former governor and baseball commissioner who is now a member 
of the university of kentuckys board of trustees during a 
discussion about investments in south africa chandler had remarked 
that zimbabwe formerly ruled by whites is all nigger now 
eighteen black students at berkeley were cited for trespassing 
april 7 following an allday sitin at the campus housing office by 
about 50 members of the african students association the protest 
was spurred by one freshmans complaint that three white students 
damaged her bicycle and that she had been the object of slurs and 
jokes 
this protest is the culmination of a lot of different things 
that have gone unresolved at the university said asa president 
michael stoll 
black students and feminists protested at the university of 
pennsylvania after an allwhite fraternity staged a pornographic 
show featuring two black strippers on march 4 the university 
ordered the zeta beta tau house closed for at least 1 years 
in february minority students took over a building at the 
university of massachusetts campus in amherst after two black 
students were beaten by five whites two of the whites dropped out 
of school before disciplinary hearings were held and two others 
were put on disciplinary probation 
forty black hispanic and other minority students occupied a 
dormiitory office at hampshire college in amherst mass for nine 
days endng march 2 the students won a 16point agreement which 
included the appointment of a dean of multicultural affairs and an 
adviser for the student group which occupied the dorm office 
minority students at dartmouth college in hanover nh 
organized several rallies and a boycott of downtown stores that 
advertise in the dartmouth review after the conservative 
offcampus weekly renewed its attacks on the competence of william 
cole a black professor of music 
a college disciplinary board last month suspended three review 
staffers and put a fourth on probation after they confronted cole 
in his classroom in a march 28 speech dartmouth president james 
freedman said the review is poisoning the intellectual 
environment of our campus 
black students organized at georgia southwestern college to 
seek the dismissal of a professor who allegedly called a student a 
black bitch 
the professor said the student had accused him of being a racist 
when he refused to let her withdraw with a passing grade instead of 
a failing grade 
weve got to do a lot more to sensitize majority populations 
about the needs of minority students said tom goodale vice 
chancellor for student affairs at university of denver and 
president of the national association of student personnel 
administrators 
goodale said one underlying issue in recent protests is access 
to higher education though the latest federal budget provides for 
increased aid the rules are more cumbersome he said in a 
telephone interview 
the other issue is continuing racism whether that is in the 
form of language or violence the country for whatever reason is 
in a conservative mood racial slurs the predominant problem of 
poverty have brought those issues to the forefront again

vladimir tufelds thoughts revolve around a very 
sick woman in an american hospital thousands of miles away but his 
crippled body is stuck in a tworoom apartment with a 12thfloor 
view of a city he no longer wants to see 
in late december tufelds wife of 35 years izolda was given 
permission to leave the soviet union to undergo brain tumor surgery 
at johns hopkins university hospital in baltimore md 
but according to soviet government officials the knowledge 
tufeld gained working in an electronics factory 15 years ago still 
could threaten soviet security despite appeals from members of the 
us congress and governments from britain to australia the 
distinguishedlooking 60yearold electronics engineer had to stay 
behind 
a growing number of soviet jews including the bestknown 
refuseniks have been allowed to emigrate under more liberal 
policies implemented by mikhail s gorbachev but many others like 
tufeld remain in the web of bureaucracy and indifference that has 
held them for years 
we have been married for 35 years and weve never been 
separated from the moment of our wedding tufeld said in a recent 
interview 
even under more liberal travel and emigration policies soviets 
are not often allowed to travel abroad as entire families tufeld 
said he feels like a hostage 
on wednesday tufeld received yet another rejection of his 
appeal to leave the soviet union and eventually settle in israel 
that makes more than 20 of them since the couple first applied to 
emigrate on july 4 1977 the day of independence in the united 
states tufeld noted 
mrs tufeld 57 underwent surgery for a brain tumor for the 
first time in 1981 in the soviet union but soviet doctors did not 
remove all of the tumor and it grew back even larger 
doctors at johns hopkins removed the new tumor im midjanuary 
and have conducted several operations since then tufeld said 
doctors believe the operation went well but izolda remains 
hospitalized and on a respirator tufeld hasnt talked to her since 
before the first american operation 
he gets weekly reports from his son igor who was allowed to 
emigrate to israel in 1977 and saw his mother for the first time 
since then when he traveled to the united states to be with her 
the kgb secret police the ministry of internal affairs and the 
moscow visa office have no objection to tufeld leaving the soviet 
union tufeld said the hangup is the ministry of general 
machinebuilding 
a ministry official nikolai gavrilenko told him the objection 
is in force until 1992 tufeld said that doesnt mean you can 
leave in 1992 tufeld quoted gavrilenko as telling him it 
means well review your case in 1992 and decide how much longer you 
have to wait 
refuseniks have long said that rejection because of alleged 
access to state secrets is widely abused by officials 
jewish emigration from the soviet union increased in early 1988 
but the annual figures for recent years are far below the peak of 
more than 51000 in 1979 
there is a certain amount of progress but already the west 
has changed its opinion to think that there is no longer a 
problem tufeld said 
but tufeld continues to struggle both with his own infirmities 
and the soviet bureaucracy 
tufeld and his wife a former teacher both were declared by the 
soviet government to be invalids in need of constant care he has 
not worked for 10 years and receives a 190 pension because of a 
back problem that an american doctor has diagnosed as either a 
herniated disc or a tumor 
tufeld said soviet doctors cannot do the tests necessary to 
decide which it is tufeld also suffers from severe gallstones 
he gets around slowly with the help of a cane between the 
telephone a wall plastered with pictures of foreign notables and a 
windowsill piled high with letters of support and futile 
communications with soviet officials the window looks down on an 
ancient church surrounded by drab east mosocw apartments and 
factories 
tufeld charges that officials who refuse to let him leave are 
undermining the authority of gorbachev who has told the west that 
everyone refused permission to emigrate because of access to state 
secrets is given a definite date when he will be allowed to leave 
i think theres a game going on tufeld said they reject 
you and wait for the reaction from the west if its quiet there 
then let him die

a decade after agreeing to desegregate their 
university systems georgia and five other southern and border 
states still fall short of the goals 
the six states have been chastised by the us education 
department for lagging in improving largely black colleges and in 
better integrating the races at all public colleges 
the president of one mostly black school says money funds for 
capital improvements is the key billy black president of albany 
state college noted that the georgia legislature usually approves 
only half the budget requested by the university system of georgia 
theres no question but that these schools up until recently 
were neglected black said in an interview at the campus here in 
southwestern georgias pecangrowing country 
if you have a coupleofhundredyear history of being 
underfunded youll probably need some catchup money to be 
competitive he said 
but fatter budgets are not the only route to racial balance 
georgia is also exploring another avenue outright merger of such 
black colleges as albany state with nearby white institutions 
h dean propst chancellor of the state university system is 
expected to make final recommendations on mergers in may 
the education department report in february sharpened the focus 
on progress and problems at traditionally black colleges which 
last year enrolled 217367 students and which account for 40 
percent of blacks earning degrees in the united states 
the report cited georgia missouri delaware florida oklahoma 
and virginia for such shortcomings as poor facilities on black 
campuses and failure to meet goals for recruiting blacks for 
whitedominated colleges and whites for mostly black colleges 
the goals were set in 1978 in agreements between the states and 
the federal government which had accused the states of violating 
the 1964 civil rights act 
at the time washington officials said the states though no 
longer segregating colleges by law had not eliminated vestiges of 
segregation from their dual systems of higher education 
in the february report education secretary william bennett 
asked the six governors for formal assurances they will carry out 
building repair and other projects to fulfill the plans 
samuel myers head of a washingtonbased group that lobbies on 
behalf of 117 traditionally black colleges says facilities are 
being upgraded and more programs offered at black schools 
attracting more students of all races 
but myers president of the national association for equal 
opportunity in higher education says further improvements are 
needed to ensure equal educational opportunities 
the consensus is that none of these states has done all that 
they should do or all that they said they would do he said 
in the case of georgia bennett ordered officials to 
complete a business administration building at largely black 
savannah state college 
renovate a complex at fort valley state another mostly black 
institution 
better promote transfers from predominantly white darton 
college a twoyear institution to fouryear albany state 
start an agricultural extension program administered jointly by 
the university of georgia and fort valley state 
in an interview chancellor propst said the building projects 
are in the works and other deficiencies should be easy to correct 
kay miller the chancellors spokeswoman says the capital 
improvements mean the state spends significantly more per student 
at black colleges than at other schools an annual 11315 at 
albany state for example compared with 5449 at traditionally 
white valdosta state college 
the bennett report covered 10 states four west virginia 
arkansas north carolina and south carolina were found in full 
compliance with their desegregation plans 
three other deep south states louisiana mississippi and 
alabama never submitted desegregation plans the justice 
department eventually took them to court the mississippi case was 
recently dismissed the others remain in litigation 
the education department said the 10 states covered in the 
report have spent more than 240 million enhancing black colleges 
in addition congress appropriated 732 million for support this 
year 
but after bennett made his formal assessment of progress 
critics of the reagan administration contended he should have been 
tougher on the states concentrating more on integration of 
students and less on physical improvements at black campuses 
after years of desegregation efforts albany state remains 
overwhelmingly black of 1994 students enrolled for the winter 
quarter 366 were white five were hispanic two were asian and 
three were american indians 
but the college which 10 years ago had less than 4 percent 
white enrollment has met the plans general goal of a 
20percentwhite student body and is now focusing on new buildings 
and expanded programs 
it will soon have a new campus entrance more paved parking 
lots a 6 million library and a new nursing and allied health 
center in the longer term a performing arts center a new 
administration building and a new physical education complex are 
planned 
we had unpaved streets unpaved parking lots and the lighting 
was terrible recalled walter burgess the business school dean 
who joined the faculty 14 years ago ive seen tremendous 
changes 
albany state has six 2plus2 academic programs aimed at 
boosting white transfers from the twoyear darton college and 
offers 200000 in annual scholarships to encourage whites to 
attend 
one white student physical education major carlton fletcher 
said he is impressed with the albany state teachers as for the 
facilities some of the buildings are really old but the newer 
buildings are as fine as ive seen 
few expect a speedy integration of georgias state colleges 
ingrained attitudes from the days of official segregation 
prevent it said albany state sophomore roger collier 
a black person is not going to go to a white school because 
they would feel uncomfortable said collier a black marketing 
major i see whites walking around the campus and they dont 
socialize you pass them and they dont ever say hello 
the rev clarence james a black educator sid historically 
black colleges if integrated lose some benefits of environment 
and development they can offer black students and eventually lose 
their black character as well 
the racial reality is that there are no 5050 institutions 
said james assistant admissions director at morehouse college a 
private black institution in atlanta once a school becomes 20 or 
30 percent white the shift is going to go on eventually to a 
9010 whiteblack split

a college and five school systems 
troubled by a growing shortage of minority teachers have teamed up 
in an effort to lure more blacks into the classroom with offers of 
scholarships and assurances of jobs back home 
until about 10 years ago teaching was an especially attractive 
profession for collegeeducated blacks offering opportunity and 
job security that was sometimes hard to find in other fields 
but by 1981 fewer than 10 percent of the nations public school 
teachers were black that total is expected to drop to fewer than 5 
percent by the early 1990s according to jack miller dean of 
georgia southern colleges school of education 
in georgia blacks account for 10 percent of public school 
teachers but their numbers will shrink to fewer than 6 percent in 
just two years at the same time the black student population will 
increase from 40 percent this year to 55 percent in 1990 
there is a critical need for role models for black kids 
said johnny tremble a codirector of georgia southerns minority 
teaching program boys and girls need to see themselves being 
successful contributing to society and need to hear about values 
from black people 
black teachers also can help white students avoid racist 
attitudes by showing it is better to judge a person on what he or 
she has to offer said tremble 
tremble principal of the collges laboratory school where 
future teachers get classroom experience said he has received 
numerous phone calls since the school announced its minority 
teaching program in march 
three students already are in the program and college officials 
hope to sign up 25 to 30 more promising black students by 
september said tremble 
five school systems from bibb chatham emanuel and barrow 
counties in georgia and beaufort sc are participating 
the school systems identify promising black students and provide 
scholarships for those willing to major in education the school 
systems also guarantee the students a job after graduation teacher 
salaries in georgia range from 16352 to 33462 depending on 
experience and level of training 
georgia southern provides counseling and puts together a 
financial package that could include additional scholarships 
grants lowinterest loans and loans that are considered repaid if 
the student teaches for a specified period 
there has been a great deal of national talk about the issue 
but this is the most complete plan to actually do something about 
it said beaufort school superintendent terry terril 
miller said the program is unique because the school systems 
handle the recruitment 
were getting capable people because the school districts 
decide who they want to come back and teach in their communities 
said miller a codirector of the program thus far ive been 
impressed with the kind of kids we have been talking to 
all of the students taking part in the gsc program will have 
aboveaverage sat scores miller said 
georgia southern received a 50000 grant from the us 
department of education to help run the program for two years 
tremble believes fewer blacks are going into teaching these days 
because they can choose from a wider range of careers 
but the nationwide teacher decline is not a problem that is 
confined just to minorities tremble noted that georgia has a 
shortage of 10000 certified teachers in recent years an 
increasing number of students of all races have shunned teaching to 
pursue careers that appear to be more rewarding 
tremble said educators and guidance counselors have focused on 
the negative aspects of teaching without pointing out the rewards 
were not giving education a fair shake he said i dont 
mind you talking about the bad but talk about the good too and 
if youre going to talk bad of education talk about the bad of 
other careers

the little america colony was shaken by 
the bloody terrorist attack on the uso club here but the us navy 
says its 10000strong community in naples wont be driven away 
the car bombing that killed four italians and one american 
servicewoman was the first known terrorist act against the us 
navy in this southern port city that serves as center for 6th fleet 
operations in the mediterranean 
the thursday night blast also injured 17 people including four 
american sailors two islamic groups claimed responsibility 
italian investigators say the attack was carried out by junzo 
okudaira a notorious terrorist of the japanese red army which is 
tied to arab terrorist groups in lebanon police say he had at 
least two accomplices fusako shigenobu the woman leader of the 
japanese gang and a middle eastern or north african man 
chief investigator romano argenio on sunday said he had no new 
leads in the case 
security measures have been tightened at the extensive american 
navy facilities here but officials and dependents say their lives 
and activities havent changed much 
the first couple of days there is apprehension but it wears 
off real fast said lt david morris a navy spokesman you 
have to get on with life 
we are all devastated but you cant live in a shell of 
fear added his wife deirdre mother of an 11monthold child 
the car bomb exploded as dozens of sailors from the visiting 
frigates uss paul and uss capodanno were at a party inside the uso 
club the frigates have since left naples but five ships from the 
6th fleets amphibious task force are due to arrive here wednesday 
on a routine port call 
in addition to welcoming visiting servicemen from 6th fleet 
ships naples is home to about 10000 navy personnel and dependents 
some are stationed at natos southern europe command but most 
serve at the naval support activity base in the naples suburb of 
agnano the 55acre complex has been the administrative 
headquarters for the 6th fleet since 1963 
the 6th fleet flagship the uss belknap is based in gaeta 60 
miles to the north 
the agnano complex could pass for a small american town it is 
equipped with a supermarket bar restaurant club movie theater 
bank hospital church post office school and gymnasium the base 
also has a weekly newspaper a local englishlanguage radio station 
and a tv station which receives american programs by satellite 
but the americans are not completely isolated since only a 
limited number of enlisted personnel is provided housing most 
people rent apartments in the local community 
most live in the western part of the city in an area known as 
little america 
the american presence has been an economic boom for naples 
pouring some 250 million a year into the local economy 
the newspaper la repubblica summed up the feeling of naples 
residents following the uso attack as italians americans whats 
the difference for us it is a tragedy in the family 
still many neopolitans say they have little direct contact with 
the resident americans 
the us community is almost an invisible army a community 
that lives like a colony closed in its own world commented the 
newspaper il messaggero the women rarely venture out into the 
city they hate the traffic they are not able to adjust they are 
afraid of muggers 
morris said there are some americans who cant adjust to 
neopolitan ways and rarely leave the navy complex 
but most people serve here for two years and that mentality 
wears off after a while he said i dont think there is a 
fortress attitude 
however he said navy personnel are constantly aware of the 
possiblity of terrorist attacks and take sufficient precautions 
while americans in naples had never been terrorist targets 
before us military figures have been attacked elsewhere in 
italy brig gen james l dozier was kidnapped by the red brigade 
in verona in 1981 and rescued 42 days later leamon hunt the 
romebased head of the un observer force in the sinai was 
assassinated in 1984 the red brigades an italian terrorist group 
claimed responsibility for his killing 
we try not to draw a lot of attention to ourselves said lt 
cmdr john marchi another navy spokesman naples is a very big 
city and we kind of melt in

the april 6 confrontation in the occupied west 
bank that led to the death of an israeli and two arabs heightened 
tension between palestinians and jews inflamed jewish settlers and 
embroiled the army in a controversy over who killed the israeli 
teenager here is a report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the conflict between arabs 
and jews came into stark focus on a recent spring day when a group 
of young israelis hiked into an area where arabs were tending 
fields of wheat and barley in these contested hills 
on that day profound mistrust between reluctant neighbors 
turned into terror and bloodshed yet its likely neither group 
wanted or expected trouble 
indeed the whole affair may have resulted from a chain of 
misunderstandings 
before the day ended two arab youths were killed and 
15yearold tirza porat became the first israeli civilian to die in 
unrest that has swept the israelioccupied territories in the past 
four months two other arabs were wounded by gunfire in the april 6 
confrontation and 15 israeli settlers were injured by stones 
the arabs said the israeli settlers marched toward beita and one 
of their guards shot to death a palestinian they said they feared 
an attack and rushed to defend their village with stones and axes 
for the 16 teenagers and two adult guards from the jewish 
settlement of elon moreh 35 miles north of jerusalem the day 
became a nightmare they said hundreds of arabs encircled them 
shouting slaughter the jews 
two very different accounts emerged inside israel about how the 
israeli teenager died that day 
after an initial report that she had been shot by arabs the 
israeli army said the girl had been stoned to death but an 
examination of the body showed she died of a bullet wound to the 
head the army finally said romam aldubi a rightwing extremist 
accompanying the teenagers as a guard accidentally shot her 
however the israeli settlers insisted she was stoned to death 
by the palestinians 
they accused the israeli army usually immune from political 
attack of backing the arabs version of the days events the 
settlers who number about 65000 among 850000 west bank 
palestinians turned the darkhaired israeli teenager into a cause 
celebre 
israeli hardliners who think israel should foster settlements 
on the land their army seized from jordan in the 1967 middle east 
war rallied behind the settlers 
the settlers lashed out in a personal attack on lt gen dan 
shomron the israeli armys chief of staff for saying most 
villagers tried to help the israelis 
shomron is wrong the arabs were vultures i didnt realize 
how hostile and primitive the population was menachem ilan the 
other adult on the hike said 
he said before the israeli teenager was shot some arabs 
shouted in hebrew you took two of ours now give us two of 
yours 
shomron for his part grew angry when the teenagers held a 
news conference four days later to dispute the militarys version 
of events he said the children and their parents were trying to 
undermine israels army and even hinted about subjecting the 
teenage hikers to liedetector tests 
leftwing israelis meanwhile attacked the army from the rear 
they said the military wrongly punished the village 
the army had placed beita under curfew for five days detained 
hundreds of men and destroyed 14 homes 
why didnt the army wait until it knew the facts said 
felicia langer an israeli attorney who represents palestinians 
for the settlers however the army had not struck back hard 
enough the mourners at the teenagers funeral demanded revenge 
and marched through an arab village 
cabinet minister avraham sharir called for razing beita 
shocking israeli moderates 
our problem at this stage isnt the arabs its the jews 
yaacov hasdai an israeli educator told the jerusalem post if 
we dont restore our basic values and send the extremists back to 
their corners we dont have much time left to us 
the final version of the armys report on that day has not yet 
been released however it is likely to contain implicit criticism 
of the settlers who failed to follow military rules requiring 
israelis hiking through the west bank to notify the army in advance 
the report according to published accounts indicates aldubi 
himself may have caused the trouble by being too quick to fire his 
m16 rifle in the field near beita killing the first palestinian 
the farmers thought the settlers were coming to hurt us 
villager nitham muthgar 27 said afterward one palestinian 
approached to ask what they were doing a settler shot and wounded 
him and then all the villagers were afraid 
the subsequent chain of events is not completely clear arabs 
apparently led the settlers into the village where news of the 
death had been broadcast over a mosque loudspeaker 
more and more youths gathered on the hilltops rachel 
savitch 16 said at the hikers news conference they got closer 
and closer she said they descended and completely surrounded 
us 
the settlers said they followed the arabs into beita because 
they were afraid a mob of arabs said rami hoffman 17 were led 
by women and girls with their faces painted shouting wailing 
whipping up the atmosphere to a fever pitch 
in beita the israeli hiker and another palestinian were shot to 
death and villagers attacked the settlers 
aldubi who has not regained consciousness after being stoned by 
arabs is believed to have killed the second arab 
arab villagers wrested aldubis gun away from him but apparently 
did not fire it according to the army instead the palestinians 
dismantled it and eventually returned it to the army with eight 
bullets inside 
the villagers say the only weapons they used were stones and 
farm tools their version is supported by the army which said no 
firearms were found in housetohouse searches 
but the settlers contend the hiker was shot by a palestinian 
with a sovietmade kalashnikov 
ariel aviva 17 said he saw an arab firing the gun he believes 
killed his fellow hiker 
i looked up and saw an arab man with a masked face shooting a 
kalashnikov rifle from a rooftop he said i was in front of 
tirza when i looked down she was lying there bleeding from the 
head 
however the army says an autopsy showed the bullet went through 
her jaw and came out the top of her head indicating that no one 
firing from a rooftop could have killed her 
but a police inquiry was expected to conclude it is impossible 
to tell which version is correct since no bullet was found 
some israelis asked why in a dangerous period of arabisraeli 
tensions the group was hiking in the arabpopulated hills 
this was clearly a political act the settlers viewed the hike 
as patriotic staking their claims to the land meron benvenisti 
a former deputy mayor of jerusalem who publishes annual reports on 
the occupied territories said 
ilan 55 said denied that but he added this land is ours 
if an arab has the right to walk around tel aviv we certainly have 
the right to hike around our homes

jesse jackson on sunday accused his democratic 
presidential opponents of inconsistent policies toward south africa 
as the new york primary contest moved into its final hours with a 
flurry of ethnic campaigning 
with new polls indicating the race for new yorks 255 democratic 
convention delegates is tightening jackson michael dukakis and 
albert gore jr aired differences over policy toward south africa 
and the middle east as well funding for combating drugs 
the candidates also vowed to work for party unity regardless of 
which of them wins the democratic presidential nomination 
its too close to call proclaimed the new york daily news 
in a frontpage headline sunday as it released the findings of its 
latest poll 
the overall poll numbers based on responses from democrats 
questioned monday through thursday had dukakis in front of 
jackson 51 percent to 37 percent with gore trailing at 10 percent 
however the daily news reported that in the final two days of 
polling gore had begun to pick up support among likely democratic 
voters at the expense of dukakis 
the survey questioned 502 likely democratic voters and had a 
margin of error of 45 percentage points 
meanwhile polls by the washington postabc news and usa 
todaycable news network indicated the race was even tighter 
the washington postabc poll based on interviews friday and 
saturday nights and pubished monday showed dukakis with 46 percent 
support jackson with 40 percent and gore with 11 percent it also 
showed that dukakis and jackson each got about 40 percent support 
in new york city 
the survey with a margin of error of 8 percentage points was 
based on telephone interviews with 183 registered democrats who 
said they planned to vote in the primary 
the usa todaycnn survey taken friday saturday and sunday found 
dukakis with 46 percent support jackson 34 percent and gore still 
far behind at 9 percent 
the poll picked up some movement toward jackson on sunday 
handing him a slight lead over dukakis in new york city but 
dukakis had twice as much support as jackson in the citys suburbs 
and in upstate new york according to poll results published in 
mondays edition of usa today 
the survey questioned 846 registered democrats who said they 
were certain to vote tuesday and had a margin of error of 35 
percentage points 
just how many voters go to the polls on tuesday may be the 
crucial factor some observers said 
the race is getting closer and turnout is the key new york 
pollster lee miringoff head of marist colleges institute for 
public opinion said sunday 
a low turnout will favor jackson said miringoff because of the 
candidates near unanimous and highly committed support among new 
yorks black voters who generally make up about 25 percent of the 
vote in new yorks democratic primaries 
in a telephone interview with the associated press new york 
gov mario cuomo said he thought there could be a low turnout for 
the primary he also said he wouldnt be surprised by a jackson 
victory 
meanwhile dukakis defeated jackson by a 32 margin in arizonas 
democratic presidential caucuses saturday night 
when vote totals were completed early sunday dukakis had 54 
percent to 38 percent for jackson and 5 percent for gore that 
meant dukakis picked up 22 national delegates jackson received 14 
delegates and gore got none 
after their televised debate on wnbc dukakis and gore marched 
in a salute to israel parade on fifth avenue jackson passed up 
the parade and met with community leaders a session set up by one 
of his most prominent jewish supporters r peter straus president 
of the new york chapter of the american jewish committee 
after the meeting jackson was asked why he had passed up the 
parade he said we had to make a judgment about our time today 
my day is full and my outreach continues 
jackson refused to comment on new york city mayor edward koch 
calling him a liar 
interviewed on the abc television show this week with david 
brinkley the mayor said jackson had lied when he said he was the 
last person to speak with martin luther king jr before he died he 
also contended jackson had initially denied he had ever called new 
york hymietown a term widely viewed as antisemitic jackson 
later apologized for the remark 
im faulting him for lying do you want a president who 
under stress is not capable of telling the truth said koch 
after marching in the parade gore was touring hispanic italian 
and jewish neighborhoods while dukakis was attending a gaelic 
football game and then a reception with gov rafael hernandezcolon 
of puerto rico 
jacksons contribution to the ethnic mix was a fundraising 
event with chineseamerican businessmen 
the discussion of south africa began with the three candidates 
agreeing that they would oppose severing relations with the 
government of south africa even if it does not move to end 
apartheid 
thats not the approach said jackson i believe you have 
to talk with the enemy 
the differences between the candidates emerged when gore said he 
opposed sending arms to countries bordering south africa the 
socalled frontline states of tanzania zambia zimbabwe and 
mozambique 
i think that would be inviting a lot more bloodshed said 
the tennswee senator 
jackson said those countries ought to be able to defend 
themselves from south africas bombarding of their infrastructure 
and our investment 
dukakis agreed with gore saying i think the superpowers are 
supplying arms to too many countries as it is 
gore also quoted dukakis as saying he thought current funding 
was sufficient to deal with drugs 
the massachusetts governor replied that congress you and 
your colleagues had appropriated enough funds to get 
started on educational programs to combat drugs but said the 
reagan administration had not used it properly 
but wait but wait a minute said gore this is a major 
crisis the drug crisis deserves more attention 
jackson said that if he arrived at the democratic convention 
with the secondlargest bloc of delegates i certainly would have 
earned serious consideration for a spot on the ticket but he 
refused later to say whether he would accept the vice presidential 
nomination if it were offered 
asked if he would choose jackson as his running mate dukakis 
said i would not rule anybody out or in at this point 
all the candidates called for party unity jackson said we 
should not have the notion the attitude that if i dont win im 
going to take my marbles and go home

israel turns 40 this week beset by a rebellion 
among palestinians who have spent more than half that time under 
occupation and a wrenching debate on the young nations future 
the arab uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip has 
drained much of the joy from a yearlong birthday celebration that 
climaxes april 21 which coincides on the hebrew calendar this year 
with may 14 1948 the date israel was founded 
a poetry festival and a 10 million rock music extravaganza in 
the negev desert are going ahead but plans to bring singer barbra 
streisand tennis star chris evert and the rock group pink floyd 
collapsed 
officials had hoped to demonstrate israels achievements and 
acceptance during the anniversary year instead canceled plans and 
the absence of foreign heads of state underline its vulnerability 
much of israels success has been in developing military power 
the result of five wars with neighboring arab states for example 
it ranks sixth in the world in arms exports which bring in about 
1 billion a year 
there also is a flourishing cultural life especially in a range 
of music from hebrew punkrock to that great national cultural 
achievement the israeli philharmonic 
since dec 8 when the violence began israel has been consumed 
by the question of what to do with the territories captured from 
jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war for the first time 
the issue is likely to be the focus of elections now scheduled for 
november 
liberal politicians say 20 years of occupation has had a 
corrosive effect on morality and does not square with being a 
light unto nations the goal declared by israels first prime 
minister the late david bengurion 
abba eban elder statesman of the labor party said growth of 
character has not matched the countrys growth in material wealth 
and military power 
we anticipated that within a period of 40 years we would have 
outlived the rhetoric of struggle and resistance and would be 
moving into some kind of drama and romance in social creativity 
the former foreign minister said 
modern israel does not owe the same allegiance debt or 
devotion to its traditional jewish character and it very rarely 
compares its actions to criteria that come from the jewish ethical 
tradition 
he said democracy was being undermined by the emergency measures 
of occupation and the cooperative spirit of pioneer days was being 
supplanted by materialism 
such misgivings are not shared by the rising star of the 
conservative likud bloc benyamin netanyahu who recently resigned 
as ambassador to the united nations he said israels success 
borders on the miraculous 
half a century ago netanyahu said the jewish people had 
crawled from the holocaust and the possibility of building a 
national life seemed hopelessly remote 
yet in a few years the jews recovered their homeland fought 
off armies that assaulted them liberated their ancient capital 
built a modern economy theaters universities and concert halls 
and revived an ancient tongue he declared 
netanyahu whose brother yonathan was killed leading the daring 
1976 rescue of hijacked airline hostages at entebbe uganda said 
the arab threat is undiminished 
the grim truth remains that the majority of the arab world 
still refuses to accept israels right to exist and still seeks to 
wage war against it war by different means including the present 
means of mass violence and media stampede netanyahu said 
in the former ambassadors view withdrawal from the occupied 
lands would shrink israels waist to a 10milewide strip against 
the sea with thousands of young palestinians holding rockets 
instead of stones 
the left believes israel is strong and secure enough to risk 
trading land for peace and that greater danger lies in keeping the 
occupied territories and trying to rule the hostile and rapidly 
growing popuatlion of 15 million arabs 
palestinian intellectuals attribute the sudden explosion of 
anger and violence dec 8 to three factors 
the palestinian question was ignored by the ussoviet summit 
last december and given secondary priority to the iraniraq war at 
the arab summit in november 
prime minister yitzhak shamir expressed satisfaction with the 
status quo and a desire to make the occupied land a permanent part 
of greater israel 
daily frustrations about army rule radicalized younger arabs 
a generation of palestinians has been born and grown to 
adulthood since 1967 resentful of occupation and less intimidated 
by the might of the israeli military many also have been attracted 
to the moslem fundamentalism spreading through the arab world 
one result of these forces has been a young underground 
leadership of the palestine liberation organization that has taken 
charge of the rebellion and is directing it 
saeb erakat a political science professor at an najah 
university in the west bank said the uprising is a message to 
the israelis the americans and the arabs we dont want to become 
israeli we are not a minority but a people and therefore we 
demand our right to selfdetermination 
many israelis say the arabs fail to comprehend or accept the 
historical connection jews feel to the land 
yehuda avni immigrated from chicago in 1949 and built the vered 
hagalil ranch near the sea of galilee with his wife yona across 
the road from his stable of purebred arabian horses is the ruin of 
the home of an israelite who lived about 200 bc 
we both picked this site with its beautiful view for our 
farms said avni 60 i feel a kind of kinship with him i feel 
i am part of a chain the sense of continuity is something vivid 
and it gives depth to my life 
in efrat a jewish settlement eight miles south of jerusalem 
rabbi shlomo riskin showed a reporter the rocky hills on which he 
has founded a community of 300 mostly religious jews 
seeking to dispel the image of settler as fanatic riskin 
stresses his desire for coexistence with arabs 
the difficulty of achieving it is illustrated by his experience 
with majid a palestinian handyman who taught riskin arabic 
i studied with him a few times a week the rabbi said he 
had gefilte fish at my home on friday evening a number of times we 
had what i thought were very good relations 
then one day a bomb was planted just outside efrat and one of 
the prime suspects was majid who disappeared 
i teach my children and myself to respect every human being as 
innocent until proven guilty riskin said at the same time i 
have to make sure that i protect myself 
the arabisraeli conflict touches almost every aspect of life 
even the 110piece israel philharmonic 
ely eban 38 a clarinetist and son of abba eban said the 
unseen impact was brought home to him when he returned from 
studying in the united states in israel the tempo of life was 
rapid 
whenever i would hear myself playing something here it always 
seemed a little fast a little strident a little more nervous 
he said when you live here there is this rhythm that you take 
on and it does affect the music making

france recalled its ambassador 
to canada on sunday after 21 french nationals were arrested for 
illegally fishing in canadian waters 
the french citizens who had been protesting a fishing ban on 
french trawlers when they were arrested on thursday were released 
from jail on sunday following a bail hearing 
the french foreign ministry said the decision to recall 
ambassador philippe husson to paris was taken because of a 
worsening of the frenchcanadian dispute over fishing 
the trawler the fishermen were on was based in st 
pierremiquelon a group of small frenchheld islands south of 
newfoundland 
the islanders have been banned from their traditional fishing 
grounds in the gulf of st lawrence because of a dispute between 
canada and france over the size of the fishing boundaries around 
the islands the men are scheduled to appear in st johns for a 
preliminary hearing on oct 3 
canada has a lot of progress to make as a civilized country 
said albert pen a senator from the islands and one of the 21 
people who took part in the fishing protest 
also among the group was gerard grignon a member of the french 
chamber of deputies on the islands and victor reux and marc 
plantegenest two members of the islands territorial government 
in edmonton external affairs minister joe clark defended the 
arrests 
this is a matter which is essentially a fishery dispute a 
very important one it is capable of being resolved by 
negotiation said clark in the meantime if canadian law is 
breached canadian law will be enforced 
during the weekend president francois mitterrand of france said 
it was intolerable that the islanders were not able to fish 
normally in waters they have for a long time been accustomed to 
use for that work

law schools are receiving a flood of 
applications this year and the reasons include oliver north baby 
m robert bork black monday and la law admissions officers 
say 
however for some wouldbe lawyers its none of the above 
law school has always been in the back of my mind said 
harvard senior janet korins who has been accepted by harvard law 
school im sorry to disappoint everyone but i wanted to go 
before i watched la law 
ms korins is among this years 66790 or so law school 
applicants that the law school admissions council of newtown pa 
says represents a 16 percent increase over last year the jump has 
mystified admissions officers at some schools applications have 
hit record numbers 
the high number of applicants has made it even tougher to get 
into law schools the schools are seeing better qualified 
candidates including physicians successful business people and 
applicants with masters degrees 
people who wouldve been accepted last year might not be 
accepted this year said andrew cornblatt director of admissions 
for georgetown universitys law school 
georgetown leads the nation with 8500 applications a 32 
percent increase over last year and a school record cornblatt has 
been left wondering why among his best guesses are 
the irancontra hearing the robert bork confirmation hearing 
and the highly publicized baby m custody battle all of which 
showed the law in action 
the oct 19 stock market crash and the insider trading 
scandals which may have turned some people away from business 
school 
and the hit nbc television series la law which 
glamorizes the legal profession 
however other admissions officers say these explanations are 
speculation and dont seem to prove true when tested against fact 
for instance most law school applicants signed up for the law 
school aptitude test the standardized test used in admissions 
before the irancontra and bork hearings and the stock market crash 
and while la law was in reruns 
i have the same educated guesses as everybody else but my 
best guess is maybe its just laws turn again said edward g 
tom director of admissions and financial aid at berkeleys law 
school boalt hall 
boalt hall this year saw the largest oneyear jump in 
applications since 1970 the number of applications rose about 30 
percent from 4093 to 5282 said tom 
the university of michigan law school stopped taking 
applications at number 5500 which is up from last years total of 
4300 the school has 370 openings said allan stillwagon 
admissions officer 
about every forth or fifth application reports either an 
interest in law or renewed interest that mysteriously arose after 
watching the hours of iran and bork hearings said stillwagon 
seton halls law school here saw a 27 percent increase from 
1500 to 1832 said dean of admissions edward hendrickson who 
guessed that troubles on wall street might be a factor 
the mba might not be that attractive anymore he said 
elizabeth knier a university of california los angeles senior 
accepted by georgetown said she has considered law for some time 
but made her mind up after testing the business job market 
i was disappointed in the jobs that were offered and the jobs 
that werent offered she said however it wasnt my prime 
motivation ive always thought about law school 
courtney koger who was accepted by harvard law said she 
considered business school briefly but stuck to her original plan 
to study law 
id like to go into family law she said but i really 
knew that before the baby m case even hit the newspapers it didnt 
affect my decision noreen clohessy a senior at siena college in 
loudonville ny who applied to seton hall said she had taken 
prelaw classes as an undergraduate and always had the idea she 
would pursue law school after graduation 
its not because of la law she said

when alice lisquez opened a letter 
and found a 100 bill the thought of keeping the money never 
entered her mind 
it never occurred to me to take it lisquez said 
a georgia woman planning to use the cash on her vacation 
mistakenly sent 10 100 bills along with an order for some plants 
lisquez 47 usually spends her days opening about 1000 orders 
for michigan bulb co in one she opened about three weeks ago was a 
2184 order from mary duval of dahlonega ga for creeping phlox 
and peonies 
the big bills also were there 
lisquez told her supervisor sue barnstable who tracked down 
duval barnstable sent duval a 1000 check to her to replace the 
cash 
on thursday lisquez received a 100 bill and a silk scarf from 
duval as a reward 
lord its the least i could do duval said 
the package also contained two letters from duval one to 
lisquez and one to barnstable 
dear alice duval wrote i called your office to obtain 
your name and to thank you i like you am a working girl and i 
had saved most of the money haphazardly and converted it to the 
100 bills as a twenty gets easily spent 
it was for a badly needed vacation and thanks to you my plans 
do not have to be changed 
the note to barnstable praised lisquez for her honesty 
i still have difficulty accepting the fact that there is basic 
honesty practiced duval wrote i would never have known what 
happened to the money 
duval 63 said the return of the money has saved a monthlong 
trip to england she has planned for later this year 
ive never been there before said the head nurse at the 
infirmary at north georgia college 
office manager lyle hansen said he has seen a few mistaken 
mailings during the companys 43year history but never more than 
a phone bill or house payment that got switched around in the 
shuffle and never before in cash

massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
backers are hoping his victory over jesse jackson in arizonas 
democratic presidential caucuses will give him a boost heading into 
the crucial new york primary 
dukakis who took 54 percent of the vote to 38 percent for 
jackson picked up 22 delegates and six alternates in saturdays 
vote jackson got 14 delegates and four alternates 
gore who got only 5 percent of the vote was shut out because 
he failed to reach the 15 percent minimum in any one of arizonas 
five voting regions 
arizonas other five delegates to the democratic national 
convention in atlanta july 1821 are top party and government 
officials who thus far are uncommitted 
jose villarreal the dukakis state campaign director contended 
that the arizona win established dukakis as the undisputed 
frontrunner going into new york 
this sends two messages villarreal said one to new york 
that governor dukakis has established a momentum throughout the 
western states that is going to carry him to victory in new york 
the other message villarreal said is that al gore is no 
more gore has been winless since super tuesday 
richard ybarra the western states coordinator for dukakis 
said hes being called el nuevo kennedy in the barrios around 
phoenix 
other supporters however said the arizona victory was welcome 
but not overly significant 
i think its got zip effect in new york said dukakis 
campaign coordinator renz jennings new yorkers are as 
independent as you find however he said a loss to jackson in 
arizona would have hurt the massachusetts governor 
we did just what we needed to do he said we picked up 
delegates we beat gore to the point that he didnt even make the 
threshold to win delegates 
jacksons campaign said the arizona race had not been crucial 
i dont think the arizona primary is going to break someone 
into frontrunner status jacksons state director john norris 
said basically its still a horse race going into new york 
he also said jacksons showing was relatively good 
its pretty fair to say that we ran a strong second in 
arizona norris said it definitely beat expectations based on 
the polls which had given dukakis a stronger lead 
illinois sen paul simon who has put his campaign on hold got 
12 percent of the arizona vote while political extremist lyndon 
larouche had well under 1 percent and 17 percent expressed no 
preference 
gore spokeswoman sue laybe acknowledged we tried a grassroots 
campaign it didnt work very well with all the money going to new 
york there wasnt much we could do 
dukakis ran well ahead in four of arizonas voting regions 
while he and jackson were tied at 47 percent in western maricopa 
county which included south phoenix and its high minority 
population 
jackson also scored well in parts of pima county which includes 
tucson he won the rural counties of apache and coconino while 
dukakis took the other 11 rural counties 
party officials said 38464 of arizonas 680000 democrats 
voted for a slightly higher turnout than was predicted on a day 
that saw stormy weather across much of the state 
dukakis received 20814 votes to 14538 for jackson 1972 for 
gore 465 for simon 35 for larouche and 639 expressing no 
preference 
democrats on saturday also began the process of choosing the 
delegates who will actually go to the national convention 
thirtysix are being allocated in proportion to the caucus vote 
while the other five top party and elected officials are 
uncommitted

leaders of the black hispanic and liberal white 
forces backing jesse jackson in new yorks democratic presidential 
primary say they will turn their fire after tuesday on jacksons 
most vocal local critic mayor edward i koch 
but while a strong enough voting bloc has emerged to give 
jackson a shot at carrying the city in the threeway primary it is 
uncertain whether his coalition can survive without him and settle 
on a koch challenger 
its not going to be the same campaign said rep charles 
rangel dny a jackson supporter who said he would consider a 
mayoral race but it is true that we are bringing people together 
that we didnt have before 
jackson voters would be a hell of a base for someone in the 
mayoral race said pollster sergio bendixen you couldnt win the 
leadership of new york with just those groups but it would be a 
hell of a base 
for minority activists the problem in past elections has been 
agreeing on a challenger to koch who has held office since 1978 
blacks have favored a black candidate rangel noted while 
hispanics sought one of their own 
still kochs critics said the mayor himself has aided their 
cause by attacking jackson and saying jews would have to be 
crazy to vote for him koch last week endorsed underdog sen 
albert gore jr a jackson critic 
the one fellow who comes out the loser in this primary fight 
is ed koch said former us rep herman badillo an hispanic 
leader who also said he would consider running for mayor in 1989 
most everyone agrees that kochs behavior has been especially 
outrageous badillo said hes gone beyond the bounds of 
decency its really an antijackson campaign of the most 
vicious kind 
badillo supports massachusetts gov michael dukakis pointing up 
that not all blacks and hispanics are in accord on jackson in any 
case badillo said friday an antikoch coalition is not limited to 
jacksons camp 
the fact that some of us are supporting dukakis and some are 
supporting jackson has nothing to do with koch he said 
theres a total basis here for us being able to work together 
after next tuesday 
thus far though hispanics remain supportive of koch in a 
survey of hispanic democrats by bendixen last week 55 percent gave 
koch a favorable rating to 19 percent unfavorable 
his numbers are not weak enough that you could see that the 
hispanic community as base against him bendixen said 
but jackson should do well enough with new york hispanics to 
bring a sizable number to the democratic national convention with 
him as they work with jacksons other delegates theyll have 
some interesting experiences and that usually breeds cooperation 
and longterm type coalitions bendixen said 
koch opponents had hopes for such a coalitin surviving from the 
jackson campaign in 1984 it did not but rangel a walter mondale 
backer then noted that minority voters are far more strongly for 
jackson now 
in the city of new york he has brought together a lot of 
people some of whom have problems with the existing leadership in 
the city who have never worked together before said rangel who 
is black 
as for himself i would consider running for mayor if i had a 
group of people that really convinced me that i could do better 
serving the city of new york than i could do in the us 
congress said rangel 
badillo noted that he was ready to run in 1985 when black 
leaders opted instead for herman farrell the black democratic 
leader of manhattan who did poorly asked if he would run in 1989 
badillo said i cant tell what the black leaders are going to 
do if we can form a coalition i sure would

the man who leads 100000 of the nations 
hog farmers says his doctorate degree and university teaching 
experience are valuable on the farm and on the road promoting 
pork 
those skills coupled with a lot of practice have been very 
useful said pig farmer ray hankes i havent regretted the 
direction my career has taken not one little bit 
hankes 41 recently was elected president of the national pork 
producers council the 25yearold group says it has helped change 
consumers attitudes about pork and the way hogs are raised 
leading to the production of a more popular and leaner meat 
i guess our programs are working said hankes who earned 
his doctorate at the university of illinois in meat science and 
ruminant nutrition 
his main goal as president is to win nationwide approval for a 
mandatory levy on pork producers farmers will vote in september on 
the plan which would collect 25 cents for every 100 in hog sales 
to pay for market development and research 
hankes second goal is make pork even leaner perhaps by 
offering a cash bonus for hogs with less fat or by paying less 
money for those that are not as lean 
weve taken a lot of the fat off but theres still a lot of 
work to be done in this area said hankes

the debate over whether william 
shakespeare actually wrote the great literature and plays 
attributed to him may make for good drama itself 
the bard will go back to court sunday for a tongueincheek 
trial in which a prosecutor will argue that the william shakespeare 
who wrote plays poems and sonnets wasnt the man who lived and 
worked in stratforduponavon under various spellings of 
shakspere 
the prosecutor is mark mcpherson director of the daedalus 
agency a michiganbased investigative agency that has looked into 
such matters as the loch ness monster whether king arthur really 
existed and who put the bop in the bop she bop she bop 
the case against will shakspere will be heard at oakland 
community colleges royal oak campus where a collection of legal 
and literary experts will argue the merits of the case 
a lot of people think im doing this for the sheer pleasure of 
being an iconoclast mcpherson said this is not true ive had 
moments when i wished i was presenting the defense it would be so 
much easier 
of the 36 plays two long narrative poems and 154 sonnets 
written between 1593 and 1623 and attributed to shakespeare many 
were published anonymously while others were published by an 
author named william shakespeare mcpherson said 
in 1623 the works became identified with a man baptized april 
26 1564 in stratfordonavon as gulielmus shaksper or shakspere 
but mcpherson claims shakspere was busy suing debtors for 
pennies developing stratford and getting married while some 
struggling writer with a similar name penned the plays 
i believe that shakespeare wrote shakespeare mcpherson 
said i just dont know who shakespeare was the bridge from 
mr shakspere of stratford to the shakespeare of legend is shaky at 
best 
michigan court of appeals judge myron wahls will preside over 
the mock trial leading the defense will be detroit attorney and 
former judge peter b spivak there will be a celebrity jury plus 
an audience who will vote on the case

continental airlines faces possible fines of 
nearly 1 million for various safety violations dating to late 
1986 government officials say prompting a planebyplane 
inspection beginning today of the countrys fourth largest air 
carrier 
transportation secretary james burnley announced sunday that the 
federal aviation administration would expand its special safety 
probe of eastern airlines announced last week to continental as 
well because of the alleged violations already found 
both airlines are subsidiaries of texas air corp the nations 
largest airline holding company which itself is facing a review by 
the transportation department to determine whether its management 
and finances meet federal standards 
frank lorenzo chairman of texas air said continental would 
cooperate with the investigation as has eastern and that he 
expects the findings will show the airlines are being operated 
safely he blamed the two airlines problems on union leaders who 
he said are trying to bring the company down by raising safety 
concerns 
last week the faa slapped eastern which is the sixth largest 
airline with a 823000 civil penalty because of safety violations 
found last year the agency also began ramp inspections of eastern 
jets 
burnley said about 200 of easterns 267 aircraft have been 
inspected and 19 were temporarily kept from flying until problems 
were corrected 
were going to extend the ramp inspections intensive 
inspection that we began on eastern last wednesday to continental 
as well beginning tomorrow burnley said on nbctvs meet the 
press on sunday 
well have people wholl be walking around the planes and 
through them and talking to the maintenance personnel and the folks 
in the cockpit and making sure that anything that can be readily 
identified is correct he said 
burnley said the action was taken because a review of faa files 
showed that various faa offices around the country have almost a 
million dollars in proposed penalties against continental that 
are in various stages of enforcement action or under negotiations 
some of the violations which cover a period of more than a 
year date back to november 1986 and include the period in early 
1987 that continental absorbed the operations of new york air 
people express and frontier airlines according to faa spokesman 
bob buckhorn 
buckhorn said the violations including some in noncritical 
categories included problems in operations maintenance and 
airport security while some of the infractions were identified by 
faa inspectors others were brought to the attention of the agency 
by continental officials said 
the airline has been notified of the penalties according to 
burnley and is considering whether to pay them voluntarily 
lorenzo defended the operations at both eastern and continental 
theres nothing wrong with our operation the only thing wrong 
with our business is the fact that were trying to adjust and have 
to adjust costs at eastern which has lost 900 million since the 
deregulation in 1978 lorenzo said on meet the press 
when asked about easterns various problems including those with 
the faa and its poor ontime record and high number of consumer 
complaints lorenzo complained about trying to run an airline 
when you have two fifth columns within one the pilots and one the 
machinists union 
lorenzo accused the unions at eastern of being out just to 
tear the airline down the unions have accused lorenzo of 
siphoning off easterns most valuable assets to the detriment of 
eastern an allegation lorenzo denies 
lorenzo said despite easterns problems he has no plans or 
intentions to sell eastern saying the door is closed on that 
option 
texas air corp had record losses of 466 million last year 
including 241 million at eastern lorenzo has sought major 
concessions from employees at eastern to reduce costs but the 
unions have balked 
in addition to eastern and continental the houstonbased 
airline company also owns rocky mountain airways britt airways 
bar harbor airlines and provincetownboston airlines

for two weeks this summer the national mall 
will look like a slice of traditional new england life 
a giant clambake will be surrounded by boat makers cranberry 
growers and stonewall builders as the smithsonian institution 
spotlights massachusetts at its annual american folklife festival 
the festival is really kind of an innovative museum 
exhibition said festival director diana parker an indoor 
exhibition could show people folk pottery or folk instruments 
but to really get behind the genius of what those things are you 
have to see the thought process that creates it 
for the 22nd year the smithsonian will bring to washington 
people who have struggled to keep american folklife alive a 
program that folklife office director peter seitel calls an extra 
smithsonian museum for two weeks of the year 
organizers once again expect about 1 million people to visit the 
festival for 10 days ending independence day 
officials at the smithsonians office of folklife programs 
stress the interaction between the folk artists and the exhibit 
goers 
the people speak more eloquently for themselves than we could 
speak for them so wed rather have them telling what the pot is 
and why its important and why its made and how its made than 
having a museum label put on it that interprets through us why we 
think its important parker said 
the theme this year will focus on how traditional yankees such 
as farmers fishermen and craftsmen along with urban ethnic 
groups have adapted to modern life while holding on to their 
traditions 
exhibits will include an area featuring massachusetts industry 
from oldfashioned clockmaking to computer assembly plus displays 
of urban gardens with italians poles blacks and portuguese 
that shows how people who were raised in the country moved 
to the city and wanted to keep up that idea of a countryside 
feeling so they took a spare lot or their backyard and made it 
into a hidden countryside said betty belanus curator of the 
massachusetts section of the program 
the other end of the mall will feature a clambake ethnic crafts 
including an irish needleworker and cambodian kite maker an 
agricultural fair with maple syrup cranberries and tobacco stone 
wall builders a maritime exhibit featuring boat builders and sail 
makers an oxenpulling contest ethnic and holiday cooking and a 
half dozen bands 
smaller sections at this years festival will feature how four 
ethnic groups blacks chinese ethiopians and salvadorans 
migrated to the washington dc area and how their cultures have 
survived 
another section will feature soviet musicians in the united 
states as part of a cultural exchange 
parker remembered a recent festival that featured both eskimo 
culture and teenage breakdancers from innercity neighborhoods of 
philadelphia 
some of these people still write each other very close ties 
are created walls are broken down she said 
the festival will run from june 23 to june 27 and june 30 to 
july 4

a policy aimed at equalizing interstate 
longdistance telephone rates is not being phased out quickly 
enough to end discrimination against northern industrial states a 
research organization says 
the rate policy adopted after the breakup of american telephone 
amp telegraph co requires longdistance carriers to bear and share 
some of the equipment and distribution costs of local telephone 
companies 
but the northeastmidwest institute a research and lobbying 
group serving 18 states says pooling rates to spread out the 
nontraffic costs favors the south and west at the expense of the 
rust belt 
the federal communications commission requires the average 
telephone subscriber in the northeastmidwest to pay more for 
access than it actually costs to provide it said in a recent 
report on telecommunications policy 
the additional payments are then used to subsidize 
longdistance access for subscribers in states such as florida 
california and colorado 
although the fcc has begun eliminating pooling gradually the 
institute said it should have followed the lead of illinois and 
started the phaseout years ago 
illinois has been shifting an increasing share of nontraffic 
costs from longdistance carriers to localcalling companies since 
1984 madelon kuchera of the illinois commerce commission said 
friday 
every year that we transition more to the enduser the 
longdistance carriers are forced to pass those savings along in 
lower rates she said so within illinois longdistance rates 
have decreased almost 30 percent 
for example campp telephone co in the nations capital said it 
costs 71 cents for a threeminute directdial call from 
springfield to belleville in illinois during weekday business hours 
in comparison it said a similar call covering about the same 
distance in texas from austin to san antonio costs 99 cents 39 
percent more than the illinois call 
similar savings could be achieved on calls outside the states 
borders if the rate structure was not inflated to help other 
regions ms kuchera said 
weve always argued that we dont like subsidizing florida and 
california she said if we could have the rates reflect our 
true costs they would be much less

goose prairie has been described as 
a bit of heaven but residents fear a plan to enlarge a nearby 
reservoir may sink the outskirts of their pristine haven in a 
watery grave 
life in the cascade mountain village would be altered forever if 
the bumping lake reservoir is expanded to more than 13 times its 
present capacity in an effort to help droughtstricken northwest 
farmers residents say 
but after three decades of debate rep sid morrison rwash 
who represents bumping lake and goose prairie says he will sponsor 
a bill calling for the expansion other area congressmen have 
pledged to support the legislation 
it will commercialize the goose praire area complained chet 
clark who lives in the remote mountain village during the summers 
youll have people construction workers staying there 
it will have quite an impact on the hiking the fishing and 
the camping 
the village with five permanent residences 14 summer cabins 
and a couple of businesses is at the end of a narrow blacktop 
road near mount rainier national park 
huge evergreens absorb noise and sunlight giving the area a 
cathedrallike stillness the bumping river named by indians 
because of its rocks races a few feet beyond the edge of the road 
the snowcovered cascade range looms overhead 
goose praire is a bit of heaven in all seasons supreme 
court justice william o douglas a dogged environmentalist wrote 
in his 1974 autobiography go east young man 
douglas who grew up in nearby yakima first came to goose 
prairie as a boy and wrote of it in his memoirs after making a home 
there away from washington dc 
goose prairie is now a part of a technological society which 
may in time destroy it wrote douglas who died in 1980 but 
the values of the prairie are so precious so unique that all who 
love the goose prairies of this continent will put up a valiant 
fight to preserve them 
those words proved prophetic as environmental groups have lined 
up against the us bureau of reclamation plans to expand the 
reservoir 
douglas im sure would be turning over once again to see this 
perennial project has arisen said david ortman northwest 
representative for friends of the earth and a leading opponent of 
the project 
ortman said greater water conservation efforts not bigger 
reservoirs are needed the dam would inundate 1600 acres of 
neverlogged old growth forests some hundreds of years old which 
provide habitat for creatures not found elsewhere he said 
in addition there would not be enough water to fill the 
reservoir for many years leaving unsightly mud flats he said 
bumping lake is one of five reservoirs that provide irrigation 
to the halfmillionacre yakima project built in 1910 the 60foot 
dam backs up 33700 acre feet of water that drains from the slopes 
of the cascades providing water for the fertile but arid yakima 
valley 
the 150 million expansion project would include a 240foot high 
dam 4000 feet downstream from the existing dam 2 miles from goose 
prairie the new dam would create a 458000 acre foot storage 
reservoir 
a total of 3000 new acres would be inundated including some 
summer cabins and campgrounds at the lake the village itself is 
below the dam and would not be covered by water but expansion 
opponents fear their lifestyle would be disrupted and resources 
like hiking trails would be destroyed 
the dam is just outside the boundaries of the william o douglas 
wilderness area where such developments would be prohibited 
douglas opposed just about all development in the area 
i was teaching at yale when news came that a road would take 
the place of the trail to goose prairie he wrote i almost 
wept at the thought of potbellied cigarsmoking men roaming 
through a sacrosanct valley and polluting it with the noise and 
fumes of cars 
i wrote i protested complained but progress won out as it 
usually does

bermuda residents were the worlds most 
prosperous in 1986 with an average income of 20420 a year the 
world bank reports 
the swiss came next with an average of 17840 americans were 
third with 17500 
the us rank was due at least in part to the drop in the price 
of the dollar compared with the swiss franc and other major 
currencies a descent that began in 1985 
the rankings are contained in an updated atlas released in 
conjunction with last weeks semiannual meetings of the bank and 
its sister organization the international monetary fund 
the average income figure for japan was 12850 for west 
germany 12080 for france 10740 and britain 8920 the incomes 
do not necessarily represent living standards since prices and 
lifestyles differ so much from country to country 
citizens of brunei whose average income surpassed those of the 
united states in 1985 were down to 15400 because of the drop in 
the price of oil brunei is a small country on the southeast asian 
island of borneo ruled by an independent sultan 
at the low end of the scale the bank leaves out many countries 
like wartorn afghanistan and angola where it does not try to 
estimate incomes the lowest figure 120 a year per citizen 
comes from ethiopia where two armed revolts have been going on for 
many years 
in burkina faso formerly upper volta in southern africa the 
average is 150 burkina faso has had several coups but no 
largescale fighting 
there is no estimate for the soviet union which does not belong 
to the bank the average for 1054000718 chinese is put at 300 
down from 320 in 1985 despite official chinese claims of rapidly 
increasing prosperity 
in many third world countries and not only those that depend on 
oil production average incomes have been going down instead of up 
especially in africa and central america some have seen a steady 
drop since at least 1973 they include bolivia the central african 
republic gabon guyana guineabissau gambia guatemala 
honduras madagascar nicaragua nigeria south africa tanzania 
and zambia 
the report provides some consolations for lower incomes an 
australian baby born in 1985 for example could expect to live for 
78 years though his or her share of the national income was only 
12370 the us baby could count only 76 years though prospects 
for income were better 
french babies also had a 78year life expectancy spanish 
swiss dutch norwegian swedish and icelandic babies could all 
expect 77 years 
in the united states 99 percent of all children between the 
standard ages of six and 17 were reported in school in 1984 
because some prosperous countries start primary schooling at five 
the bank put their rates at 100 percent plus they include brunei 
denmark iceland and the french island of new caledonia in the 
south pacific 
japan despite its tradition of intensive education rates 97 
percent 
but in ethiopia and chad only one child in four gets to attend 
school

a nuclear age curriculum aimed at 
teaching students to peacefully resolve conflicts should be ready 
for oregon classrooms this fall despite concerns that it might 
traumatize school children 
the program was approved by the legislature after backers said 
students arent being offered the information they need to cope 
with a world bristling with the weapons of mass destruction 
we cant let kids grow up with no knowledge and no ability to 
handle what is probably the most important subject today and that 
is the threat of nuclear war said democratic state rep wayne 
fawbush chief sponsor of the curriculum legislation 
critics however said the curriculum will frighten and depress 
children 
to start pumping this type of stuff into them just seems to be 
forcing them to deal with things theyre not equipped to deal 
with said lon mabon executive director of the conservative 
oregon citizens alliance 
mabon also said his group suspects the real objective of the 
curriculums backers is to promote nuclear disarmament but 
supporters say thats not true 
under the law passed last year school districts will be 
encouraged but not required to use the materials in their 
classrooms 
chris dudley executive director of the oregon school boards 
association said he cant predict how many districts will use the 
curriculum once its drawn up 
it will vary around the state dudley said i think the 
portland school district expressed interest in it but i think 
there will be other districts where the community wont want to 
have that kind of curriculum 
the state department of education is creating the program for 
students in kindergarten through 12th grade it should be available 
to districts after sept 1 
among other things the law calls for the curriculum to 
improve students conflict resolution skills and encourage 
creative problem solving 
provide students with an understanding of other cultures and of 
the roots and nature of conflict between cultures 
present a discussion of the history of the arms race the 
potential effects and dangers of using modern weapons and 
strategies for preventing war in the nuclear age 
fawbush said he recognized the need for such a curriculum after 
the 1983 broadcast of the day after the television drama 
depicting a nuclear war 
that prompted a lot of national debate he said some 
schools handled it well but in other districts including hood 
river teachers were told not to talk about the issue with 
students 
don skinner of salem a statewide coordinator for oregon 
peaceworks a group that promotes peace issues said students want 
to become involved in the nuclear arms issue 
its very important for our kids to feel they have a role in 
this because its their future skinner said 
but state rep walter schroeder called the bill a scare 
tactic that could make students believe that the only way to make 
the world safe is to get rid of all nuclear weapons 
im one of those who believes in peace through strength not 
peace though weakness the republican legislator said 
fawbush denies theres any intent to promote a particular point 
of view 
all were seeking is a balanced approach to the subject he 
said some people will conclude that we must have clearly drawn 
lines and the means to defend those lines others will conclude 
that what we need to do is erase the lines if possible and reduce 
the points of conflict 
the citizens defense education committee a group that supports 
a strong national defense is monitoring the drafting of the 
curriculum to make sure it presents a balanced view 
bill moshofsky an attorney who is working with the group says 
the organization hopes the curriculum will mention the fact that 
nuclear arms so far have acted as a deterrent to another world war 
having a national defense capability is no different than a 
community having a police force said moshofsky a former state 
republican party chairman it recognizes that there are people 
out there who are a threat to our security

democratic leaders appear determined to hand 
president reagan sweeping trade legislation on a 
takeitorleaveit basis despite a chorus of administration veto 
threats 
the die is cast and well just have to see how the votes 
fall sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said as congress moved toward 
a headon collision with the reagan administration on the trade 
issue 
the root of the conflict is a provision that would require 
employers to provide advance notice of plant closings and 
largescale layoffs labor is pushing it while the administration 
is siding with business groups and threatening a veto 
following a decision by the leaders thursday night to retain the 
provision there were calls for reconsideration from lawmakers who 
said it was guaranteed to sink the entire trade bill 
but bentsen chairman of the senate finance committee said 
friday morning it was too late to remove the provision he also 
said it would be very difficult to pass a watered down version 
of the trade bill later in the year if reagan vetoed this one 
with the plantclosings provision in the bill reagan may well 
veto it and of course that would make our job tougher he said 
he acknowledged that trying to override such a veto could prove 
futile 
itll be close said bentsen who had pushed for a bill 
likely to gain a presidential signature rather than a veto 
that effort ended thursday when house speaker jim wright 
dtexas and senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva 
decided to support the plantclosings plan 
among top democrats only house ways and means committee dan 
rostenkowski dill was raising storm signals over that decision 
he said it could mean the nation will let trade policy drift for 
another three years and added that would be a tragedy 
republicans are proving less reluctant to forecast the result 
its time to write the obituary said sen john c danforth 
rmo one of the chief authors of the legislation which has been 
on the drawing board in congress for three years 
now is no time to let the trade bill go down the tubes 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said 
the plantclosings provision would require companies with at 
least 100 employees to give a 60day warning of impending factory 
shutdowns or layoffs involving 150 workers or more if that 
represented onethird of the work force 
layoffs of 500 or more would have to be accompanied by notice 
regardless of whether they involved onethird of the work force 
critics say the measure would prove too burdensome for business 
and could be the forerunner of more farreaching moves to strip 
corporate management of its powers labor secretary ann mclaughlin 
warns against the obvious legal battles confusion and 
confrontation between management and labor that will ensue if the 
provision becomes law 
supporters say too many breadwinners arrive for work only to 
find the plant gate locked and their jobs gone without warning 
vetoing the trade bill because of the plantclosing provision 
would be a triumph of rightwing ideology over fairness and common 
sense says sen edward m kennedy dmass if business really 
wants a worldclass work force to meet foreign competition then 
workers deserve help in adjusting to sudden business decisions that 
can devastate families and whole communities

with secular antiapartheid 
groups effectively silenced clergymen have sharpened their attacks 
on the whiteled government and rekindled a longstanding 
churchstate conflict 
spared in recent government crackdowns activist church leaders 
represent one of the few prominent opposition forces operating 
without restrictions 
in recent weeks anglican archbishop desmond tutu and other 
clergymen have organized and led demonstrations issued harsh 
antigovernment statements focused sermons on political themes and 
dared authorities to act against them 
the churches have been pushed to the front line of the 
struggle said the rev alan boesak president of the world 
alliance of reformed churches we have always protested against 
apartheid we must now go over to participate in the resistance 
against apartheid 
although president pw bothas national party government has 
refrained from clamping down on the clergymen it has attempted to 
undercut the credibility of tutu boesak and other prominent 
ministers 
botha regularly refers to south africa as a country guided by 
christian principles yet pointedly tells antiapartheid clergymen 
they have no business in politics 
in recent letters to activist church leaders botha said the 
clergymen love and praise the outlawed african national 
congress guerrilla movement with its marxist and atheistic 
ideology 
you embrace and participate in their call for violence 
hatred sanctions insurrection and revolution botha said the 
question must be posed whether you are acting on behalf of the 
kingdom of god or the kingdom promised by the anc 
i work for gods kingdom replied tutu winner of the 1984 
nobel peace prize for whose kingdom with your apartheid policy 
do you work for 
at one point the anglican church threatened to sue botha 
saying his statements were defamatory 
i would like that responded botha then the government 
will come forward with all the knowledge and facts it has at its 
disposal 
botha did not elaborate 
the longsimmering churchstate feud began to boil over after 
the government on feb 24 banned 18 leading antiapartheid 
organizations from participating in politics church leaders 
marched on parliament on feb 29 to protest the ban and 25 
clergymen including tutu were briefly arrested 
in early march church leaders formed the committee for the 
defense of democracy in a bid to fill the void created by the 
government crackdown but within days law and order minister 
adriaan vlok barred the new organization from performing any 
activities or acts whatsoever 
boesak reported march 11 that his house had been stoned and that 
he had received death threats he said that if anything happened to 
him suspicion should fall on the south african government and the 
police 
two weeks later police searched the home of a catholic bishop 
edward adams and confiscated documents related to local 
organizations in the southern cape province 
the state is intent on an open confrontation with the 
church the southern african catholic bishops conference said in 
a statement condemning the search 
anglican bishops backed by archbishop of canterbury robert 
runcie in britain declared the government had launched a 
carefully planned attack on tutu boesak and others aimed at 
portraying them as marxists and isolating them from their churches 
as a prelude to state action against them 
however bothas verbal attacks on activist clergy have won 
support from sectors of the white community including the dutch 
reformed church the largest white denomination 
in this deeply religious country the dutch reformed church has 
long had close links to the government and maintained until 1986 
that apartheid was justified in the bible 
apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 
256 million blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 million 
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts schools 
and health services 
dutch reformed leaders said recently that black clergy do not 
represent the christian church when they confront the state the 
leaders called on tutu and boesak to divorce themselves from this 
impious road and to discuss their problems openly with botha and 
vlok who are both avowed christians 
the antiapartheid clergy are denounced frequently in letters to 
the editor in the progovernment newspapers 
these men are doing satans work said one recent letter in 
the citizen a johannesburg daily it is hoped that these 
troublemakers are dealt with and not to worry about the cloth they 
wear 
but the criticism appears only to have strengthened the 
ministers resolve to confront the government 
the government of south africa has signed its own death 
warrant boesak said in a recent sermon in cape town no 
government can challenge the living god and survive 
i am not going to allow this government to choose my friends 
for me tutu said at the same service if teaching the gospel 
of jesus christ is going to lead me into trouble tough luck

tony leddy a southwest kansas farmer 
received an unwelcome 75000 surprise in his mail earlier this 
year 
a letter notified leddy of a near tripling of the price of 
natural gas used to power irrigation pumps supplying water for 
2900 acres of land that he and his fatherinlaw farm near the 
community of ulysses 
the increase will raise his yearly bill from about 24000 to 
nearly 75000 making irrigation fuel the single largest expense 
for his farming operation 
i know if the average consumer had a 300 percent jump in their 
natural gas bill washington would sure hear about it says 
leddy 34 who has been farming for 14 years 
if their gas bill would go from 45 to 150 a month then 
something would be done but were a small isolated pocket of 
individuals out here and dont have the masses to support that kind 
of an effort 
legislation has been introduced in congress to roll back the 
prices increases and similar relief proposals have been offered in 
state legislatures in kansas and oklahoma but with a doubtful 
outlook for legislation farmers also are negotiating with gas 
companies to try to obtain lower prices 
farmers say they could be forced to abandon irrigation in some 
cases and that prospect threatens not only the livelihoods of farm 
families but the regions fragile agriculturally dependent economy 
its very obviously going to eliminate some people from the 
business without a doubt says randal loder a garden city kan 
farmer 
the culprit according to irrigators is a 1986 order by the 
federal energy regulatory commission raising the maximum price that 
can be charged for natural gas in production before 1978 
in effect the government freed gas producers to seek higher 
prices from their pipeline purchasers but that also translated 
into bigger bills for irrigators who buy unprocessed gas straight 
from the wellhead 
frankly we were not surprised there was an increase but the 
surprise was that it was so dramatic so quick says larry 
kepley a board member of the southwest kansas irrigators 
association 
the first any of the producers knew was here came a bill that 
translated into three times as high as any they had been paying 
before 
farmers in southwest kansas and the oklahoma panhandle a dry 
region transformed into an agricultural oasis through irrigation 
sit atop the hugoton gas field one of the largest in the world 
according to kepley there are about 11500 gaspowered 
irrigation wells in southwest kansas and more than 3000 in 
oklahoma 
because the hugoton field has been in production for decades 
its gas has been some of the cheapest in the nation for pipelines 
and their utility customers 
the ferc order was designed to bring down highpriced gas at the 
same time allowing cheaper regulated gas to rise to market levels 
in leddys case the cost jumped from 53 cents to 150 for a 
thousand cubic feet or mcf 
loder saw his gas costs go from 55 cents to 124 and 150 an 
mcf for some of his 14 wells yet he continues to see no drop in 
price for one well that costs 425 an mcf ive been hit in the 
pocketbook extensively he complains 
gas producers defend the ferc order 
its worked pretty well says mike waters a spokesman for 
the natural gas supply association a producer group 
john stow a spokesman in washington for amoco production co 
one of the companies that operates in the hugoton field says 
irrigators are not treated differently than the companys other gas 
customers he says the company also opposes any legislation to 
control gas prices for irrigators 
but irrigators contend they should be treated differently most 
of their gas purchases come during the spring and summer when 
residential use is lowest and they usually buy raw sometimes 
lowquality gas 
few alternatives are available farmers in southwest kansas say 
diesel fuel and electricity are too expensive to replace natural 
gas 
compounding the problem is the uncertainty of future prices the 
ferc order allows what in effect are floating prices some 
irrigators were hit with a doubling or tripling of prices early 
this year but then saw them return months later to 50 cents to 60 
cents 
irrigators say the changing prices make it nearly impossible to 
accurately project their production expenses can leave them short 
of cash and ruin their cropping plans 
it makes it real difficult to plan and your banker sure 
doesnt understand it says kansas state rep gene shore who has 
sponsored legislation in the legislature to help irrigators 
leddy for example prepared some irrigated acreage last fall 
for growing corn that was months before he received his january 
price increase notice he intends to stick with his irrigation 
plans but we are monitoring all our expenses right down to the 
penny 
we just feel like no major business can really truly absorb a 
300 percent jump on something that is a major input like natural 
gas is for us says leddy they would try to do everything they 
could to alleviate the problem

nine virginia school teachers will become 
peace corps volunteers in ghana for a year as part of an effort to 
double the number of volunteers abroad the peace corps announced

years will help teachers in ghana develop new courses said peace 
corps director loret miller ruppe

from many of the 60 countries where volunteers now serve more us 
educators will be enlisted under the new leadership for peace 
program ms ruppe said

serious crime reports to police rose for a 
third straight year in 1987 but the rate of increase was less than 
half that of the previous two years the fbi says 
reports of serious crime were up in all regions of the country 
except the west the bureau said in a report issued over the 
weekend nationally the 2 percent increase in 1987 followed rises 
of 5 percent in 1985 and 6 percent in 1986 
the amount of violent crime reported to police in 1987 edged 
down 1 percent the fbi said but the level of property crime was 
up 2 percent 
the fbis crime index level was up 1 percent in the midwest 3 
percent in the northeast and 4 percent in the south the west 
experienced the only decline moving downward 1 percent 
across the country the number of reported aggravated assaults 
rose 2 percent from 1987 while larcenies rose 3 percent and motor 
vehicle thefts rose 5 percent according to the preliminary 
figures those three categories of offenses traditionally account 
for about 70 percent of the major crime reported to the fbi by 
police departments around the country 
the number of murders reported to police fell by 4 percent last 
year forcible rapes dropped by 1 percent robberies by 5 percent 
burglaries by 1 percent and arsons by 5 percent 
it is difficult to determine whether the fbi crime data gathered 
from police departments signify an actual increase in crime levels 
or if victims are simply coming forward more frequently to report 
the offenses than they did in the past 
a survey last month by the justice departments bureau of 
justice statistics found that 37 percent of serious crimes were 
reported to police agencies last year compared with 32 percent 
when the bureaus survey was first instituted in 1973 
the bureaus survey of households which measures crime that is 
both reported and unreported to police found that the amount of 
crime in the united states last year remained stable 
the fbi report and the bureau study both recorded declines in 
crime levels during the first half of the decade many researchers 
forecast an increase in crime in coming years as young people in 
increasing numbers move into the most crimeprone age group of ages 
15 to 24

the pilots of a small commuter plane that 
burst into flames before crashing into a passenger ramp told 
investigators late sunday the fire erupted so quickly they had 
little time to make an emergency landing 
carl carlson the pilot of horizon air flight 2658 from seattle 
to spokane and mark hilstad the copilot made the comments to 
national transportation safety board investigators in a closeddoor 
meeting the comments were overheard by reporters outside 
ntsb officials and the pilots declined to comment to reporters 
at the meeting a an airport hotel here 
carlson and hilstad related the events aboard the de havilland 
dash 8 which crashed friday into a passenger concourse loading 
ramp at seattletacoma international airport 
all 40 people aboard the aircraft survived the crash which 
occurred after the engine caught fire following takeoff amid 
overcast skies 
less than a minute after the fire report the crew reported 
control problems and attempted an emergency landing forty seconds 
later the plane came to a stop next to the b concourse after 
clipping three passenger ramps the burning plane was drenched in 
firefighting foam and the blaze was quickly extinguished 
of the 19 aboard who were injured three remained in hospitals 
sunday hospital officials said one was in serious condition 
carlson of the portland area told officials he didnt know 
there was a fire on the plane until it made a final turn for the 
runway during its attempt to make an emergency landing a 40 
percent to 60 percent loss in torque in the right engine prompted 
him to head back according to the remarks overheard by reporters 
after hilstad told him the landing gear was down as they made 
their final approach carlson heard someone say over the tower 
radio frequency that the plane was on fire 
as they started the descent carlson and hilstad said they 
realized they were going too fast and they appeared to be coming 
down too high to adequately slow down however they said they had 
no choice but to land 
carlson said he thought he was still in a comfortable range to 
maneuver the plane to a stop 
hilstad said he and carlson applied full force to the brakes and 
locked the emergency brake in an effort to stop but could not 
avoid hitting the ramp 
ntsb investigators have said that an initial review of tapes of 
tower communications with the plane indicated the first mention of 
fire came from another aircraft that was not immediately identified 
youve got a fire on that airplane horizon the voice on 
the tape said 
hilstad described the fire as a big reddish ball of flame 
protruding forward from the wing and said it appeared while the 
plane was at about 2000 feet going 205 to 230 mph 
at a news conference in seattle late sunday ntsb member joseph 
t nall said fuel was spotted on the planes wing by a passenger 
when asked if the leaking fuel could have caused an explosion 
nall said thats speculation we have no way of knowing that 
investigators have an unusual videotape of the planes landing 
from an airport camera they also have found a panel that fell from 
the planes burning right engine while it was turning to return to 
the airport 
carlson refused to discuss the crash friday night when he was 
released from a hospital after being treated for back pain horizon 
officials said he had been told to make no public comment until 
after interviews with investigators 
ntsb spokesman ted lopatkiewicz said the wrecked plane may be 
moved into a hangar monday for closer scrutiny 
had it not been for the quick application of foam and their 
the fire crews efforts we could easily have lost 40 people 
rick smith chief of the port of seattle fire department said 
sunday after watching the videotape of the crashlanding 
the videotape was made from a camera mounted permanently atop 
the control tower one of several around the airport said charles 
blood seatac operations manager 
the jumpy blackandwhite tape shows the burning craft initially 
as two tiny specks of light leading a thin trail of black smoke 
the craft approached descended irregularly and touched down 
roughly 
then it careened past a couple of racing firetrucks and across a 
grass median onto a taxiway that runs parallel to the concourse 
the plane stopped short of a boeing 747 parked in its path 
blood did not know if anyone was aboard the jumbo jet 
there was damage to three jetways a baggage car a truck and 
the roof of the concourse where a piece of propeller landed said 
margo spellman of the airport staff three flight gates were closed 
by damage 
found saturday was a 2by3foot metal door that gives mechanics 
access to the right engine nall said it fell off the burning 
engine pod and was found a mile and a half from the airport 
the planes turboprop engines were made by pratt amp whitney 
canada 
horizon president john kelly said it was the airlines third 
incident in 19 months involving the engines on the dash 8 model but 
the first passenger injuries in the companys sevenyear history 
last june an engine fire in a horizon dash 8 was detected 
shortly after takeoff from seatac and the plane landed safely at 
nearby king county international airport in september 1986 another 
plane returned to seatac when an engine malfunctioned and had to 
be shut down shortly after takeoff 
officials at the de havilland division of boeing canada and 
pratt amp whitney canada said in telephone interviews they knew of no 
recurrent problems

us officials remain skeptical of soviet 
explanations for a mysterious anthrax outbreak in 1979 despite a 
recent public relations blitz by the soviet government 
the carter administration demanded a full accounting from the 
soviets in 1980 saying it had disturbing indications that the 
epidemic was caused by some sort of lethal biological agent 
but according to a lecture and slide show presented by soviet 
health officials over the last week in washington baltimore and 
cambridge mass the outbreak stemmed from a batch of contaminated 
bone meal fed to livestock whose meat in turn caused the deaths 
of 66 people in sverdlovsk a city of 12 million in the ural 
mountains 
the longawaited soviet explanation leaves many questions 
unanswered said gary b crocker a state department analyst 
specializing in questions relating to soviet military use of 
biological and chemical weapons it does not fit with the 
evidence and facts we have collected on the issue he said 
in 1986 the pentagons defense intelligence agency released a 
report alleging that the anthrax came from the microbiology and 
virology institute a topsecret military research facility in 
sverdlovsk 
the pentagon report said a pressurized system probably 
exploded at the institute spewing as much as 22 pounds of 
anthrax spores into the air and that hundreds of soviet 
citizens died 
anthrax an infectious disease which occurs naturally is 
considered a deadly candidate for use in biological weapons a 1975 
treaty signed by both superpowers bars possession of biological 
weapons and significant quantities of biological agents but allows 
research ostensibly aimed at biowarfare defenses 
james oberg author of the recent book uncovering soviet 
disasters said he believes the soviet health officials are 
telling the truth in blaming the outbreak on a batch of 
contaminated meat rather than germwarfare experiments 
but they are not telling the whole truth said oberg 
they should have said this eight or nine years ago said 
oberg who urged the soviets to open the sverdlovsk research 
facility to western observers the damage has been done he 
said it will take a lot more of this kind of disclosure to undo 
the damage that soviet paranoid secrecy has inflicted on 
international relations 
the soviets had long denied the us allegations but had 
offered little evidence to refute them the more detailed rebuttal 
last week came from dr pyotr n burgasov former deputy soviet 
health minister dr vladimir n nikiforov chief infectious 
disease specialist at the moscow institute for the advanced 
training of physicians and dr vladimir p sergiyev of the soviet 
health ministry 
the heart of their argument bolstered by gory autopsy slides 
was that the victims suffered severe damage to their intestines 
indicating they ate rather than inhaled the anthrax 
the dia report had said hundreds of soviet citizens died from 
inhalation of anthrax and that others suffered after eating the 
meat of animals who had inhaled the deadly spores 
the soviet officials declined to answer questions about the work 
performed at the sverdlovsk research lab but in circumstantial 
refutation of the us allegations they said no one at the lab 
became ill during the outbreak

a federal audit being prepared on the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp will show that its deficit more 
than doubled in 1987 to as much as 13 billion according to a 
report published today 
the washington post said government estimates indicate that 
fslics deficit could reach 30 billion to 65 billion in the next 
few years it attributed its report to government sources 
the deficit at the end of 1987 for fslic which insures deposits 
up to 100000 and manages failed sampls more than doubled the 63 
billion deficit at the end of 1986 the newspaper said 
the deterioration in fslics financial condition last year 
occurred despite government efforts to stabilize the sampl industry 
last august president reagan signed legislation recapitalizing 
fslic which was technically insolvent and unable to deal with 
failed sampls the legislation provides 108 billion over three 
years from the sale of bonds to be paid off by a special 
assessment on profitable institutions 
m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
which regulates 3126 savings institutions said last month that 
its too soon to consider bailing out fslic wall said the fund had 
about 20 billion to work with over the next three years 
in 1987 sampls suffered net withdrawals in seven of the first 
nine months and onethird of the industry lost money pushing 
overall 1987 losses to a postdepression record of 68 billion 
but the bank board reported earlier this month that net deposits 
at federally insured savings institutions had grown for the fifth 
consecutive month in february continuing a trend begun after the 
october stock market crash 
the board said net deposits increased by 52 billion in 
february compared with a 11 billion withdrawal in february 1987 
since the stock market crash 62 billion moved into sampl accounts 
in october 32 billion in november 26 billion in december and 
54 billion increase in january 
the increase came despite the deteriorating financial condition 
of many thrift institutions particularly in texas which has been 
hit hard by the depressed energy and real estate markets 
the post reported that congressional sources said the final 
figures for the fslic audit still were being worked out between the 
auditors and the bank board

louise nevelson who turned scavenged balusters 
bedposts and odd bits of wood into masterpieces of modern 
sculpture has died she was 88 
mrs nevelson who had been in poor health for several months 
died sunday at her home 
mrs nevelson was a serious artist for half a century but her 
work was largely ignored until the late 1950s 
she remained active almost to the end having recently finished 
a 35foot black steel sculpture being installed at the national 
institutes of health in bethesda md a show of her 1950s work is 
scheduled for this summer at the pompidou center in paris 
a regal woman who wore mainly black and preferred that color for 
her creations as well mrs nevelson was generally regarded as one 
of the nations greatest and most prolific sculptors 
her confidence in her work never flagged despite the early lack 
of recognition outside an intimate circle of artistic friends 
when success did come mrs nevelson accepted it with aplomb and 
without compromise 
i have all the commissions i want but on my own terms nobody 
tells me what to do they take what i give them she said in a 
1983 interview with the associated press 
the artist was perhaps best known for blackonblack wood boxes 
assembled from found objects put together in unusual ways she 
also worked in white and in gold but invariably in monochromes in 
later years mrs nevelson used metal and plexiglass as well as 
wood 
her work was big dramatic often dark and intense some critics 
felt it was cold airless and sterile others called it graceful 
warm haunting and uplifting 
critic hilton kramer in an introduction to nevelsons world 
in 1983 praised her as having expanded the scale drama and 
psychological intensity of modern art much as martha graham had 
influenced dance 
once she emerged as a major figure in the late 50s she could 
never again be ignored kramer wrote she turned out to be one 
of those artists who changed the way we look at things 
mrs nevelson lived in adjoining houses on spring street in 
manhattans little italy section behind a wroughtiron door were 
17 rooms and a garage studio where she did much of her wood work 
it was not unusual to find odd assortments of wood in the studio 
finials newels barrel tops steering wheels and packing crate 
pieces that mrs nevelson or her longtime assistant diana 
mackown culled from junk piles 
friends also contributed raw materials such as sculpture bases 
organ pipes boxes or bits of furniture that the artist would turn 
into murals constructed walls or standing sculptures 
mrs nevelson was born in kiev russia a few months before the 
turn of the century the date never precisely recorded her family 
the berliawskys came to the united states when she was 4 and 
settled in rockland maine 
louise berliawsky decided on her career at an early age 
i felt like an artist you feel it just like you feel youre 
a singer if you have a voice she once said i have that 
blessing and there was never a time that i questioned it or 
doubted it 
in 1920 she married charles nevelson a wealthy new york ship 
owner and moved to the city they had a son myron and separated 
in 1931 
mrs nevelson traveled to munich where she studied with hans 
hofmann upon the rise of the nazis she returned to her new york 
studio to work with paint plaster terracotta marble aluminum 
bronze and odd bits of wood 
i always wanted to show the world that art is everywhere 
except it has to pass through a creative mind she said 
but it was not until her 60th year in 1959 that mrs nevelson 
was recognized as a major artist with dawns wedding feast her 
first allwhite environment 
it was a majestic series of standing and assembled columnar 
bride groom wedding cake and chapel constructed in mrs 
nevelsons favorite medium pieces of wooden junk 
in succeeding years mrs nevelson produced her notable 
allblack sculpture house mrs ns palace and the white chapel 
of the good shepherd in st peters church in new york 
her 1964 homage to 6000000 an enormous painted wood 
memorial of the jews killed in the holocaust sold for 110000 in 
1980 two nevelson sculptures dedicated in 1983 were commissioned 
by the american medical association in washington at a cost of 
640000 
age did not slow her in her 84th year mrs nevelson embarked 
on creating the sets and costumes for a production of the opera 
orfeo and euridice in st louis in 1985 she was among the 
first recipients of the national medal of the arts 
mrs nevelson studied religion philosophy and literature and 
spoke in metaphysical terms of the creative energy she seemed to 
have in abundance but she rejected those who saw her preoccupation 
with black boxes and bits of wood as a search for truth or some 
deeper meaning of life 
im not looking for the truth im looking to fulfull my life 
to its fullest capacity she said some say you did it for the 
world i said no i did it for myself what is the world 
its a land we dont know too much about 
survivors include her son and three granddaughters funeral 
services will be private a memorial service will be announced at a 
later date

while workers put the finishing touches on this 
citys new pastelpink basketball arena about 700 ragged hungry 
men a block away cling to the gate of a homeless shelter waiting 
for the days only meal 
for five years city planners have tried to move the shelter in 
the overtown section scene of the 1982 riots for fear families 
venturing downtown to watch nba stars like larry bird or magic 
johnson will be hassled by vagrants beggars and drug addicts 
im sure the shelter is doing fine work but some of the 
clientele tend to congregate on the sidewalk all day said 
matthew schwartz deputy director of miamis department of 
development its an environment thats simply not conducive to 
the arena the area development or any kind of business 
most of the homeless who gather at the camillus house shelter 
for the 3 pm soup line know little about the 525 million miami 
arena the citys fledgling nba franchise or the planned 150 
million project to rejuvenate the blighted area but they are 
painfully aware they have never been a part of the big plans 
its another roundup said cc williams a 28yearold 
exconvict who spends the night in abandoned warehouses and 
sometimes finds daylabor jobs the police came and took us away 
before the orange bowl and when the pope came through this is the 
same kind of thing 
people drive through here on their way back from work and they 
stare at us like were animals at the zoo said terence radd a 
22yearold detroit native who says he has turned to petty crime 
for survival i know were probably an embarrassment but weve 
got a little pride too 
brother paul johnson who operates camillus house for the 
brothers of the good shepherd says he is not opposed to progress 
but doesnt want to see the homeless get a raw deal 
i love basketball just like everyone else but since when do 
the recreational needs of the wealthy become more important than 
the basic needs of human beings he asserted 
the city has offered just over 1 million for the halfblock 
camillus house property 
weve been here 30 years it wasnt our idea to move 
johnson said adding that he thinks its worth 2 million 
but schwartz said that figure is out of line the city 
has limits as to what it can pay 
under public acquisition laws the city has the right to condemn 
camillus house and take the property but johnson said if that 
happens he will sue for the true value of the land plus hefty 
damages a suit schwartz acknowledges the city probably would lose 
with the 16500seat arena set to open in july schwartz says 
the arenas operators and owners of the miami heat basketball 
franchise are putting subtle pressure on the city to move camillus 
house 
the heat which tips off its national basketball association 
schedule in the arena in november has publicly steered clear of 
the homeless controversy for fear it could hurt the teams image 
team owners lewis schaffel and zev bufman refused comment 
the arena is the centerpiece of a city plan to turn the overtown 
slum into a thriving middleincome community with four residential 
complexes hotels shops and a cultural center nearby are the 
yearold bayside festival marketplace and newly opened bayfront 
amphitheater 
the camillus house has plans of its own if it is bought out 
johnson has already purchased a 18acre lot on the other side of 
downtown near the city police station to serve the homeless who he 
said number 8700 in summer and 10000 in winter in dade county 
the city just seems to think that if it ignores these people 
long enough they will go away johnson said

us warships on monday attacked two 
offshore iranian oil facilities in the southern gulf in retaliation 
for a mine blast that ripped open the hull of an american frigate 
last week 
the official islamic republic news agency said the warships 
first struck the sassan platform at 9 am 130 am edt 
twentythree minutes later they blasted the nasr platform on the 
nearby sirri island 
irna monitored in cyprus noted that the aggressive us 
attack came after the united states had blamed iran for sowing 
mines in the waterway one of which blasted the hull of the uss 
missile frigate samuel b roberts 
gulfbased western diplomats and shipping sources said the 
sassan platform was ablaze after the attack but said they could 
not immediately tell how many warships participated in the attack 
in washington the white house confirmed at a news conference 
early tuesday that the us warships had shelled the iranian 
offshore oil platforms in retaliation for sowing mines in the gulf 
the shipping executives said a number of salvage tugboats were 
en route to sassan and nasr platfores these tugs were requesting 
permission from the american warships to let them rescue survivors 
and help extinguish fires 
the americans the executives said told the tugs they may 
rescue survivors but they may not participate in any firefighting 
the two targets were pounded shortly after a warning from the 
us warships to iranian workers to evacuate the platform and the 
island 
shipping executives said their monitors picked up a radio 
message at 900 am 1 am edt from the us warships to the 
sassan platform telling workers to evacuate the facility saying it 
will be shelled in five minutes 
sassan is sister platform to rostam which was wrecked by 
american gunners in october 1987 when the iranians fired a 
chinesemade silkworm missile into the usflagged kuwaiti oil 
tanker eighteen persons were injured in the tanker attack 
including the captain 
us officials have said there was substantial evidence that 
iran planted a mine that heavily damaged the hull missile frigate 
uss samuel b roberts in the central gulf last week and injured 10 
crewmen 
the injured crewmen were injured and flown by helicopter to a 
medical facility aboard the uss trenton 
the four most seriously injured were moved to bahrains 
salmaniya hospital and later flown aboard a special us air force 
jet to west germany for further treatment and reunion with families 
the frigate was towed to the dubai ship repair yard on saturday 
and knowledgeable sources said it was not in danger of sinking 
despite enormous damage to the hull and engine room 
circumstances of the attack monday on sassan were very much 
similar to those that preceded the shelling of rostam last 
october said one dubaibased maritime salvage agent who spoke 
on condition of anonymity after a fiveminute warning the 
american guns blazed away at the platform he said of the attack 
on rostam 
a multinational minesweeping effort has found six mines in the 
central gulf area where the samuel b roberts was hit on thursday 
according to us navy sources the mine sweeping task force 
included six us ocean mine sweepers four british units two 
belgium two dutch and four italian 
the uss trenton which is an amphibious transport ship was 
accompanying the task force and acting as the overall command ship 
us defense officials suspect the mines are recently laid navy 
sources said they said the mines looked clean and free of seaweed 
indicating they had not been in the water for long the sources 
said the explosives were contact mines the same type of mines 
previoulsy located 
the roberts is part of the us middle east force which was 
bolstered in the gulf last summer when kuwait registered 11 of its 
tankers in the united states to entitle them to us navy 
protection against iranian threats 
the bridgeton the first of the flagged tankers struck a mine 
during the first us escorted tanker convoy last july 
the navy then conducted at least 55 other convoys through the 
550mile length of the waterway between kuwait and the strait of 
hormuz outlet of the gulf without incident 
the navy also spearheaded a massive minehunting operation with

attack on the uss samuel b roberts the presidential

a recent classified ad in an east german 
newspaper offered this deal prepared to exchange a luxury 
apartment in east berlin for a hole in the wall 
true as much as any of the hundreds of anecdotes in a newly 
released compilation entitled the jokes of oppression the humor 
of soviet jews 
jews may not be free in the soviet union but the jewish joke is 
it doesnt fear jails or labor camps escapes detection by the 
kgb targets sacred institutions and venerated leaders and 
permeates every nook of society 
in the absence of an open press in this kind of 
claustrophobic stifled society where publicly people wear one 
kind of face and privately an entirely different type these jokes 
are of great significance says the books coauthor david 
harris 
harris the washington representative of the american jewish 
committee spent 10 years collecting the jokes from jews living in 
the soviet union israel the united states and europe his 
coauthor izrail rabinovich is a soviet emigre who teaches at the 
defense language institute in monterey calif 
for soviet citizens humor is a private way of coping 
criticizing distancing themselves a punch line just for a moment 
or two permits release of tension and anger that otherwise tends 
to build up with no outlet harris says 
for jews in particular the jokes reflect the pain of a 25 
million minority suffering antisemitic persecution and 
restrictions on emigration free worship and the study of jewish 
culture and the hebrew language 
last year about 8000 jews were allowed to leave the soviet 
union although the figures for this year have increased 
significantly israel estimates that some 400000 soviet jews wish 
to leave 
this joke illustrates frustration with repeated rejections of 
emigration requests 
a jew named khaimovich is turned down for an exit visa because 
he is in possession of state secrets from his place of work 
state secrets you must be kidding in my field the americans are 
at least 20 years ahead of us he exclaims thats precisely 
the secret comes the curt reply 
the jokes say the authors are also embraced widely by nonjews 
who identify with the recurring themes of a hostile bureaucracy 
discontent with the standard of living memories of stalinist 
terror and frustration with the stifling presence of the communist 
party 
for instance the same khaimovich is being chastised at a 
district party meeting why werent you at the last party 
meeting asks an official if i had known it was the last not 
only would i have come but id have brought my entire family as 
well he replies 
or this one whats the difference between catholicism and 
communism the answer in catholicism theres life after death 
in communism there is posthumous rehabilitation 
while the humor of other countries doesnt always travel well 
laughter about the soviet union is usually culturally translatable 
in the united states president reagan enjoys telling jokes about 
the russians and he trots them out periodically at summit meetings 
with soviet leaders 
americans find it reassuring to laugh at the soviets it 
reinforces a feeling of political and social superiority toward the 
russians harris says 
as a refugee official for jewish organizations in europe harris 
dealt with thousands of emigre soviets including rabinovich who 
arrived in rome from the soviet union in 1976 
the two men discovered an interest in jokes and although they 
have not seen each other since they have conducted a prolific 
correspondence for some 11 years which yielded a collection of some 
2000 jokes the book is only a part of the collection 
americans familiar with the humor of the borscht belt 
those areas of the united states with large concentrations of east 
european jews will likely be a receptive audience for this one 
khaim and abram devised a scheme for crossing the border 
dressed up as a cow as they approached the border in their 
fourlegged outfit khaim whispered oy vey were in for big 
trouble 
border guards abram asked 
no a bull khaim whispered 
then there are jokes that appeal on the level of superpower 
competition 
an american and a russian are discussing their countries 
intelligence services the kgb is the best i hear theyve 
managed to steal all the designs of the major american weapons 
systems for the last 10 years boasts the russian 
thats nothing ivan retorts the american i know for a 
fact that the cia has succeeded in stealing from the kremlins safe 
the results of all the soviet elections for the next 10 years

a federal investigation and one of the busiest 
travel weekends of the year combined to make the eastern airlines 
terminal at logan international airport a waiting room for hundreds 
of frustrated travelers 
the eastern ticketholders were stuck at the airport sunday for 
the third consecutive day that eastern flights into or out of 
boston were delayed or canceled by mechanical problems 
id rather be sitting by the pool than sitting here jack 
honen said while he waited for his flight to florida 
eastern which is the focus of a federal aviation administration 
investigation into mechanical and safety problems was trying to 
cope with the crowds on one of bostons busiest travel weekends of 
the year 
what youve got is spring break theyre all headed down 
south youve got patriots weekend and youve got the boston 
marathon were busy in and out said thomas hannah easterns 
manager for departure services 
hannah said the delays and cancellations were typical of any 
large airline on a busy weekend theres nothing really unusual 
about that you can go to delta or piedmont or what have you and 
find the same thing he said 
piedmont united and continental experienced no significant 
delays sunday reservations clerks reported a clerk who answered 
the phone at delta said she could not provide any information 
an incoming eastern flight sunday morning from orlando fla 
was canceled because of equipment problems that required servicing 
hannah said a flight from boston to miami was delayed several 
hours after eastern mechanics discovered a fuel leak and a flight 
from boston to orlando was delayed three hours 
the mechanics found some engine vibrations theyre working on 
it hannah said 
hannah said faa inspectors were in easterns boston hangars 
sunday looking over the airlines planes but he said the problems 
that led to delays and cancellations had been found by eastern 
mechanics not the inspectors 
honen and his family of hanover were among many heading to 
disney world 
if they were responsible for paying for one day of your 
vacation that you lost maybe theyd get their act together 
claire honen said she passed time playing cards on the floor with 
her two children 
earlier sunday eastern officials rerouted several dozen 
passengers to laguardia airport in new york city because they were 
trying to make connections with a carribean cruise leaving from 
florida the passengers had to board an eastern shuttle to new york 
so they could reach miami 
hannah who is based in florida said he came to boston to help 
manage the busy weekend and handle press questions 
three eastern flights out of logan were canceled saturday and 
two eastern jets were taken out of service friday because of 
equipment problems delaying hundreds of travelers 
us transportation secretary jim burnley said sunday that 
starting today his agency was expanding its airplanebyairplane 
inspection of aircraft to continental airlines like eastern a 
subsidiary of texas air corp the nations largest airline company 
last week the faa began checking eastern and fined eastern 
823000 for violating safety regulations authorities said 
on wednesday the agency also began examining the finances and 
management of the houstonbased texas air burnley said the 
agencys concerns were raised by evidence that eastern and 
continental airlines are under substantial increasing financial 
pressure

thirteen mississippi teenage girls are taking 
home lessons in history and culture and new friendships after a 
whirlwind visit that gave them a taste of the big city 
i got to see a lot of things about culture that i didnt even 
know about said chandrika rankin 16 one of the wideeyed 
teenagers from greenville miss who took part in the weekend 
meeting between north and south 
the mississippians visit was sponsored by the greenvillebased 
daisey m greene national association a nonprofit organization 
dedicated to the services of minority youth and elderly 
it gave new insight to teenagers in chicago too 
were so much in chicago that we want to know what life is 
like in the outside world said marlene seja 16 who was among a 
group of innercity minority girls from the metro achievement 
program that met with the mississippi visitors the girls exchanged 
addresses and planned to write to each other 
i didnt think they were going to be so modern said kina 
stone a ninth grader at chicagos whitney young high school we 
thought they were going to have straw hats overalls and wear no 
makeup but they were pretty much like us 
before they left for home sunday the mississippi girls said 
their trip was so short that they wanted to take pieces of chicago 
back with them 
if i could bring one thing from chicago back to mississippi 
it would be the sears tower because its big said daisy 
jackson 17 after a look at the 110story building the worlds 
tallest 
id bring the whole city because we didnt have enough 
time to see everything said 15yearold loraine loving 
others giggled and said they would rather take back another one 
of chicagos soaring attractions pro basketall star michael jordan 
the visitors busy schedule included attending a performance by 
the alvin ailey american dance theater a sightseeing tour of 
chicago and a stop at the dusable museum of african american 
history 
miss loving said she was especially impressed with the museum 
i like the indepthness of the history there said there 
is not enough taught in the schools and it was just there waiting 
for you to come and see it 
i learned that a lot of things were invented by the black man 
but because they didnt have the power to get a patent the white 
man had a patent on it she added 
the weekend trip was the idea of mary wiley a greenville native 
who is chairwoman of the board of the greene organization ms 
wiley who now lives in chicago said she came up with the idea 
during a visit to greenville a city of about 39000 
i thought the greenville youngsters should be exposed to 
culture outside their own environment and chicago with all the 
performing arts here is an ideal place she said 
miss jackson said she plans to recommend chicago to her friends 
and shed love to return on one condition 
as long as i know i can go back home to greenville she 
said im used to a slower pace

domestic crude oil production in the 1990s 
should be higher than previously expected and demand for natural 
gas will be markedly higher according to the energy departments 
annual forecast 
the departments energy information administration said oil 
prices will be slower to rise in the decade than it projected in 
last years forecast and natural gas prices will be much lower 
the import share of us petroleum consumption wont be much 
different at the end of the century from what was predicted last 
year eia said 
in their annual forecast released last week the agencys 
forecasters significantly raised its prediction for us crude oil 
production in the year 2000 from 54 million barrels a day to 60 
million barrels last years production was about 83 million 
barrels compared with 90 million barrels before the 1986 petroleum 
price collapse 
richard farmer in charge of the petroleum forecast said in an 
interview friday there is no way you can avoid a decline in 
us production by the year 2000 any major discoveries off 
california or in alaska areas where explorers have high hopes 
could not be in significant production before then he said

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee says congress should consider halting the air force 
program to upgrade the problemplagued b1b bomber because the new 
plane will be obsolete 
we should consider now whether its worth spending any more 
money to make the b1b operable but obsolescent said rep les 
aspin dwis in a speech released on sunday 
the air force in a statement disputed aspins contentions and 
noted that he has long opposed the bomber 
aspins comments were contained in a speech which he plans to 
give today on the floor of the house it is the latest in a series 
of addresses in which aspin is outlining the results of a lengthy 
investigation by his committee into new atomic weapons begun during 
the reagan presidency 
the b1 was killed by president carter but reagan resurrected 
it six years ago saying the nation needed to buy 100 of the 
swingwing planes to replace the aging b52s as the atomic bombers 
in the nations nuclear arsenal 
congress authorized 100 of the b1bs for a total cost of 205 
billion but the air force now says it will cost up to 3 billion 
more to fix electronic countermeasures ecm that will permit 
the b1b to evade soviet air defenses 
it will be at least 1991 before the b1b has the ecm 
capabilities it was supposed to have in 1986 according to aspin

a new study advises state and local 
authorities to vigorously pursue money laundering cases against 
drug traffickers who frequently dump their illegal profits back 
into local communities instead of relying on federal government 
investigations 
the report conducted for the national institute of justice by 
the police executive research forum and released sunday notes that 
money generated by narcotics trafficking and other underworld 
activities has been estimated as high as 100 billion annually 
only california and georgia have laws specifically barring 
conversion of profits from drugs and other crimes said the report 
but most states do have effective though rarely utilized laws which 
can be used to prosecute money laundering operations 
state and local law enforcement agencies rely on the federal 
government to investigate complex money laundering cases because 
such operations often are international in scope 
but offenders at the lower levels of criminal groups are capable 
of generating enormous sums that require laundering and for the 
same reasons that international traffickers and syndicate 
racketeers need such services concluded the report by the police 
forums associate director clifford karchmer 
money launderers convert cash from illegal activities to a form 
that conceals its origin and true ownership

earth faces environmental catastrophe unless 
developing nations stem rapid overpopulation a population control 
group warned but a critic dismissed the report as invalid 
speculation by humorless doomsayers 
world population now 51 billion grew by an unprecedented 90 
million people last year over the next 10 years the world will 
add another billion people ninetytwo percent of that growth is 
taking place in the poorer nations of the developing world said 
the report released sunday by the population institute 
unless we wake up to the serious damage population pressures 
are doing to this planet we will see a 21st century that could 
offer unprecedented catastrophic consequences said werner 
fornos the groups president 
fornos said the thinning of earths protective ozone shield 
heating of the atmosphere by industrial pollutants waste and 
pollution of water supplies loss of soils and forests extinction 
of species and expansion of deserts are all tied directly to 
rapid world population growth 
he said the united states and other industrialized nations 
should consider forgiving debts of developing nations that 
establish policies to halt environmental destruction and to expand 
educational and employment opportunities for women birth rates are 
lower where women have greater economic and social opportunities 
fornos said 
the report drew sharp criticism from julian simon a university 
of maryland economist who said that while more people mean more 
problems the history of humanity is a history of surmounting 
problems new solutions leave us better off than if the original 
problems had never arisen if we had only 1 million people on 
earth wed still be chasing rabbits and eating berries and roots 
the population institute and other doomsayers have been wrong 
on every single prediction they have made for the past two 
decades and people like fornos have no sense of humor and 
can manufacture scares faster than you can write stories about 
them said simon a business administration professor 
contrary to their prophecies every important human trend has 
improved he said during a telephone interview life is longer 
health is better all resources have become more available rather 
than less available and in the united states our environment has 
become cleaner 
kingsley davis a demographer at stanford university and the 
university of southern california defended the report saying 
theres no question in my mind that virtually every environmental 
problem we have is made worse by the fact we have over 5 billion 
people on earth 
fornos labeled simons viewpoint baloney and outrageously 
elitist because when you recognize the next billion people will 
come in just nine years then you understand that competition for 
food and resources of this planet will become more intense 
fornos said depletion of earths ozone layer will increase skin 
cancers and perhaps damage crops and seafoods while atmospheric 
heating will raise sea levels and cause crop failures 
deforestation is likely to create more deserts spur droughts 
trigger extinctions and reduce oxygen production while industrial 
pollution and human wastes will taint more water supplies he added 
to stem the environmental damage fornos also recommended 
researchers should accelerate efforts to develop alternatives 
to wood coal and oil as energy sources because the use of such 
fuels spurs deforestation expansion of deserts and carbon dioxide 
pollution that warms the atmosphere 
industrial nations could provide more financial aid to 
developing countries that try to limit the flow of migrants into 
polluted megacities which often lack adequate sewage and 
waste disposal systems 
nations that ratified the treaty to reduce emissions of 
chlorofluorocarbons the refrigerant gases blamed for depletion of 
earths ozone layer should reconvene to move up their 1994 
deadline for cutting such emissions in half

contra rebel leaders said they 
rejected a government proposal for a permanent truce because the 
document failed to spell out the democratic reforms the sandinistas 
would adopt 
government negotiators offered the plan sunday during the third 
day of ceasefire talks the first held in managua since fighting 
broke out in 1981 
although the rebels rejected the government offer both sides 
returned to the bargaining table and met sunday night and into 
today behind closed doors at the camino real hotel on the outskirts 
of managua 
before talks resumed sunday the contras said the sandinistas 
must take steps or at least guarantee them during a truce to 
return nicaragua to democratic elected rule we reject the 
sandinista proposal because it speaks only of ceasefire and no 
other issues such as the true democratization of nicaragua said 
adolfo calero head of the rebel delegation 
for us the permanent truce should come about simultaneously 
with the process of democratizing nicaragua and that is why the 
sandinista proposal is a regression calero said 
it is dangerous said another contra leader alfredo cesar 
it does not mention how the ceasefire will be implemented 
the defense chief gen humberto ortega described the proposal 
in a news conference as reasonable mature and flexible 
as soon as a permanent truce is signed he said eight leaders 
of the contra umbrella organization known as the nicaraguan 
resistance can join representatives of the 14 legally recognized 
opposition political parties in a national reconciliation 
dialogue with the sandinistas 
the defense chief president daniel ortegas brother claimed 
the sandinistas had already defeated the ussupported contras 
but were not demanding unconditional surrender only in 
metrogoldwynmayer movies is war ended by smashing the enemy with 
a club he said 
modern wars he said are ended by negotiating political and 
other matters to arrive at an accord that is the way it was in 
vietnam 
after receiving the government plan the contras discussed it 
for four hours before calling a news conference to announce they 
had rejected it 
the two sides agreed on march 23 to a preliminary peace plan 
that called for a 60day ceasefire to give the negotiators time to 
work out a permanent truce the ceasefire which went into effect 
on april 1 calls for the rebels to gather in seven zones but the 
two sides have not yet been able to work out such details as how 
the rebels will be resupplied whether they can keep their weapons 
and how the truce will be verified 
in an editorial printed sunday the opposition newspaper la 
prensa said a permanent truce means the sandinistas should be 
willing to bury totalitarism and give up their ideal of ruling with 
a single party 
if they insist on a truce just to dismember the nicaraguan 
resistance leaving intact the sandinistas politicalmilitary 
regime then there will be no peace or development not only in 
nicaragua but throughout central america 
if the nicaraguan resistance surrenders its weapons before an 
effective democratization is achieved it will be betraying the 
democratic aspirations of nicaraguans and the bloodshed by those 
who died yesterday today before and after 1979 the editorial 
said 
la prensa which the sandinistas have closed several times for 
criticizing the government is nicaraguas only opposition 
newspaper 
the sandinistas seized power in july 1979 after a bloody 
revolution that overthrew the usbacked government of rightwing 
president anastasio somoza

survived only three of the 19 injured remained hospitalized early 
today one in serious condition 
carlson 38 and copilot mark hilstad both of the portland 
area were interviewed here sunday by national transportation 
safety board investigators 
neither man nor the ntsb investigators would comment to 
reporters after the closed meeting but in remarks overheard by 
reporters outside the meeting carlson said he first knew the plane 
was in trouble when he experienced an overall sense of 
decreasing responsiveness in the planes controls 
instruments then indicated the right engine was losing from 40 
percent to 60 percent of its torque the pilots said 
carlson said he immediately radioed for permission to return to 
the airport and began a series of three turns to bring the 
twinengine de havilland dash 8 back in line with the runway 
as he was heading into the final turn carlson said hilstad 
lowered the landing gear and then shouted that the right engine was 
on fire 
i quickly saw the red fire warning light carlson said 
adding the flames were not visible from his side of the cockpit 
hilstad described the fire as a big reddish ball of flame 
protruding forward from the wing he said it appeared while the 
plane was at about 2000 feet going 205 to 230 mph 
ntsb investigators have said that an initial review of tapes of 
tower communications with the plane indicated the first mention of 
fire came from another aircraft that was not immediately identified 
carlson and hilstad said they remembered hearing the warning 
over the radio as they discovered the problem themselves 
hilstad said he triggered two fire extinguisher bottles but they 
had no effect 
carlson said he quickly experienced trouble with the controls 
as they were starting down the pilots said they realized they 
were too high and were going too fast but they had no choice except 
to land 
i felt like it was wallowing teetering going to stall 
hilstad said 
carlson said he thought he was still in a comfortable range to 
maneuver the plane to a stop he and hilstad applied full force to 
the brakes and rudder and locked the emergency brake but could not 
avoid ramming a runway identification sign and hitting the 
passenger ramp 
i remember the horizon ramp going by at blinding speed he 
said the next thing i knew we were being showered by foam 
both men said their preflight checks showed nothing wrong with 
the airplane and everything was normal through the takeoff 
joseph t nall an ntsb investigator said sunday night at a 
seattle news conference that a passenger spotted fuel on the 
planes wing before the blaze erupted 
nall said the two cockpit recorders would be read out only 
after they arrive at a laboratory in washington dc 
rick smith chief of the port of seattle fire department at the 
airport praised the flight crew and the fire crew on the ground 
he watched a videotape of the landing and crash made by an airport 
camera 
had it not been for the quick application of foam and their 
the fire crews efforts we could easily have lost 40 people a 
jetway and had an extension of fire on the concourse he said

the four trade ministers 
responsible for twothirds of the worlds commerce made little 
progress on farm subsidies and japanese trade barriers when they 
discussed drafting new global trading rules 
progress in this particular session has certainly not been 
significant us trade representative clayton yeutter said on 
sunday 
he was referring mostly to the billions of dollars spent 
subsidizing the worlds farmers to produce exports no one wants to 
buy 
envoys from the united states japan canada and the 12nation 
european community said they found some agreement during the 
weekend meeting at a secluded retreat but made little headway on 
issues dividing them 
yeutter repeated the reagan administrations call for an end of 
farm subsidies by the year 2000 and an agreement by december 
establishing a framework for phasing them out 
our friends in europe consider that an unrealistic objective 
but we fail to comprehend why that should be construed as such 
yeutter told a news conference 
if 12 years is too soon then lets look at 14 years but 
lets not conclude its impossible to rid the world of these 
onerous practices 
he said eec trade commissioner willy de clercq kept his cards 
close to his vest on the issue during the quadrilateral trade 
meeting on quadra island a treelined retreat 100 miles northwest 
of vancouver 
at a news conference however de clercq said the eec had taken 
a courageous decision to begin curbing farm production and 
spending 
the eec commissioner termed us proposals unreasonable and 
accused the reagan administration of talking free trade while 
practicing the opposite 
both of us spend about 30 billion a year to support 
farming there are about 25 to 3 million farmers in the united 
states and 12 million in the european community its not difficult 
to draw the conclusion which farmers are more supported de 
clercq said 
he said under one us program nearly 12 million tons of 
subsided wheat have been sold to the soviet union in the past year 
de clercq said any agreement on agriculture must be part of a 
global package under the 95nation general agreement on tariffs 
and trade which is being renegotiated in geneva the agreement 
pledges its members to free trade that package should cover such 
topics as investment services and improved access for third world 
goods he said 
canadian trade minister john crosbie said he hoped for a 
compromise on farm subsidies by the gatt midterm review meeting set 
for next december in montreal 
we would like to get agreement on a freeze on any further 
steps in this direction he said 
canada australia and other farm exporting nations complain 
their treasuries cannot match us and eec spending power 
while the troubled gatt negotiations dominated weekend 
discussions bilateral differences were aired 
with japanese trade minister hajime tamura at his side yeutter 
chastised japan for failing to relax its restrictive quotas on us 
beef and citrus products he urged the japanese government to work 
harder on overcoming the powerful farm lobby opposed to more 
agricultural imports 
japans unwillingness to resolve this issue has generated 
a lot of emotion in congress he said 
yeutter said on friday that the reagan administration remains 
confident the free trade agreement which would begin in january 
1989 and dismantle all tariffs over a 10year period will be 
approved by congress this year

the drowning of a newborn girl in a toilet at a 
state psychiatric hospital could not have been foreseen a state 
official says 
but mental health advocates say it points out the problems of 
underfunded understaffed hospitals 
the girl born tuesday night to a patient at the chicagoread 
mental health center died by drowning an autopsy showed the 
infant was found in the toilet about 15 minutes after staff members 
had checked the mother in her bed said david devane spoeksman for 
the state department of mental health 
the staff check around 8 pm showed the woman who was nine 
months pregnant was resting comfortably with no indication of 
rapid breathing or anything to indicate labor devane said sunday 
staff members found the infant after they saw blood on the lower 
part of the mothers body devane said 
the trail of blood went back to the bathroom he said 
devane said the 34yearold woman identified by police as 
patricia ales was checked every 15 minutes because of her 
pregnancy he declined to discuss her mental condition 
chicago police sgt thomas czarnecki said an autopsy determined 
that the baby had drowned he said he did not expect charges to be 
filed against the mother 
mental health advocates questioned how a woman could give birth 
unnoticed in a crowded hospital unit 
i find it incredible that this could happen and nobody knew 
she was in labor said jan holcomb former president of the 
mental health association in illinois a private advocacy group 
does it take the death of a newborn baby to recognize that our 
underfunded and understaffed state mental health facilities can 
pose a threat to the health and safety of our most vulnerable 
citizens 
devane said the staff did everything possible 
there were four people on the unit four staff members 
devane said she the mother was under close observation and 
that close observation had been followed 
the woman had been examined by her obstetrician at the 
university of illinois downtown clinic earlier that day devane 
said the doctor did not indicate any need for her to go to a 
maternity ward he said 
the chicago tribune reported that fire department paramedics 
responded to a call of woman in labor at 814 pm when they 
arrived the newspaper said they were first directed to the 
mother who was hemorrhaging and then were told by an unidentified 
staff member that a baby was in the bathroom toilet police records

president reagan retaliating for the mining 
of a us navy frigate ordered the shelling of iranian offshore 
oil platforms in the persian gulf monday in what the white house 
called a measured response to irans unlawful use of force 
the united states had said there was substantial evidence 
that iran had planted a mine that blew a hole in the side of the 
uss samuel b roberts in the central gulf last week and injured 10 
crewmen 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said there were no 
american casualties in the shelling and the united states did not 
know of any on the iranian side 
fitzwater said reagan decided on the attack sunday night during 
meetings in the residence section of the white house 
he said reagan met with secretary of state george p shultz 
national security adviser colin powell and others at 830 pm edt 
sunday then briefed congressional leaders and met with his 
advisers for fine tuning of the decision 
the spokesman said he did not know how many people were aboard 
the platforms although they normally have a complement of 20 to 40 
men they are manned by iranian revolutionary guards he said they 
were given several minutes warning to leave and some were seen 
leaving 
fitzwater said the frigates simpson and bagley and the cruiser 
wainwright took part in the attack on the sirri platform which he 
said is 18 miles off sirri island he said the destroyers merril 
and mccormick and the landing platform ship trenton which carries 
helicopters took part in the attack on the sassan 
he said there was no indication of resistance the platforms 
were still burning about three hours after the attack 
fitzwater said the sassan platform had been boarded by marines 
who were setting charges to destroy it 
fitzwater said four iranian f4 fighters took off during the 
attack but returned to their base without firing he said aircraft 
from the us aircraft carrier enterprise were in the air during 
the shelling but he did not know whether they took any part he 
said he understood all of the firing was from the ships 
fitzwater said the attack represented a measured response to 
irans unlawful use of force against the united states and to 
irans numerous violations of the rights of other nonbelligerents 
and they constitute a lawful excerise of the united states 
inherent right of self defense under article 51 of the united 
nations charter 
reagan first met with top advisers on friday to decide upon a 
response to the mining of the roberts a guided missile frigate 
which came close to sinking 
the incident was the second of its nature since the united 
states began escorting oil tankers through the gulf on july 21 
1987 to protect them from attack from the warring parties in the 
7year iraniraqn war 
on oct 19 a raid was staged in retaliation to a missile attack 
on a kuwaiti ship flying the us flag in which 18 americans were 
injured two iranian oil platforms were destroyed in what reagan 
termed a prudent response 
reporters were summoned to the white house for a 230 am edt 
briefing on monday by time it was under way an hour later news 
reports on the shelling had been received from the persian gulf 
in a written statement fitzwater said the government of iran 
should understand that we will protect our ships and our 
interests against such attacks 
these platforms are used as command and control radar stations 
for the iranian military he said of the targets 
the government of iran has repeatedly been warned about the 
consequences of such hostile acts as the mining of the gulf he 
said 
fitzwater said the friendly governments had been informed in 
advance 
we have repeatedly told iran that we do not desire military 
confrontation fitzwater said but the government of iran 
should understand that we will protect our ships and our interests 
against unprovoked attacks 
we urgently seek an end to tensions in the region and to the 
iraniraq war he said this would benefit the people of both 
nations who have suffered so much from the brutal conflict 
fitzwater said the united states is urging iran to accept a 
united nations security council resolution passed july 20 calling 
for a ceasefire in the sevenyearold iraniraq war 
iran has nothing to gain from continuation of the war he 
said

john demjanjuk is the second man to be tried in 
israel for nazi war crimes in 1961 a special court heard the case 
of adolf eichmann found him guilty and sentenced him to death 
a year later eichmann was hanged the only person to have been 
executed in israels 40year history 
although demjanjuk could suffer eichmanns fate there are many 
differences between the two men and their trials 
above all there was no doubt about eichmanns guilt 
his nazi wartime record was well documented he was considered a 
highranking leader of the nazi regime and was the man in charge of 
carrying out his governments orders to exterminate european jewry 
unlike demjanjuk eichmann never denied committing the wartime 
deeds of which he was accused also eichmanns trial was held 17 
years after the end of the war when the memory of the holocaust 
was still fresh and many of those who survived it still alive 
his presence aroused so much anger in israel that the 
authorities built a bulletproof glass booth to protect him during 
the opencourt proceedings in jerusalem 
the israeli government regarded the trial as an historic 
settling of accounts with the nazi movement eichmann was regarded 
not only as a man who had committed unspeakable crimes but also as 
a symbol of the entire nazi regime which was being brought to 
justice by the jewish people 
the accused contributed to the sense of national outrage in 
israel by his demeanor he observed his trial in silence with a 
sardonic smile on his face and never expressed regret for his 
deeds 
the austrianborn eichmann became the perfect stereotype of the 
cold and ruthless nazi killing machine

the following is a summary of prosecution and 
defense arguments in the nazi war crimes trial of john demjanjuk 
 
the prosecution 
the prosecution claims demjanjuk is ivan the terrible a 
brutal guard who operated gas chambers that killed 850000 jews at 
the treblinka death camp in nazioccupied poland in 1942 and 1943 
prosecutors presented five treblinka survivors who identified 
demjanjuk as ivan in photo lineups that included a 1952 picture 
of the defendant and another taken from his alleged nazi identity 
card 
survivor pinchas epstein pointed to demjanjuk in court and said 
he recognized the defendants walk while survivor eliyahu 
rosenberg said he remembered demjanjuks murderous eyes 
the prosecutions most pivotal evidence was demjanjuks alleged 
nazi identity card issued at trawniki a training camp for death 
camp guards the document does not mention treblinka but states 
demjanjuk was posted at the nearby sobibor death camp 
six prosecution experts authenticated the paper ink photograph 
and signatures on the trawniki card one expert produced a video 
showing how the photograph of the young guard on the card matched 
the presentday demjanjuk almost exactly in addition two 
historians vouched for the documents historical authenticity 
in a grueling weeklong crossexamination prosecutors showed 
inconsistencies in demjanjuks version of his whereabouts during 
world war ii and accused him of hiding his true identity 
 
the defense 
demjanjuk claims he is an innocent victim of mistaken identity 
and says he was a nazi prisonerofwar during the years of 
treblinkas operation 194243 
demjanjuk admits he lied on his us immigration application 
saying he was a polish farmer rather than a ukrainian soldier but 
he insists it was because he feared forced repatriation to the 
soviet union and not because he was hiding a nazi past 
a psychology expert raised doubts about the reliability of the 
treblinka survivors memories more than 40 years after the 
holocaust he also contended the photo lineups were biased against 
demjanjuk because his picture was the largest clearest and the 
only one of a bald man 
demjanjuks attorneys presented 12 statements from treblinka 
inmates who failed to identify demjanjuks picture as ivan 
demjanjuk claims the trawniki card was forged by the soviet 
union which provided it and three other other similar documents to 
israel he says the soviets wanted to frame demjanjuk because he 
served in an anticommunist unit organized by the germans at the 
end of world war ii 
the defense also called six experts who contended the trawniki 
card was forged one document expert said the paper could not have 
been produced in nazi germany because it was made of rags a 
material that was scarce during world war ii 
defense witnesses also said demjanjuks signature on the card 
was forged and contended the picture on the document even if it 
portrayed demjanjuk was not the original but had been glued on at 
a later date 
several defense witnesses were discredited including one who 
retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide 
after her credentials were called into question 
some defense witnesses also offered bizarre arguments including 
one who claimed the soviet secret service used thought power to 
kill its enemies and inflict disasters on the west

john demjanjuk the second man to be tried in 
israel for nazi war crimes says he is a simple man with a 
fourthgrade education who survived nearstarvation in the soviet 
ukraine by eating birds rats and a pet cat 
my tragic mistake is i cant think properly i dont know how 
to answer the retired ohio autoworker told an israeli court in a 
revealing moment 
demjanjuk has become more human to many israelis than adolf 
eichmann the first man to stand trial for nazi war crimes because 
he learned some hebrew and his family attended nearly every session 
the israeli prosecution says demjanjuk is ivan the terrible 
who operated gas chambers that killed 850000 jews at the treblinka 
death camp in nazioccupied poland in 1942 and 1943 
during the trial demjanjuk chatted with police guards laughed 
good naturedly during sessions and shouted the hebrew greeting 
shalom to bystanders as he was led handcuffed to and from court 
he even tried to shake hands with a treblinka survivor who 
recoiled in horror and called demjanjuk a murderer 
before being yanked into the public eye by charges he was a 
brutal nazi guard the 68yearold grandfather lived a quiet life 
centered on family and friends in clevelands closeknit ukrainian 
community where demjanjuk emigrated in 1952 
when he took the stand in israel demjanjuk endeavored to win 
sympathy by describing his own hardships in the soviet ukraine and 
portraying himself as a mildmannered man who couldnt even kill 
a chicken 
me and my relatives were forced to eat birds mice rats and 
even our pet cat demjanjuk said of his childhood in the ukraine 
in 1932 and 1933 
the balding defendant tried to explain away inconsistencies in 
his version of his whereabouts during world war ii by blaming his 
lack of education and faulty memory 
what do you expect when i had only four years of schooling 
he said in helpless frustration during a grueling weeklong 
crossexamination last august 
demjanjuks three children describe their father as a patient 
goodnatured man who tried to make life more homey in his dreary 
israeli isolation cell by hanging hundreds of cards from 
wellwishers and family photographs onto the walls 
alone in his prison cell demjanjuk lifted his spirits by 
reading from a ukrainianlanguage bible and doing situps and 
pushups to relieve tension his children said in interviews 
demjanjuk and his wife vera 62 worked long factory shifts to 
attain a measure of the good life they bought a house in the 
middleclass cleveland suburb of seven hills where demjanjuk 
planted a garden and planned to retire 
my dad enjoyed seeing things grow he was squeamish about 
killing anything even worms in the garden said demjanjuks 
daughter irene nishnic 28 
on aug 25 1977 the first accusations against demjanjuk 
appeared in the us media 
after a sixweek trial in feb 1981 in a us district court in 
cleveland when demjanjuk admitted lying to immigration authorites 
he was stripped of his us citizenship 
he was extradited to israel in february 1986 and his 
14monthlong trial began one year later 
describing her father mrs nishnic said my dad is a good 
man a loving man hes never beat on me hes never hurt me but 
thats not going to make any difference is it

an ultrasecret multisatellite program 
intended to help coordinate the nations nuclear weapons appears to 
be facing serious problems including budget overruns and technical 
obstacles a newspaper reported 
the san jose mercury news said the 5yearold milstar program at 
lockheed missiles amp space co is supposed to be tough enough to 
survive an allout war smart enough to run itself for six months 
at a time and sophisticated enough to link just about every ship 
plane and battlefield unit with a nuclear weapon 
but a congressional report prepared in december reported 
pervasive problems and cost overruns in milstar which is short 
for military strategic and tactical relay system the newspaper 
said in its sunday editions 
the report blamed the problems on repeated changes in 
acquisition schedules inadequate funding poor contracting 
procedures and a lack of management attention at the senior levels 
of the department of defense and air force 
hundreds of millions of dollars perhaps as much as a billion 
dollars could be wasted over the next decade it warned 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified congressional source as 
saying contracts werent written to encourage lockheed and its 
subcontractors enough to save money fluctuations in air force 
financing led to inefficiencies on the production lines the source 
said 
there were an awful lot of problems said the source who 
asked not to be identified but the source added that doesnt 
mean its a dog of a program 
congress recently authorized an additional 25 million above 
what has been allocated for the project this year the projects 
budget is secret the newspaper said the budget was estimated at 
10 billion or perhaps much more 
the milstar program we think is proceeding well said lt 
col rick oborn a spokesman for the air force we do realize 
there are some techinical challenges and there are some minor 
setbacks 
but given the technical risks those setbacks are not 
insurmountable it is a program designed as the highest national 
priority he said 
richard buenneke editor of the industry newsletter military 
space was more skeptical 
theyre obviously using the security around the program to 
hide a lot of the problems with it said buenneke

us warships today attacked two offshore 
iranian oil facilities in the persian gulf in retaliation for a 
mine explosion that ripped open the hull of an american frigate and 
injured 10 crewmen 
iran countered by striking oil facilities off sharjah and at 
least two us vessels 
the white house said three us warships ships attacked each 
iranian platform and that the facilities were on fire no american 
casualties were reported in the us attacks and the iranians 
reportedly fled prior to the shelling 
the official islamic republic news agency said the us warships 
first struck the sassan platform in the southern gulf at 9 am 
130 am edt twentythree minutes later they blasted the nasr 
platform at nearby sirri island irna said 
soon afterward an iranian warship shelled oil facilities off 
sharjah an emirate in the southern gulf shipping executives said 
targeted in the iranian attack were the scanbay drilling rig 
the 112744ton british tanker york marine and a storage facility 
all three are in the mubarak oilfield off sharjah the gulfbased 
executives said 
the executives speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
york marine was set afire and that its crew had abandoned the 
vessel 
a reagan administration official in washington said an iranian 
guided missile patrol boat had fired on the us cruiser 
wainwright one of the american ships that took part in the attack 
on one of the iranian platforms 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
wainwright was not hit he said the us frigate simpson returned 
fire and scored a direct hit on the patrol boat asked if the 
iranian ship was sunk he said only it scored a direct hit use 
your imagination 
the official also said a us supply vessel the willy tide was 
under attack by three iranian speedboats he said he had no other 
details 
the londonbased lloyds shipping intelligence unit also 
reported the attack on the willy tide a 283ton vessel operated by 
tidewater inc of new orleans 
iran and iraq have been at war since 1980 and the war has 
produced repeated attacks on neutral shipping last july the 
united states stepped up its presence in the gulf reflagging 11 
kuwaiti tankers and giving them us navy escorts 
the us raid on the iranian oil platforms was confirmed by the 
white house early today after it was reported by iran and the 
shipping executives the white house said the attack was a 
measured response to irans unlawful use of force 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said there were no us casualties in 
the raid and the united states did not know of any on the iranian 
side 
these actions he said were taken in response to irans 
recent resumption of mine laying in international waters and its 
mine attack thursday on the uss frigate samuel b roberts 
the government of iran has repeatedly been warned about the 
consequences of such hostile acts 
fitzwater said he did not know how many people were aboard the 
platforms although they normally have a complement of 20 to 40 
men they are manned by iranian revolutionary guards he said they 
were given several minutes warning and some were seen leaving 
the white house spokesman said the frigates simpson and bagley 
and the cruiser wainwright attacked the sirri platform he said the 
platform is 18 miles off sirri island irans statement monitored 
in cyprus said the platform was on the island the two reports 
could not be reconciled immediately 
fitzwater said the destroyers merril and mccormick and the 
landing platform ship trenton which carries helicopters attacked 
the sassan platform 
he said there was no indication of iranian resistance and that 
both platforms were burning about three hours after the attacks 
the shipping executives who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said their monitors picked up a radio message about 30 minutes 
before the attack in which a us warship urged platform workers to 
evacuate 
the executives said the warning specified the facilities will 
be shelled in five minutes 
the iranians radioed back we have no instructions to leave 
the place 
eight minutes later the american warship which the executives 
could not identify said we will blast the platform in half a 
second 
one shipping executive noted circumstances of the attack on 
sassan were very much similar to those that preceded the us 
shelling of rostam last october rostam is the sister platform to 
sassan 
the rostam was wrecked in october 1987 after iran fired a 
chinese silkworm missile into a usflagged kuwaiti oil tanker 
injuring 18 crewmen after a fiveminute warning the american 
guns blazed away at the platform the executive said of the 
attack on rostam 
the samuel b roberts had sailed into a mine field on thursday 
and was trying to manuever to safety when it was hit by a submerged 
mine us military officials said on sunday 
while trying to move at minimum speed to maintain a safe 
distance from three mines it had spotted on the surface the 
3700ton warship apparently slid into the mine from the side 
said maj barry willey of the us central command 
the explosion blew a hole in the port side of the ships hull 
beneath the waterline causing fire and flooding and injuring the 
10 crewmen 
the frigate to the united arab emirates port of dubai on 
saturday the four most seriously injured americans have been flown 
to a us military hospital in west germany 
us officals also said on sunday that two more mines had been 
found and destroyed in the waters where the roberts was crippled 
that brought to five the number known to have been seen in the area 
us officials have said the mines were recently laid and that 
they came from the same source as those found on an iranian 
minelayer disabled by us helicopters on sept 21 1987

evelyn hagopian who was 3 years old when 
the great earthquake and fire struck san francisco 82 years ago 
today has no plans to attend a gathering of the disasters 
shrinking number of survivors 
all she has to do to mark the anniversary is reread a letter 
written by her father a week after the earthquake 
bikran hagopian then about 36 described the april 18 1906 
disaster in a letter to his sister hattie in new york city 
the quake was not only shaking and swinging the house to and 
fro but the whole structure was jumping and bouncing up and 
down he wrote outside multitudes of men women and children 
in their nightclothes filled the streets 
at about 630 am he went from his home near the fairmont 
hotel to the restaurant he owned in chinatown to learn the fate 
of our night cooks 
i found the building partly fallen and there were dead 
right in front of our place partly covered with bricks he wrote 
hagopian saw the chinese running from across and then back 
and caught in between two falling walls getting killed 
instantly 
the letter said the whole waterfront was in flames and smoke 
in the debris were horses dead by the dozens and gents hats 
scattered here and there gave evidence of the men killed 
the fire had things all in its favor no water to fight it and 
the wind to help to spread its destruction 
the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the 
richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the richter 
scale the quake and fire that followed were blamed for an 
estimated 700 deaths 
evelyn hagopian who now lives in berkeley said that in 
addition to the letter she also has a rocking chair with a burned 
arm that her mother used as a sled to haul away some clothes from 
the wreckage of their home 
i was so tiny i dont remember much of anything about the 
earthquake she said but i hate those flaming lights from 
highway flares i think thats the only way the 1906 earthquake and 
fire affected me

scientists plan to reassemble a 60footlong 
lord of the sea that is believed to be about 20 feet longer 
than the discovered remains of other sea lizards 
robert t bakker university of colorado museum curator said 
fossilized mosasaurs have been found in other parts of the world 
but he said the largest we know of were in the 40footlong 
range 
it was the lord of the sea and there is nothing like it 
today bakker said of the creature 
he said the lowndes county site more than 100 miles from the 
gulf of mexico was about 100 feet under water when mosasaurs ruled 
the depths 
mosasaurs became extinct along with dinosaurs at the end of 
the mesozoic era about 70 million years before the appearance of 
humans said doug jones director of the university of alabama 
museum of natural history 
bakker and jones visited saturday at the site of the dig which 
started about one month ago 
the scientists said the lizard had a sixfootlong head and a 
twohinged jaw capable of swallowing a cow 
if a tyrannosaurus rex ever ventured into the water around 
where one of those was it would have more than had its hands 
full bakker said as he scraped clay from part of the jawbone 
it could swallow a hereford steer whole and probably could go 
through a herd one at a time it was that large bakker said 
the discovery was made by jones and jerry oldshue the assistant 
vice president for student affairs at alabama university officials 
said they hope to take the fossilized remains to tuscaloosa to be 
reassembled 
oyster shells and other evidence of sea life was found by the 
paleontologists saturday including some that had become fossilized 
on parts of the uncovered mosasaur 
jones said it would be many weeks before the dig is complete 
we want to make sure we can preserve what we have here he 
said

a prosecutorturnednovelist 
becomes the mayor of this celebrity mecca tuesday amid concern that 
his abrasive antiestablishment style will intensify the city 
councils infighting 
robert tanenbaum 45 who maintains a law practice devotes most 
of his time away from city hall to his relatively new occupation 
writing his first endeavor the autobiographical badge of the 
assassin which traced his pursuit of police killers was made 
into a 1985 cbstv movie 
with two successful careers under his belt why does tanenbaum 
sacrifice 20 or so hours a week to the city of beverly hills 
hes the most honest guy i know and why he got involved in 
politics well that ill never know said longtime friend and 
assistant don baezler 
but while no one questions tanenbaums honesty his method of 
governing has caused a stir among the citys establishment to 
which the transplanted new yorker definitely does not belong 
tanenbaum was the top votegetter in the 1986 election his 
first run for a council seat and he has kept his campaign pledge 
to vote consistently against overdevelopment and commercial 
encroachment on residential areas of this wealthy los angelesarea 
community 
but his courtroomstyle crossexaminations shouting matches and 
namecalling during council meetings have raised the ire of many 
in addition some find it odd that baezler a former detective 
with the new york police department lives in tanenbaums home and 
works alongside him 
id be talking to someone at a council meeting and he 
tanenbaum would send over his bodyguard or whatever baezler 
is to listen to what im saying said ed brown a former mayor 
and real estate investment executive its a type of 
intimidation 
but tanenbaum who as the former deputy chief of homicide for 
the new york district attorneys office helped put away my share 
of mobsters said baezler is no political spy merely his 
assistant and trusted family friend 
i dont need a bodyguard said the 6foot6 former college 
basketball player who also lives with his wife and three children 
but because of the cases ive dealt with in the past ive been 
threatened many times im toughskinned but its comforting to 
know don is here with my family when i have to be away 
the mayorship is rotated annually among the five council 
members who serve fouryear terms and are paid 330 a month 
calling himself a representative of the regular joes 
tanenbaum says he ran for office after detecting what he claimed 
was a distortion of values among city officials 
the notion here was interest groups and wealthy people get 
their candidates in office in order to get what they want done 
tanenbaum said after attending a few council meetings i saw 
that developers were treated with sensitivity while residents were 
treated like alien creatures

bombs exploded early today at the 
jewish community center and the saudi arabian airlines office 
damaging both buildings but causing no injuries police said both 
devices were probably planted by the same attackers 
police said monday that bombs one that blew a large hole in 
front of the frankfurt jewish community center and another that 
shattered the plateglass windows of the saudi arabian airlines 
office were probably planted by the same attackers 
the bombs which went off shortly after midnight only a few 
minutes and about a mile apart blew a large hole in front of the 
jewish center and shattered the windows of the saudi office the 
blast near the saudi office also damaged the adjacent offices of 
air canada 
there was no claim of responsibility for the attacks 
frankfurt prosecutor spokesman jochen schroers said both 
bombings apparently were carried out by the same group because 
evidence at both sites is similar 
schroers said by telephone that police think industrial or 
military explosives were used in the bombings 
there was neither insulation material nor a fire extinguisher 
or anything similar for packing homemade explosives into he 
said fire extinguishers containing traces of explosives often have 
been found after bombings in west germany 
damage at the jewish community center was estimated at tens of 
thousands of dollars and about 300000 at the saudi arabian 
airlines office schroers said 
the head of west germanys jewish communities heinz galinski 
issued a statement today in west berlin calling on authorities to 
tighten security near jewish property to prevent such attacks 
it is not understandable for me that even today especially 
in view of the increasing number of threatening and abusive letters 
that jewish communities have difficulty when they try to get 
sufficient security for their property galinski said 
the first bomb went off at the jewish community center in the 
residential west side just after midnight at 1218 am 618 pm 
edt sunday the second bomb exploded at the office of saudia 
airlines police said 
the jewish community center a modern marblefronted building 
which houses conference rooms a gymnasium restaurant and other 
facilities was opened in september 1986 
a volkswagen bus parked in front of the jewish community center 
was destroyed police said police said a caretaker was inside the 
center at the time of the blast but was not injured 
no one was inside the airline office when the explosion occurred

the supreme court today left intact a key 
federal regulation designed to foster competition within the 
natural gas industry 
the justices without comment rejected appeals by pipeline 
companies that claim the rule places them in an unfair economic 
bind 
the justices also refused to hear arguments by natural gas 
producers who support giving federal officials broader power to 
regulate the pipelines 
the federal energy regulatory commission adopted sweeping new 
regulations in 1985 to change the way the natural gas industry 
operates 
the key change called the openaccess rule is aimed at 
giving consumers the benefits of competition among natural gas 
suppliers 
the rule requires pipeline companies under certain conditions 
to transport gas sold by other producers and traders thus the 
pipeline companies would carry gas that is in competition with 
their own supplies 
the commission adopted the rule to end what it said was a 
practice that unnecessarily inflates the price of some gas supplies 
potentially billions of dollars in proceeds from gas sales are 
at stake in the dispute 
the us circuit court of appeals here substantially upheld the 
commissions new regulations last year stating that the pipeline 
companies apparently were trying to stifle competition 
their attack on the commission rule is precisely that it may 
disable them from passing on to customers gas purchase costs that 
they incur under contracts entered into years ago under premises 
now obsolete the appeals court said in other words 
enforcement of the rule will expose them to competition that 
their discriminatory practices enable them to avoid 
the commission said the pipelines had been practicing unfair 
discrimination by generally declining to transport gas in 
competition with their own sales thus denying consumers access to 
gas at the lowest reasonable rates 
the commission said the problem was aggravated by the phasing 
out of price controls in recent years 
in the appeal acted on today the pipeline companies said the 
openaccess rule is causing a dramatic decline in gas sales and a 
drop in drilling for gas reserves the regulation has raised 
questions as to the security of the nations gas supply and has 
threatened the financial and operational base of the pipeline 
industry the companies said 
the appeals court here stopped short of upholding all of the 
commissions 1985 regulations 
the appeals court ordered the commission to come up with an 
adequate explanation of its decision not to amend socalled 
takeorpay provisions in gas supply contracts 
a takeorpay provision requires a pipeline to pay a producer 
for some specified percentage of deliverable gas for example 75 
percent even if the pipeline took less 
the pipeline companies say such provisions became particularly 
onerous by committing them to high gas costs in what by 1982 became 
a time of falling prices 
natural gas producers urged the justices to overturn that 
portion of the appeals court ruling that requires the commission to 
reexamine its support of the takeorpay concept 
the cases are interstate natural gas association vs ferc 
87976 texas eastern transmission corp vs ferc 87977 shell 
offshore inc vs associated gas distributors 87978 willcox 
ariz vs ferc 87979 and southern california gas co vs ferc

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
limiting the power of states and indian tribes to impose duplicate 
taxes on oil and gas taken from indian lands 
the court said it will hear a petroleum companys challenge to 
taxes imposed by new mexico officials 
cotton petroleum corp and its affiliate united crude co 
challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some 15000 acres of the 
jicarilla apache reservation in new mexico 
the corporation pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 
percent of its production in addition new mexico levies five 
taxes amounting to about 8 percent of the corporations 
onreservation production 
cotton petroleum challenged the two biggest state taxes on the 
grounds they illegally overlap the taxes imposed by the tribe the 
corporation said oil and gas producers in the state with deposits 
on nonindian land are taxed only 8 percent of their production 
the corporation said the dual taxation interferes unlawfully 
with interstate commerce it also argued that the state taxes are 
excessive because the corporation receives limited services from 
the state 
for example cotton petroleum said that from 1981 through 1985 
it paid 23 million in taxes to new mexico but received only 
89000 in services from the state 
the new mexico court of appeals upheld the state taxes last 
september 
there is no requirement that benefits conferred must equal 
taxes extracted the appeals court said adding that the levies 
do not interfere improperly with interstate commerce 
new mexico officials said the dispute is a matter of great 
concern in western states 
they said there are more than 150 cases in which companies with 
oil and gas deposits on indian land are protesting such double 
taxation in arizona new mexico montana and utah 
the case is cotton petroleum vs new mexico 871327

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether states may bar political party leaders from endorsing 
primary election candidates and whether states may regulate 
political party structure 
the justices said they will consider reinstating parts of a 
california law overturned as infringements on citizens rights to 
express themselves and associate with whom they please 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last october threw out key 
portions of the california election law 
that decision marked the second time in less than two years that 
the appeals court said the state had interfered unconstitutionally 
with political parties the supreme court last year ordered the 
appeals court to reconsider its initial ruling in light of a 1986 
supreme court decision on political parties 
the justices had ruled in 1986 in a case from connecticut that 
states with open primaries may not bar independent voters from 
casting ballots to determine party nominees 
the 9th circuit court said the 1986 ruling supported its 
decision to strike down portions of the california law 
prohibiting the governing body of a political party from 
supporting some candidates and opposing others in primary 
elections patently infringes both the right of the party to 
express itself freely and the right of party members to an 
unrestricted flow of political information the appeals court 
said 
californias ban on preprimary endorsements is a form of 
paternalism that is inconsistent with the first amendment it 
said 
the appeals court also struck down rules that dictated the 
makeup of state party central committtees and set terms of office 
for party chairmen 
state officials said the ban on primary endorsements was 
designed to prevent factionalism within parties and to prevent 
voters from being unduly influenced by party leaders 
california revamped its elections laws around the turn of the 
century to break the grip on political parties by wealthy special 
interests particularly the southern pacific railroad co 
but the 9th circuit court said such rules as prohibiting party 
leaders from endorsing candidates in primaries now have the effect 
of undermining the parties main goals 
the state has effectively drained party central committees of 
political power the appeals court said 
the state law was challenged by county democratic and republican 
leaders and by state leaders of the libertarian party 
the case is march fong eu vs san francisco county democratic 
central committee 871269

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
us district judge alcee hastings who says he unlawfully is being 
subjected to possible impeachment 
the court without comment left intact a 1980 law under which 
fellow judges asked the house of representatives to consider 
impeaching hastings for alleged judicial misconduct 
the justices also refused to block the release of confidential 
grand jury documents concerning hastings to the house judiciary 
committee 
hastings who lives and works in miami contends the 1980 law is 
unconstitutional 
a federal trial jury acquitted hastings of a bribery charge in 
1983 after his friend washington lawyer william borders was 
convicted in a separate trial of soliciting a 150000 bribe in 
return for promised official favors from hastings 
soon after hastings acquittal two federal judges in the 11th 
us circuit which encompasses florida georgia and alabama filed 
a complaint charging that he had obstructed justice and lied under 
oath during his prosecution 
an investigative panel of 11th circuit judges compiled a 
381page report that recommended hastings be impeached acting on 
that recommendation the us judicial conference in 1987 asked the 
house to consider impeachment 
the conference a 27judge board of directors for the federal 
courts headed by chief justice william h rehnquist said hastings 
has engaged in conduct which might constitute grounds for 
impeachment 
but the conference made no move to suspend hastings from 
continuing to preside over trials or carrying out his other 
judicial duties 
the house has not yet determined whether to impeach hastings 
who was appointed by president jimmy carter in 1979 if it did he 
would stand trial in the senate 
the judges who filed the complaint against hastings did so under 
the provisions of the judicial councils reform and judicial conduct 
disability act of 1980 
under the law any person may file a complaint alleging that a 
federal judge or magistrate has engaged in conduct prejudicial to 
the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the 
courts or is unable to discharge all the duties of office by 
reason of mental or physical disability 
the chief judge of a judicial circuit has the authority to 
dismiss the complaint as frivolous or empanel an investigative 
committee of judges 
if that committee believes impeachment may be warranted the 
1980 law requires it to certify that determination with the 
judicial conference which in turn may conduct its own 
investigation and send the matter to the house 
hastings contends that the law unconstitutionally allows judges 
to usurp congressional power by taking impeachment matters before 
the house 
hastings the only black federal trial judge in florida has 
suggested that the allegations against him could be racially 
inspired 
he also has said he may be the victim of a vendetta by justice 
department officials angered by his rulings that blocked 
deportations of haitian refugees 
rehnquist disqualified himself from acting on the emergency 
request and the formal appeal from hastings 
the cases are hastings vs us judicial conference 871187 
and hastings vs house judiciary committee a788

the supreme court today refused to let a 
dallas blood bank withhold the names and medical records of its 
donors from a woman who says her husband contracted aids after 
receiving tranfusions 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that donors 
privacy rights do not override patty jo bakers need to learn their 
identities for her wrongfuldeath lawsuit 
although todays action sets no national precedent the justices 
twice in two months have rejected arguments that the national 
interests in a viable volunteer blood system are jeopardized by 
releasing donors names in such circumstances 
george w baker underwent surgery at lewisville memorial 
hospital in dallas in 1984 and received several transfusions 
during and after the operation he died in 1986 of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
his widow charging that at least one of the transfused blood 
units was contaminated with the aids virus sued the hosital the 
operating surgeon and two blood banks that supply the hospital 
as part of the pretrial discovery proceedings mrs bakers 
lawyers sought the identities and medical records of all blood 
donors whose blood had been used in bakers health care 
the defendants objected arguing that complying with the 
requests would violate donors privacy rights and that such 
information was protected under the physicianpatient privilege 
a trial judge ruled that the requested information must be 
released and a state appeals court agreed the texas supreme court 
refused to hear the case 
the appeal acted on today was filed by one of the sued blood 
banks known as the blood center at wadley it is based in dallas 
lawyers for the blood bank said courts in florida and iowa have 
barred the release of blood donors names in similar cases 
the blood banks are a nationwide operation the appeal said 
a blood donors freedom from intrusive questioning and disclosure 
of the most intimate details of his life should not depend upon 
which state the donor chooses as his place of residence or where 
his blood is sent 
the appeal said the texas courts gave too litle weight to the 
privacy of donors and the interest of the public in a volunteer 
blood system

houston 871438

the supreme court today refused to let the 
government approve the use in cosmetics of color additives that 
pose a minimal risk of causing cancer 
the court without comment rejected arguments by the cosmetics 
industry that safe substances are being forced off the market 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last october that 
federal law prohibits the food and drug administration from 
approving two additives orange dye number 17 and red dye number 
19 even though the cancer risks are trivial 
government researchers citing tests with laboratory animals 
said the lifetime use of a product with orange dye number 17 poses 
a cancer risk of one in 19 billion and for red dye number 19 one 
in nine million 
the fda said the threat from each was so trivial as to be 
effectively no risk 
the dyes are used in lipsticks face powders rouges and 
products for hair and nails 
the appeals court compared use of the dyes to the greater risk 
of cosmic radiation posed by living in denver or of toxins 
contained in peanuts 
those who indulge in those activities can hardly be thought 
of as living dangerously the appeals court said 
but it gave a strict interpretation to a 1960 federal law that 
prohibits fda approval for any color additive found to induce 
cancer in man or animal 
the appeals court said it decided with some reluctance that 
the law does not allow exceptions for minimally risky products 
the fdas approval of the color additives was challenged by 
public citizen a consumer group it said banning the dyes is 
sensible because of uncertainty about whether there are safe levels 
for carcinogens and the lack of benefits of color additives 
the cosmetic toiletry and fragrance association representing 
the cosmetics industry asked the supreme court to permit fda 
approval 
reagan administration lawyers said they disagree with the 
appeals court ruling but said the case does not warrant the high 
courts review 
the case is cosmetic toiletry and fragrance association vs

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that a worker may not be fired for refusing on religious grounds to 
pay union dues 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by a machinists 
union in seattle wash seeking to force a boeing co employee to 
pay union dues 
thomasine nichols said her personal religious beliefs bar her 
from paying dues to lodge 751 of the international association of 
machinists amp aerospace workers 
mrs nichols said she believes the bible teaches that labor 
organizations should be abolished her view is not shared by the 
religious group to which she belongs the bethel temple 
she offered to contribute a sum equal to her assessed union dues 
to a charity 
boeing refused to fire her even though her refusal to pay dues 
violated the companys contract with the machinists union 
the union sued in federal court in 1986 it said mrs nichols 
should not be exempt from paying dues because she is not a member 
of a religious organization that traditionally opposes union 
membership 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled last november that 
mrs nichols is protected against being fired by the federal civil 
rights act of 1972 which requires employers to make reasonable 
accommodations for workers religious beliefs 
the law requires such accommodations unless they pose undue 
hardships to the employer 
the appeals court said granting a dues exemption to mrs nichols 
does not impose undue hardship on the union 
to prove undue hardship a union must demonstrate a widespread 
refusal to pay union dues the appeals court said 
the appeals court also rejected the unions claims that a 1985 
supreme court ruling requires mrs nichols pay the dues 
the justices in 1985 struck down a connecticut law that gave 
workers a right to designate their own sabbath as a day off from 
work 
the 9th circuit court said the 1985 ruling declared the 
connecticut law unconstitutional because of its complete failure 
to take into account the interests of the employer and other 
employees who did not observe a sabbath 
the 1972 civil rights law does not give an unqualified right 
to employees to have their religious beliefs accommodated the 
appeals court said 
therefore the federal law adheres to the constitutions required 
separation of church and state the appeals court said 
the unions argument that the national labor relations act of 
1980 takes precedence over the 1972 law also was rejected by the 
appeals court 
the 1980 law says no worker may be forced to pay union dues if 
that violates established and traditional tenets or teachings of 
a bona fide religion body or sect 
the 9th circuit court said that rights created by the 1972 law 
are independent and separate from the rights created by the 
national labor relations act 
mrs nichols was aided in the case by the national right to work 
legal defense foundation in springfield va

the supreme court said today it will try to 
clarify the issue of when a federal civil rights law may be used to 
sue states and their agencies 
the court agreed to consider a lawsuit that accuses michigan 
officials of denying a promotion to a state employee because his 
brother was a political activist 
the justices will review a ruling that threw out a suit against 
the state police and its director 
ray will sought promotion to a job as data systems analyst with 
the state police in 1973 he had been ranked second on a promotion 
list and moved up to number one when the applicant above him 
withdrew from consideration 
but will said he learned years later that he didnt get the job 
because a socalled red squad operated by the state police had 
investigated his brother charles a student political activist 
the red squad which monitored campus radicals with subversive 
ideas was held unconstitutional by a state judge in 1976 
will then sued his employers in state court under a federal 
civil rights law enacted after the civil war the suit named the 
state police and its director as defendants 
a state judge in 1982 ruled that wills rights were violated and 
awarded him more than 153000 for lost wages emotional distress 
and punitive damages 
but the michigan supreme court overruled the judge last august 
the states highest court said the civil rights law invoked by 
will authorizes suits against persons and that neither the 
state the state police nor the police director may be 
characterized as a person for purposes of seeking back pay and 
monetary damages 
neither a state nor a state official sued in an official 
capacity for retroactive relief is a person under the law the 
state court said 
the state court cited a number of us supreme court rulings 
dealing with the issue of state immunity from lawsuits the state 
court said the rulings are somewhat ambiguous but on the whole 
support its decision barring wills suit 
in the appeal acted on today will said other state and federal 
courts have held that states and state officials may be considered 
persons who are subject to being sued under federal civil 
rights law

the supreme court said today it will decide 
whether public criminal records compiled by the fbi generally must 
be released under the freedom of information act 
the justices agreed to study a reagan administration attempt to 
scuttle an foia lawsuit by a cbs news reporter and the reporters 
committee for freedom of the press aimed at obtaining such 
documents 
the fbi maintains identification records called rap sheets 
on some 24 million americans detailing arrest and conviction 
information supplied by federal state and local law enforcement 
agencies 
cbs correspondent robert schakne in 1978 sought all fbi records 
of the arrests indictments and court dispositions of any charges 
against four brothers two of whom were identified as associates of 
reputed pennsylvania crime boss russell bufalino 
filed under the foia a 1966 law aimed at curtailing government 
secrecy the request sought information about william phillip 
samuel and charles medico 
schakne said he was trying to determine if the brothers had 
criminal records because their firm medico industries inc had 
received lucrative defense contracts with the help of former rep 
daniel j flood dpa 
schakne said he requested the fbi files as part of his reporting 
on flood who had been charged with accepting 50000 in bribes 
flood pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 1980 and was placed on 
probation 
the washingtonbased reporters committee later filed a similar 
request 
in 1980 the pennsylvania crime commission identified phillip 
angelo and william medico as members of the organized crime family 
allegedly headed by bufalino 
the 1980 report said bufalino regularly visited the medico 
family business near wilkesbarre pa over a 20year period 
the report said flood had used the medico industries box at a 
local racetrack and attended samuel medicos funeral 
schakne confined his request to documents that were a matter 
of public record 
the fbi first denied the request but later released the rap 
sheet on the late william medico 
the bureau said it had no records on phillip and samuel also 
deceased and refused to release its file on charles medico 
government lawyers said releasing the information would violate 
medicos privacy 
the us circuit court of appeals here last year rejected 
justice department arguments that such fbi records are covered by 
privacy exemptions contained in the 1966 law 
one exemption authorizes withholding information if its 
disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of 
personal privacy 
another applying only to law enforcement records authorizes 
withholding if disclosure could reasonably be expecged to 
constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy 
the appeals court ordered us district judge john garrett penn 
to review the requested documents and determine if they were 
considered public by pennsylvania authorities 
if so the appeals court said they are discloseable under the 
foia 
in the appeal acted on today government lawyers noted that the 
federal appeals court based in new york city has ruled that such 
fbi documents are covered by foia privacy exemptions and can be 
withheld

scientology members for auditing and training sessions is not a 
charitable contribution that can be counted as a tax deduction 
scientologists say the irs has singled out their church for 
unfair treatment and is interfering with their religious freedom 
federal law allows taxpayers to reduce their tax liability by 
declaring various deductions including money or things of value 
given to charities or religious organizations but such a payment 
is not tax deductible if something of value is received in return 
a practice within the church of scientology is a process known 
as auditing in which members are expected to reach a higher level 
of spiritual awareness auditing is administered in a onetoone 
session in which the church members skin responses to questions 
are measured by an electronic device 
the church also engages in training sessions in which members 
study the doctrines and practices of scientology 
the church charges a fixed donation for training and 
auditing and almost never waives the payment requirement 
the us tax court ruled in a 1984 test case that the fixed 
donations required by the church are not taxdeductible 
contributions but instead are nondeductible payments made for 
services 
the tax court said the payments were not voluntary transfers 
without consideration but were made with the expectation of 
receiving a commensurate benefit in return 
the individual scientologists involved in the tax court decision 
were katherine jean graham of honolulu richard m hermann of los 
angeles and david f maynard of rialto calif 
three federal appeals courts in challenges by those 
scientologists and others to the tax court ruling upheld the tax 
court but one the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled for 
the scientologists 
participation in strictly religious practices is not a 
recognizable return benefit under federal tax law the st 
louisbased 8th circuit court said 
it added regardless of the timing of the payment or the 
details of the churchs method of soliciting contributions from its 
members an amount remitted to a qualified church with no return 
other than participation in strictly spiritual and doctrinal 
religious practices is a contribution within the meaning of the 
tax code 
in contrast the bostonbased 1st us circuit court of appeals 
ruled that the payments by scientologists are not taxdeductible 
we find no indication that congress intended to distinguish 
the religious benefits sought by a scientologist trying to claim 
his payments to the church as tax deductions from other 
benefits that could likewise provide the quid for the quo of a 
nondeductible payment to a charitable organization the 1st 
circuit court said 
the justices chose the 1st circuit court involving scientology 
member robert l hernandez to study the issue court documents did 
not indicate where hernandez resides but he is represented by new 
haven conn lawyer michael j graetz 
the case is hernandez vs commissioner of internal revenue

an american tug and supply vessel was 
reported safe today after being fired on by iranians responding to 
a us attack in the persian gulf a spokesman for the company that 
owns the vessel said 
my understanding is that it the willi tide was fired on but 
it was not hit said victor koock senior vice president and 
general counsel for tidewater inc all this is unconfirmed but 
thats what i was told a few minutes ago 
koock said the 283ton vessel sailed back to a persian gulf 
port probably in dubai he said a crew of about 12 people was 
aboard and he had no reports of injuries 
the willi tide is a specialized vessel that carries supplies to 
offshore oil platforms and is also equipped for towing 
the attack on the willi tide came after us warships destroyed 
two offshore iranian oil platforms and an iranian patrol boat iran 
responded by rocketing oil facilities and firing on at least two 
us vessels 
the american attack was in retaliation for a mine explosion that 
tore a hole in an american frigate last week injuring 10 crewmen 
the londonbased lloyds shipping intelligence unit reported 
that iranian boats attacking the willi tide fled after unidentified 
warplanes swooped low over the scene

the supreme court in a case stemming from the 
1982 war over the falkland islands today agreed to decide whether 
argentina may be sued in us courts for attacking a neutral oil 
tanker 
the justices said they will hear arguments by argentine 
officials supported by the reagan administration aimed at killing 
the lawsuit 
at issue is whether a foreign nation accused of violating 
international law may be sued in federal courts in this country by 
a foreign corporation engaged in us trade 
the case stems from an attack on the oil tanker hercules by 
argentine aircraft on june 8 1982 the ship was some 600 miles 
from the argentine coast and nearly 500 miles from the falkland 
islands 
argentina and great britain were at war over control of the 
islands which argentina calls the malvinas 
the hercules was owned by united carriers inc and chartered by 
amerada hess shipping corp to carry oil from alaska around the 
southern tip of south america to a refinery in the us virgin 
islands 
united carriers and amerada hess are both liberian corporations 
the hercules was attacked despite a us alert to great britain 
and argentina that it was among neutral vessels traveling in the 
south atlantic 
the badly damaged tanker made it to port in rio de janeiro 
brazil but officials scuttled the ship on july 20 1982 because 
an unexploded bomb was embedded in one of its tanks 
united carriers sued argentina for 10 million for the destroyed 
tanker and amerada said it lost 2 million in fuel 
the suit was filed in federal court in new york city after 
argentine officials refused to consider the claims the companies 
were unable to hire argentine attorneys to pursue a suit in that 
nations courts 
a us federal judge threw out the suit but it was reinstated 
last september by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court in ordering a trial rejected arguments that 
argentina was immune from being sued because of a 1976 us law 
granting foreign nations broad protection from such claims 
the appeals court said that under a different law enacted by 
congress in 1789 a foreign nation may be sued in us courts by a 
foreign corporation or foreign individual when the nation is 
accused of violating international law or a us treaty 
it is beyond controversy that attacking a neutral ship in 
international waters without proper cause for suspicion or 
investigation violates international law the appeals court said 
it added that protections of sovereign immunity do not apply in 
the same way that nazi war criminals at the nuremberg trials after 
world war ii were not immune from prosecution 
the reagan administration said the appeals court ruling could 
have dire consequences for us foreign policy 
the courts of the united states are not the proper forums for 
the resolution of the legality of acts of foreign states justice 
department lawyers said sensitive foreign policy concerns are 
implicated 
the government lawyers also said the appeals court decision 
threatens to turn the courts of the united states into tribunals 
in which aliens generally but not us citizens may seek redress 
against foreign governments for conduct that has no substantial 
nexus to the united states 
the case is argentine republic vs amerada hess 871372

the supreme court today left intact a 208 
million award to the family of a texas cowboy who died of leukemia 
after a medicine for cattle and horses seeped into his cuts and 
bruises 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by the medicine 
manufacturer ordered to pay the damages 
clois osburn who worked as a cowboy in the texas panhandle 
began in 1982 to administer to sick calves an antibiotic drug 
called veterinary chloramphenicol 
osburn would pour the drug from its original bottle into another 
bottle that had a rubber lid into which a needle could be inserted 
he said the medicine frequently leaked from the rubbertopped 
container and got into scratches and cuts on his arm 
osburn was 42 when he was diagnosed in february 1984 as having 
leukemia he died in july 1987 
osburn and his wife anita sued anchor laboratories inc and 
rachelle laboratories inc manufacturers of the drug they said 
the companies failed to warn users of the medicines dangers and 
that such a failure violated a texas law protecing against personal 
injuries 
anchor labs agreed to a settlement paying the osburns 225000 
a federal jury awarded the osburns 25 million against rahcelle 
labs a sum later reduced to 208 million by the 5th us circuit 
court of appeals 
rachelle labs said the verdict is unfair because its warning 
label on the drug was approved by the federal food and drug 
administration 
the company said it could not comply with the fda labeling 
regulations and at the same time use a label that would fulfill its 
obligations to comply with texas law 
but the 5th circuit court said the fda regulations did not 
prevent rachelle from adding to its label warnings of the dangers 
of fatal blood diseases associated with exposure to 
chloramphenicol 
the appeals court also said there had been enough evidence for 
the jury to decide that osburns leukemia was caused by the drug 
the case is rachelle laboratories vs anita osburn 871496

the supreme court today refused to hear delta 
air lines challenge to a rule barring it from offering nonstop 
flights between salt lake city and new york citys laguardia 
airport 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that a 
socalled perimeter rule in effect for laguardia prohibiting 
nonstop flights to or from points more than 1500 miles away is 
valid 
laguardia is operated by the port authority of new york and new 
jersey which also runs kennedy international airport and newark 
international airport in the metropolitan new york area 
until 1984 the port authoritys perimeter rule for laguardia 
was informal and barred flights to or from points more than 2000 
miles away the authority in 1984 imposed a formal 1500mile 
perimeter rule but allowed flights to and from denver which is 
1600 miles away to continue 
delta in 1986 sought to operate nonstop flights between 
laguardia and salt lake city international airport the 
atlantabased airline had operated such flights between kennedy 
airport and salt lake city for some years 
when the authority rejected the request delta sued it charged 
that the local rule violated a federal law banning state or local 
agencies from enforcing any rule relating to rates routes or 
services of any air carrier 
a federal judge dismissed the suit ruling that the perimeter 
rule is a valid exercise of the port authoritys proprietary 
powers 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld that ruling last 
year 
justice department lawyers urged the high court to reject the 
delta appeal acted on today 
they said the 2nd circuit courts decision is limited to those 
state or local agencies operating more than one airport 
since there is no indication that any other proprietor is 
likely to impose a perimeter rule this decision is unlikely to 
have any significant impact upon the national air transportation 
system the government lawyers said 
the case is delta air lines vs port authority 87333

the supreme court today let stand rulings that 
public school teachers have no right under federal law to block 
public review of their college transcripts 
the justices without comment turned away arguments that such 
information is protected under a 1974 federal law aimed at ensuring 
students privacy rights 
a houston school district and one of its teachers sued in 1986 
in an attempt to keep her college transcript from being released 
under the texas open records act 
two members of the public had requested that donald collins 
superintendent of schools for the klein independent school 
district release the personnel file and other related public 
records of rebecca holt a teacher 
collins then requested an opinion from state attorney general 
jim mattox concerning whether ms holts college transcript could 
be withheld 
collins was told the transcript had to be released under the 
states open records act 
the ensuing federal lawsuit contended that a federal law the 
family educational rights and privacy act of 1974 authorized 
withholding the transcript from public release 
the federal law is aimed at limiting the authority of school 
officials to release students transcripts without the consent of 
the students or their parents 
the suit filed by the school district and ms holt contended 
that the federal law preempts enforcement of the state law 
a federal trial judge threw out the suit ruling that the 
federal law does not apply when a school is asked to release the 
transcript of one of its employees 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the dismissal last 
oct 22 
excluded from ferpas protections are records relating to an 
individual who is employed by an educational agency or 
institution the appeals court ruled 
it emphasized the right of the public to know the academic 
records of the schoolteachers of their children adding 
recently there has been grave concern in texas about the quality 
of public education many teachers who had been certified and 
were teaching in texas classrooms could not pass a basic test of 
minimal competency 
the appeals court said in light of this apparent lack of 
competency prevalent in the state the public must have full and 
complete information concerning the teachers who serve the public 
in educating their children 
the case is klein independent school district vs mattox

james e olson the forceful chairman of 
american telephone amp telegraph co who got his start cleaning silt 
out of manholes died early today of cancer he was 62 
olson who had led the telecommunications giant since the fall 
of 1986 had been operated on last month for a tumor in the colon 
atampt president robert e allen who took over after olson became 
ill last month will continue to direct the company until the board 
of directors elects a new chairman company spokeswoman lynda 
beighley said 
atampts directors will meet around the time of the annual meeting 
wednesday in denver but ms beighley said she could not say if a 
chairman would be picked at that time 
olson became ill with flu on march 18 and had surgery seven days 
later he returned home april 1 and had been undergoing 
chemotherapy as an outpatient since that time he died at home 
all of us in the company are shocked at the suddenness of 
jims death allen said in a statement he was a dynamic and 
visionary leader we will miss him our legacy to him will be the 
vigor with which we carry out the strategic course he laid out for 
us during his 20 months as our leader 
allen 52 is the companys president and chief operating 
officer 
olson had made atampt more aggressive more costconscious and 
more certain of its direction since taking office in september 1986 
analysts said the company had drifted in the first years after 
the breakup of the bell system on jan 1 1984 when local phone 
service was split into seven regional bell holding companies 
olson who landed his first job in the bell system at age 17 
was considered a takecharge executive with an emphasis on getting 
results disdaining the fashion of corporate boardrooms the beefy 
executive wore shortsleeved shirts throughout his career 
jim olson was the ultimate tough guy i think he instilled 
a real sense of pride and determination in an atampt workforce that 
at that time needed it said jack grubman an analyst for 
painewebber inc 
i think he leaves atampt in good hands grubman said if 
this had happened a year ago it would have been extremely 
disruptive 
allen is widely considered to be atampts almost certain choice as 
a successor to olson he is a bigpicture guy grubman said 
his style is probably more overtly executive than olsons he 
said 
olson a native of devils lake nd was born dec 3 1925 his 
first job in which he cleaned manholes was as a splicers helper 
in 1943 with northwestern bell telephone co in grand forks nd 
twentythree years later olson had moved through the ranks of 
the company to become vice president and general manager for iowa 
he was transferred to indiana bell as vice president for operations 
in 1970 and became president of that company two years later 
in 1974 olson assumed the presidency of illinois bell and in 
1977 became executive vice president of atampt headquarters in new 
york city he was made president and chief operating officer in 
june 1985 after serving as vice chairman of the board since 1979 
olson was a graduate of the university of north dakota and 
served on the boards of many companies business organizations and 
charitable groups 
olsons undisclosed illness was reminiscent of that of william 
mcgowan the chairman of atampts longdistance rival mci 
communications corp who suffered a heart attack in december 1986 
received a heart transplant and returned to office in september 
1987 
both companies drew criticism for failing to announce their 
chiefs illnesses until news leaked to the press 
olson is survived by his wife jean a son james d olson a 
daughter mrs bruce paterson one brother and two sisters

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
lawsuit against the federal aviation administration stemming from 
an airplane crash near bishop calif that killed 36 people in 
1974 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that the faa is 
immune from charges that its negligence contributed to the accident 
a sierra pacific airline charter flight crashed into a foothill 
of the white mountains the night of march 13 1974 just after 
taking off from bishop airport 
relatives of some of the crash victims sued the faa charging 
that there was inadequate ground lighting near the airport and that 
the faa negligently had failed to conduct night test flights before 
publishing an approved departure procedure 
the suit was filed under the federal tort claims act a law that 
waives the governments sovereign immunity and allows it to be sued 
in some instances 
but lower courts ruled that the faa officials who investigated 
safety conditions at the bishop airport and prepareed departure 
procedures for use there were acting within the scope of the 
discretionary function exception to the ftca 
the government may not be sued under the law if the allegedly 
wrongful actions stemmed from a government officials discretionary 
authority

the supreme court today refused to rule that 
convicted killers never are denied fair sentencing trials when 
jurors see them in leg irons 
the court without comment or a dissenting vote rejected 
florida prosecutors argument that using shackles at sentencing 
trials as opposed to trials on guilt or innocence is not 
inherently prejudicial because jurors already know the defendant is 
guilty of a violent crime 
william duane elledge was convicted of killing margaret anne 
strack in hollywood fla in 1975 and also was convicted of two 
subsequent murders in jacksonville 
his original death sentence for the strack murder was 
overturned but in 1977 elledge was resentenced to death for that 
crime 
the presiding judge ordered that elledge be placed in leg irons 
during the second sentencing trial the judge explained before a 
jury was selected and outside the presence of potential jurors 
that elledge purportedly had become an expert in karate while 
imprisoned and planned to attack the court bailiff 
the judge said he received that information from a county jail 
official 
elledge asked if he could say something about the judges 
order but he was not allowed to do so 
in striking down elledges death sentence the 11th us circuit 
court of appeals last july said the state at no time made any 
showing that the shackling was necessary to further an essential 
state interest 
the appeals court noted that elledge was not given an adequate 
opportunity to challenge the untested information that served as 
the basis for the shackling 
even though the sentencing jury knew elledge had committed a 
gruesome crime his appearance at the sentencing trial in leg irons 
was inherently prejudicial and should not have been required 
without proof to substantiate the report on which the judge relied 
the appeals court said 
in the appeal acted on today florida attorney general robert 
butterworth argued in the exercise of common sense the jurors 
could not have been inherently prejudiced by seeing elledge 
shackled when they knew from the outset of his sentencing 
proceeding that he was a convicted murderer

ferry service across the east river began this 
morning for some of the nearly 250000 travelers denied use of the 
decrepit williamsburg bridge 
the first boat moved out at 7 am from a hastily built pier 
near the brooklyn side of the bridge and made the 15minute voyage 
to connect with subways at the tip of manhattan 
the bridge a vital link between manhattan and queens and 
brooklyn was closed to cars trucks and subways last week when 
inspectors found it decaying from rust corrosion and years of 
neglect 
the inauguration of the ferry was very smooth according to 
transportation department spokesman victor ross transportation 
commissioner ross sandler was on hand for a ceremonial opening at a 
later departure 
sandler said sunday that to get the 371 city bridges with a 
poor or fair rating to a good or better rating well have to spend 
25 billion over the next 10 years he said the figure would go 
up another half billion if the williamsburg must be replaced 
he said inspectors were half finished with their examination of 
the williamsburg and theres nothing that weve found so far that 
we wont be able to fix 
fliers advertising the ferry service are being distributed in 
english spanish and yiddish there is a large orthodox jewish 
population in the williamsburg section of brooklyn 
the city is using two of its smaller ferries each capable of 
carrying 1280 passengers that normally run between staten island 
and manhattan at night and on weekends

a member of kuwaits royal family held 
hostage aboard a jumbo jet said today he wants his government to 
give in to the hijackers demand and free 17 terrorists imprisoned 
in kuwait 
speaking extremely slowly and in a tired voice a man identified 
by the arab hijackers as fadel khaled alsabah said i hope 
kuwait releases all the prisoners he then mumbled something 
unintelligible and added thanks to god 
the control tower at algiers houari boumedienne airport asked in 
english that the statement be repeated one of the hijackers then 
got on the radio and replied he doesnt want to talk 
reports from a hostage freed earlier said that alsabah was in 
very bad condition apparently suffering from a nervous disorder 
two other members of the royal family alsabahs sisters also are 
aboard kuwait airways flight 422 
the thailandtokuwait flight was hijacked april 5 with 112 
people aboard and forced to land in mashhad iran where 57 were 
released on april 8 the jet flew to cyprus where two passengers 
were killed and 13 freed since landing in algiers one passenger 
has been freed leaving about 35 hostages including the three 
members of kuwaits extensive royal family 
the five to eight hijackers are demanding the release of the 17 
men jailed for bombing the us and french embassies in kuwait in 
1983 
kuwait has refused the demand 
the shiite moslem hijackers are armed with grenades and guns and 
have threatened to blow up the plane 
algerian officials privately expressed hope the gunmen might 
free one or more of their estimated 35 hostages early today as a 
gesture of goodwill to mark the beginning of the monthlong fast of 
ramadan traditionally a period of reconciliation for devout 
moslems 
the hijackers demanded a special ramadan meal before dawn but 
no hostage had been released when the fast began at daybreak 
on sunday a passenger radioed a message to the control tower 
saying that the hostages faced certain death if the 17 proiranian 
prisoners were not freed by kuwait 
a man aboard the jet who identified himself as suleiman farhan 
doukhi said in the message all the passengers are in good 
health i hope the kuwait government will act quickly to liberate 
the 17 young prisoners otherwise we all face a black end 
three other passengers have made similar statements since the 
plane landed in algiers early wednesday 
during the night algerian negotiators repeatedly went to the 
plane around 2 am 9 pm sunday edt three algerian security 
vehicles shuttled across the tarmac going separately two and from 
the aircraft 
algerian television cameras caught one of the hijackers coming 
down off the plane during the night to negotiate with unidentified 
persons in a car near the jetliner 
the algerian camera showed a hooded man coming to the bottom of 
the stairs and after a few minutes returning to the plane and 
coming down again with a second man they stayed in the car about 
15 minutes 
contacts intensified sunday between president chadli bendjedid 
of algeria and other arab heads of state saudi arabian king fahd 
kuwaiti ruler shiek jaber alahmed alsabah and libyan leader 
moammar gadhafi all reportedly spoke by telephone with bendjedid 
during the day 
algerian authorities abruptly expelled hundreds of reporters 
sunday from the section of the vip lounge where they had been 
staying for nearly a week 
one official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
lounge was needed for arab ambassadors expected to come to the 
airport for a possible expansion of the negotiations the official 
declined to provide any details 
algerian officials said that palestine liberation organization 
leader yasser arafat was expected in algiers but declined to say 
when he would arrive or whether he would play a role in the 
negotiations 
the gunmen who have threatened to fly the jet out of algeria 
to settle our score with kuwait somewhere else agreed on 
sunday to delay their departure to pursue negotiations 
there has been no indication of where they might go if they left 
algiers

the arrest of student activists who 
staged a sitin over minority issues has cast a shadow of 
uncertainty over penn state universitys efforts to recruit blacks 
for next fall officials say 
the timing of this couldnt be any worse said scott f 
healy penn states admissions director explaining that parents 
are sitting down with collegebound offspring now to decide which 
school theyll attend this fall 
when you show a student being escorted out of a building in 
handcuffs it isnt a positive image of education healy said 
more than 150 students most of them black occupied penn 
states telecommunications building april 8 when university 
president bryce jordan canceled a meeting with nine black students 
who had staged a sitin outside his office three days earlier 
police arrested 89 protesters who remained in the 
telecommunications building the next morning 
jordan convened an open meeting today with student leaders to 
discuss minority issues and agreed to drop all criminal and 
university charges against the protesters 
the outcome of the meeting will heavily influence minority 
recruitment for this fall said vice provost carol cartwright who 
chairs the universitys equal opportunity planning committee 
before the protests minority applications were up 7 percent 
over last year healy said he acknowledged that the arrests could 
scare off some minority students 
it could say to minorities this is not the place i want to 
go for the next four years he said 
the students involved in the sitins have complained of the low 
number of blacks enrolled at penn state and are expected to 
include better minority recruitment in their demands at the meeting 
last fall penn state failed to reach a courtmandated goal of 5 
percent black enrollment the university has 2424 blacks 
throughout the state system 36 percent of its 67278 students 
courtney pinkney president of the student black caucus agrees 
the arrests and the publicity surrounding them may have hurt 
minority recruitment 
in no way can they blame the black students ms pinkney 
said if things would have been correct from the beginning this 
wouldnt have happened 
student activists have not spelled out the demands they plan to 
present at the meeting but protester robert blair said they would 
be similar to those made by a group of students at a board of 
trustees meeting last november 
at that meeting students complained about low numbers of black 
students and faculty requested the creation of the post of vice 
president for minority affairs and asked that all undergraduates 
be required to take black studies 
in 1986 black students at penn states state college campus 
stopped helping admissions recruiters and spread word the school 
wasnt a good place for blacks 
when you have your own students working against you it is 
very difficult if not impossible to turn the situation around and 
get black and hispanic students to come healy said 
this spring with the admissions offices blessing students 
from the black caucus began meeting with minority applicants to 
tell them what life at the school is like 
the students wanted to be convinced we were telling the 
truth said gary kelsey director of the division of minority 
admissions and community affairs 
ms pinkney a senior from philadelphia said she was recruited 
by penn state when she was in 10th grade 
i thought penn state was the greatest place on earth when i 
got here i thought it was very unfortunate and very unfair i was 
not told the real deal she said

the supreme court today agreed to study the 
rights of unwed fathers whose children are put up for adoption by 
their mothers 
at issue whether unwed fathers who actively seek custody of 
their children may be stripped of all parental rights if adoption 
is deemed to be in the childrens best interest 
the justices said they will use a case from san diego calif 
to review rulings that terminated edward mcnamaras parental rights 
to his daughter katie who is now 6 years old 
mcnamara and katies mother unidentified in court records had 
not seen each other for eight months when katie was born in 1981 
mcnamara did not learn of the pregnancy or birth until he was told 
katie then a month old had been placed in a foster home awaiting 
adoption 
he quickly sought custody 
katie was 5 months old before a trial was held on mcnamaras 
custody request and a california judge ruled that it was in 
katies best interest to stay with the foster parents she had been 
living with 
the foster parents wanted to adopt katie and the judge ruled 
that the baby girl had bonded with them 
the judge acknowledged that mcnamara was a good parent who 
can provide a good loving home for the child 
the california supreme court reversed the ruling stating that 
custody could not be awarded to a nonparent unless awarding 
custody of the child to one of its parents who sought custody would 
be detrimental to the child 
the states highest court sent the case back to a trial court to 
determine whether the passage of time had made an award of custody 
to mcnamara detrimental for katie by then adopted 
the trial court in 1985 ruled against mcnamara and stripped him 
of all of his parental rights to katie the judge however 
encouraged katies adoptive parents to make edward part of katies 
life 
in the appeal acted on today mcnamara argued that his treatment 
in the california courts violated his equalprotection rights 
he noted that wed fathers cannot lose their parental rights 
unless they are found to have no interest or ability in parenting 
the child 
and he noted that unwed mothers would not lose their parental 
rights under similar circumstances 
the justices agreed to study the case and if they find they 
have the proper jurisdiction to rule on whether mcnamara received 
fair treatment 
in other action the court 
agreed to decide whether states may bar political party 
leaders from endorsing primary election candidates and whether 
states may regulate political party structure 
the justices said they will consider reinstating parts of a 
california law overturned as infringements on citizens rights to 
express themselves and associate with whom they please 
refused to let a dallas blood bank withhold the names and 
medical records of its donors from a woman who says her husband 
contracted aids after receiving transfusions 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that donors 
privacy rights do not override patty jo bakers need to find out 
their identities for her wrongfuldeath lawsuit 
left intact a key federal regulation designed to foster 
competition within the natural gas industry 
the justices without comment rejected appeals by pipeline 
companies that claim the rule places them in an unfair economic 
bind 
rejected an appeal by us district judge alcee hastings who 
says he unlawfully is being subjected to possible impeachment 
the court without comment left intact a 1980 law under which 
fellow judges asked the house of representatives to consider 
impeaching hastings for alleged judicial misconduct 
refused to let the government approve the use in cosmetics of 
color additives that pose a minimal risk of causing cancer 
the court without comment rejected arguments by the cosmetics 
industry that safe substances are being forced off the market 
let stand a ruling that a worker may not be fired for refusing 
on religious grounds to pay union dues 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by a machinists 
union in seattle seeking to force a boeing co employee to pay 
union dues 
said it will decide whether public criminal records compiled 
by the fbi generally must be released under the freedom of 
information act 
the justices agreed to study a reagan administration attempt to 
scuttle an foia lawsuit by a cbs news reporter and the reporters 
committee for freedom of the press aimed at obtaining such 
documents 
agreed to decide whether payments called fixed donations 
made to the church of scientology by its members may be claimed as 
federal income tax deductions 
the courts decision expected sometime next year will resolve 
conflicting rulings by federal appeals courts

the supreme court today was urged to kill a 
lawsuit aimed at stripping the catholic church of its taxexempt 
status because of its antiabortion lobbying 
permitting the suit would open the way to a host of legal 
challenges against tax exemptions for any religion said kevin t 
baine a lawyer representing the catholic church officials 
you can substitute any church any controversial issue 
he said 
but marshall beil a lawyer for prochoice groups and 
individuals argued that the tax exemption for the catholics is 
skewing the political process by giving the church an unfair 
advantage in the national debate over abortion 
only the courts can create a remedy he said the 
political process cant 
the justices have been asked to decide whether the 
prochoice coalition has the required legal standing to sue the 
federal government in hopes of forcing revocation of the churchs 
tax exemptions 
but several justices hinted during 60 minutes of arguments that 
they might order further lower court examination of the issue 
they expressed concern that a federal appeals court had not 
decided the legal standing issue unambiguously 
the high court is faced also with another key procedural issue 
whether the catholic church had a right to appeal a contempt 
citation issued by a federal judge for its failure to turn over 
documents in the case 
the question is whether a witness rather than one of the 
opposing sides in a lawsuit has such a right of appeal prior to 
the outcome of the case 
the justices are expected to announce their decision by july 
alan i horowitz a justice department lawyer argued in support 
of the churchs position 
he said that a ruling in favor of the prochoice groups and 
individuals could expose the government to untold suits by people 
interested but not affected by the outcome of federal regulations 
the prochoice coalition sued in 1980 accusing the 
government of helping to subsidize the churchs antiabortion 
lobbying through tax breaks 
the federal tax code generally bars taxexempt organizations 
from spending money on political activities 
a federal judge in new york city held the church in civil 
contempt in may 1986 for refusing to supply records to those suing 
the government the judge ordered the church to pay 100000 a day 
until it supplied the documents 
but the contempt ruling has been put on hold pending the outcome 
of the churchs appeal to the supreme court 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last year ruled that the 
prochoice groups and individuals have legal standing to sue 
the government 
the appeals court said the prochoice forces claim the 
governments failure to enforce the tax code places them at a 
competitive disadvantage with the catholic church in the arena of 
public advocacy on important public issues 
the reagan administration has taken the churchs side 
government lawyers argue that allowing the suit to survive would 
encourage other suits by those dissatisfied with the tax treatment 
given groups with opposing views 
even if the suits eventually fail justice department lawyers 
have told the court they would give people unwarranted access to 
the courts and a means of forcing adversaries to reveal sensitive 
information 
the case is us catholic conference vs abortion rights 
mobilization 87416

american retaliation by laying new mines in the gulf he urged the 
tehran government to desist from an unsound and unwise policy 
irans return to minelaying in the gulf damaged a us 
military vessel on april 14 and in doing so iran initiated a new 
wave of military confrontation in the region abdelmeguid said

its policy of provoking others

a presidential commission called today for 
major changes in the way the government regulates the airlines 
including more inspections of air carriers and appointment of an 
aviation safety czar with broad authority 
after months of examining aviation safety the sevenmember 
panel concluded that the air transportation system is safe but 
added safety is being maintained to an increasing extent through 
delays and other inconveniences 
and the commission said while the air transport system is 
safe for now the present governmental structure is not working 
effectively enough to ensure its safety in the future 
the panel urged congress to enact legislation that would split 
the federal aviation administration away from the transportation 
department into an independent agency with power shared by an 
administrator and a director of aviation safety 
this director would be in effect a safety czar whose sole 
responsibility would be to ensure the safety of the aviation 
system said john albertine the commissions chairman in 
announcing the recommendations the director would have the 
authority to initiate safety regulations or block regulations 
initiated by the agency 
the commission which was created by congress was directed by 
president reagan last year to examine aviation safety and make 
recommendations on how the federal government could improve its 
regulation of the airline industry 
in the past year there has been increased pressure to make 
sweeping changes in the organization of the faa suggestions have 
ranged from making it a semiprivate agency and possibly taking air 
traffic controllers out of the government altogether to keeping the 
agency in the transportation department 
in a twovolume report the presidents commission on aviation 
safety urged that the faa remain part of the government to 
maintain public accountability but as an independent agency with 
an administrator and an aviation safety director both of whom 
would be appointed for sevenyear terms 
the commission also urged an increase in federal inspectors to 
keep up better with the rapidly changing airline industry and 
called for establishing a broader airline inspection program it 
urged the adoptions of surprise inspections of air carriers as 
well as special inspections for airlines undergoing rapid change 
the commission noted that the faa is committed to hiring 
additional inspectors and has increased the number to more than 
2000 from a low of 1494 five years ago because of continuing 
inspector staff shortages significant portions of the faas 
surveillance program are not being executed the commission said 
the faa currently is committed to major indepth inspections of 
eastern airlines and continental airlines both subsidiaries of 
texas air corp and also has underway a special series of 
inspections of commuter airlines in addition to its routine 
inspection duties 
the commission also concluded among other things that 
a new and independent faa should be given additional 
flexibility including less rigid personnel and procurement 
requirements to deal better with the rapidly changing airline 
industry 
commuter airlines should gradually be required to conform to 
the same federal requirements as larger airlines 
small private planes flying near any hub airports should be 
required to have equipment that tells controllers altitude 
information 
in addition to albertine who is vice chairman of farley 
industries the commission members are s john byington a partner 
in the firm of pillsbury madison and sutro joseph kalt a 
professor at the school of government at harvard michael levine a 
professor at yale university and former executive of new york air 
russell meyer chairman of cessna aircraft co john robson dean 
of the school of business administration at emory university and a 
former chairman of the civil aeronautics board and thomas wathen

banks reopened in panama today for 
the first time in six weeks but only to receive deposits business 
was brisk but most customers appeared wary 
most people deposited checks which they have been unable to 
cash since the banks were closed on march 4 
ill keep my cash at home said frank farrell one of about 
20 people lined up to make deposits at chase manhattan bank when it 
opened later on maybe ill deposit cash 
a retiree farrell said he was depositing about a half dozen 
dividend checks asked if he felt secure in depositing them he 
replied i dont worry chase is solid 
a middleaged panamanian woman in the same line said she also 
was depositing checks only 
i need the cash to eat she said 
it was unclear when the banks would allow withdrawals 
the banks reopened today after the national banking commission 
the governments bank regulator said the banks could resume 
accepting deposits and carrying out interbank operations 
they were closed march 3 after a monthlong run on deposits 
turned into a stampede in late february when gen manuel antonio 
noriega the nations strongman dismissed then president eric 
arturo delvalle 
the reagan administration furthered the economic crisis by 
imposing sanctions on panama including freezing panamanian assets 
in the united states in an effort to force noriega to leave his 
post 
noriega chief of panamas 15000member defense forces is 
under federal indictment in the united states on charges of drug 
trafficking and money laundering 
the united states recognizes delvalle as the nations leader 
delvalle was deposed after he ordered noriega to step down 
in other developments a roman catholic priest on sunday told 
worshipers not to be intimidated by riot police who have crushed 
demonstrations against noriega 
hundreds of people stood and cheered repeatedly during the 
homily by the rev javier villanueva at the christ the king church 
there is no suffering no blow from a truncheon or a stream of 
poisonous water nor an insult nor criticism nor pain that does 
not form part of the suffering of christ he told about 500 
people 
on saturday police trucks equipped with water cannons fired a 
mixture of tear gas and water at about 400 demonstrators most of 
whom were members of an opposition womens group during a march on

a west german computer hacker 
electronically raided about 50 us military computers containing 
defense and aerospace information a prosecutor said today 
the 24yearold student gained access to the computers for 
almost two years through his own computer and telephone links 
according to the west german newsmagazine quick 
some of the raided computers are at the air force systems 
command in el segundo calif and nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
in pasedena calif said hansgeorg von bock prosecuting attorney 
in bremen 
fbi spokesmen said their agency was investigating they declined 
to say whether charges would be filed 
bock refused to say what the student who is from hanover 
discovered in his computer breakins quick said the student was 
able to find out the names of us army officers in japan and 
details about us coastal security systems 
however no one said whether the man uncovered any important 
secrets 
bock said bremen authorities had abandoned their inquiry for 
lack of evidence bock refused to provide any details about the 
suspect including his name because the investigation had been 
dropped 
we wanted to catch the suspect committing the acts but 
unfortunately that did not happen bock said 
he said the electronic links were made by telephone via a 
computer at bremen university 
the bremen court decided it could not be proven who 
originated these calls bock said 
hackers are computer enthusiasts who try to gain unauthorized 
access to other computers through telephone lines some hackers say 
they commit their electronic breakins just for fun 
quick said the electronic breakins were detected in august 1986 
by the lawrence berkeley laboratory in berkeley calif which does 
unclassified research the laboratory and its sister institution 
the lawrence livermore laboratory which is involved in nuclear 
weapons research and the strategic defense initiative known as 
star wars are operated by the university of california for the 
us government 
quick said authorities questioned the student in june and the 
breakins stopped at about that time 
bock said west german investigators had been handicapped because 
german law prevents them from tapping telephones unless they 
suspect a more serious crime such as murder

a christiancontrolled radio station 
reported today that us marine lt col william r higgins has 
been killed by his proiranian shiite moslem captors 
the voice of lebanon said higgins was killed and buried by his 
captors early this month in siddiqine a village in south lebanon 
the beirutbased voice of lebanon has a record of frequent 
inaccuracies concerning the foreign hostages in lebanon its report 
on higgins could not be independently verified 
timur goksel the spokesman for the un interim force in south 
lebanon with which higgins was serving when he was abducted said 
of the report we can neither confirm nor deny the report or 
anything related to it 
he spoke by telephone from the un groups headquarters in 
naqoura on the lebaneseisraeli border 
we have no such information and therefore we cannot comment 
on the radio report goksel added we have checked with our 
sources and everybody was surprised when they heard about the 
report 
at un headquarters in new york spokeswoman nadia younes later 
told reporters that unifil had checked with its sources and found 
no confirmation of the radio report 
the radio said higgins was killed hours before prosyrian 
militiamen of justice minister nabih berris amal militia captured 
siddiqine from hezbollah supporters apparently to keep amal from 
claiming credit for his liberation 
amal and hezbollah spokesmen in beirut made no comment on the 
report the two groups have been at odds since higgins 43 of 
danville ky was kidnapped near the southern port of tyre on feb 
17 
siddiqine 10 miles southeast of tyre was a hezbollah 
stronghold before amal crushed its shiite moslem fundamentalist 
rivals in a fourday crackdown early this month 
amal supports the presence of the un peacekeeping force in 
predominantly shiite south lebanon hezbollah or the party of god 
opposes it 
amal has charged that hezbollah masterminded higgins abduction 
to undermine amals control of south lebanon 
hezbollah is a proiranian extremist group that is believed to 
be an umbrella for factions holding most of the 22 foreign hostages 
in lebanon hezbollah has not claimed to hold any foreign hostages 
higgins abduction was claimed by a group calling itself the 
organization of the oppressed on earth which charged that he was a 
cia spy both the us and un have denied the charge 
amal spokesmen had said their fighters found no trace of higgins 
in any of the hezbollah strongholds they have captured including 
siddiqine 
the foreigners missing and presumed kidnapped in lebanon are 
nine americans four frenchmen three britons one irishman one 
italian one west german one indian and two unidentified men 
the longest held is terry a anderson 40 chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985

a man who had chained himself to an 
outer banks bridge and demanded that it be saved from erosion today 
gave up his threeday vigil along with his run for a state senate 
seat 
standing at the bridge catwalk which he had made his soapbox 
dan lawrence announced he was ending his protest and throwing his 
support to his democratic opponent state sen marc basnight 
i dont want even one person to feel that this was done as a 
political stunt detracting from the great need we have to save 
this bridge and save this island lawrence a republican said 
late this morning 
lawrence made the announcement after saying earlier today that 
he had asked for police protection for his vigil at the 
twomilelong herbert bonner bridge the only route from hatteras 
island to the mainland he also admitted that he had abandoned his 
post and gone home for two hours sunday night 
i was afraid that something stupid was going to happen and i 
didnt want to be involved in that lawrence said i have to 
consider my family i have to consider my own health 
lawrence told greg clark a reporter for radio station wobr 
that two men drove up to his position on the catwalk and said if 
youre here tomorrow were going to kill you 
lawrence said he went home sunday night for two hours then 
returned and spent part of the night in his car at the south side 
of the bridge before going to sleep under some trees in hatteras 
island park 
he said his wife had been harassed at the trailer park where 
they live and that his son was suffering emotionally from his 
fathers vigil 
i need some people out here at night to protect me from the 
kook element there are some kooks out here lawrence said 
adding that he had been urged by a local high school teacher to 
abandon his protest 
lawrence admitted the protest was tougher than he had envisioned 
its easy to say youre going to do something but i wasnt 
ready to face the elements he said 
lawrences protest had drawn praise from basnight who joined 
lawrence on the bridge for the announcement that the vigil was over 
i commend him for his efort to try to bring attention to an 
injustice basnight said sunday nothing else seems to work 
maybe something can happen here good 
lawrence 42 first chained himself to the bridge friday morning 
after the structure was threatened by heavy erosion from a fierce 
storm wednesday 
gov jim martin and many local officials and fishermen say 
jetties are needed to stabilize the inlets shifting sands 
the project was authorized by congress 17 years ago but the 
jetties were never built mostly due to opposition from 
environmentalists and the us department of the interior which 
say they wouldnt work and would be environmentally hazardous 
hatteras island which has about 4800 yearround residents is 
about 50 miles long and never more than a few miles wide there has 
also been controversy over how and whether to move the historic 
cape hatteras lighthouse which has also been threatened by the 
everencroaching sea 
when asked if he thought lawrences protest would spur officials 
to stabilize the oregon inlet and the bridge basnight said 
nobody can answer that except for the federal officials well 
just have to wait and see

jesse jackson campaigning one day before the big new york 
primary said today that early morning fighting with iran raised 
new questions about us policy and that weapons used against 
american troops were no doubt sold iran illegally by the 
reaganbush administration 
rival democratic candidate albert gore jr and vice president 
george bush the likely republican nominee both called the us 
action appropriate while democrat michael dukakis said it would be 
inappropriate for him to comment without more information 
jackson also said the fighting could revive questions about how 
much president reagan and bush knew about secret arms dealing in 
the irancontra affair 
the comments came on the eve of tuesdays primary election with 
255 delegates at stake polls have shown massachusetts gov dukakis 
leading in new york with jackson second and sen gore of tennessee 
a distant third 
all three men were campaigning in the state today as reports 
provided details of military action in which the us navy 
destroyed two offshore iranian oil platforms sank a defending 
iranian patrol boat and bombed an iraniants who said they were certain 
to vote tuesday and had a 
margin of error of 35 percentage points 
dukakis and gore marched sunday in a salute to israel 
parade while jackson held a meeting with community leaders that 
was set up by a prominent jewish supporter an estimated 25 percent 
of new york democrats are jewish and issues concerning israel have 
loomed large in the primary campaign 
dukakis heads into the new york contest with a fresh victory to 
his credit in arizonas weekend caucuses he bested jackson by a 
32 margin in the saturday contest picking up 22 delegates to 
jacksons 14 gore got none 
the massachusetts governor has pulled well ahead of jackson in 
the national delegate race with 87215 to jacksons 7381 gore 
has 41755 to nominate 2082 delegates are needed 
on the republican side bush has a virtual lock on his partys 
nomination but he was campaigning anyway in ohio today with a 
trip to pennsylvania scheduled tuesday he is likely to clinch the 
1139 delegates needed to nominate within the next few weeks 
jackson and dukakis are certain to continue their battle in the 
coming contests but gores weekend defeat in arizona brought new 
predictions from the other camps that hell have to pack it in soon 
meanwhile democrats in delaware were holding caucuses tonight 
in state representative districts they were choosing 189 delegates 
to the state convention on may 23 where 15 national convention 
delegates will be chosen

american industry operated at 823 percent of 
capacity in march the second consecutive monthly decline the 
government reported today 
the federal reserve board said that us factories mines and 
utilities saw their operating rate drop by 01 percentage point 
from february 
it was the second monthly decline following a 02 percent point 
dip in february to an operating rate of 824 percent down from 
826 percent in january 
analysts said the setbacks had been expected given the fact 
that certain factories in particular the auto industry cut back 
on production during the first three months of the year in order to 
reduce high backlogs of unsold goods 
the operating rate for manufacturing plants edged down to 825 
percent in march compared to 826 percent in february production 
of durable goods items expected to last three or more years rose 
slightly to 802 percent of capacity up 01 percentage point from 
february while production of nondurable goods dipped 03 
percentage point to 859 percent of capacity 
the mining industry which includes oil and gas drilling saw 
capacity climb to 803 percent last month up from 798 percent in 
february while production at electric and gas utilities edged down 
01 percent to 818 percent 
the various changes left the overall operating rate up 06 
percentage point from a year ago reflecting the fact that american 
industry has benefited from strong demand for exports over the last 
year

congressional leaders said today that 
president reagan was fully justified in retaliating against an 
iranian mine attack that seriously damaged a us frigate on patrol 
in international waters 
they said also they are pleased that the president consulted 
with them before ordering that two iranian platforms in the persian 
gulf be destroyed rather than merely informing them after the fact 
the mines have been clearly identified as manufactured by the 
iranians and sown in the waters by the iranians said senate 
majority leader robert c byrd dwva the iranians were 
carrying out terrorist acts i support the decision to destroy 
the iranian oil drilling platforms 
said senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
in my view now is the time to send only one message to our 
adversaries that the united states the president the congress 
the people are united and determined to meet our responsibilities 
and defend our interests in the gulf i hope the ayatollah 
khomeini gets that message so we can all avoid further bloodshed 
and violence dole said 
house speaker jim wright of texas said the white house 
discussions were very frank and that the congressional leaders 
pointed out the perils as well as the possible benefits of military 
action 
but wright said said of reagan he is the commander in chief 
and when action is taken by the united states it certainly 
behooves all of us to close ranks and to give the world a view of a 
nation that is united 
byrd also said that reagan had promised to report to congress in 
writing within 48 hours on his actions consistent with the war 
powers act 
and he said that for the first time we were consulted before 
the executive order was issued and before it was decided and that 
was good 
byrd dole and three other members of the congressional 
leadership were called to the white house sunday night and briefed 
on possible actions that might be taken for the mine attack that 
seriously damaged the uss samuel b roberts last week 
the others were house majority leader thomas s foley dwash 
and house minority leader robert michel rill 
foley interviewed on the cbs morning news called the 
presidents action an inevitable consequence of the decision to 
reflag kuwaiti vessels and to provide escorts i think the 
president has a responsibility obviously to insure that american 
lives and american assets are protected 
the resumption of mining by the iranian forces has created a 
very serious risk not only to american shipping but to other 
neutral shipping and nonbelligerent shipping in the area foley 
said 
he said reagan intended his move as a single action a 
response and a deterrent to further action 
foley added that because of the volatility of the middle east 
the white house really needs to walk a fine line in terms of 
keeping hostilities at a minimum

the chancellor of the university of 
massachusetts lashed back today at us education secretary william 
bennett for his criticism of the way the school handled a protest 
by minority students 
students here were treated with respect but also firmness 
chancellor joseph duffey said they left the building because 
they were treated with respect not because they got what they 
wanted they also left because they realized they were here to 
study 
minority students took over a campus building at umass for six 
days in february to protest campus racism and bennett in a sunday 
speech in new orleans said the school was too lenient 
he accused administrators of sending the demonstrators a 
basket of fruit and ordered out chinese food for them and then gave 
in to all of their demands one wonders what kind of teaching 
experience that is 
the protestors should have been arrested for trespassing he 
said 
mr bennett seems to believe the only response to protesters 
with legitimate concerns is to arrest them duffy said today 
the only excuse i can imagine for that is that hes been away 
from the campus too long 
duffey had sent the protesters a basket of fruit after receiving 
a card from them relaying their condolences because his brother was 
hospitalized duffey later negotiated a settlement with the 
students 
in his speech to the education writers association convention 
bennett also criticized the university of minnesota which recently 
decided to turn away former un ambadassor jeane kirkpatrick and 
yale university which canceled a date with former us supreme 
court nominee robert bork 
in both instances he said students had objected to the 
conservative speakers 
universities have become increasingly closed and increasingly 
insular and in some cases repressive by not allowing certain 
speakers onto the campuses bennett said he said most of the 
intolerance is for conservative ideas 
he urged administrators to take a hard line to insure that 
universities are open administrators should not just sit there 
and be ambushed bennett said 
students who heckle shout or otherwise interfere with a 
speakers address should be removed he said 
they have got to make sure a situation is such that a person 
can speak bennett said 
duffey said he agreed with bennett about keeping campuses open 
to controversial speakers

and a pepsicola sign 
thats right a stable as in horses in manhattan

said joseph bresnan executive director of the landmarks 
preservation commission

bottling plant in long island city since it was erected in 1936 
its a visible wellknown element on the new york skyline and 
we want to learn more about it said commission chairman gene a 
norman 
the stable is the claremont riding academy on manhattans upper 
west side built in 1892 it was once condemned 25 years ago when 
the city sought to tear it down as part of an urban renewal 
project but its still serving people who ride in central park 
also on tuesdays agenda is a 67yearold lighthouse that stands 
along the hudson river underneath the towering george washington

housing secretary samuel r pierce jr said 
monday that we are taking care of more people by far with much 
less money than when he took office in 1981 
pierce defended before a senate appropriations subcommittee the 
administrations 19 billion spending request for the department of 
housing and urban development for fiscal 1989 up slightly from 
current outlays of 186 billion 
the only member of reagans original cabinet who remains in 
office pierce has presided over a dramatic decline in huds 
spending authority the ceiling for separately approved 
appropriations from 334 billion in 1981 to a proposed 136 
billion next year 
the secretary said he did more with less by getting rid of 
big costly hud programs of questionable effectiveness and 
streamlining others inherited from previous democratic 
administrations 
he said hud is assisting 43 million needy families this year 
compared with 33 million in 1981 actual outlays over the same 
period have slowly increased from 14 billion to a projected 186 
billion this year 
pierce said he had always based his budgetary decisions on three 
guiding principles 
first individual rights and responsibilities belong to the 
poor as much as anyone else 
second the poor need not always remain poor nor should we 
assume they will 
third the poor often are capable of making their own 
decisions and improving their condition in life 
sen william proxmire dwis the subcommittee chairman 
questioned the projected costs of a new hud program of rental 
subsidies for poor families that are intended to give recipients 
greater freedom to choose where they will live 
proxmire said the new system of direct cash vouchers cost more 
than 200 million annually above the present certificate system 
serving the same number of people 
proxmire asked pierce whether the voucher system was a bad 
deal for american taxpayers in view of the need to reduce federal 
budget deficits pierce said the longterm differences in costs 
should be negligible once the shift to the new system is completed 
under the current certificate system the government pays the 
difference between fair market rentals and 30 percent of a poor 
familys income available for housing the voucher system allows a 
poor family to pay more or less than the subsidized rent if they 
wish 
sen pete domenici rnm asked pierce and his aides for a 
report on why there were so few applicants for a new 30 million 
program to provide temporary housing for the homeless who are 
mentally ill pierce said the department will begin an analysis 
immediately after the next may 17 deadline for applications

iran said today us helicopters attacked 
iranian troops to support an iraqi offensive that reportedly 
recaptured the southern faw peninsula us officials denied the 
charge 
the iranian claim was made hours after american warships 
destroyed two iranian platforms in the persian gulf in retaliation 
for a mine blast that rocked a us frigate last week 
fred hoffman a pentagon spokesman dismissed the charge as 
totally without foundation no us military forces have been 
involved with iraqi units he said 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted a supreme defense 
council statement as saying in direct open and practical 
support for the iraqi regime american forces have entered the 
war 
the statement was issued after iraq reported its troops led by 
units of the elite presidential guard recaptured faw iran which 
seized the peninsula two years ago denied iraqi had retaken it 
iraq said its forces today retook the town of faw near the tip 
of the peninsula it is the only town on the peninsula 
victorious iraqi armed forces entered faw town today and 
hoisted the iraqi flag the iraqi news agency reported in an 
urgent dispatch 
a war communique read over staterun television in baghdad said 
iranian forces were driven out of the peninsula to the other side 
of the shattalarab waterway 
the supreme defense council which determines irans war 
strategy called on all iranians to join the military and brace for 
a holy defense of their country 
tehran radio said us helicopters attacked iranian troops in 
southern iraq several times on sunday during the iraqi 
offensive 
there was no immediate reaction to the allegation from 
washington 
defense secretary frank c carlucci said today that during the 
us attack on the two oil platforms iran patrol boats fired on an 
american vessel and a helicopter but they escaped unscathed 
us warships sank the patrol boat carlucci said 
soon after the platform attack the iran gunboats fired on a 
us tugboat but it too was not hit iranian gunboats also 
attacked three facilities in the mubarak oilfield off sharjah an 
emirate in the southern gulf 
iran also accused kuwait the closest arab state to the war 
zone of aiding the latest iraqi attack and warned of retaliation 
kuwait denied the charge 
iranian officials quoted by irna said kuwait allowed iraqi 
troops to use its bubiyan island as a launching board for the 
offensive 
in washington the white house said the us navy attacked the 
offshore sassan and sirri platforms in retaliation for a mine blast 
that damaged the american frigate samuel b roberts and wounded 
10 crewmen last thursday 
washington said iran laid the mines in the persian gulf tehran 
has denied the charge 
iraqi gunners meanwhile today fired four longrange missiles 
into tehran the holy city of qom and isfahan capital of the 
16thcentury persian empire 
the iranian agency confirmed the three cities were struck by 
missiles claiming civilian casualties but it did not give any 
figure 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia said the 
7th army corps and the presidential guard destroyed all enemy 
forces in the faw triangle which the iranians overran in an 
offensive in february 1986 
it said small groups of iranian soldiers were entrenched in 
a few positions facing death imminent defeat or captivity 
the iraqi offensive codenamed blessed ramadan began 
sunday on the eve of the beginning of islams holy month of 
fasting 
it was the first time that iraq has taken the initiative in the 
ground war since mid1986 when it overran the abandoned iranian 
town of mehran 
the faw peninsula is 50 miles southeast of iraqs major port 
city of basra the iranians had held 120 square miles of the 
peninsula for two years tehran reportedly has used faw to launch 
antiship chinesemade silkworm missiles at kuwaiti ships and oil 
facilities

an israeli court today convicted john demjanjuk 
of nazi war crimes ruling the former ohio autoworker was the 
sadistic ivan the terrible who sent hundreds of thousands of 
jews to their deaths in world war ii 
we determine decisively and without hesitation or doubt that 
the accused john demjanjuk who is on trial before us is ivan 
known as ivan the terrible the operator of gas chambers said 
presiding judge dov levine 
the court convicted the 68yearold demjanjuk of all four counts 
against him war crimes crimes against the jewish people crimes 
against humanity and crimes against persecuted people 
demjanjuk was absent from the court as the guilty verdict was 
read he listened from an adjoining cell where he lay on a cot 
suffering from what his family said was a back injury 
he will be sentenced april 25 and could face the death penalty 
observers have said it was more likely he would receive a life 
prison term defense attorneys have said they would appeal 
demjanjuk was the second person to be convicted of war crimes in 
israel adolf eichmann architect of adolf hitlers final 
solution for the extermination of european jewry was convicted 
and hanged in 1962 the only person to have been executed in 
israels 40year history 
in their lengthy summation the judges rejected key defense 
arguments and said demjanjuks testimony was filled with 
inconsistent versions 
earlier israel radio reported demjanjuk stayed away from 
todays court session because his attorney yoram sheftel told him 
he thought he would be convicted 
sheftel confirmed to the associated press that he told demjanjuk 
three days ago there is no doubt in my mind he is going to be 
convicted even though he deserves an acquittal 
of demjanjuks inability to sit in the courtroom sheftel said 
i would not exclude the possibility that it was related to 
nerves 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk was charged with war crimes crimes 
against the jewish people and crimes against humanity for allegedly 
operating gas chambers that killed 850000 jews at the treblinka 
death camp in nazioccupied poland in 1942 and 1943 
levine indicated during his summation that the judges gave great 
weight to the testimony of five survivors who identified demjanjuk 
as ivan the terrible 
the question of identity has been key during the 14month trial 
demjanjuk denies he is ivan and defense attorneys questioned 
the memory of survivors 
levine said survivors testimony had persuaded the court these 
experiences are deeply ingrained on their memories the horrors are 
a deep part of them the sights are before their eyes and the 
stories are true and accurate 
polishborn judge zvi tal also rejected a defense contention 
that ivan was killed during a prisoner revolt in august 1943 
inconsistences in demjanjuks testimony tal added lead us 
not to believe the version of the accused that he spent 18 
months at a prisonerofwar camp is totally unsupportable and 
implausible 
demjanjuks wife vera 62 was seen crying and wringing her 
hands during the lunch break i cant even sit down she said 
demjanjuk who lived in a cleveland suburb before being 
extradited to israel in february 1986 claims he is a victim of 
mistaken identity he says he was a nazi prisonerofwar during the 
period in question 
the prosecutions case against demjanjuk has rested largely on 
the memories of the five treblinka survivors 
a pivotal piece of prosecution evidence was demjanjuks alleged 
nazi identity card provided to israel by the soviet union 
the document issued at trawniki a training camp for death camp 
guards in naziheld poland does not mention treblinka but states 
that demjanjuk was posted at the nearby sobibor death camp 
six prosecution experts authenticated the cards paper ink 
photograph and signatures and an equal number of defense witnesses 
said the document was forged demjanjuk claims the trawniki card 
was fabricated by the soviets to punish him for fighting in an 
anticommunist unit organized by the nazis at the end of world war 
ii 
demjanjuks attorneys presented 12 statements from treblinka 
inmates who failed to identify demjanjuks picture as that of 
ivan 
besides mrs demjanjuk the defendants son john jr 22 
soninlaw ed nishnic daughter lydia maday 37 and her husband 
andrij went to israel to hear the verdict another daughter irene 
nishnic 27 and demjanjuks 2yearold grandson eddie remained 
in cleveland

here is a text of the remarks president reagan 
made monday in defending a new wave of american military attacks on 
iranian targets in the persian gulf 
earlier today our navy made a measured response to irans 
latest use of military force against us ships in international 
waters as well as its continued military and terrorist attacks 
against a number of nonbelligerents 
following the destruction of the two iranian military platforms 
whose personnel evacuated after our warning several iran naval 
vessels and small boats attempted to engage our ships and aircraft 
three iranian naval vessels and at least two small boats were sunk 
or very severely damaged 
weve taken this action to make certain the iranians have no 
illusions about the cost of irresponsible behavior we aim to deter 
further iranian aggression not provoke it they must know that we 
will protect our ships and if they threaten us theyll pay a 
price 
a more normal relationship with iran is desirable and were 
prepared for it he said but such a relationship is not 
possible so long as iran attacks neutral ships threatens its 
neighbors supports terrorism and refuses to end the bloody war 
with iraq

the soviet unions acceptance of the 
administration view that the superpower arms treaty outlaws 
futuristic weapons that could be carried by intermediaterange 
missiles resolves the issue the state department said today 
it does very clearly resolve this one particular issue said 
charles e redman the state department spokesman the soviet 
understanding is the same as ours which is that the inf treaty 
bans all us and soviet groundlaunched cruise and ballistic 
missiles in the inf range regardless of the type of weapon it might 
be carrying 
redman said the joint conclusion would have no impact on the 
us strategic defense initiative a program known popularly as 
star wars that seeks to develop a spacebased shield against 
soviet ballistic missiles with futuristic technology 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze accepted the us 
position in a letter delivered friday night by soviet ambassador 
yuri dubinin to assistant secretary of state rozanne l ridgway 
another us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
sunday 
the concession seems to remove concerns that had been raised by 
the senate armed services committee about weaponry using exotic 
technologies such as lasers plasma or ion beams 
although the panel has endorsed the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty senate majority leader robert byrd dwva last 
thursday described the futuristic weapons issue as a possible 
hole in the treaty that had to be filled before he would bring 
the pact to a vote of the full senate 
secretary of state george p shultz had raised the issue with 
shevardnadze on thursday while they were in geneva for the signing 
of an agreement with pakistan and afghanistan for the withdrawal of 
soviet forces from afghanistan and a return of millions of afghan 
refugees to the country after more than eight years of civil war 
shultz is scheduled to leave tuesday for moscow for talks with 
shevardnadze on a more elaborate treaty to sharply reduce us and 
soviet strategic nuclear weapons and to make preparations for 
president reagans visit to moscow for a summit meeting with soviet 
general secretary mikhail s gorbachev on may 29june 2 
shevardnadzes letter appears to represent an effort by moscow 
to dispel congressional suspicions about soviet intentions to 
cooperate with the united states in reducing nuclear weapons 
the reagan administration has pushed for a senate ratification 
vote on the inf treaty before the summit but the armed services 
panel was planning to issue another report on the futuristic 
weapons issue and byrd said no floor action was likely before that 
reported was completed 
im not driven by a calendar deadline he said i want 
first last and always to have a good treaty 
former defense secretary caspar weinberger and former arms 
control and disarmament agency director kenneth adelman had said in 
letters released thursday that they didnt believe the inf treaty 
banned futuristic weapons 
however other administration officials including chief treaty 
negotiator maynard glitman have said the soviet union understood 
that the pact bars the possession or flight testing of all 
mediumrange weapons no matter how they are armed or operate 
ratification requires a vote of 67 of the 100 senators and both 
parties say the treaty likely will be supported by 88 to 90 
senators

president reagan said today that the american 
shelling of two iranian oil platforms should serve as a warning to 
iran that we will protect our ships and if they threaten us 
theyll pay a price 
we undertook this action to make sure the iranians have no 
illusions about the cost of irresponsible behavior the president 
said 
we aim to deter further iranian aggression not provoke it 
reagan said they must know that we will protect our ships and 
if they threaten us theyll pay a price 
reagans order sending the fleet into action came after last 
weeks incident in which the samuel b roberts a guided missile 
frigate was severely damaged and almost sunk by a mine that 
us officials said had been freshly laid by iranians ten american 
sailors were injured 
his comments came at the start of a previously scheduled speech 
in the old executive office building next to the white house to 
members of the associated general contractors 
the president said the united states does desire a more normal 
relationship with iran but such a relationship is not possible 
so long as iran attacks neutral ships threatens its neighbors 
supports terrorism and refuses to end the bloody war with iraq 
at the state department spokesman charles redman said that the 
united states sent a message to iran today warning that any 
further provocation or hostile iranian military or terrorist 
action against us personnel or targets will receive a firm us 
response 
the message said the mine explosion that damaged the roberts had 
followed repeated warnings by the united states to iran about the 
consequences of placing mines in international waters of the 
persian gulf 
redman said that before todays retaliatory action the united 
states had notified britain france italy the netherlands and 
belgium of its intentions all have naval vessels in the gulf 
others including the soviet union were notified at the time 
the action commenced redman said

attacks said they agreed with reagan 
hitting back two iranian navy frigates fired missiles at us 
aircraft and an iranian guided missile patrol boat fired on the 
cruiser wainwright the pentagon said 
one frigate was attacked and set afire by us forces the other 
was left dead in the water the pentagon said the patrol boat was 
sunk by the us frigate simpson 
the wainwright one of the american ships that had taken part in 
the attack on the platforms was not hit said defense secretary 
frank carlucci 
the government of iran should understand that we will protect 
our ships and our interests against unprovoked attack white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said at a pair of briefings hich 
brought reporters scurrying to the white house in the predawn 
darkness 
carlucci and adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff said an american helicopter was also fired upon but not hit 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said an americanflagged 
tugboat the willi tide came under atttack from three iranian 
speedboats in new orleans victor koock of the ships owner 
tidewater inc said he understood the boat and its 12man crew 
were safe and were sailing for port 
the announcement of the raid was delayed until 330 am edt 
after news was received in washington that the attacks on the 
iranian oil facilities had started two hours earlier 
fitzwater said the president ordered the move in response to 
irans recent resumption of mine laying in international waters and 
its mine attack on the uss samuel b roberts 
that attack on thursday injured 10 american seaman and nearly 
sank the roberts the mine blew a ninefoot hole in the side of the 
guided missile frigate 
fitzwater said he had no reports of american or iranian 
casualties resulting from the shelling of the oil platforms 
the oil platforms at sirri and sassan in the southern gulf was 
also used as command and control radar stations for the iranian 
military fitzwater said 
the spokesman said us marines had boarded the sassan and 
have set charges for its ultimate destruction 
the incident was the second of its nature since the united 
states began escorting oil tankers through the gulf on july 21 
1987 to protect them from attack from the warring parties in the 
7year iraniraq war 
on oct 19 a raid was staged in retaliation to a missile attack 
on a kuwaiti ship flying the us flag in which 18 americans were 
injured two iranian oil platforms were destroyed in what reagan 
termed a prudent response 
fitzwater said the white house had conclusive evidence iran 
had laid the mine that hit the frigate and had laid other mines in 
the area 
the government of iran has repeatedly been warned about the 
consequences of such hostile acts he said our actions are 
designed and intended to deter further iranian mining 
fitzwater reported that the president decided on the attack 
sunday night during meetings in the private residence of the white 
house 
he said reagan met with vice president george bush defense 
secretary frank carlucci secretary of state george p shultz 
national security adviser colin powell chief of staff howard baker 
and others at 830 pm est then briefed congressional leaders and 
met with his advisers for fine tuning of the decision 
house majority leader tom foley dwash one of five 
congressional leaders who attended the briefing said he believes 
reagan regards the us retaliation as an action that is designed 
to be a single action to be a response and a deterrent to further 
action 
foley called the response an inevitable consequence of the 
decision to reflag kuwaiti vessels and to provide escorts the 
resumption of mining by the iranian forces has created a very 
serious risk not only to american shipping but to other 
neutral shipping 
the iranians were carrying out terrorist acts i support

about 20000 antigovernment students 
shouted protests and scattered antius leaflets on monday the 
anniversary of a 1960 popular uprising 
national police meanwhile were put on top alert after 
president roh taewoo called for severe punishment of political 
activists who resort to violence roh worried by clashes between 
partisans of rival political parties said his government would not 
tolerate violent and seditious acts in campaigning for national 
assembly elections on april 26 
the government had mobilized about 35000 riot police over the 
weekend to protect campaign rallies nationwide 
opposition leader kim youngsam accused the governing democratic 
justice party of using gangsters to impede opposition rallies 
he said government officials were turning to the autocratic tactics 
of former president chun doohwan 
in the southern city of suwon on monday students hurled tear 
gas grenades and firebombs at a governing party office but there 
were no reports of injury 
the students in seoul chanted down with dictatorship as 
they joined in a 10mile run from korea university to a 
commemorative cemetery and back turning the annual event into a 
huge antigovernment demonstration 
the annual run commemorates the april 1960 popular uprising that 
protested election procedures and helped topple autocratic 
president syngman rhee 
riot police remained on alert along the course but did not 
intervene 
the students leaflets criticized both the government and the 
united states antius sentiment has grown this year as 
washington pressured south korea to open its markets 
after mondays run about 5000 students regrouped at korea 
university for a rally supporting labor rights 
they called for joint struggle with striking workers charging 
the government with suppressing labor unions and their demands for 
a better life

the roman catholic churchs taxexempt status 
gives it an unfair advantage in the political battle over abortion 
rights the supreme court was told monday 
the court was urged by a prochoice coalition to keep alive 
an 8yearold lawsuit that seeks to strip the church of its tax 
exemption because of its antiabortion lobbying 
the suit is against the federal government not the church 
the justices are being asked to decide whether the suit can go 
forward not whether the churchs tax exemption should be revoked 
a decision is expected to be announced by july 
if the suit against the government is kept alive the church 
faces 100000 a day in fines for its refusal to surrender 
documents sought by those suing 
marshall beil a lawyer for prochoice groups and individuals 
said being free from paying taxes is a form of government subsidy 
that is skewing the political process in the national debate 
over abortion 
only the courts can create a remedy he said the 
political process cant 
church officials and the reagan administration urged the court 
to kill the lawsuit 
permitting such legal claims could expose the government to 
untold suits by people interested but not affected by the outcome 
of federal regulation said justice department lawyer alan i 
horowitz 
several justices hinted that the case could be sent back to a 
federal appeals court for clarification of that courts views on 
the prochoice coalitions legal standing to sue the government 
justice byron r white in raising that possibility said it 
would save us a lot of work 
chief justice william h rehnquist suggested that the case is in 
sort of a twilight zone because the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals did not state clearly whether it believed the prochoice 
coalition has the proper legal standing to sue 
the appeals court said last june that there is at least a 
colorable basis for standing 
the prochoice coalition said in its suit against the government 
that the tax breaks for the church violate a provision of the 
federal tax code barring any taxexempt organization from spending 
money on political activities 
the 2nd circuit court upheld a ruling by a federal judge in new 
york city in 1986 who found the church in civil contempt for 
refusing to supply records to those suing the government 
the judge ordered the church to pay 100000 a day until it 
supplied the documents but the contempt ruling has been put on hold 
pending word from the supreme court 
before reaching the issue of legal standing the justices must 
decide whether the church officials had the right to appeal the 
contempt citation 
the question is whether a witness such as the church rather 
than one of the opposing sides in a lawsuit has such a right of 
appeal prior to the outcome of the case 
justice antonin scalia said that denying such a right of appeal 
could lead to imprisonment in some cases for long periods not 
just a stiff fine for a reluctant witness 
you have to spend however many years in jail until the case is 
complete he asked beil 
the lawyer for the prochoice coalition noted that the catholic 
church case involved a fine not a jail term he added that the 
church has an alternate remedy providing the documents his clients 
seek 
kevin t baine representing church officials urged the 
justices to deny legal standing to the prochoice forces 
permitting their suit would open the way to a host of legal 
challenges against tax exemptions for any religious group that 
takes a stand on such issues as civil rights or the death penalty 
he said 
you can substitute any church any controversial issue 
said baine who is representing the us catholic conference and 
the national conference of catholic bishops

as bidders for lucrative city contracts go 
leclaire service corp isnt rich doesnt wield much clout and 
has no friends in high places 
but leclaire owned and operated by publichousing tenants 
wants a chance 
a chance to become a productive positive part of society to 
share a piece of the american dream said irene johnson the 
driving force behind leclaire service which draws its name 
management and workers from leclaire courts a 615unit housing 
project on the south side 
leclaire has a 15 percent stake in a joint venture bidding for 
food and beverage concessions at midway airport heading the 
venture is flying food fare inc a company that specializes in 
catering to the airline industry and is owned by chicago 
realestate entrepreneur sue ling gin 
the contract which would be for five years and likely will be 
awarded within the next few weeks calls for the operation of 22 
concession stands at midway and could generate revenues of 42 
million 
leclaire service which employs five fulltime and two parttime 
workers would own and operate three stands and as the major 
subcontracting partner be responsible for recruiting half the 
employees for all the stands 
obviously the jobs would be a benefit but more important 
the money would roll over in the neighborhood said ms gin 
whose flying food would own 70 percent of the venture with the 
remaining 15 percent divided among two hispanic businesses and a 
chineseamerican business group 
the contract could mean 750000 annually for the fledgling 
company and between 40 and 80 new jobs for leclaire residents who 
number about 3500 
ms johnson considers leclaire service a success already it 
provides more than 700 meals daily to seven daycare centers and 
has gross sales of about 140000 
all this began with the idea of making something different out 
of public housing she said and were succeeding every day 
leclaire residents taking a lesson and some counseling from 
publichousing activists in st louis boston and washington took 
steps six years ago to become chicagos first tenantmanaged 
project 
once we got that in motion got tenants interested and 
involved in their homes we decided the next step was economic 
development said ms johnson finding jobs and keeping them 
here 
there is no income ceiling for residents of leclaire courts 
where rent is based on 30 percent of income 
with help and some training funds from the nearby clarence 
darrow community center leclaire residents moved into the food 
business five years ago 
ms gin learned about leclaire services when the community 
centers executive director asked her to come in and share her 
business acumen with members of the group

watch was left in france when he returned from the war or why he 
had her married name and hometown inscribed on the back 
mrs bevan and her husband barry had been able to search for 
the ring when lake milton receded in 1969 and more recently when 
the lake was drained for dam repairs 
we were on our hands and knees we had a little rake for the 
mud nothing mrs bevan 47 said last week 
mrs bevan didnt know exactly where she lost the ring in 1969 
because she didnt notice it missing until she got out of the water 
bevan decided to give the search one more try april 9 after the 
state announced plans to refill the lake aided by a friend who had 
a new metal detector bevan cleared an area about 5 feet from shore 
he bevan went right to the spot not that anything told him 
to but he went right there she said 
the metal detector soon alerted them to something 
he bevan just started digging mrs bevan said he dug 
and could see a diamond shining not bright but the sun kind of 
caught it 
mrs bevan was not present when the ring was found later that 
day when she returned home she said her husband had his hands in 
his pockets and looked shaken 
she asked him if he was all right and he said do you believe 
in miracles then he slipped the ring on 
he got tears in his eyes and so did i she said 
in wisconsin ms bouzek received the wristwatch by mail last 
week from a french woman who had written to her in november 
it runs like velvet said ms bouzek 72 its a gruen

invasion of normandy in june 1944 and spent some time in a 
hospital in france before returning to prairie du chien he later 
moved to milwaukee 
but he died nearly three years ago at age 66 long before ms 
bouzek knew of the watch and its mystery

president reagans decision to order military 
strikes against two iranian offshore platforms came without any 
buildup in the number of us warships in the region 
ever since february when the pentagon adjusted its joint task 
force middle east by withdrawing the battleship iowa and the 
helicopter carrier okinawa the navys presence in the region has 
remained fairly constant at between 25 and 30 ships 
of that total roughly half including six mine sweepers 
normally operate inside the persian gulf ready to escort 
commercial tankers the other half led by the aircraft carrier 
enterprise operate in the nearby gulf of oman and northern 
arabian sea 
according to pentagon officials who asked not to be named 
mondays operation saw commanders move several ships from the gulf 
of oman into the persian gulf including the destroyers joseph 
strauss obrien merrill and lynde mccormick and the frigate 
bagley 
that was considered more than enough firepower to deal with the 
offshore platforms and any iranian ships that sought to intervene 
the sources said 
fighters and attack jets from the enterprise also provided 
constant air cover over the lower half of the gulf the sources 
said 
all told the navy battle group inside the gulf at the time of 
mondays attack included the command ship coronado a combat stores 
ship the six mine sweepers plus one cruiser one amphibious 
landing ship four destroyers and seven frigates 
the enterprise and a second cruiser remained outside the gulf in 
the northern arabian sea along with a handful of support ships the 
officials added 
as for the iranians according to jim mccoy of the institute for 
strategic studies iran has four 1500ton quite small 
frigates built in britain for the shah of iran in 197172 they 
are their most modern surface ships and iran has been maintaining 
patrols with these frigates in the strait of hormuz assisted by a 
number of amphibious ships 
paul beaver naval editor of janes defence weekly adds that 
the four are vosper mark5 frigates and have been very active 
recently he says iran also has a number of larger patrol craft 
which are capeclass us coast guardlike vessels 
mccoy said iran has three destroyers believed nonoperational 
one from britain two from the united states 
he said iran also has at least 50 of what are basically 
recreational speed boats 40footers with large engines in which 
revolutionary guards carry out attacks on tankers with 
rocketpropelled grenades 
beaver calls them swedishbuilt boghammers and said they are 
equipped with machine guns and sometimes mortars according to 
janes iran also has 
11 french attack craft missile with american harpoon missile 
systems but because as of 1986 iran had only nine missiles left 
the boats have been used as gunboats 
two out of four corvette 900ton warships left in operation 
six hovercraft two midget subs whose origin is unknown and which 
have not been in operation yet and two landing ships 
in the air beaver lists eight f14 tomcat fighters 20 f4 
phantom fighter bombers and as many as 40 f5 tigers all us 
built 
also they have one maritime patrol aircraft a number of small 
spotting craft and a number of agusta 212 helicopters used by 
revolutionary guards 
don kerr of the institute adds that iran has one p3 orion 
aircraft but its thought that it has almost nothing electronic 
working so is used for visual reconnaisance plus out of a 
collection of 26 c130s maybe now as low as 15 work for transport 
purposes

the socialist mayor of vermonts largest 
city has exasperated democrats for years siphoning off votes that 
might otherwise go to democratic candidates 
burlington mayor bernard sanders has finally found a democrat he 
likes presidential candidate jesse jackson but even that irks 
some local party leaders 
sanders has been bashing democrats for years and it seems 
totally incongruous for him now to come and speak as a democrat 
said city alderwoman nancy chioffi who supports massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis for president 
there are lots of democrats mainstream burlington democrats 
who have worked for jesse jackson argued craig fuller executive 
director of the vermont democratic party he said one of them is 
just as well qualified to speak for jackson at tuesdays caucus 
jackson won the meaningless beauty contest primary in 
vermont on march 1 but the states 14 pledged delegates will be 
chosen through the caucus process 
sanders intends to make the nominating speech for jackson at his 
local caucus one of more than 200 that will be held around the 
state 
for sanders to attend and participate in a democratic party 
function is something new both for the mayor and the party it is 
not just that sanders has been critical of the democrats he 
describes the democratic and republican parties as tweedledee and 
tweedledum but that he has worked to defeat democrats 
sanders was an independent candidate for governor in 1986 
receiving 15 percent of the vote in his unsuccessful bid to oust 
the gov madeleine kunin a strong dukakis support who will attend 
the same caucus as sanders 
this year finds sanders running as an independent for the us 
house some democrats fear his candidacy might help elect a 
republican because sanders and the democratic nominee could split 
the progressive vote 
for his part sanders vows to mind his manners at the democratic 
caucus it is my intention absolutely not to insult anybody not 
to pick any fights my views about the democratic and 
republican parties remain unchanged but tuesday night is not the 
time there will be no negative words coming out of my mouth about 
anybody or any party 
jackson supporters say they feel sanders presence at the caucus 
will symbolize jacksons success at attracting new voters 
my focus is on jesse said caryl stewart a former city 
party chairwoman and unsuccessful candidate to remove sanders from 
the mayors office whats really important is that we put aside 
all the local differences that weve had 
dukakis has long been favored to win the caucuses but jackson 
supporters have been working long and hard to make the caucus 
results reflect the primary victory

the us navy today destroyed two 
offshore iranian oil platforms sank a defending iranian patrol 
boat and bombed two iranian navy frigates iran attacked oil 
facilities off sharjah and fired on at least two us vessels 
the american attack on the persian gulf oil platforms came in 
retaliation for a mine explosion that tore a hole in an american 
frigate last week injuring 10 crewmen 
we aim to deter further iranian aggression not provoke it 
president reagan said they must know that we will protect our 
ships and if they threaten us theyll pay a price 
also today iran said the united states had entered the 
iraniraq war charging that us helicopters supported an iraqi 
land offensive in the faw peninsula the pentagon dismissed the 
charge saying no us military forces have been involved with 
iraqi units 
the white house said three us warships ships blasted each 
iranian platform no american casualties were reported in the us 
attacks and the iranians fled prior to the shelling the white 
house said 
iran said a number of oil workers aboard the two platforms were 
killed or injured it gave no details 
defense secretary frank c carlucci said an american helicopter 
also was fired upon during the raid but was not hit 
one us warship fired missiles at two approaching iranian jet 
fighters but the fighters reversed course and it was unclear 
whether they were hit carlucci said 
he said an iranian patrol boat fired on the us cruiser 
wainwright which took part in the attack on one of the platforms 
the wainwright was not hit he said the us frigate simpson 
returned fire and sank the patrol boat 
about seven hours after the oil platform attack the 310foot 
iranian frigate sahand was noticed closing rapidly upon three 
us warships said dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman 
the iranian warship then fired upon three us aircraft on 
patrol in the strait of hormuz the entrance to the gulf 
the aircraft a6 intruders returned fire with two harpoon 
missiles and a number of laserguided bombs shortly thereafter 
the uss strauss a destroyer engaged the sahand with an additional 
harpoon howard said 
he said the sahand was on fire and the smoke is so heavy that 
its difficult to do a further assessment at this point 
at 940 am edt about 70 minutes after the sahand attack navy 
jets attacked a second iranian frigate the sabalan after it fired 
on us planes from the aircraft carrier enterprise 
us a6 intruders returned fire and hit the sabalan with a 
single laserguided bomb the pentagon said 
as darkness fell the sabalan was down by the stern with tugs 
fore and aft we do not intend to renew attacks on the sabalan 
unless she exhibits further hostile intent the pentagon said 
no american injuries or casualties were reported in either 
frigate attack 
irans official islamic republic news agency said the us 
warships first struck the sassan platform in the southern gulf at 9 
am 130 am edt twentythree minutes later they attacked the 
nasr platform at nearby sirri island irna said 
an iranian warship later shelled the mubarak oilfield off 
sharjah an emirate in the southern gulf shipping executives said 
targeted in the attack were the scanbay drilling rig the 
112744ton british tanker york marine and a storage facility 
the executives speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
york marine was set afire and that its crew had abandoned the 
vessel the scanbay reported it was under attack by four gunboats 
they said 
the iranians also fired on the press helicopter of the nbc 
television network but did not harm the aircraft or its 
passengers executives said 
the londonbased lloyds shipping intelligence unit reported a 
us tugboat and supply vessel the willi tide also was fired on 
off sharjah but was not hit 
they said unidentified warplanes swooped low over the attacking 
iranian boats chasing them away from the 283ton vessel operated 
by tidewater inc of new orleans 
shipping executives later reported iranian gunboats attacked and 
set fire to a cypriot bulk carrier in the strait of hormuz 
iran and iraq have been at war since 1980 and the war has 
produced repeated attacks on neutral shipping last july the 
united states reflagged 11 kuwaiti tankers and gave them us navy 
escorts to protect them against iranian attack 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus said us helicopters 
attacked iranian troops in southern iraq several times on 
sunday 
the iranian report was issued after iraq said its troops led by 
the presidential guard recaptured faw iran which seized the 
peninsula two years ago denied iraqi had retaken it 
the white house said today the oil platform attacks were a 
measured response to irans unlawful use of force 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the united states raided the 
platforms because iran was responsible for the mine attack on 
the uss samuel b roberts 
the platforms were manned by iranian revolutionary guards 
fitzwater said they were given several minutes warning and some 
were seen leaving 
the white house spokesman said the frigates simpson and bagley 
and the cruiser wainwright attacked the sirri platform 
fitzwater said the destroyers merril and mccormick and the 
landing platform ship trenton attacked the sassan platform 
the shipping executives said their monitors picked up a radio 
message about 30 minutes before the attack in which a us warship 
urged platform workers to evacuate 
the executives said the warning specified the facilities will 
be shelled in five minutes 
the iranians radioed back we have no instructions to leave 
the place 
eight minutes later the american warship which the executives 
could not identify said we will blast the platform in half a 
second 
in october 1987 us warships destroyed rostam the sister 
platform to sassan after iran fired a chinese silkworm missile 
into a usflagged kuwaiti oil tanker injuring 18 crewmen

iraq said its forces monday retook the town 
of faw near the tip of a strategic iraqi peninsula that had been 
captured by iran more than two years ago 
iran claimed us helicopters attacked iranian troops and kuwait 
provided a staging area to support the iraqi offensive the united 
states and kuwait denied the charge 
thousands of iranians were killed or wounded in the twodayold 
offensive named blessed ramadan after the moslem fasting 
month the iraqi news agency reported 
it was the first time iraq took the initiative in a major ground 
push since the early years of the 7yearold war 
victorious iraqi armed forces entered faw town today and 
hoisted the iraqi flag the staterun agency reported in an 
urgent dispatch 
a war communique read over staterun television said iranian 
occupying forces were driven out of the peninsula over to the 
other side of the shattalarab waterway that forms its northern 
shore 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted a supreme defense 
council statement as saying in direct open and practical 
support for the iraqi regime american forces have entered the 
war 
pentagon spokesman fred hoffman said in washington that irans 
charge was totally without foundation no us military forces have 
been involved with iraqi units he said 
earlier in the day the official islamic republic news agency 
reiterated claims that iranian revolutionary guards had routed 
the offensive when it was launched saturday night 
the agency repeated accusations that iraq used chemical weapons 
against iranian defenders in the faw region 
in the war of the cities iraqi missile batteries fired 
longrange rockets into tehran the holy city of qom and isfahan 
the iranian agency confirmed the three cities were struck by 
missiles and civilians were killed it gave no figures 
iraq said an iranian missile landed in baghdad killing 
civilians 
the iraqi agency said troops of the seventh army corps backed 
by elite presidential guards took the faw triangle the bulk 
of the peninsula that juts out into the persian gulf and straddles 
iraqs only sea outlet it later reported the seizure of the town 
of faw the only town on the peninsula 
in the twopronged offensive iraqi forces stormed iranian 
positions from the west across the salt marshes that form most of 
the peninsula and also attacked its northern shore 
the invaders are now licking their wounds on the other bank of 
the shattalarab distancing themselves from the confrontation 
line with the iraqis said a communique quoted by ina 
god is great blessed be the iraqi victory blessed be the 
arabs victory and blessed be the victory of our armed forces 
the iraqi accounts said the bulk of the iranian forces in the 
peninsula were destroyed but they did not claim the entire 
peninsula was retaken they said iraqi forces continued their 
advance 
irna in reports monitored in cyprus claimed that in an open 
confession of their dirty gangingup us and iraqi forces using 
kuwaiti facilities attacked iranian positions in the faw region 
southern iraq on monday 
it claimed us helicopter gunships suddenly appeared on the 
battle scene from the sea side and attacked iranian combatants 
the agency claimed iranian revolutionary guards immediately 
opened fire on the us helicopters forcing them to hastily drop 
their rockets and flee the scene 
the accusation came after us forces destroyed two iranian oil 
platforms in the gulf in retaliation for allegedly planting the 
mine that almost sank a us frigate last week 
in a series of clashes later in the day us forces sank an 
iranian patrol boat and bombed two iranian frigates setting them 
ablaze after they shot at us planes and ships the pentagon said 
since they were driven out of iranian territory in 1982 iraqi 
forces have waged a largely defensive war 
the faw peninsula about 50 miles southeast of iraqs major port 
city of basra was lost to the iranian attackers in a major 
offensive in february 1986 
iranian troops carried out a nighttime amphibious landing in 
faw erecting a pontoon bridge 
they eventually retained about 120 square miles of the 
peninsula using their new positions to shell iraqs main air base 
near basra 
they also reportedly used faw to launch antiship chinesemade 
silkworm missiles at kuwaiti ships and oil facilities

week and engineers predict it could be an answer to beach erosion 
the 200000 cost of the project will be borne by millionaire 
willis du pont who will have four sections of the reef submerged 
off the coast of his palm beach property 
the structure designed by engineer hans rauch has been tested 
by engineers at florida atlantic university and the university of 
florida many past experiments with other reefs have failed 
engineers said 
windy conditions in riviera beach monday delayed loading of a 
barge that was to carry parts of the reef to the site off palm 
beach 
du pont an heir to the delaware chemical fortune agreed to pay 
for the experimental reef and its installation after learning 
that his beachfront property is washing into the sea 
stretching parallel to the beach the concrete structures will 
be sunk 175 feet off the coast about 3 feet under the surface of 
the water 
each structure is 25 feet long 12 feet wide and 5 feet high 
and is designed to break a wave before it reaches the shoreline 
thus reducing or stopping the drift of sand from the beach 
once in the water the reef will be tested by university of 
florida researchers who also will be checking to see if marine 
life grows on the reef

the following is a summary of prosecution and 
defense arguments in the nazi war crimes trial of john demjanjuk 
 
the prosecution 
the prosecution claimed demjanjuk is ivan the terrible a 
brutal guard who operated gas chambers that killed 850000 jews at 
the treblinka death camp in nazioccupied poland in 1942 and 1943 
prosecutors presented five treblinka survivors who identified 
demjanjuk as ivan in photo lineups that included a 1952 picture 
of the defendant and another taken from his alleged nazi identity 
card 
survivor pinchas epstein pointed to demjanjuk in court and said 
he recognized the defendants walk while survivor eliyahu 
rosenberg said he remembered demjanjuks murderous eyes 
the prosecutions most pivotal evidence was demjanjuks alleged 
nazi identity card issued at trawniki a training camp for death 
camp guards the document does not mention treblinka but states 
demjanjuk was posted at the nearby sobibor death camp 
six prosecution experts authenticated the paper ink photograph 
and signatures on the trawniki card one expert produced a video 
showing how the photograph of the young guard on the card matched 
the presentday demjanjuk almost exactly in addition two 
historians vouched for the documents historical authenticity 
in a grueling weeklong crossexamination prosecutors showed 
inconsistencies in demjanjuks version of his whereabouts during 
world war ii and accused him of hiding his true identity 
 
the defense 
demjanjuk claimed he is an innocent victim of mistaken identity 
and says he was a nazi prisonerofwar during the years of 
treblinkas operation 194243 
demjanjuk admitted lying on his us immigration application 
saying he was a polish farmer rather than a ukrainian soldier but 
he insists it was because he feared forced repatriation to the 
soviet union and not because he was hiding a nazi past 
a psychology expert raised doubts about the reliability of the 
treblinka survivors memories more than 40 years after the 
holocaust he also contended the photo lineups were biased against 
demjanjuk because his picture was the largest clearest and the 
only one of a bald man 
demjanjuks attorneys presented 12 statements from treblinka 
inmates who failed to identify demjanjuks picture as ivan 
demjanjuk claims the trawniki card was forged by the soviet 
union which provided it and three other other similar documents to 
israel he says the soviets wanted to frame demjanjuk because he 
served in an anticommunist unit organized by the germans at the 
end of world war ii 
the defense also called six experts who contended the trawniki 
card was forged one document expert said the paper could not have 
been produced in nazi germany because it was made of rags a 
material that was scarce during world war ii 
defense witnesses also said demjanjuks signature on the card 
was forged and contended the picture on the document even if it 
portrayed demjanjuk was not the original but had been glued on at 
a later date 
several defense witnesses were discredited including one who 
retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide 
after her credentials were called into question 
some defense witnesses also offered bizarre arguments including 
one who claimed the soviet secret service used thought power to 
kill its enemies and inflict disasters on the west

some amish communities in 
northwestern pennsylvania have dropped their normal opposition to 
immunizations and sent 125 children to get shots to fight an 
outbreak of measles 
our concern right now is mainly with the amish said bruce 
reimer spokesman for the state health department most do not 
accept immunizations and our fear is that it will get into other 
pockets of amish 
this is the time of year when many will travel to other areas 
to visit family and friends and a lot of weddings will be going 
on there is a potential for spreading 
reimer said the first reports of measles among amish occurred in 
lawrence and mercer counties in the northwestern part of the state 
in early december he said the outbreak is apparently pretty much 
nipped after 142 confirmed cases in four months 
reimer said monday there appears to be no outbreak of measles 
among the states largest concentration of amish in lancaster 
county in southeastern pennsylvania 
carlos flores a pediatrician said two special clinics in new 
wilmington inoculated 125 amish children and young adults on 
friday some arrived in traditional horsedrawn buggies he said 
his office has scheduled more inoculations for friday 
some of the amish people tell their daughters and sons that 
its worse if they have the shot than if they had the diesease 
its not true flores said theyre spreading that word among 
them the side effects of measles alone can be more dangerous 
flores said only about 20 percent of amish in his practice 
follow normal inoculation patterns against disease 
the measles outbreak forced three of 10 amish schools to close 
in lawrence and mercer counties two because students were ill and 
one because a teacher was ill officials said two schools remained 
closed through last week officials said 
we have nurses in the area talking to the amish bishops 
trying to locate additional cases reimer said getting 
information from the amish is difficult

john demjanjuk a retired autoworker with a 
ready smile described himself as simple man with a fourthgrade 
education who survived nearstarvation in the soviet ukraine by 
eating birds rats and the family cat 
my tragic mistake is i cant think properly i dont know how 
to answer demjanjuk told the court in a revealing moment 
the second man to be tried in israel for nazi war crimes 
demjanjuk became more human to many israelis than adolf eichmann 
the first to stand trial because he learned some hebrew and his 
family attended nearly every session 
demjanjuk was convicted monday of war crimes committed as ivan 
the terrible the brutal treblinka death camp guard who operated 
gas chambers that killed 850000 jews in nazioccupied poland in 
1942 and 1943 
during his trial demjanjuk chatted with police guards laughed 
good naturedly during sessions and shouted the hebrew greeting 
shalom to bystanders as he was led handcuffed to and from court 
he even tried to shake hands with a treblinka survivor who 
recoiled in horror and called demjanjuk a murderer 
before being yanked into the public eye by charges he was a 
brutal nazi guard the 68yearold grandfather lived a quiet life 
centered on family and friends in clevelands closeknit ukrainian 
community where demjanjuk emigrated in 1952 
when he took the stand in israel demjanjuk endeavored to win 
sympathy by describing his own hardships in the soviet ukraine and 
portraying himself as a mildmannered man who couldnt even kill 
a chicken 
me and my relatives were forced to eat birds mice rats and 
even our pet cat demjanjuk said of his childhood in the ukraine 
in 1932 and 1933 
the balding defendant tried to explain away inconsistencies in 
his version of his whereabouts during world war ii by blaming his 
lack of education and faulty memory 
what do you expect when i had only four years of schooling 
he said in helpless frustration during a grueling weeklong 
crossexamination last august 
demjanjuks three children describe their father as a patient 
goodnatured man who tried to make life more homey in his dreary 
israeli isolation cell by hanging hundreds of cards from 
wellwishers and family photographs onto the walls 
alone in his prison cell demjanjuk lifted his spirits by 
reading from a ukrainianlanguage bible and doing situps and 
pushups to relieve tension his children said in interviews 
demjanjuk and his wife vera 62 worked long factory shifts to 
attain a measure of the good life they bought a house in the 
middleclass cleveland suburb of seven hills where demjanjuk 
planted a garden 
my dad enjoyed seeing things grow he was squeamish about 
killing anything even worms in the garden said demjanjuks 
daughter irene nishnic 28 
on aug 25 1977 the first accusations against demjanjuk 
appeared in the us media 
after a sixweek trial in february 1981 when demjanjuk admitted 
lying to immigration authorites he was stripped of his us 
citizenship 
he was extradited to israel in february 1986 and his 
14monthlong trial began one year later 
describing her father mrs nishnic said my dad is a good 
man a loving man hes never beat on me hes never hurt me but 
thats not going to make any difference is it

a man identified as a member of kuwaits 
royal family spoke monday from the hijacked kuwaiti jetliner and he 
said he hoped his government yields to the gunmens demands to end 
the twoweek ordeal 
most of the brief radio message from the man the hijackers said 
was fadel khaled alsabah was impossible to understand except for 
the part about their demand that kuwait free 17 proiranian 
prisoners convicted in the 1983 attacks on the us and french 
embassies in the persian gulf sheikdom 
i hope that kuwait releases all the prisoners the man said 
speaking in arabic in a feeble halting voice kuwaiti officials 
insist they will not give in to the hijackers who have killed two 
kuwaiti passengers 
three of the approximately 35 people still aboard the kuwait 
airways boeing 747 that was hijacked april 5 are distant relatives 
of the emir of kuwait two of those relatives are women 
hostages released earlier have said alsabah is in worse 
condition than any of the other hostages aboard the jet describing 
him as the most psychologically broken down and suffering from 
a stomach ailment 
when the message was read on the planes radio about 310 pm 
1010 am edt the control tower had trouble understanding it 
it was not very clear could he try to say it once more the 
control tower said in english 
no because he doesnt want to speak but i want to confirm 
that he is one of the royal family he is fadel alsabah a 
hijacker responded in english 
radio conversations monday made no reference to refueling the 
plane or leaving algeria on saturday the gunmen said they wanted 
fuel to fly elsewhere and commit a massacre but sunday they 
said they would give algeria more time to seek a solution no 
deadline was announced 
monday was the first day of the moslem holy month of ramadan 
when the faithful fast during the day after sunset the plane 
radioed a request for 40 meals which were then hoisted up in 
packets with tied tablecloths 
during ramadan observant moslems do not eat or drink during 
daylight hours at the hijackers request a traditional prefast 
meal was delivered to the plane sunday night for all aboard 
talks lasted late into the night and two hooded hijackers even 
descended from the plane to meet with an algerian negotiator monday 
morning in a car on the airport tarmac but the pace of contacts 
seemed to slow during the hazy hot day 
radio algiers in an arabic language news broadcast monday said 
there was hope that a peaceful solution is still possible 
despite no indication that either side would make any concessions 
the oficial radio reported new movement that gives a chance 
for new elements but did not elaborate 
algerian officials have been acting as mediators between a 
highlevel delegation from kuwait and the gunmen boarding the 
plane several times a day for talks little of whose substance has 
been disclosed 
the jumbo jet was hijacked while en route from bangkok to kuwait 
with 112 people aboard and first diverted to mashhad in 
northeastern iran where 57 passengers were freed on april 8 it 
was flown to larnaca cyprus where the hijackers killed two 
passengers and released 13 others it came to algiers houari 
boumedienne airport on wednesday 
mondays plea to kuwait was the fourth by a passenger since the 
plane landed in algeria 
the hijackers only direct threat was that made saturday when 
they asked that the plane be refueled so they could settle our 
score with kuwait in another country rather than friendly 
algeria 
algerian interior minister hedi khediri in charge of the 
mediation effort said early on he had obtained a promise from the 
hijackers that they would not resort to violence on algerian soil

a hacker linked his home computer to 
about 50 us military computers to gain access to sensitive 
defense and aerospace information a prosecutor said monday 
the 24yearold university student tapped into the worldwide 
computers for nearly two years through telephone links according 
to the west german newsmagazine quick 
west german authorities dropped their case however for lack of 
evidence fbi spokesmen said they were investigating but declined 
to say if charges would be brought 
the bremen court decided it could not be proven who 
originated these calls said hansgeorg von bock a prosecuting 
attorney in bremen 
he said the hacker scoured california computers at the air force 
systems command in el segundo nasas jet propulsion laboratory in 
pasedena and the lawrence berkeley laboratory in berkeley 
bock refused to say what the hacker who lives in the northern 
city of hanover discovered quick said he was able to find out the 
names of us army officers in japan and details about us coastal 
security systems 
authorities did not say if any important secrets were robbed 
bock said he remained convinced of the hanover mans guilt we 
wanted to catch the suspect committing the acts but unfortunately 
that did not happen he said 
the prosecutor said west german investigators had been hampered 
because law only allows wiretaps to investigate more serious crimes 
like murder a telephone tap would have enabled west german 
authorities to trace the suspects calls 
computer hackers use telephone connections to gain unauthorized 
access to other computers often just for fun 
bock said the computer connections in this case were made by 
telephone via a computer at bremen university 
quick said a connection with the lawrence berkeley laboratory 
allowed the hacker to link to computers worldwide however the 
magazine did not provide further details or identify the hacker 
bock said he could provide no details about the hacker because 
the west german investigation had been dropped 
quick said the electronic breakins were detected in august 1986 
by the lawrence berkeley laboratory which does broadbased 
unclassified research 
the laboratory and its companion institution the lawrence 
livermore laboratory which researches nuclear weapons and the 
reagan administratoins spacebased missile defense system are 
operated by the university of california for the us government 
quick said authorities questioned the suspect in june and that 
the breakins stopped at about the same time

artist louise nevelson who struggled until she 
was nearly 60 to win the publics attention has died at the age of 
88 with a reputation as one of the nations greatest sculptors 
mrs nevelson who had been in poor health for several months 
died sunday at her home in manhattans little italy 
she recently completed a 35foot black steel sculpture for the 
national institutes of health in bethesda md a show of her 1950s 
work is scheduled this summer at the pompidou center in paris 
shes seen as one of the great artists of our time said 
thomas messer director of the guggenheim museum and an 
acquaintance of the late artist 
mrs nevelson was a walking work of art every gesture in 
her life and every form in her art had larger meanings he said 
a regal woman who wore mainly black the artist was perhaps best 
known for blackonblack wood boxes assembled from found 
objects 
her work was big dramatic often dark and intense some critics 
felt it was cold airless and sterile others called it graceful 
warm haunting and uplifting 
her works are included in the collections of many major museums 
and have been taken on exhibitions around the nation and the world 
mrs nevelson was born in kiev russia in 1899 her family 
immigrated when she was 4 and settled in rockland maine 
i felt like an artist she said of the talent that emerged 
in childhood i have that blessing and there was never a time 
that i questioned it or doubted it 
she was enormously honest enormously gifted and ferociously 
independent recalled maurine rothschild president of the 
william a farnsworth art museum in rockland 
in 1920 she married charles nevelson a wealthy new york ship 
owner and moved to new york city they had a son myron and 
separated in 1931 
mrs nevelson then traveled to munich to study upon the rise of 
the nazis she returned to new york to work with paint plaster 
terra cotta marble aluminum bronze and bits of wood 
she was one of the most important artists in america along 
with georgia okeeffe said peter dittmar art critic for the die 
welt newspaper in bonn west germany 
although mrs nevelson was a serious artist for half a century 
her work was largely ignored until 1958 when it was included in an 
anthology at the museum of modern art 
she was intensely independent and very courageous she set an 
astounding example of artistic integrity and recognition for women 
artists said richard oldenburg moma director i remember the 
flamboyance of her appearance her tremendous warmth and spirit 
she had a large reserve of wit she was very good company 
mrs nevelsons fame grew in 1959 when at the age of 60 she 
won acclaim for her first allwhite environment titled 
dawns wedding feast 
once she emerged as a major figure in the late 50s she could 
never again be ignored critic hilton kramer wrote in an 
introduction to nevelsons world in 1983 she turned out to 
be one of those artists who changed the way we look at things 
louise nevelson was an important artist of originality 
strength and integrity who has made a lasting contribution to the 
history of 20th century sculpture said richard marshall an 
associate curator who organized nevelson exhibitions at the whitney 
museum in new york 
age did not slow her in her 84th year mrs nevelson embarked 
on creating sets and costumes for a production of the opera orfeo 
and euridice in st louis in 1985 she was among the first 
recipients of the national medal of the arts 
she wanted to make a major contribution to the world as an 
artist the work will remain said richard koshalek director 
of the museum of contemporary art in los angeles the individual 
will be missed the most the spirit and dedication and kindness 
that louise nevelson demonstrated to other artists museum and the 
world in general 
survivors include her son and three granddaughters funeral 
services will be private a memorial service will be announced at a 
later date

retired ohio autoworker john demjanjuk was 
convicted monday of nazi war crimes by an israeli court that said 
there was no doubt he was ivan the terrible a sadistic death 
camp guard who ran gas chambers that killed 850000 jews 
the threejudge court convicted demjanjuk of the four counts 
against him war crimes crimes against the jewish people crimes 
against humanity and crimes against persecuted people 
applause broke out in the courtroom when the verdict was 
announced and a judge admonished the spectators 
demjanjuk 68 listened to the guilty verdict from a cot in a 
cell next to the courtroom six police officers had carried him 
there feet first after he said he was unable to sit down because of 
a back injury 
after the verdict demjanjuk slowly walked to a police van and 
told reporters im very good im an innocent man i will appeal 
and im sure i will win 
this is ridiculous what happened hayom today said 
demjanjuk using the hebrew word for today 
surrounded by 18 guards demjanjuk walked with his head bowed 
and his hands clasped two guards supported his arms he was not 
handcuffed 
demjanjuk was the second person to be convicted of war crimes in 
israel adolf eichmann architect of adolf hitlers final 
solution for the extermination of european jewry was hanged in 
1962 the only person to have been executed in israels 40year 
history 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk who lived in suburban cleveland 
before his extradition to israel in 1986 could face the death 
penalty when he is sentenced april 25 observers have said he would 
probably receive life in prison 
presiding judge dov levine said the court had determined 
decisively and without hesitation or doubt that demjanjuk was 
ivan the terrible the operator of gas chambers 
the accused wasnt an ordinary guard who just obeyed orders 
but fulfilled a central position in the treblinka death camp with 
his own hands he took part in the murders of masses of human 
beings levine said 
demjanjuk was accused of operating gas chambers that killed 
850000 jews at treblinka in nazioccupied poland in 1942 and 1943 
halfway through the 12hour reading of the 450page opinion 
demjanjuks relatives left the courtroom in protest and did not 
return to hear the verdict 
demjanjuks 22yearold son john jr said the judges were 
biased 
as far as im concerned this was nothing more than a soviet 
show trial whenever one of our witnesses came on they got the 
hammer he said 
this is going to go down in history as the most lopsided case 
ever conducted anywhere in the world said demjanjuks 
soninlaw ed nishnic who raised 650000 for the defense 
defense attorney john gill said the court automatically rejected 
defense arguments 
my god in heaven according to the judges we didnt do 
anything right they ruled against us on every single point gill 
said 
jewish leaders praised the verdict 
the trial was an affirmation of law and civility in response 
to the barbarity of the holocaust said harry wall director of 
the israel branch of the bnai brith antidefamation league a 
major americanjewish organization 
throughout the trial demjanjuk maintained his innocence saying 
he was a victim of mistaken identity and was not the infamous guard 
who would stand near gas chambers and strike prisoners with a metal 
bar or bayonet as they went to their deaths 
the defense had challenged as unreliable the testimony of five 
holocaust survivors who identified demjanjuk as ivan 
levine indicated the court gave great weight to the survivors 
testimony 
these experiences are deeply ingrained on their memories the 
horrors are a deep part of them the sights are before their eyes 
and the stories are true and accurate levine said 
defense attorneys also argued that ivan was killed in a 
prisoner revolt at treblinka in august 1943 the defense said 
demjanjuk spent the period in question in german prisonerofwar 
camps after being captured while serving in the soviet army 
judge zvi tal whose parents died in the holocaust described 
reports of ivans death as unproven rumors he said demjanjuks 
claim that he spent 18 months at a pow camp as totally 
unsupportable and implausible 
the defense said demjanjuks alleged nazi identity card was 
forged by soviet officials who wanted to punish him for fighting in 
an anticommunist unit formed by the nazis at the end of world war 
ii 
the document a key piece of prosecution evidence was issued at 
trawniki a training camp for death camp guards in nazioccupied 
poland the document says demjanjuk was posted at the sobibor death 
camp near treblinka 
six prosecution experts authenticated the document while an 
equal number of defense experts said it was forged 
we can conclude the personal details on the id card are those 
of the accused said judge daliah dorner 
during the trial two of the defenses 15 expert witnesses were 
discredited one retracted her testimony and another tried to 
commit suicide after her credentials were questioned by the court 
the trial opened feb 16 1987 a year after demjanjuk was 
extradited to israel demjanjuk had been stripped of his us 
citizenship for lying on his immigration application 
about 250000 spectators attended the emotioncharged trial in a 
converted movie theater the proceedings were broadcast live on

a beirut radio station reported monday 
that us marine lt col william r higgins was killed by his 
kidnappers this month after several weeks in captivity 
united nations officials said they had heard nothing to confirm 
the report by the christiancontrolled voice of lebanon 
the station which has broadcast several inaccurate reports 
about the hostages in lebanon said higgins was killed and buried 
by his captors early this month in siddiqine a village in south 
lebanon 
higgins was serving with the un interim force in south lebanon 
when he was kidnapped near the southern port of tyre on feb 17 
timur goksel the spokesman for the un group said monday 
we have no such information and therefore we cannot comment on 
the radio report 
we have checked with our sources and everybody was surprised 
when they heard about the report he added in a telephone 
interview from the un groups headquarters in naqoura on the 
lebaneseisraeli border 
at un headquarters in new york spokeswoman nadia younes told 
reporters that unifil had checked with its sources and found no 
confirmation of the broadcast 
the radio said higgins was killed hours before prosyrian 
militiamen of justice minister nabih berris amal militia captured 
siddiqine from supporters of the proiranian hezbollah apparently 
to keep amal from claiming credit for his liberation 
amal and hezbollah spokesmen in beirut did not comment on the 
report the two groups have been at odds since higgins 43 of 
danville ky was kidnapped 
siddiqine 10 miles southeast of tyre was a hezbollah 
stronghold before amal crushed its shiite moslem fundamentalist 
rivals in a fourday battle early this month 
amal supports the presence of the un peacekeeping force in 
predominantly shiite south lebanon hezbollah or the party of god 
opposes it 
amal has charged that hezbollah masterminded higgins abduction 
to undermine amals control of south lebanon 
hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for factions holding 
most of the 22 foreign hostages in lebanon it has not claimed to 
hold any foreign hostages 
higgins abduction was claimed by a group calling itself the 
organization of the oppressed on earth which charged that he was a 
cia spy both the united states and united nations have denied the 
charge 
amal spokesmen had said their fighters found no trace of higgins 
in any of the hezbollah strongholds they captured 
the foreigners missing and presumed kidnapped in lebanon are 
nine americans four frenchmen three britons one irishman one 
italian one west german one indian and two unidentified men 
the longest held is terry a anderson 40 chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16

here is the text of the statement by white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater on mondays us military action 
in the persian gulf 
acting under his authority as commanderinchief the 
president has directed us forces at 1 am edt today to strike 
iranian military targets in the southern persian gulf our forces 
attacked oil platforms at sirri and sassan in the southern gulf 
these platforms are used as command and control radar stations for 
the iranian military 
the attacks are under way at this time 
these actions were taken in response to irans recent resumption 
of minelaying in international waters and its mine attack on the 
uss samuel b roberts the government of iran has be of the cash offer 
and 
restructuring at between 11 billion to 12 billion 
spokesman d emerson phelps said the deal would allow irving 
management to retain control of the company although the board of 
directors would be expanded to include four representatives from 
banca commerciale 
the banca commerciale offer which was approved by both 
companies boards and was set to begin tuesday includes the 
purchase of 95 million irving shares or 51 percent of its common 
stock outstanding for 65 a share in addition a special 
10ashare dividend would be payable to shareholders upon 
completion of the deal irving said 
the company said stockholders could receive cash for about half 
of their shares and retain the other half and thereby 
participate in the realization of irvings attractive longterm 
potential 
our shareholders will benefit far more from the affiliation 
with bci banca commerciale italiana than the proposal advanced 
from bny bank of new york irving chairman joseph a rice said 
in a statement irving anticipates increases in its revenues as a 
result of its ongoing relationship with bci 
irvings announcement comes just days after bank of new yorks 
shareholders voted to support managements 1 billionplus rare 
hostile bid for irving the tender offer which began last month 
after regulatory approval is for 15 in cash and 1575 of its 
common shares for each of irvings roughly 181 common shares 
outstanding 
bank of new york which holds a 49 percent stake in irving 
also is running a slate of 16 nominees to irvings board of 
directors irvings annual meeting is scheduled for thursday 
although most business will be conducted at a reconvened meeting on 
saturday to give sharholders time to digest the latest offer 
irving said 
irving has repeatedly spurned bank of new yorks takeover 
proposals which began about seven months ago it had maintained it 
wanted to remain independent but disclosed recently it was seeking 
a white knight friendly merger partner as an alternative 
hostile takeovers are rare in the banking industry although a 
few have been tried over the years most have resulted in the 
target companies reaching friendly mergers with third parties a 
merger between bank of new york and irving would have created one 
of the nations 15 largest bank holding companies with combined 
assets of more than 40 billion 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady said his company was 
studying the banca commerciale offer and had no immediate comment 
michael starr a banking analyst with duff amp phelps inc in 
chicago said bank of new york could sweeten its current offer but 
then it would have to resubmit itself to the lengthy regulatory 
process that includes hearings before the federal reserve and new 
york state banking boards 
analysts said they werent surprised that irving sought help 
from a foreign bank since many large us banks lack the capital 
for big acquisitions however some experts said they found the 
terms of the deal a bit complex and said that probabaly accounted 
for the relatively lackluster activity on wall street 
in new york stock exchange trading irving shares rose slightly 
then fell 1 to 6037 bank of new york shares gained 1 to 
3165 
i thought the street would have viewed the stock as being 
worth more said james l bellessa jr a banking analyst with 
great falls montbased da davidson amp coi think part of the 
problem is the street doesnt understand it all 
bellessa though called the deal a good alternative to what 
bank of new york was proposing 
as part of its restructuring irving said it would begin an 
intensive program of cost savings that could raise net income to 
about 160 a share in 1988 and 275 next year in addition the 
banking concern said it would immediately increase irvings annual 
common dividend from 242 a share to 450 
irving lost 19327 million last year after raising its 
loanloss reserves to cover troubled third world debt 
to pay for the special 10ashare dividend which is part of 
the banca commerciale deal irving said it planned to sell its wall 
street headquarters and its 39 percent equity interest in banca 
della svizzera italiana for more than the current market price of 
about 325 million 
banca commerciale based in milan has assets of around 60 
billion and is italys second largest bank behind banca nazionale 
del lavoro about 64 percent of banca commerciale is owned by the 
giant state holding company istituto per la ricostruzione 
industriale irvings assets total 2412 billion

abc is considering buying out dolly partons 
contract and canning her variety show dolly which proved a 
disappointment in the ratings abc entertainment president brandon 
stoddard said monday 
were now in a situation where we frankly dont know what 
were going to do about dolly next year stoddard told a news 
conference 
as you all know we actually have the right not to do the 
show there is a penalty payment we would pay if we did not go 
ahead on the second year stoddard said parton got a twoyear 
guarantee in her multimilliondollar contract with abc stoddard 
would not say how much the penalty would be 
stoddard listed dolly and moonlighting as his two 
biggest disappointments in a season that saw abc eke out a 
secondplace finish after coming in last the previous year nbc has 
won its third season in a row and cbs finished last for the first 
time ever 
moonlighting formerly a top10 show dropped into the top 
20 this season due to frequent repeats and episodes without cybill 
shepherd who was pregnant nevertheless stoddard said the show 
likely will come back next season 
stoddard was not optimistic about an early end to the strike by 
the writers guild of america and said if it lasts into the summer 
it could substantially delay the start of the fall season 
that could chase more viewers away from the three networks which 
have seen a 9 percent decline in audiences since 198687 according 
to the ac nielsen co 
a delay would mean more reruns and more viewers would presumably 
turn to cable or other alternatives stoddard said 
i think the net effect of that is that even when we come back 
on the air it could be the loss of a couple more share points for 
the networks he said its not a happy thought 
in addition to that when the strike is finished and we start 
putting programs on the air theres going to be tremendous 
pressure to get something up on that screen and maybe it aint 
perfect when we do i think there also could be some erosion caused 
by the lack of quality this is a very serious problem 
he said abc is considering repeating miniseries should the 
strike cause a significant delay in the start of the new season 
but the 30hour miniseries war and remembrance which would 
be available for the fall wont be wasted then when nbc will have 
the summer olympics stoddard said instead the ballyhooed 
miniseries will likely be saved for the february 1989 sweeps period 
stoddard also said while happy the network was second for the 
season in the nielsen ratings with an average primetime rating 
of 137 to cbs 135 the performance really was not that 
terrific nbc had a 161 
without highrated primetime sports the world series the 
super bowl and the winter olympics abc actually was third 
the rating is a percentage of the nations 886 million homes 
with televisions 
as for abcs new shows stoddard said there would be some early 
pickups announced in a week or so those are likely to include 
the wonder years and thirtysomething 
stoddard said it looked good for a renewal of hooperman but 
a decision on the slap maxwell story is a tough call

shortly after the us military attack on two 
iranian oil platforms in the persian gulf the united states issued 
a fresh message to iran warning that additional provocations would 
be met with a firm us response the state department said monday 
state department spokesman charles redman said iranian 
authorities were told that the united states was exercising its 
right of selfdefense following the mine explosion last friday in 
which the uss samuel b roberts was damaged injuring us navy 
personnel 
the extreme seriousness with which the government of the 
united states views such unacceptable activity by iranian vessels 
should be understood by the islamic government of iran the 
message said 
any further provocative or hostile iranian military or 
terrorist actions against us personnel or targets will receive a 
firm us response 
there was no further elaboration and redman refused to speculate 
what response the administration has in mind 
redman said five nato allies britain italy west germany the 
netherlands and belgium were notified before mondays attack 
that the action was pending all have naval vessels in the persian 
gulf 
a group of other countries including the soviet union and iraq 
was informed as the attack commenced redman said 
another us official insisting on anonymity said a cable was 
sent to all us diplomatic posts abroad at approximately the same 
time the attack took place advising them of the us action and 
asking them to guard against possible retaliatory terrorist 
incidents 
the official said requests for us posts abroad to increase 
their state of readiness at such times are normal practice 
redman said iran had been warned four times about mining in gulf 
waters since last july when a reflagged kuwaiti vessel the 
bridgeton struck a mine near farsi island he said other warnings 
followed in september and october 
the note to iran said that despite these warnings and the fact 
that us forces in the gulf have not threatened iranian forces 
iran has persisted in this illegal and reckless conduct 
redman said the message was sent to iranian authorities through 
the swiss which handles us interests in iran in the absence of 
diplomatic relations between the two countries

hippies in australias outback are 
forsaking traditional drugs and getting their kicks from cane 
toads which when boiled produce a slimy and potentially lethal 
cocktail police say 
people taking it experience a trip similar to that resulting 
from lsd said inspector syd churchill of cairns police in 
northeast australia it is by all accounts a very potent drug 
churchill told the sydney morning herald newspaper that cane 
toads which are reviled across australia for their ugly 
appearance are being cooked by drug users because they are 
plentiful while narcotics like marijuana and heroin are in short 
supply or expensive 
the preparation method involves boiling toads in a billy a 
pot for a few minutes the toads are then removed and the 
somewhat treacly substance behind is drunk said churchill 
but he warned that bufotenine the substance contained in two 
glands behind the toads head is a toxin that can be fatal 
churchill did not mention if the practice is widespread nor 
whether there had been any arrests or fatalities cairns police 
said he was not available for comment monday 
however an expert in cane toads dr robert endean of 
queensland universitys zoology department said he was aware 10 
years ago that people in the outback were getting high from chewing 
or smoking cane toad skins 
it is definitely hallucinogenic endean told the associated 
press it makes a good cocktail but the toad is so ugly i would 
have thought just to look at it is enough to make most people think 
ill give that a miss 
the size of dinner plates cane toads were introduced to 
australia from south america about 50 years ago to control a beetle 
plague in the queensland canefields they are now found across 
northeastern australia

american industry had a second straight 
monthly decline in operating rates in march despite a rebound at 
auto plants the government reported monday 
the federal reserve said us factories mines and utilities 
operated at 823 percent of capacity last month down from an 
operating rate of 824 percent in february 
us factories had operated at 826 percent of capacity in 
january the highest level in more than eight years 
analysts said the small declines in the operating level over the 
past two months were not worrisome and represented cutbacks in 
industries trying to work down high levels of unsold goods 
before the year began economists had been worried that sharp 
production cutbacks could topple the country into a new recession 
but those fears have now faded as a variety of economic indicators 
have shown the economy performing betterthanexpected so far this 
year 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc predicted 
the overall economy as measured by the gross national product 
would expand at a respectable annual rate of around 2 percent in 
the januarymarch quarter 
she said many industries such as paper and chemicals have been 
expanding their production facilities to meet increased demand and 
this higher spending will help boost overall gnp growth this year 
as well as helping to hold down inflationary pressures 
the added manufacturing capacity is needed if we are to keep 
price pressures from developing in the economy she said 
in march the operating rate at auto factories shot up to 792 
percent of capacity the first increase in this key sector since 
october analysts credited the gain to the success auto dealers had 
in spurring sales through the use of new incentives programs 
in manufacturing overall the operating rate edged down to 825 
percent a dip of 01 percentage point from february as strength in 
autos was offset by cutbacks at factories making nondurable goods 
the operating rate at plants making durable goods items 
expected to last at least three years rose to 802 percent up 01 
percentage point reflecting the auto rebound 
plants making nondurable goods however operated at 859 
percent of capacity down from 862 percent in capacity 
the mining industry which includes oil and gas drilling 
operated at 803 percent of capacity up from 798 percent in 
february us utilities operated at 818 percent of capacity down 
01 percent from february 
the overall operating rate of 823 percent was up sharply from a 
year ago when american industry was operating at 797 percent of 
capacity 
the growth over the past year reflects heavy overseas demand for 
us products because of the decline in the value of the dollar

some banks opened for the first time 
in six weeks monday but only to accept deposits and people who 
still have currency in this cashpoor economy were in no rush to 
give it up 
business was brisk at a few major foreign banks but slow at 
institutions owned and operated by panamanians 
about 30 people were outside chase manhattan when it opened 
virtually all were depositing checks they have been unable to cash 
for 45 days because us economic sanctions have dried up the money 
supply in panama whose currency is the dollar 
ill keep my cash at home said frank farrell who is 
retired and was depositing several dividend checkslater on 
maybe ill deposit cash 
asked if he felt secure putting checks in a bank that had been 
closed since march 4 by order of an insolvent government farrell 
replied i dont worry chase is solid 
the banks were closed after panamanians began withdrawing large 
sums of money on feb 26 that was the day gen manuel antonio 
noriega the real power in panama dismissed civilian president 
eric arturo delvalle for trying to fire him as commander of the 
armed forces and police 
the reagan administration subsequently ordered the federal 
reserve to halt the flow of dollars to panama lawyers acting for 
delvalle were able to freeze panamanian funds in us banks 
washington also has imposed other economic sanctions on panama 
in an effort to out noriega who is under indictment in us 
federal courts on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering 
he denies the charges 
a middleaged woman in line at the chase office said she was 
depositing only checks because i need the cash to eat 
short lines lines also formed outside citibank and the bank of 
america but panamanianowned banks whose solvency is in question 
did not appear even to be getting many checks for deposit 
a few minutes after it opened only six customers were in the 
spacious lobby of the national bank of panama largest of the 
locally owned banks 
the panamanian banking association says its members will not 
resume full service until the government can assure a steady 
adequate supply of dollars most of the more than 120 banks doing 
business in panama belong to the association 
since the banks closed panama has operated on a cashonly basis 
and the government has been able to make only partial salary 
payments to employees 
only banks licensed to provide full services were included in 
the banking commissions reopening order many foreign banks accept 
checking savings and time deposits and provide fund transfers but 
do not make loans or offer other banking services 
one bank manager said privately the reopening for deposits only 
would reestablish the check as an acceptable payment in lieu of 
dollars 
panama is a check economy if you want to use that word he 
said this is an initial step to reestablish the reopening of 
banks but i really dont know if this is going to work or not 
he said clients depositing checks would not be able to draw cash 
from their accounts until or unless the banks resume full services 
but if you owe money to somebody and he will accept a check you 
can write a check on your new balance

two iranian navy frigates were attacked and 
disabled today by american forces and four smaller gunboats either 
sunk or damaged in a wave of fighting across the lower half of the 
persian gulf the pentagon said 
no american injuries or fatalities were reported but defense 
secretary frank c carlucci said a cobra attack helicopter with two 
crewmen aboard was late in returning to a navy cruiser and that a 
search had been mounted for the aircraft 
the naval action with iran began when us warships attacked and 
destroyed two offshore platforms in retaliation for last weeks 
mining of the frigate samuel b roberts 
carlucci appearing at his second press briefing of the day 
described as foolhardy behavior irans decision to escalate the 
fighting today he said he assumed the attacks could only be 
explained as stemming from fanaticism 
earlier today carlucci and other pentagon officials disclosed 
that an iranian patrol boat had been sunk after firing a missile at 
the cruiser wainwright and that two iranian navy frigates had been 
attacked and disabled after firing on us aircraft 
during his second briefing carlucci announced that a navy a6 
intruder jet had sunk at least one and possibly three small iranian 
gunboats after observing them attack commercial vessels and oil 
rigs off the coast of the united arab emirates 
that confrontation occurred around 730 am edt carlucci said 
or about 6 hours after us forces attacked the iranian offshore 
platforms 
navy jets were assigned to patrol the area after reports were 
received indicating an american commercial boat the willy tide 
had been attacked carlucci indicated 
the defense secretary described the us attack on the platforms 
as a measured response given available evidence proving iran 
had sown a new minefield in the gulf last week 
all of the fighting that occurred after the attacks on the 
offshore platforms was in the cause of american selfdefense 
carlucci said 
asked if he were surprised by the iranian decision to confront 
us forces directly the secretary replied i wouldnt use the 
word surprised because the iranians have been known to engage in 
this kind of frankly foolhardy behavior before 
i might say we were disappointed we hoped that they would 
heed the warnings that we gave but when they did not we took 
appropriate action 
asked how he would explain irans decision to ignore us 
warnings he said im not sure that its explainable in terms of 
western logic at this point i have to only assume that its some 
kind of a fanatical reaction or slavish obedience to a contingency 
plan 
it certainly makes no sense whatsoever in military terms and 
we hope that tomorrow that will bring peace in the region 
the pentagon said the missing american helicopter had been on a 
routine surveillance mission from the cruiser wainwright in the 
lower central gulf and that there was no indication the aircraft 
had become involved in hostile action as of 330 pm edt 
carlucci said the helicopter was about 40 minutes overdue and 
efforts to establish radio contact had been unsuccessful 
the pentagon said it had launched a searchandrescue mission 
but had not spotted the helicopter 
earlier the pentagon said the two iranian frigates had been 
attacked and disabled after firing missiles at us jets flying 
overhead 
the defense department said the last of those confrontations 
ccurred around 940 am edt when a frigate identified as the 
sabalan fired on a6 intruder attack jets from the carrier 
enterprise 
the aircraft returned fire and hit the sabalan with a single 
laserguided bomb the pentagon added 
as darkness fell the sabalan was down by the stern with tugs 
fore and aft we do not intend to renew attacks on the sabalan 
unless she exhibits further hostile intent 
the fight with the sabalan came just 70 minutes after a similar 
confrontation with an identical frigate named the sahand it also 
was attacked and set afire after firing missiles at the us 
aircraft the pentagon said 
the confrontation with the sahand occurred in the strait of 
hormuz the entrance to the persian gulf around 830 am edt 
about 7 hours after the united states bombarded and destroyed two 
iranian offshore platforms said dan howard the pentagons chief 
spokesman 
earlier an iranian patrol boat was sunk after advancing on us 
warships an american helicopter came under fire from another 
gunboat and one us warship fired on two approaching iranian jet 
fighters although it was unclear whether they were hit 
howard gave this account of the sahand incident 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the iranian frigate a 310foot warship named the sahand 
steamed out of the naval base at bandar abbas earlier this morning 
and was noticed closing rapidly upon three us warships 
the sahand ignored repeated warnings from a us e2 
earlywarning aircraft to turn away or to be considered hostile 
about 830 am edt the sahand fired upon three a6 intruder 
aircraft on patrol in the area off the uss enterprise 
the intruders returned fire with two harpoon missiles and a 
number of laserguided bombs shortly thereafter the uss strauss 
a destroyer engaged the sahand with an additional harpoon all the 
ordnance appears to have hit the frigate and its heavily damaged 
its on fire at the moment and the smoke is so heavy that its 
difficult to do a further assessment at this point 
howard added that the strauss had been patrolling the area in 
and around the strait of hormuz along with two other ships the 
destroyer obrien and the frigate jack williams 
neither the a6 attack jets nor the us warships sustained any 
damage and there were no reports of any american injuries or 
casualties the spokesman said 
howard revealed the battle with the sahand this morning a bit 
more than an hour after defense secretary frank c carlucci and 
adm william crowe the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
appeared at an earlymorning briefing to discuss the us attacks 
the destruction of the two iranian offshore platforms was 
ordered by president reagan on sunday night in retaliation for the 
mine strike that almost sank the frigate samuel b roberts last 
week carlucci said 
carlucci said there was no doubt the mine field in which the 
roberts became entrapped had been laid recently by iran mines 
discovered in the area carry the same type of serial numbers as 
those captured last year aboard an iranian minelaying ship 
carlucci said 
according to carlucci and crowe todays operation began around 
1 am edt with two groups of navy warships attacking two oil 
platforms in the central persian gulf 
both of the platforms were ultimately destroyed one by naval 
gunfire and the other by planted explosives the two said 
but in the process of attacking one of the platforms the 
socalled sassan platform the us ships came under fire from a 
machine gun on the facility crowe said 
and immediately after the attack on the second platform the 
sirri platform an iranian patrol boat roughly 150 feet in length 
began advancing on the three american warships and ignored warnings 
to keep its distance the admiral continued 
it the iranian boat acknowledged the message but continued 
to close crowe said after several warnings we engaged and he 
fired at us simultaneously with a missile 
the simpson fired three standard missiles two of which hit 
the iranian vessel the wainwright fired one which hit the 
iranian we subsequently closed on it and fired another missile 
and it sunk we found no people in the water

two bomb blasts on monday wrecked 
a jewish community center and a saudi arabian airlines office and 
authorities looked into a possible link with the weekend 
assassination of a senior plo leader 
no one was injured in the early morning blasts in frankfurt and 
no one claimed responsibility 
police said the devices which went off about 15 minutes apart 
within a mile of each other probably were planted by the same 
attackers frankfurt prosecutors spokesman jochen schroers said 
that evidence at both sites is similar 
he said a connection with saturdays slaying of the palestine 
liberation organization miliary chief in tunisia is just 
speculation at this point 
but a connection is possible he added such a political 
motive cant be ruled out 
khalil alwazir also known as abu jihad was killed early 
saturday by commandos who stormed his suburban tunis home the plo 
a tunisian government panel and israeli press reports have said 
israel carried out the assassination israel has remained silent 
a leading member of the opposition social democratic party also 
discussed the possibility of a link between the slaying and the 
frankfurt blasts in an interview monday with saarland state radio 
however hans koschink said there were no clear signs of 
such a connection 
the head of west germanys jewish communities heinz galinski 
issued a statement monday in west berlin calling on authorities to 
tighten security near jewish property 
it is not understandable for me that even today especially 
in view of the increasing number of threatening and abusive letters 
jewish communities have difficulty when they try to get 
sufficient security for their property galinski said 
meanwhile police looked for a silvergray bmw car that 
witnesses saw before the blast at the jewish community center a 
police spokesman said requesting anonymity 
the blast at the center blew off outdoor lighting fixtures 
badly damaged the front entrance and left a footdeep hole in the 
ground 
the explosion at the saudi airlines office gutted the interior 
and shattered windows in nearby buildings including at the air 
canada office 
authorities estimated overall damage at several hundred thousand 
dollars

here are highlights from the report by the 
presidents commission on aviation safety 
the nations air transportation system is safe for now 
but the government regulatory structure designed to ensure 
aviation safety is inadequate to deal with future growth and 
technological change 
there is a need for a major structural overhaul of the 
federal aviation administration making it an independent agency 
outside the transportation department 
an independent aviation safety czar should be appointed as 
part of the new faa and given authority to oversee safety matters 
with a sevenyear term the new aviation safety director could 
initiate new safety rules and block proposed regulations 
no need has been demonstrated for reimposing federal 
regulation of the airline industry although the government must 
streamline its regulatory activities to deal with rapidly changing 
events in a deregulated industry 
surveillance of airlines should be improved with heavier 
reliance on indepth inspections surprise inspections and closer 
examination of airlines undergoing major changes 
safety requirements for commuter airlines should elevated 
gradually to the same level as those for larger commercial airlines 
small private planes flying near major airports should be 
required to have equipment that informs ground controllers of their 
altitude

richard nixon advised democrat michael dukakis 
on monday to back president reagan on americas retaliatory actions 
in the persian gulf to dispel any impression that he is weak on 
foreign policy 
he said also that the united states should make clear to 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev that the russians are playing 
russian roulette with the situation there 
president reagan should make it clear to the soviets who he 
said are playing on both sides in the war between iran and iraq 
that this is an area we consider absolutely vital and that 
eventually they are going to hurt their relations with us unless 
they join us in trying to get this war brought to an end nixon 
said 
nixon described the conflict as not a war that we want either 
side to win and added there has never been a war in which both 
sides deserved to lose more than this war 
incidents in the persian gulf have the effect of strengthening 
the candidacy of vice president george bush nixon said adding 
that if he were dukakis i would take a hard line on this 
when the united states comes under attack and they the 
people realize our interests are involved they rally around the 
president and his vice president in this case the former 
president said 
i dont think george bush is going to make a political issue 
out of this and that is why i think dukakis ought to join the 
president and george bush in making it clear to the iranians they 
are confronting a united united states on this issue and that were 
not going to be divided 
dukakis said monday we just dont have sufficient information 
for me to comment on whats happened in the middle east in the last 
few days and it would just be inappropriate for me to comment 
nixons interview on cnn was one of a series of appearances he 
is making to promote his new book 1999 
he said dukakis would be helped by taking a strong line in the 
persian gulf conflict because he opposed the move even into 
grenada 
the former president who has predicted that republican bush 
will beat democrat dukakis by a narrow margin in november said 
that what he called dukakis weakness in foreign policy has not 
been brought out due to the fact that everybody is concentrating 
on jesse jackson at the moment because of his spectacularly 
successful campaign 
as he has before nixon described dukakis foreign policy as 
right out of george mcgoverns playbook 
if people get the idea that you are going to have a president 
who is smart tough strong which he is but is weak in the 
foreign policy area it will be devastating to him i think it will 
serve his interest in this case to support the president

cuba has given exit permits to 225 former or 
current political prisoners and their families and a portion of 
the group is expected to fly to the united states this week the 
state department said monday 
spokesman charles redman said this represents about oneeighth 
of the more than 2000 persons whom the us has authorized for 
entry into the united states as refugees 
another official asking not to be identified said the initial 
group is due to arrive in miami on wednesday and is expected to 
number about 25 persons the remainder will fly to miami over the 
next several weeks 
consistent with past practice cuba is likely to send the 
emigres in small groups in order to limit opportunities for 
propaganda spectacles by exile groups or by the reagan 
administration the official said 
redman said the 225 had been processed for emigration by the 
us diplomatic mission in havana last august from a list drawn up 
by the us catholic conference the list was later amended by the 
cuban government he said 
of the 91 in the prisoner category 22 are longterm inmates who 
have refused political rehabilitation 
the expected departure of the first group of cubans coincides 
with the arrival in cuba this week of cardinal john oconnor the 
archbishop of new york city 
he is believed to be the highest ranking american roman catholic 
official to travel to cuba since the 1959 revolution 
the us official said there has been speculation but no firm 
evidence that the cuban decision to allow the emigres to leave the 
island was linked to oconnors visit he is going to cuba after a 
visit to the dominican republic

a proposed exhibition in michigan of two giant 
pandas from china would undermine international laws governing 
imports of endangered species the world wildlife fund said monday 
in urging denial of an import permit 
however michigan united conservation clubs an exhibition 
sponsor said the permit may be unnecessary because chinese 
officials have agreed to provide pandas exempt from a treaty 
governing endangeredspecies imports 
the world wildlife fund a private organization seeking to 
preserve wild animals said in a letter to the us fish and 
wildlife service the imported wildlife will be used for 
commercial purposs and the import will neither serve scientific 
purposes nor enhance the propagation or survival of the species 
such use of the pandas would violate both us endangered 
species laws and the convention on international trade of 
endangered species the letter said 
evidence of poaching of the rare giant panda in china prompted 
the world wildlife fund to oppose the michigan exhibition said 
william reilly the organizations president 
had we known a year ago what we have learned in the past few 
months about the plight of the panda and the pressure posed by 
exhibition loans we almost certainly would have opposed most if 
not all previous shortterm loans just as rigorously reilly 
said 
reilly said approval of the permit would increase the demand for 
the import of giant pandas into the united states for commercial 
purposes 
tom washington mucc executive director denied the exhibition 
was commercial certainly we are not a circus or a carnival or 
even a zoo for that matter he said there is a whole string 
of hypocricy involved here 
mucc received a letter over the weekend from sichuan provinces 
foreign affairs office providing assurance that they will provide 
us with a pair of pandas born before 1984 washington said the 
animals would not require an import permit he said 
the exhibitors of the pandas in michigan would pay chinese 
authorities at least 300000 with the money to be used to build a 
panda captivebreeding facility and to improve the animals 
habitat washington said 
the michigan department of natural resources and mucc in 
february asked the fish and wildlife service to allow the pandas 
shown at a 100day summer exhibition called pandarama at the 
michigan state fairgrounds in detroit

breaking a long official 
silence the armed forces chief on monday gave details of his 
troops role in angola and said angola had exaggerated the size of 
the south african force operating there 
gen jannie geldenhuys in his first detailed statement on south 
africas involvement in angolas civil war said there had never 
been more than 3000 south african troopers in angola at any one 
time in the past year 
angolas marxist government claims there are 9000 south african 
military personnel fighting alongside rebels of the national union 
for the total independence of angola or unita 
there are an estimated 40000 cuban soldiers and hundreds of 
soviet advisers in angola helping the government forces 
geldenhuys announced last november that south african troops had 
intervened on behalf of unita since then the military has been 
widely criticized for providing minimal information about its role 
in the war 
the generals statement monday indicated the intervention began 
in may 1987 since the losses he announced were for a period 
beginning then 
in the months since geldenhuys said 31 south african soldiers 
have been killed and three tanks four other combat vehicles and 
two aircraft have been lost 
the casualty figures did not include black units composed of 
southwest africans and angolan exiles there have been unofficial 
reports that those units have suffered higher losses than white 
south african units 
geldenhuys did not give casualty figures for the unita rebels 
he said angolan government losses for the past year totaled 4768 
men but it was not clear if the losses referred to the number 
killed or both killed and wounded 
the general repeated a statement he made in december that south 
african forces were in the process of withdrawing he declined to 
report a timetable saying such information could aid the enemy 
he said the south african troops had captured certain weapons 
unknown to the western world and several countries were seeking 
access to them he did not elaborate 
angolas foreign minister alfredo van dunem said friday more 
than 6000 south african soldiers were preparing for a renewed 
attack against the strategic southern town of cuito cuanavale 
he said the troops beseiging the garrison town were part of a 
south african force of 9000 soldiers 600 artillery pieces and 500 
tanks and armored cars in angola 
cuito cuanavale has been under attack for four months by unita 
rebels and south african troops 
the town is 190 miles north of the border with south 
africanruled southwest africa also known as namibia it has an 
airstrip and is used as a staging base for army operations against 
unita guerrillas 
unita lost to the marxist popular liberation movement of angola 
in a battle for power after angola received its independence from 
portugal in november 1975 
unita which is suported by the united states is demanding the 
marxists share power 
the government has rejected negotiations with the rebels it has 
said it would agree to a gradual withdrawal of the cuban troops if 
south africa removed its forces and halted aid to unita

secretary of education william j bennett 
charged monday that recent changes in its western culture course 
requirements at stanford university represented a victory for 
radical students who employed the tactics of intimidation 
a great university was brought low by the very forces which 
modern universities came into being to oppose ignorance 
irrationality and intimidation bennett charged in a speech 
prepared for delivery on the stanford campus in california 
stanford president donald kennedy denied bennetts allegations 
and accused bennett of using his bully pulpit to bully rather 
than to engage the issues 
kennedy said bennett had refused an offer to debate with 
university officials and insisted instead on having a platform to 
speak unopposed 
among the sponsors of bennetts speech were the stanford 
conservative forum and the stanford college republicans 
stanfords black student union feminists and other minority 
student groups had agitated for changes in the western culture 
requirement 
stanfords faculty senate voted 394 on march 31 to alter its 
western culture requirement for freshman to include the study of 
noneuropean cultures and works by women and minorities they also 
renamed the requirement effective in the fall of 1989 cultures 
ideas and values 
freshmen entering this fall still will have to read from the old 
and new testaments and works by plato augustine machiavelli 
rousseau and marx but works by dante luther locke freud 
voltaire darwin nieztsche and several others have been dropped 
from the core list 
starting in 1989 the cultures ideas and values faculty will 
decide which texts authors themes and issues will be taught in 
six to 10 different tracks 
the faculty senate decided that each track must include works 
from at least one noneuropean culture and confront issues 
relating to class ethnicity race religion gender and sexual 
orientation students will have at least one major reading each 
quarter on race gender or class issues 
in a related matter the chancellor of the university of 
massachusetts on monday lashed back at bennett who had accused the 
school of being too lenient in handling a protest by minority 
students 
students here were treated with respect but also firmness 
chancellor joseph duffey said they left the building because 
they were treated with respect not because they got what they 
wanted 
minority students took over a campus building at umass for six 
days in february to protest campus racism and bennett on sunday 
complained that administrators sent the demonstrators a basket of 
fruit and ordered out chinese food for them and then gave in to all 
of their demands one wonders what kind of teaching experience 
that is 
bennett previously had injected himself into the debate at 
stanford in february when he said that faculty trashing of plato 
and shakespeare was eroding the credibility of higher education 
kennedy said in an interview after he read the advance text of 
the speech that the faculty had made a significant improvement 
in the curriculum and that bennett obviously had not followed the 
controversy very carefully 
i dont believe he can possibly have read the ultimate 
compromise carefully or read the arguments in the debate that led 
up to it bennett said 
im disappointed that people on both sides of the original 
debate wont have a chance to respond kennedy said but i 
certainly hope they will respond in other forums 
kennedy said the faculty has made the core list more flexible 
and it has introduced some notion of comparative analysis into that 
curriculum 
but bennett said that even though some may portray the new 
requirement as a minor pedagogical change the fact is that 
the core reading list of 15 significant works in western philosophy 
and literature has been thrown out 
instead instructors will decide year by year what the course 
content will be he said does anyone doubt that selecting works 
based on ethnicity or gender of their authors trivializes the 
academic enterprise bennett asked 
he said the tactics of intimidation had brought about the 
changes 
the loudest voices have won not through force of argument 
but through bullying threatening and namecalling thats not the 
way a university should work bennett said

panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega had 
signed an agreement to leave power voluntarily in may it was 
disclosed monday but the deal fell through when panamas president 
tried to fire the general in february 
the report came from former venezuelan president carlos andres 
perez who said he negotiated the deal with noriega together with 
former presidents alfonso lopez michelsen of colombia and daniel 
oduber of costa rica 
perez said in an interview the us government was aware of his 
groups negotiations with noriega which took place in panama last 
november and in january and february of this year 
the deal was signed feb 24 three weeks after noriega was 
indicted on drug charges in miami and one day before panamas 
thenpresident eric arturo delvalle announced he was firing him 
instead noriega engineered delvalles removal from the presidency 
the former venezuelan president said negotiations with noriega 
had been undertaken to help lead panama back toward democracy 
and had the support of the united states and spain 
he said spains prime minister felipe gonzalez knew of the 
initiative and indicated noriega could come to spain after leaving 
panama 
the deal with noriega envisioned his resignation from command of 
the national guard panamas politically powerful army and his 
replacment by an officer removed from politics whose mission 
would be the preservation of public order under civilian control 
concurrently steps would be taken to prepare for free elections 
and to restore full freedom of expression 
perez said noriegas departure from panama was not part of the 
deal but would have been a natural outgrowth of the process 
once he was out of the guard it was inevitable that he would have 
to leave the country 
initially perez said we were told by the united states 
that noriega could come here to the united states we had no idea 
that a criminal investigation and indictment were in the works 
perez who has been meeting with bankers and business leaders in 
the united states is a candidate for the presidency of venezuela 
in elections to be held in november he served as president from 
1974 to 1979 
perez said news of noriegas removal came as a complete 
surprise to us and apparently followed a meeting between 
delvalle and the us assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs elliott abrams he said the move came just 
as he and his fellow negotiators were preparing to report the 
signing of the agreement with noriega to secretary of state george 
p shultz 
perez said the agreement had been intended to remain 
confidential but the need for secrecy disappeared once the 
circumstances in panama changed he said he mentioned its existence 
in a statement issued in caracas in february but it gained little 
attention at the time

congress should repeal the moneylosing law 
that requires the us forest service to market a minimum supply of 
timber from tongass national forest in alaska the general 
accounting office said monday 
gao the investigative wing of congress said the requirement 
contributed to a net loss by taxpayers of about 221 million in 
1986 in sales of commercial timber from the tongass the nations 
largest national forest 
a 1980 law requires that the forest service offer to sell at 
least 45 billion board feet of tongass timber each decade and 
guarantees at least 40 million in spending a year to support the 
sales program 
the tongass is the only national forest with a minimum sales 
goal set by law although sen james mcclure ridaho has proposed 
a similar guarantee for the panhandle national forest in his state 
last month the house interior committee approved legislation to 
repeal the guaranteed minimum sales offerings from the tongass a 
similar bill is pending in the senate energy and natural resources 
committee 
the proposals are being pushed by environmental and conservation 
groups who say the guarantee leads to unnecessary roadbuilding by 
the forest service and needless harvesting of 400yearold trees 
the gao study requested by sens william proxmire dwis and 
ted stevens ralaska said that sales offerings of timber from the 
forest should be subject to market supplyanddemand forces 
gao said that from 1981 through 1986 the last year for which 
data were available sales of tongass timber averaged 245 million 
board feet a year some 105 million below the yearly average needed 
to meet the 10year goal 
focusing on 1986 gao said the forest service spent 479 
million on the tongass and realized only 33 million in revenues 
the net loss to taxpayers was 221 million because some spending 
was for timber production in future years according to the study 
from 1981 through 1986 the forest service spent 131 million to 
prepare for timber sales that were not needed to meet demand the 
study said 
gao said that because of the guarantee the forest service has 
incurred substantial expenses to prepare and offer timber it could 
not sell under depressed market conditions and made added 
investments in timber not needed to meet this demand 
we think clarifications and fundamental changes are 
necessary said gao noting that demand for tongass timber has 
not met the projections made when the 1980 law was enacted 
the timber supply provision should be revised so that the 
amount supplied would be based on the anticipated demand for timber 
and on the data currently being formulated by the forest service 
rather than on a rigid perdecade requirement the study said 
one reason given by advocates of the guarantee was to ensure 
employment in southeast alaska following passage of the 1980 law 
which barred commercial activities in about onethird of the 168 
million acre tongass 
gao said tongassrelated timber jobs declined from 2700 in 1980 
to 1420 in 1986 primarily because of the decreased harvest 
levels resulting from declining demand for timber and increased 
production by the alaska native corporations that directly compete 
with the tongass timber industry 
the forest service chief f dale robertson said in a letter to 
gao that the proposal to scrap the tongass guarantee has merit 
stevens said in a prepared statement that the gao focused on a 
lowdemand portion of an economic cycle and that timber has since 
rebounded he said money must be spent on the tongass even in low 
periods in order to meet peak demand 
he also noted that the guaranteed timber offerings were part of 
the 1980 compromise with conservation groups that set aside 54 
million acres of the forest as protected wilderness

attorney general edwin meese iii appeared for 
four hours before a federal grand jury monday in the criminal 
investigation of his activities that began nearly a year ago 
it was his fifth grand jury appearance in the probe by 
independent counsel james mckay since coming under criminal 
investigation last may 11 
meeses attorneys nathan lewin and james rocap said in a 
statement that the attorney general answered all questions and 
they said they remain confident that meese wont be indicted and 
that the probe will be completed in the near future 
mckay has been delving into a 40000ayear job for meeses 
wife meeses involvement with a 1billion iraqi oil pipeline the 
attorney generals ownership of 14000 in regional bell telephone 
stock and meeses ties to scandalplagued wedtech corp 
the attorney generals most recent grand jury appearance in the 
mckay probe was last nov 4 when prosecutors from mckays office 
were focusing on the wedtech matter 
last thursday two members of the family that arranged to pay 
the salary of meeses wife were questioned in front of the grand 
jury 
the bender family arranged to pay the salary of ursula meese 
while leasing office space to the justice department 
the associated press reported last wednesday that a partnership 
headed by howard m bender won a 50million lease on justice 
department offices after the bender foundation had put up money to 
pay mrs meeses salary at the multiple sclerosis society 
mrs meese is to be questioned by mckays office later this 
month in connection with the job 
longtime meese friend e robert wallach who is under indictment 
in the wedtech scandal had a role in helping arrange the job for 
mrs meese wallachs attorney has told the washington post 
mckay said 2 weeks ago that he had insufficient evidence to 
seek an indictment of meese in connection with the oil pipeline or 
the telephone stock but that his investigation would continue at 
least through the end of april 
in connection with the oil pipeline project meese referred 
wallach to thennational security adviser robert mcfarlane in may 
1985 the referral led to a meeting the next month involving 
mcfarlane wallach and wallachs client swiss oilman bruce 
rappaport a partner in the pipeline project 
rappaport paid a 150000 legal fee to wallach who deposited it 
in a stock trading account owned by meeses financial manager w 
franklyn chinn chinn in effect pooled wallachs money with that of 
meese and other customers to help generate 40000 in stock trading 
profits on a 50000 investment in just 18 months wallach 
introduced meese to chinn 
mckay also has been investigating meeses holdings of telephone 
stock in 1985 and 1986 when meese met with executives of four of 
the seven regional bell companies 
the phone companies wanted the justice department to reverse its 
position and to recommend that the socalled baby bells be 
permitted to enter several new types of business a year after his 
meetings with the bell executives meese approved the 
recommendation reversing earlier department policy 
meese listed his telephone stock as having been sold on federal 
financial disclosure forms for 1985 and 1986 but the attorney 
general actually had transferred the holdings to chinn meese 
regained possession of the stock and sold it last september 
mckay also has been examining meeses efforts on behalf of 
wedtech at wallachs behest then white house counselor meese 
intervened on behalf of the bronx ny defense contractor 
directing his white house staff to ensure that the company got a 
fair hearing from the army in connection with a 32 million engine 
contract

the reagan administration quickly decided last 
week that if it could find evidence iran planted the mine that 
almost sank a navy frigate it would use military force to 
retaliate officials said monday 
top aides to president reagan also recommended however the 
retaliation be proportionate and not involve any direct action 
against iranian installations on land the officials said 
the result was a simultaneous attack monday morning on two 
iranian offshore platforms 
the frame of reference was pretty well established from the 
very beginning said one of the officials who like the others 
agreed to discuss the matter only if not identified 
we knew something had to be done but there were not a lot of 
options considered 
we had hit some of their offshore platforms before and that 
was pretty much the only thing we considered this time another 
source said 
were walking a line here of trying to protect freedom of 
navigation in international waters these platforms have been used 
to support attacks on commercial shipping we also need 
congressional support and international support were not trying 
to directly immerse ourselves in the iraniraq war 
the latest confrontation with iran began last thursday when the 
frigate samuel b roberts struck an underwater mine in the central 
gulf just hours after successfully shepherding an oil tanker to 
kuwait ten sailors were injured although the crew managed to save 
the ship 
by the time reagan met with his top security aides on friday 
it had been established conclusively that this was an iranian 
mine and that it had been deliberately planted and was not a 
drifter one source said 
defense secretary frank c carlucci said monday there was no 
doubt the mine had been sown by iran citing a match of serial 
numbers on the explosives with earlier captured mines he added 
it is very clear that they are new mines of iranian manufacture 
reagan after another briefing sunday night gave the final 
goahead for the retaliatory mission 
then much to the surprise of top pentagon officials the 
iranians decided to confront us forces directly in different 
parts of the gulf rather than simply abandon the platforms two 
iranian frigates were disabled and one large patrol boat and three 
smaller ones sunk or crippled by american forces in a day of 
fighting 
carlucci suggested at one point monday the confrontations 
stemmed from iranian fanaticism adding the united states acted 
only in selfdefense when it attacked the various iranian ships 
we hope iran will now realize the futility of its attempts to 
interfere with peaceful international shipping in the persian 
gulf carlucci added 
we do not seek a confrontation with iran but we do intend to 
continue our efforts to ensure freedom of navigation in the gulf 
and should the iranians resume their attacks our ships are 
prepared to defend themselves just as they did today

nasa said monday it will ask contractors this 
summer to submit proposals for a 12 billion program to design and 
build an advanced space shuttle booster rocket in a 
governmentowned plant 
under the plan the winning contractor will design build and 
operate the plant the rockets to be built there will be used by 
the shuttle program well into the next century 
the national aeronautics and space administration gets its 
shuttle rockets from a single private source morton thiokol inc 
whose manufacturing facilities are situated in utah a 
governmentowned plant will enable nasa to change contractors if it 
becomes dissatisfied 
the request for proposals will be issued in june or july nasa 
said so the advanced solid rocket motor will be available for 
launching after oct 1 1993 
the new booster will enable the shuttle to carry 12000 more 
pounds of cargo to orbit than the current 65000 pounds that 
increase will be equivalent to 24 extra shuttle missions a year on

israeli commandos operating with air 
support assassinated plo military chief khalil alwazir tunisian 
investigators concluded in a report released monday 
president zine el abidine ben ali condemned the flagrant 
premeditated aggression against tunisian sovereignty and said his 
government would file a complaint with the the un security 
council 
alwazir 52 also known as abu jihad father of the holy war 
was killed by seven commandos who burst into his home in a tunis 
suburb early saturday he was chief aide to yasser arafat chairman 
of the palestine liberation organization and was the plo military 
commander 
the body is to be flown to damascus syria on tuesday for 
burial 
arafat blamed israels mossad secret service immediately after 
the assassination news of the killing cause the worst violence in 
the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip since riots began 
dec 8 with 17 palestinians reported killed saturday 
state department spokesman charles e redman condemned the 
killing of alwazir violence is not the solution to the problems 
of the middle east he said in washington 
tunisian government investigators said they established israeli 
responsibility for this cowardly terrorist act which it israel 
planned and executed 
their report said an israeli military boeing 707 registry 
number 4x977 was about 35 miles outside tunisian air space at the 
moment of the attack 
it jammed communications in sidi bou said the northern suburb 
where alwazir lived the report said the plane was flying in 
the international air corridor in a way so as not to expose itself 
to tunisian air forces the investigators said 
the terrorist group which assassinated the palestinian leader 
had sophisticated technological support which put this operation 
beyond the framework of normal terrorists and into the kind of 
terrorism that only states are in a position to practice the 
report declared 
in october 1985 the israeli air force raided the plo 
headquarters killing about 80 palestinians and 20 tunisians and 
wounding 100 people arafat was not there 
israeli leaders have said nothing about responsibility for the 
killing but israeli sources said monday it was the work of mossad 
the navy and an elite commando unit 
arafat moved his headquarters to tunis after the 1982 israeli 
invasion drove the plo out of lebanon

both of auburn died in june 1986 after ingesting tainted capsules

britain said the us attack on iranian oil platforms monday was 
entirely justified but the soviet union said it could prompt 
more fighting in the persian gulf 
western european nations monday suspended their mineclearing 
operations in the gulf because of the destruction of the two oil 
platforms a dutch official said 
us forces also sank or damaged four iranian attack boats and 
bombed two iranian naval frigates after they fired on american 
planes 
american officials said the platform raids were in retaliation 
for a mine explosion thursday that damaged an american frigate and 
wounded 10 sailors 
iran has denied laying the mine 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain told reporters she 
was satisfied from the evidence we have that the mines were laid 
by iran and that the us reaction was entirely justified as a 
proportionate response 
foreign office minister david mellor told the house of commons 
that the us attack was a measured and proportionate response 
to renewed minelaying in the gulf by iran 
egyptian officials in cairo also supported the american actions 
we understand the american response and we urge iran to stop 
its policy of provoking others foreign minister esmat 
abdelmeguid said in a statement 
in the soviet union a television commentator said president 
reagan ordered the attack under pressure from the extreme 
right and because he wanted to show american society and the 
whole world that he is acting from a position of strength 
this is a road to nowhere said commentator farid 
seifulmulyukov on the nightly news program vremya 
the official news agency tass said the raids brought tension in 
the persian gulf to a critical level once again 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati protested the raid 
to the united nations and threatened retaliation irans official 
islamic republic news agency said in dispatches monitored in 
nicosia cyprus 
in athens greek officials said the american attack did not 
contribute to a deescalation of tension prevailing in the 
region but on the contrary could dangerously escalate the conflict 
between iran and iraq 
the usiranian confrontation was a subject of discussion at a 
meeting of the western european union in the hague the group is a 
defense forum comprised of the netherlands britain belgium 
france west germany italy and luxembourg 
the british were expected to use the meeting to seek a statement 
in support of the us raid

dutch italian and british mineclearing vessels in the gulf of its 
plans to attack 
dutch defense minister willem van eekelen said the ships 
immediately suspended operations 
the mineclearing vessels are awaiting new instructions van

out of the gulf 
in retaliation for mondays us raid iran attacked the 
britishflagged york marine several other vessels and oil 
facilities 
british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe in the netherlands 
for the western european union meeting said he was absolutely 
outraged that there should be an attack on a defenseless

spectators burst into applause when john 
demjanjuk was convicted of war crimes monday but his family walked 
out halfway through the 12hour reading of the verdict he heard it 
in a cell lying on a cot with back pains 
an assistant prosecutor said a survivor of the treblinka death 
camp in nazioccupied poland eliyahu rosenberg beamed after the 
verdict hugged him and said i feel better now 
rosenberg was one of five survivors who identified demjanjuk 
68 as the brutal death camp guard ivan the terrible who 
terrorized prisoners and ran the gas chambers at treblinka 
demjanjuk listened to the reading of the 450page judgement from 
a cot in a courthouse holding cell where he was taken after 
complaining of back pains 
when the court session opened guards carried him feetfirst 
across the courtroom stage into the cell after he began weeping and 
refused to leave the police van the trial was conducted in a 
converted movie theater 
two other holocaust survivors who testified against demjanjuk 
were among more than 600 spectators 
at one point survivor pinchas epstein was helped from the 
courtroom in tears after judges quoting from his testimony said 
ivan would gloat at the crushed faces the blood flowing after he 
brutalized people 
six hours into the opinion demjanjuks wife vera daughter 
lydia son john jr and soninlaw ed nishnic walked out of the 
courtroom in protest 
we just couldnt sit there any longer and listen to that 
garbage said nishnic who raised 650000 for the defense 
john jr 22 said its a disgrace to the word justice these 
are oldfashioned hanging judges as far as im concerned this was 
nothing more than a soviet show trial whenever one of our 
witnesses came on they got the hammer 
nishnic said this is going to go down in history as the most 
lopsided case ever conducted anywhere in the world 
defense lawyer john gill contended that the threejudge court 
automatically rejected defense arguments 
my god in heaven according to the judges we didnt do 
anything right he said they ruled against us on every single 
point 
mrs demjanjuk 62 was seen crying and wringing her hands 
during a lunch break i cant sit down i cant sit down she 
said 
although the courtroom remained full through the often tedious 
reading many spectators fell asleep read newspapers or slipped 
outside for a smoke or snack 
dov levine the presiding judge quoted twice from the bible in 
one instance he said samuel 1826 supported the contention of a 
treblinka survivor who said he recognized demjanjuk by the way he 
walked 
in the bible we find references to identifying an individual 
by his gait levine said 
after the reading demjanjuk walked slowly to a police van 
supported by two policemen and surrounded by 16 other guards he 
looked somber his head was bowed and his hands were clasped 
when reporters hidden from view behind a 6foothigh screen 
asked how he felt after the verdict he looked up and appeared 
surprised 
im very good he shouted im an innocent man i will 
appeal and im sure i will win 
as police hustled him toward the van he added this is 
ridiculous what happened hayom using the hebrew word for 
today

prime minister margaret thatchers government 
saved its tax legislation monday despite a revolt in the ranks that 
cut her usual huge majority in the house of commons to 25 
after noisy debate a 320295 vote defeated an amendment by 
conservative party rebels to the government bill on property taxes 
which critics say is unfair to the poor 
it was one of the governments worst days in parliament where 
the conservatives have a majority of 101 seats since mrs thatcher 
took office nine years ago 
rebellious rankandfile conservative members rallied behind 
michael mates and voted for his amendment which would have tied 
the tax to a persons ability to pay rather than assessing a flat 
rate regardless of income 
neil kinnock leader of the opposition socialist labor party 
was jubilant about the tory rebellion and declared in the commons 
the flagship is badly holed and sinking fast 
during the often rowdy session mates denied he was challenging 
mrs thatcher 
we are debating principles not personalities he said in a 
43minute speech punctuated by heckling from his own party i 
dont find this a comfortable position to be standing here 
offering criticism of the government 
at issue was a clause of the local government finance bill 
levying property taxes on each adult in a household instead of on 
the house or apartment in which they live as the case is now 
last week tory revolts cut government majorities to 74 and 81 
in votes on the introduction of charges for dental and eye checkups 
under the national health service 
those charges which follow a shakeup in the system of welfare 
payments are part of of the thirdterm program mrs thatcher says 
is designed to end the dependency culture 
conservatives to the political left of the prime minister say 
the program feeds the belief that her government is rightwing and 
uncaring 
in addition to charges for some health services the tax 
legislation reduces the top rate on income from 60 percent to 40 
the government says the new property tax system to take effect 
in 1990 will be fairer spreading the liability to 35 million 
people from the current 18 million heads of households

more than 1200 mourners paid their 
last respects monday to four siblings brutally slain in a mobile 
home killings one family member blamed on a convoluted judicial 
system 
jennifer mann 19 her sisters shannon 17 and martha 15 and 
brother ernest 11 were buried monday after a memorial service at 
mission park south funeral home 
an assailant broke into their mobile home early friday and 
attacked them with steak knives some broken by the force of the 
blows the girls were sexually mutilated officials said 
the girls parents ernest and becky mann who are separated 
were not home during the attack 
shannon manns former boyfriend leo narvaiz jr 20 was 
arrested shortly after the attack and charged with four counts of 
murder he remained in the bexar county jail in lieu of 405 
million bond 
grady mann jr an uncle of the victims blamed authorities for 
the deaths because narvaiz was not arrested quickly enough for an 
earlier threat 
we feel the mann children were victims of a system that has 
lost the meaning of a basic principle that our founding fathers 
felt was foremost the right to life liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness mann said outside the funeral home 
for the mann children these rights are gone forever 
at the time of the killings police had been looking for narvaiz 
because of a complaint filed by ricky moore 24 who was dating 
shannon mann moore alleged that narvaiz had damaged his pickup 
truck and threatened him with a knife on march 28 
moore criticized police for not arresting narvaiz sooner but 
officials blamed a clogged justice system for the delay 
police have said narvaiz is the sole suspect in the slayings 
but they are analyzing the tape of a frenzied call one of the girls 
made to a 911 emergency exchange for further clues 
it is our hope this tragedy might serve as a catalyst for all 
of us nationally to personally protest the system that has 
evolved grady mann said 
the system protects and shelters the rights of the few and in 
so doing neglects the needs of the many he said the time for 
change is now lest another family need go through the agony and 
torture of loss whether one or many 
after mondays fiveminute graveside service the victims 
father rose and screamed i want my boy i want my boy 
earlier mourners filed past four identical gray caskets 
bearing the victims snapshots in the funeral home the coffins 
were surrounded by hundreds of roses pink carnations were placed 
on top of the girls coffins and blue carnations on the boys 
friends of the manns have set up two funds to help defray the 
familys funeral costs which are expected to total more than 
10000

john shepherd attorney general edwin meese 
iiis choice to fill the no 2 post at the justice department told 
officials monday to proceed with a search to fill the job 
department sources said 
while not yet closing the door on the post shepherd is on the 
verge of withdrawing from consideration for the job of deputy 
attorney general the sources said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
shepherd has said he is concerned about the stress on his family 
of the public scrutiny that has occurred since meese picked him 
two weeks ago meese hurriedly selected shepherd a former 
president of the american bar association for the position without 
customary white house clearance and fbi background checks 
president reagan has not yet formally nominated shepherd 
in brief remarks to reporters meese said that he didnt expect 
to have a decision from shepherd until midweek but several 
sources said that shepherd as a matter of courtesy had already 
informed the department that he probably will withdraw from 
consideration for the post and that aides to meese should start 
looking for other candidates in fact the search was already under 
way said the sources 
a secretary at shepherds law firm said that he is not returning 
telephone calls to the news media his home telephone number is 
unlisted 
meanwhile meese has gone outside the department in attempt to 
fill another top vacancy the post of assistant attorney general in 
charge of the criminal division other justice department sources 
said 
sounded out about the possibility of taking the criminal 
division post by aides to meese is stephen a saltzburg a 
university of virginia law professor saltzburg is a consultant on 
a legal question in the irancontra prosecution of independent 
counsel lawrence walsh said the sources also speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
reached at his home saltzburg said he hadnt been offered the 
job but would not comment when asked whether he had been 
approached about it 
saltzburg is a consultant to former federal judge and exus 
attorney herb stern stern was hired by walsh to represent the 
irancontra prosecutor on the issue of congressional immunity 
the legal question is whether or not the congressional testimony 
compelled by grants of immunity to former national security council 
staffer oliver north former national security adviser john 
poindexter and businessman albert hakim prejudice their fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination 
in connection with the post shepherd would fill the 62yearold 
st louis attorney told meese last friday that he was giving 
serious consideration to withdrawing because of stress on his 
family stemming from his selection 
a former bookkeeper from shepherds law firm testified shortly 
before meese recommended him for the post that she had an affair 
weith shepherd the bookkeeper who was convicted of embezzlement 
claimed shepherd had told her to write checks to herself shepherd 
denied that he had an affair with her or that he had authorized her 
to write checks 
the trial testimony and shepherds membership in an allwhite 
country club and an allmale social club brought increasing public 
scrutiny to shepherd after meese announced his selection april 5 
in an interview friday with the washington post shepherd spoke 
of the tremendous pressure that this whole ordeal has been on me 
and my wife 
its more severe than anybody could have anticipated 
shepherd said he told meese last week he said the stress has 
caused the complete disruption of our family life 
meeses efforts to fill the posts of deputy attorney general and 
head of the criminal division stem from the march 29 resignations 
of arnold burns and criminal division chief william weld they 
stepped aside out of concern that the nearly yearold criminal 
investigation of meese is hurting justice department operations 
morale and image 
meese who testified before a federal grand jury for four hours 
in the probe monday has refused to resign predicting that he 
wont be indicted 
meeses first choice to fill the post of deputy attorney general 
was former federal judge arlin adams now a philadelphia lawyer 
adams said he was unable to take the post because of a heavy 
caseload and the fact that he had gone to work at the law firm just 
last year adams said meeses legal problems were not a major 
factor in his decision not to take the justice department position

mojong lorika wept monday as he described 
how his 2yearold son was killed by cattle rustlers who massacred 
192 kenyan villagers the kenya news agency reported monday 
the agency said that in an interview lorika said that when 
raiders burst into his home at 5 am last wednesday he grabbed 
his son and took cover in a corner but the rustlers opened fire 
and a bullet struck the child in the head killing him instantly 
laban kitele a minister of state said police tracked the gang 
of 50 rustlers from the raided village 30 miles west of the border 
town of lokichoggio and killed 40 in a gunbattle he said the 
other rustlers escaped across the border into sudan he mentioned 
no police casualties 
kitele in a statement sunday also said the police recovered 
3000 of about 3500 cattle sheep goats and donkeys that had been 
seized by the rustlers 
he described the rustlers as a terror gang of sudanese from 
the toposas tribe and ndongiros from ethiopia and said they were 
armed with automatic rifles and machetes 
there are several nomadic tribes in east africa that believe all 
animals were given to them by god and it is their right and duty to 
win them back 
the staterun news agencys correspondent interviewed lorika at 
the lodwar district hospital where 19 of 50 wounded survivors were 
being treated 
the news agency quoted medical health officer john adongosi as 
saying eight of the patients were in critical condition from bullet 
wounds and machete gashes it said six severely wounded victims 
were flown to nairobi for surgery 
wednesdays massacre occured in the remote turkana district in 
northwestern kenya heavy rains in the mountainous region made 
roads to the raided village impassable and turned a nearby dirt 
airstrip into a muddy bog 
the sunday nation an independent newspaper reported the sky 
over the ravaged village was black with vultures 
kiteles statement also referred to a march 30 attack by 
rustlers on a camp of nomads in northern kenya during which they 
hacked to death 15 people and fled with some 2000 goats 
rustlers have lost all respect for human life to the extent 
that they will massacre human beings in cold blood kitele said 
i wish to warn anybody within kenya or outside still harboring 
ideas of rustling to desist government response to rustling 
will always be prompt and aggressive hot pursuit 
nomads regularly cross the borders in east africa in search of 
pasture for their animals 
the daily nation also an independent newspaper called monday 
for the east african nations to establish a joint organization to 
wage war on stock thieves 
it is easy for raiders to pounce on a village on this side 
kill people and take livestock before vanishing to the other side 
where international law forbids our forces from following them 
the paper said 
mohamed yusuf haji a provincial commissioner managed to visit 
the massacre site and he told the sunday nation he found only bones 
and skulls left by vultures and scavenging animals

jesse jackson said monday that the atmosphere in 
the new york primary campaign has been so divisive and so 
violent that he has received more death threats than at any other 
time in the 1988 presidential campaign 
in response to questions about the attacks on him by mayor 
edward koch jackson said the namecalling and the accusations 
and the attempts of a provocation by the mayor have not been good 
for the city or the campaign 
koch has kept up a drumbeat of attacks on jackson 
early in the campaign the mayor said that jews and other 
supporters of israel would have to be crazy to vote for jackson 
in a television interview on sunday the mayor said jackson has 
lied when he had claimed to be the last person martin luther king 
jr spoke to before he died after being shot in memphis and again 
when he denied he had ever used the terms hymie and 
hymietown the terms are considered offensive to jews and 
jackson later apologized for using them 
we have received more death threats in this campaign than in 
all the other combined because the climate has been so divisive and 
so violent jackson told a news conference 
jackson customarily receives far more death threats than any of 
the other candidates and travels with heavy secret service and 
other protection 
later he exhorted his supporters to turn out in force for the 
new york primary and give him an upset victory that could scramble 
the odds in the race for the democratic presidential nomination 
standing in the rain at a getoutthevote rally in east harlem 
jackson said if you will stand in the rain today you will vote 
in the rain tomorrow weve come too close nothing can stop us 
now 
recent polls said massachusetts gov michael dukakis was getting 
the most support among likely democratic voters with jackson 
running a strong second sen albert gore jr of tennessee was a 
distant third 
turnout was the big unknown in efforts to predict the outcome on 
tuesday and jackson spent the last full day of campaigning trying 
to keep enthusiasm high among his strongest supporters 
he scheduled three rallies in different parts of harlem where 
black and hispanic voters turned out in large numbers to support 
him in the 1984 new york presidential primary and a fourth in 
chinatown 
the race is getting closer and turnout is the key said new 
york pollster lee miringoff he said a low turnout would favor 
jackson whose supporters are seen as generally being more fervent 
than those of the other candidates and thus more likely to follow 
through and vote 
in a speech to the nonpartisan association for a better new 
york jackson never mentioned koch by name but referred to those 
who are inclined because of their fears to be bent toward 
hysteria 
he went on leaders must set a high moral tone i will not 
surrender that tone to diversions 
however gerald austin jacksons campaign manager had less 
restraint saying koch is a lunatic hes a lunatic by new york 
standards 
the mayor campaigning with gore dismissed the criticism from 
the jackson camp 
so should i decline to say these things simply because he says 
its divisive said the mayor i mean hes not an icon hes a 
candidate candidates have to be able to take it and respond

conspiracy theorists scholars and a 
man wounded during the 1968 assassination of robert f kennedy were 
waiting anxiously monday for the release of police files on the 
killing 
this is a kind of vindication of citizens efforts to force 
this material out said gregory stone a professor on leave from 
the university of wisconsin who has devoted himself to studying 
kennedys killing 
secretary of state march fong eu plans to open the los angeles 
police departments voluminous investigative files on the 
assassination tuesday they include some 2500 photographs 50000 
pages of written material and interviews with 4000 witnesses 
officials said 
eus spokeswoman melissa warren said her office had been 
inundated with calls since announcing the impending release 
including many from massachusetts kennedys home state and new 
york which he represented as a senator 
there have been dozens of calls from all over the state all 
over the country from news people from historians and the just 
plain interested she said 
most of the material has been sealed since shortly after kennedy 
was gunned down at the ambassador hotel on june 5 1968 a summary 
of police files was released in 1986 but names and details then 
considered sensitive were deleted 
the summary concluded that sirhan bishara sirhan a jordanian 
immigrant was the lone assassin it found no evidence of a second 
gunman or a conspiracy 
the summary also concluded that sirhan who is serving a life 
sentence at soledad prison for the killing was sane and was not 
under the influence of alcohol when he shot kennedy moments after 
he had claimed victory in the california democratic presidential 
primary 
sirhan has said he does not remember shooting kennedy and blamed 
his amnesia on alcohol 
although sirhan shot kennedy in full view of numerous 
spectators controversy arose later about how many shots were fired 
and whether a second gunman was involved

the rightwing arena party 
filed a protest monday with the supreme court claiming the central 
elections council wrongly deprived it of a majority in the national 
assembly 
a complaint filed by the republican nationalist alliance known 
as arena said the council should have allotted it 31 of the 60 
seats in the assembly 
the councils final decision from the march 20 elections gave 30 
seats to arena and 23 to president jose napoleon duartes centrist 
christian democratic party 
the election was a crushing defeat for the christian democrats 
who had held 33 seats while arena had only 13 
arenas protest claimed the elections council should have 
allotted only 22 seats to the christian democrats instead of 23 
arena did not challenge the seven seats awarded to the national 
conciliation party which although it is conservative has said it 
will align itself with the christian democrats to form a voting 
bloc equal to arenas 30 seats 
the disputed legislative seat is from the easternmost province 
of la union 
in the outgoing legislature the national conciliation party had 
12 seats and there were two independent 
the threemember central elections council which supervises the 
vote count had one representative from each of the major parties 
arenas representative had walked out of the council claiming 
the count was incorrect but the christian democrat and national 
conciliation members continued with the count and announced the 
results 
all parties have agreed the dispute over the la union seat will 
not prevent the installation of the new assembly as scheduled on 
may 1

congressional leaders joined ranks monday to 
support president reagans decision to retaliate against iran for a 
mine attack that seriously damaged a us navy frigate in the 
persian gulf 
they applauded reagan for consulting with congress in advance of 
his decision to order navy ships destroy two iranian oil drilling 
platforms in the gulf on monday several called the military action 
appropriate and measured 
others said that by engaging in genuine consultation in advance 
instead of merely informing congress later as he has in the past 
reagan may have defused a possible congressional fight over 
whether he should have invoked the war powers act before ordering 
the navy to retaliate 
there will be no fight as long as they keep consulting 
said rep tony coelho dcalif the house deputy democratic leader 
the mines have been clearly identified as manufactured by the 
iranians and sown in the waters by the iranians said senate 
majority leader robert c byrd dwva the iranians were 
carrying out terrorist acts i support the decision to destroy 
the iranian platforms 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas told his colleagues 
in my view now is the time to send only one message to our 
adversaries that the united states the president the congress 
and the people are united and determined to meet our 
responsibilities and defend our interests in the gulf 
i hope the ayatollah khomeini gets that message so we can 
all avoid further bloodshed and violence dole said 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said the white house 
discussions were very frank and candid and that the 
congressional leaders pointed out the perils as well as the 
possible benefits of taking military action 
wright said of reagan he is the commander in chief and when 
action is taken by the united states it certainly behooves all of 
us to close ranks and to give the world a view of a nation that is 
united 
it seems to me the critical thing is that what was done was 
done in a measured fashion against inanimate objects to demonstrate 
we had the capacity to close down iranian oil production wright 
said 
wright byrd dole and house majority leader thomas foley 
dwash and minority leader bob michel rill were summoned to 
the white house on sunday evening and briefed on last thursdays 
mine attack on the uss samuel b roberts 
for the first time we were consulted before the executive 
order was issued and before it was decided and that was good 
byrd said 
sen john mccain rariz called the us response appropriate 
and said congress should not begin a chorus of calls for 
invocation of the war powers act 
he urged lawmakers to support reagan wait 24 hours to 48 hours 
then evaluate whether the us actions have been proper 
its clear we have a very dangerous situation mccain said 
if it begins to appear that there will be further escalation i 
think the president needs to talk directly to the american 
people the worst mistake would be for them to be kept in the 
dark 
but sen brock adams dwash one of the senates strongest 
advocates of invoking the war powers act in the persian gulf said 
the latest incidents demonstrate that by refusing to follow the 
requirements of the law the administration and congress have 
evaded their obligation to develop a longterm national policy 
sen arlen specter rpa said however he believed the 
iranian missile attack on a us warship in the gulf had exposed 
americans to hostilities and therefore had already triggered the 
acts 60day clock 
congress has a responsibility to become involved specter 
said but added that if calm is restored lawmakers may not press 
the issue it depends on future events as to how vigorously it 
would be pursued he said 
sen mark hatfield rore who has urged that the war powers 
act be invoked accused the senate of being lulled into 
complacency about the gulf in recent months 
i dont hear many voices calling for the war powers 
resolution in fact most everybody seems to be cheering the 
action my fear is that it will take dead bodies the dead bodies 
of us servicemen to force us to face our responsibility 
hatfield said 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee said the administrations retaliation was a 
measured and correct response but he said the war powers act 
should have been invoked many months ago so that the 
administration and the congress could be working in tandem and not 
at cross purposes 
adams said any time you have mining a us vessel hitting 
back shelling platforms these are certainly acts of war and the 
war powers act should be invoked 
as for reagans action he said of course i support 
protecting our people taking defensive actions 
under the war powers act hostilities involving us military 
forces trigger a 90day period during which the president must 
report to congress on the situation and congress must vote on 
whether or not to keep those forces deployed otherwise us units 
must be withdrawn 
presidents of both parties have opposed the act as an 
infringement of their powers as commander in chief

in todays news ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
bush defended his decision to campaign instead of remaining in 
washington to monitor persian gulf developments aides said he 
would interrupt a tuesday campaign swing through pennsylvania to

refusal to meet the demands of gunmen who hijacked 
a kuwait airways jetliner has become a source of national pride in 
this persian gulf sheikdom 
some kuwaitis also see it as vital to the survival of their 
country which is threatened by a 7yearold war between iran and 
iraq that rages only 50 miles to the north iran accuses kuwait of 
aiding iraq in the war and has attacked its main oilexport 
terminal 
i think kuwait has set an example that you never ever 
negotiate with terrorists said faisal almarzouk editor of the 
newspaper alanbaa 
i think its unfortunate that the united states west germany 
france have always wanted to negotiate the release of hostages held 
in lebanon he said in an interview 
for two weeks this land of about 17 million residents only 40 
percent of whom are citizens has rejected the demands of hijackers 
who seized the boeing 747 on april 5 it now is at the airport in 
algiers 
the gunmen want kuwait to free 17 proiranians convicted of 
bombing the us and french embassies in 1983 in return for the 
plane and about 35 hostages still held on it including three 
members of kuwaits royal family they have killed two kuwaiti 
passengers and have said they would massacre the rest 
kuwaits emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah ordered financial 
aid monday for the families of the two men slain by the hijackers 
a government statment said the emir ordered that all outstanding 
debts of the two victims and their families be written off and that 
the full salaries of the slain men be paid to their families 
in kuala lumpur malaysia a visiting kuwaiti soccer team 
offered to replace the hostages 
malaysias bernama news agency said the 52member team 
competing for the asian cup released a statement saying the 
members would sacrifice themselves for their country 
it reported the kuwaiti teams president sheikh fahad alahmad 
aljabar alsabah a younger brother of the emir said the soccer 
players were ready to depart for algeria 
a senior western diplomat said many kuwaitis view the hijacking 
as an affront 
the kuwaitis arent going to back down its a matter of 
national pride said another with extensive official contacts 
almarzouk the editor said even if they kill all the 
hostages on the plane well never ever release the killers who 
are here in kuwait 
several previous attempts have been made to force the release of 
the 17 prisoners who were convicted in 1984 three are sentenced 
to death 
lebanese extremists believed related to some of the 17 hijacked 
a kuwait airways jetliner in december 1984 on a flight from dubai 
to karachi pakistan and force it to tehran the fiveday ordeal 
ended when iranian security men entered the plane in disguise and 
surprised the hijackers two of the four americans on board were 
killed by the terrorists 
release of the imprisoned bombers also has been set as a 
condition for freeing american hostages held by moslem extremists 
in lebanon 
kuwait even refused to grant church of england envoy terry waite 
a visa in 1985 when he asked to come and discuss his efforts to 
free foreign hostages waite disappeared in beirut in january 1987 
and is believed held hostage 
us officials who sold weapons to iran to try to free the 
americans are said to have pressed kuwait briefly but 
unsuccessfully to release the prisoners 
diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity cited several 
reasons for kuwaits hard line 
as a rich but weak country close to powerful and often hostile 
neighbors it cannot afford to become a target of blackmail 
kuwaiti officials have expressed fear that if they knuckled 
under they would put every civilized country at risk 
fear that bowing to the hijackers would create conflict in 
kuwait between the majority sunni and minority shiite moslem sects 
kuwait is ruled by sunnis but many of its shiite minority are 
ethnic iranians and iran is predominantly shiite 
theyre just not going to let their country go the way of 
lebanon which has been ravaged by civil war since 1975 a 
european diplomat said

suporters of retired autoworker john demjanjuk 
said monday that his conviction in israel on war crimes charges 
would arouse antisemitic feelings in america 
i think people will be outraged because they know demjanjuk is 
innocent said peter jacyk of toronto who helped raise money for 
demjanjuks defense 
in the long run it will have a very negative effect on israel 
and jews it will definitely be longremembered jacyk said 
a panel of israeli judges on convicted demjanjuk on monday of 
war crimes saying they had no doubt that he was the sadistic death 
camp guard ivan the terrible who killed 850000 jews during 
world war ii 
demjanjuk 68 a ukrainian immigrant who lived in suburban 
cleveland before being stripped of his citizenship is scheduled 
for sentencing april 25 he faces death or life imprisonment 
bill liscynesky of the cleveland suburb of parma who heads the 
local united ukrainian organizations said the conviction was 
bound to have a negative effect on the american populations view 
of israel 
the majority of americans feel that demjanjuk is innocent 
liscynesky said 
the united ukrainian organization is an umbrella group for 48 
ukrainian groups in greater cleveland that have about 20000 active 
members liscynsky said he said telephones are probably very 
hot spreading the word among local ukrainians about demjanjuks 
conviction monday 
more than 200 people gathered sunday at st vladimirs cathedral 
in parma a ukrainian orthodox church to pray for demjanjuk and 
his family 
a former cleveland lawyer who helped win demjanjuks extradition 
to israel in 1986 said demjanjuk was justly treated by israel and 
deserved to be convicted 
i think there was no doubt that he was given a fair trial 
that every possible defense was raised and thoroughly defended 
said alvin lodish a former justice department lawyer who now is in 
private practice in miami there can be no doubt who john 
demjanjuk really is 
demjanjuks former attorney mark oconnor of buffalo ny 
said demjanjuks lawyers would need to alter their defense away 
from emotionally attacking prosecutors and judges 
it cant be said that he demjanjuk didnt have every 
opportunity to present evidence said oconnor he could not 
have had fairer trial 
the albany ny chapter of the holocaust survivors and friends 
in pursuit of justice which has 3000 members across the country 
applauded the verdict 
we commend the state of israel for accepting this 
reponsibility and we hope they will continue to prosecute nazi war 
criminals who have found haven throughout the world the group 
said in a statement as read by deborah rausch who had attended 
part of the trial 
in new york city abraham h foxman national director of the 
antidefamation league said the conviction was gratifying 
evidence that even 40 years after the holocaust justice can 
prevail over evil 
elizabeth holtzman the brooklyn district attorney said thee 
verdict sent the world a signal that nazi war criminals cannot 
escape 
as a member of congress holtzman was author of an amendment 
allowing for the deportation of nazi war criminals from the united 
states and barring those linked to nazi atrocities from entering 
the country

besides destroying the two offshore iranian oil platforms used 
for military purposes the us navy either sank or damaged four 
small iranian gunboats and bombed two iranian navy frigates that 
had fired missiles at us planes iran attacked oil facilities off 
sharjah and fired on at least two us vessels 
no american injuries or fatalities were reported but defense 
secretary frank c carlucci said a cobra attack helicopter with two 
crewmen aboard was late in returning to a navy cruiser and that a 
search had been mounted for the aircraft 
the pentagon said the helicopter had been on a routine 
surveillance mission from the cruiser wainwright in the lower 
central gulf and that there was no indication the aircraft had 
become involved in hostile action 
irans official islamic republic news agency in a dispatch 
monday night said iranian warships in a heroic clash with the 
aggressor american helicopters in the persian gulf shot down one of 
them monday afternoon 
pentagon spokesman maj bill oconnell said monday night that 
the pentagon was aware of the iranian claim but said we have 
nothing on that the search is still under way 
carlucci described as foolhardy behavior irans decision to 
escalate the fighting he said he assumed the attacks could only be 
explained as stemming from fanaticism 
carlucci said three of the small iranian craft were attacked by 
a navy a6 intruder jet after observing them attack commercial 
vessels and oil rigs off the coast of the united arab emirates 
that confrontation occurred around 730 am edt carlucci said 
or about 6 hours after us forces attacked the iranian offshore 
platforms 
navy jets were assigned to patrol the area after reports were 
received indicating an american commercial boat the willi tide 
had been attacked carlucci said 
asked if he were surprised by the iranian decision to confront 
us forces directly the secretary replied i wouldnt use the 
word surprised because the iranians have been known to engage in 
this kind of frankly foolhardy behavior before 
the national association of arab americans said in washington 
that it regretted the rising violence in the gulf but that the 
us military response was appropriate in light of our vital 
security interests and irans continued belligerence 
the stakes are very high and the us cannot permit iran to 
impede the free flow of oil in the gulf association president 
george moses said in a statement 
there were no immediate indications of american or iranian 
casualties from mondays fighting 
the incident was the second such outbreak of violence since the 
united states began escorting oil tankers through the gulf last 
july to protect them from attack from the warring parties in the 
7year iraniraq war 
on oct 19 a raid was staged in retaliation to a missile attack 
on a kuwaiti ship flying the us flag in which 18 americans were 
injured two iranian oil platforms were destroyed in what reagan at 
the time termed a prudent response 
at the state department spokesman charles redman said monday 
that the united states sent a message to iran warning that any 
further provocation or hostile iranian military or terrorist 
action against us personnel or targets will receive a firm us 
response 
the message said the mine explosion that damaged the roberts had 
followed repeated warnings by the united states to iran about the 
consquences of placing mines in international waters of the persian 
gulf 
redman said that before mondays retaliatory action the united 
states had notified britain france italy the netherlands and 
belgium of its intentions all have naval vessels in the gulf 
others including the soviet union were notified at the time the 
action commenced he said 
democratic and republican congressional leaders said they felt 
reagans actions were fully justified several said they were 
pleased that reagan consulted with them on sunday night before 
acting 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva said the 
iranians were carrying out terrorist acts i support the 
decision to destroy the iranian oil drilling platforms 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said he hoped that 
irans revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini gets 
that message so we can all avoid further bloodshed and violence 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater talking to reporters in 
the early morning hours had said reagan acted only after the 
united states gathered conclusive evidence that iran was 
responsible for the mining of the roberts 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said the white house 
discussions were very frank and that the congressional leaders 
pointed out the perils as well as the possible benefits of military 
action 
but wright said of reagan he is the commander in chief and 
when action is taken by the united states it certainly behooves 
all of us to close ranks and to give the world a view of a nation 
that is united 
democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson voiced criticism 
of the operation however telling reporters in new york that the 
fighting with iran raised fresh questions about us policy in the 
region

democrat michael dukakis dashing across new 
york monday on the eve of the states primary state backed off on 
an initial statement calling the us attack on iranian oil 
platforms a measured response 
the massachusetts governor declined to comment on the middle 
east developments at two news conferences he held during a long day 
of campaigning 
but aides confirmed that he had told one reporter early in the 
day that he considered the us move a measured response 
late in the day dukakis declined to meet with reporters on his 
campaign plane who wanted to question him about the initial 
statement sending aides instead 
madeleine albright his senior foreign policy adviser said 
dukakis altered his position on the initial attack because of 
subsequent events 
in exchanges that continued throughout the day on monday 
american forces destroyed two of irans persian gulf oil platforms 
sank or damaged four attack boats and disabled two frigates that 
fired missiles at american planes us officials reported 
the feeling was that so many pieces of this story were hard to 
put together that it was hard to figure out what the whole story 
was and so he felt he didnt want to continue with the initial 
statement albright said 
asked whether dukakis stood by the early statement she said 
a combination of several series of escalations make one question 
whether it was an appropriate reaction 
dukakis would not come to the rear of his airplane to meet with 
reporters to explain the situtation when questioned by a reporter 
getting off his airplane in new york monday night he referred 
questions to press secretary mark gearan 
during the day dukakis who has been accused by rival albert 
gore jr of inexperience in foreign policy matters talked with 
aides about the situation in the persian gulf but said little 
about the subject 
we just dont have sufficient information for me to comment on 
whats happened in the middle east in the last few days and it 
would just be inappropriate for me to comment he said 
he continued to avoid the issue and spoke with extreme caution 
to reporters aboard his plane on middle east questions including 
about reports that israel was behind the slaying of a palestine 
liberation organization official in tunisia 
asked if he would consider such an assassination morally wrong 
he said i dont want to answer hypotheticals on that i dont 
have the facts 
dukakis spent monday making stops in major television markets in 
a bid to get maximum exposure just before new yorks important 
democratic presidential primary late polls showed him leading 
jesse jackson and far ahead of gore 
just dont forget to vote tomorrow he told workers at the 
american brass co in buffalo where he spoke to workers on the 
floor of the brass mill 
if we can win tomorrow with your help were going to be on 
our way to the nomination and i have no doubt that the democratic 
nominee for the presidency is going to beat george bush in 
november he said 
aides continued to suggest the race in new york was tightening 
between dukakis and jackson although dukakis told reporters im 
always optimistic 
from buffalo he flew back to manhattan and a noontime crowd in 
the heart of the financial district with cousin olympia dukakis 
the oscarwinning actress 
dukakis made appearances in syracuse where he called for 
greater drug education efforts and rochester where he told a 
college crowd that voter turnout was the key on tuesday 
olympia dukakis mentioned by her cousin at nearly every 
campaign stop used greek to praise the massachusetts governor to a 
crowd gathered on a drizzly day in the small nassau street mall 
near wall street 
shes given us our battle cry lets go mike he said 
paraphrasing her words at the academy awards ceremony a week ago 
dukakis compared himself to john kennedy as a son of 
massachusetts running for president and said history is going to 
repeat itself in 1988 
dukakis visited buffalo two days after throwing out a ceremonial 
first pitch which landed in the dirt in front of the batters box 
at a buffalo bisons minor league baseball game saturday in the 
citys new outdoor baseball stadium back on monday he called the 
ball park a terrifc example of buffalo coming back and adressed 
local hopes to land a bigleague team 
i cant make this as a commitment but i want to say this to 
you if michael dukakis is elected president ill do what i can to 
get a major league team to buffalo dukakis said 
at the american brass co plant he praised cooperation between 
labor and management following a buyout by management 
he repeated his support for federal legislation as in 
massachusetts requiring notice before plants are closed

federal aviation administration officials began 
inspecting continental airlines planes monday extending an 
investigation that began last week with eastern airlines 
continental and eastern are subsidiaries of texas air corp 
which is under investigation by the transportation department to 
determine if its management and finances meet federal standards 
also monday credit analysts indicated they might downgrade 
about 13 billion of texas air and continental airlines debt 
because of recent financial losses and the transportation 
department investigation among other things 
texas air had record losses of 466 million last year including 
241 million at eastern texas air chairman frank lorenzo has been 
seeking major cost concessions from easterns union but the unions 
so far have resisted 
no significant inspectionrelated flight delays were reported 
monday in the 351plane continental system said company spokesman 
bruce hicks 
and in miami eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said she had 
not heard of any major problems with that carrier 
the inspectors were too busy to talk to reporters other faa 
officials said they are doing their job they are too 
preoccupied said faa spokesman dick stafford in washington 
during an appearance sunday on nbcs meet the press 
transportation secretary jim burnley said the department had 
inspected about 200 of easterns 267 aircraft and grounded 19 of 
them 
burnley said the continental and eastern inspections would be 
very similar 
well have people wholl be walking around the planes and 
through them and talking to the maintenance personnel and the folks 
in the cockpit and making sure that anything that can be readily 
identified is correct burnley said 
faa officials had no more uptodate figures monday on 
inspections of eastern planes nor of continental inspections 
lorenzo said on meet the press that the company has been 
trying to adjust to the marketplace rigors of deregulation and has 
said easterns unions are out just to tear the airline down 
he said continental would cooperate with the inspection just as 
eastern has done 
standard amp poors placed texas air and continental airlines debt 
on its special credit watch monday standard amp poors said 
financial losses recent court rulings and the federal 
investigation may hinder texas airs ability to win wage 
concessions from eastern employees 
at the end of 1987 texas air and its operating units held about 
850 million in cash and marketable securities and were not 
expected to have trouble meeting debt maturities this year 
standard amp poors said 
while texas airs corporate structure insulates the parent 
company somewhat from financial problems at its subsidiaries 
further delays in resolving easterns labor problems or continued 
financial losses at continental could affect texas airs longterm 
ability to compete standard amp poors said 
we are trying to present the situation as accurately as we 
can said philip baggaley spokesman for standard amp poors 
so far eastern has been slapped with 823000 in fines for 
violating safety regulations on sunday burnley said the 
transportation department found nearly 1 million in violations by 
continental during a review of the carriers files 
burnley said continental had been notified of the penalties and 
the airline was considering whether to pay them voluntarily 
burnley said 
in addition to continental and eastern texas air owns rocky 
mountain airways britt airways bar harbor airlines and 
provincetownboston airlines

a candidate for the state senate 
abandoned his vigil on a bridge he said was threatened by erosion 
and pulled out of the race monday saying his protest had turned 
attention away from the bridge 
i dont want to take away from the problem down here dan 
lawrence said as he announced he would support his rival for the 
senate state sen marc basnight lawrence is a republican and 
basnight a democrat 
i dont want even one person to feel that this was done as a 
political stunt to detract from the great need we have to save 
this bridge and save this island he said 
lawrence started his vigil friday by chaining himself to a 
catwalk that adjoins the 2mile herbert bonner bridge the only 
link between the northern end of the outer banks and hatteras 
island 
he said he had not anticipated the problems that plagued his 
protest which included poor weather and a death threat on sunday 
night following the threat lawrence returned for a short time 
sunday night before going back to the bridge for the final hours of 
his vigil 
im giving up folks im going home my family has suffered a 
lot he said i cant take it anymore im hungry 
lawrence was concerned that the onslaught of the atlantic ocean 
would lead to further erosion that would not only eat away at the 
coastline but undermine bridge supports state department of

collapse and that periodic checks of the supports are made to 
ensure that any damage can be repaired as soon as possible

michael dukakis predicted monday he would post a 
great victory in the new york primary that would place him 
firmly on the road to the democratic presidential nomination but 
jesse jackson and albert gore jr exhorted their supporters to 
deliver a polldefying upset 
in its final 24 hours the campaign was nothing if not blunt 
new york mayor ed koch a gore supporter who has sharply criticized 
jackson in recent days was branded a lunatic by jacksons 
campaign manager 
jackson said kochs comments about him have not been good for 
the city or the campaign he also said the atmosphere in the 
primary campaign has become so divisive and so violent that he 
is getting more death threats than at any time in his presidential 
campaign 
jackson who generally receives more threats than the other 
candidates travels with very tight security 
jackson meanwhile went into the new york contest a winner he 
beat out dukakis in monday nights democratic caucuses in delaware 
taking 45 percent to dukakis 27 percent gore was a distant third 
with 2 percent 
dukakis the leader in all the preelection polls steered well 
clear of the jacksongorekoch hostilities but he caused a flap 
when he refused to meet with reporters to discuss his earlymorning 
comment to one reporter that the us action in the persian gulf as 
a measured response 
on monday in a series of engagements american forces destroyed 
two of irans persian gulf oil platforms sank or damaged four 
attack boats and disabled two frigates that fired missiles at 
american planes us officials reported 
at appearances throughout the day dukakis said too little was 
known about the situation for him to comment when reporters on his 
campaign plane learned of his initial remark and wanted to talk to 
dukakis about it he dispatched an aide to tell them the early 
comment had been outdated by events in the gulf 
just dont forget to vote tomorrow the massachusetts 
governor told an audience in buffalo as he barnstormed through the 
final day of a costly contentious primary campaign marked by 
racial and religious divisions 
jackson running second to dukakis in the public opinion polls 
staged three getoutthevote rallies in soggy harlem if you 
will stand in the rain today you will vote in the rain 
tomorrowweve come too close nothing can stop us now he said 
the late preelection polls gave dukakis a lead over jackson 
measured in double digits with gore a distant third but even so 
the pollsters fretted 
nobody can predict for sure what the final combination of 
blacks jews hispanics and white catholics will be said abc 
news pollster john brennan we could all be wrong new york is a 
killer 
gore struggling for survival in the democratic race sought to 
place some distance between himself and the critical comments made 
by koch the mayor is speaking for himself the tennessee 
senator said as the two men campaigned side by side 
on the final rounds of a milliondollar campaign gore endorsed 
president reagans decision to take military action against iran in 
the persian gulf he said the administration has every right to 
do what it did 
koch was asked repeatedly about his weekend comments criticizing 
jackson im not saying hes a liar im saying he cant stand 
stress and then he lies under stress he said 
he later said that if nominated jackson would lead the 
democratic party to its worst defeat since the republican 
landslide year of 1972 
in a speech to the nonpartisan association for a better new 
york jackson never mentioned koch by name but referred to those 
who are inclined because of their fears to be bent toward 
hysteria 
he went on leaders must set a high moral tone i will not 
surrender that tone to diversions 
but his campaign manager gerald austin was less diplomatic 
koch is a lunatic by new york standards he is a lunatic he 
said 
new york gov mario cuomo who has spoken warmly of all three 
contenders but endorsed no one weighed in from albany saying that 
kochs tactic of attacking jesse jacksons character might 
boomerang cuomo said he felt gore chances had been hurt in new 
york because the tennessee senator has been obscured by negative 
smoke going up from attacks on others 
while most eyes were on new york and the 255 democratic national 
convention delegates at stake in the primary delaware democrats 
began the process of selecting 15 delegates to the party convention 
next summer 
on the republican side nomineeforsure george bush spent the 
day campaigning in ohio which holds its primary on may 3 asked 
about the air raid against gulf platforms he said our people 
understand it is appropriate to have a proper response when our 
obligation is protection of sea lanes the vice president has no 
active opposition for the gop nomination 
dukakis leads the competition for democratic national convention 
delegates with 872 compared with 738 for jackson and 417 for gore 
with 2082 needed for nomination 
he has scored consecutive primary victories in connecticut and 
wisconsin and caucus triumphs in colorado and arizona in the past 
few weeks and is looking for a new york victory to certify him as 
the frontrunner and prohibitive favorite in the democratic race 
were looking forward to a great victory tomorrow here in the 
state of new york and were going to get it he said in buffalo 
if we can win here tomorrow with your help were going to be 
on our way to the nomination and i have no doubt that the 
democratic nominee for the presidency is going to beat george bush 
in november he said from there he traveled to new york for a 
rally with cousin olympia dukakis who was awarded an oscar last 
week for her role in the movie moonstruck 
turnout was the big unknown in efforts to predict the outcome on 
tuesday and jackson spent the last full day of campaigning trying 
to keep enthusiasm high 
the three democrats also offered differing responses to the 
administration military action in the persian gulf 
jackson said the early morning fighting with iran raised new 
questions about us policy he said the weapons used against 
american troops were no doubt sold iran illegally by the 
reaganbush administration 
gore said based on the facts presently available i think the 
response was an appropriate one it was a proportionate response

for the first time a soviet journal has printed a 
letter written by albert einstein 40 years ago in response to 
criticism by soviet scientists 
in the letter included in the april 15 edition of the weekly 
new times the physicist called on the soviet union to join the 
united states in supporting international security measures for 
atomic weapons 
the editors of new times said in a note that they were 
publishing the letter because einsteins thoughts are unusually 
in keeping with our times 
they said soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev had noted that a 
mistake was allowed when we didnt heed einstein and likeminded 
people they warned that the world had amassed such force that a 
new approach was needed 
einstein who urged thenus president franklin delano 
roosevelt to explore the use of atomic energy for bombs was 
attacked by four soviet scientists in the nov 26 1947 edition of 
new times but his response was not published 
soviet dictator josef v stalin was in power at the time and 
his government kept dissident opinions out of the press 
gorbachevs police of glasnost or openness has encouraged 
a more honest assessment of past mistakes and freer expression 
about reforming soviet society 
einstein said in his response that to guard against war a world 
government should be created to ensure that global and not national 
interests were dominant he said the soviet union and united states 
should put aside their ideological differences and work together 
for peace 
isnt it truly unavoidable because of our fright and inherited 
habits that we are doomed to destroy one another so that nothing 
will be left to preserve he said 
doesnt that mean that all our disagreements and differences 
of opinion which we touched on in our strange exchange of letters 
are insignificantly minute compared to the danger threatening all 
of us

after admitting he put words in president 
reagans mouth while serving him as white house spokesman larry 
speakes has lost his job as chief spokesman for merrill lynch amp co 
the popular assumption for his resignation from the securities 
firm is that such an admission would make less credible his future 
statements on its behalf and perhaps tarnish its image as well 
but creating statements for the top guy has a long tradition in 
the world of business 
it is practiced every day without exception and it is likely to 
continue in practice it has been used to protect the inarticulate 
chairman to promote an image that is inconsistent with the facts 
to impress viewers and listeners 
public relations executives regularly issue statements they 
attribute to the chief but which they themselves drafted and 
sold to the executive before issuing to the media 
few chief executives write their own speeches seldom do they 
sit at a typewriter and knock out the magazines articles that 
appear under their names few are capable of writing a bestselling 
book 
in fact professor eugene jennings a business scholar and 
adviser to top executives commented recently that one item found 
in most offices but not in that of the corporate chief executive 
is a simple everyday dictionary 
even the company presidents message to shareholders that 
staple of every annual report is likely to have been drafted by a 
writer assigned to the task with an eye on history even corporate 
memos have been ghostwritten 
real estate publications carry advertisements of ghostwriters 
who offer weekly columns of housing information designed for 
publication under the real estate agents name as either 
advertising or editorial matter 
one ghostwriter advertisement in realtor news aimed at real 
estate agents seeking to develop their business carries the 
customer endorsement that your columns have paid back almost 100 
for every dollar invested 
newsletters proliferate under the logotype of local merchants 
especially those who sell directly to consumers some of them are 
highly personalized to project a certain image of the person which 
might or might not be accurate 
there is an easy explanation for all this writing often takes 
too much time and effort an executive who tried to write his or 
her own material might lose sight of the bigger job which is to 
manage the company properly 
but there are other reasons too among them 
words can be misconstrued so they must be chosen carefully 
words chosen carefully can turn a negative into a positive 
wellchosen words can make neat memorable quotes helping to get 
the executives message across to the public 
but in most instances there is a big difference between what 
happens in the business world of ghostwritten words and what 
occurred at the white house level and got speakes into trouble 
invariably wise executives review material issued in their 
name because it is they who must stand behind it should they 
attempt to blame the writer they would immediately reveal 
themselves as inadequate to their position 
speakes concedes that on two occasions president reagan never 
got to see his own material

editors note there are some 5000 socalled orphan 
diseases affecting an estimated 20 million americans these are 
the rare diseases that have failed to attract the millions of 
research dollars needed to find cures or treatments because 
individually they afflict relatively few people but victims of 
orphan diseases can now find help through the national organization 
for rare disorders 
</TEXT>

abbey meyers knows the suffering and 
frustration that accompanies rare diseases that are often neglected 
by drug manufacturers 
her three children suffer from tourette syndrome a disorder 
characterized by involuntary muscular movements and vocal noises 
in 1979 when her oldest son was 12 he received an experimental 
drug that halted the symptoms when it was announced that 
production of the drug was to be halted meyers launched a 
letterwriting campaign 
in 1980 she founded the national organization for rare 
disorders based in new fairfield her efforts enabled her son and 
other children to continue to receive the drug 
nords goal is to help people suffering from the socalled 
orphan diseases those rare ailments that have failed to 
attract the millions of research dollars needed to find cures or 
treatments because individually they afflict relatively few people 
an orphan disease is one that afflicts less than 200000 people 
there are 5000 such diseases affecting an estimated 20 million 
americans according to nord 
but the orphan diseases have started to attract greater interest 
in recent years thanks in part to the efforts of nord 
nord is a clearinghouse for information on rare diseases it 
also makes referrals to rare disease support groups and works to 
encourage development of drugs to treat rare diseases 
the nonprofit group began as an informal coalition of health 
agencies and individuals it incorporated in 1983 and opened its 
office in 1985 it now has six fulltime workers and an annual 
budget of about 250000 
the public told us what they wanted us to be otherwise we 
would have remained an informal group says meyers the nord 
executive director 
the organization has information on 1500 of the diseases 
interested people can obtain information through the mail or by 
linking up with a computer data base run by nord through compuserve 
in columbus ohio 
people tell us their symptoms meyers says but we cant 
help people unless they have a diagnosis they must have a name for 
their diseases 
meyers says the rarest disease may be severe combined immune 
deficiency of which there are 27 known cases a person afflicted 
with this disease has no immunity to disease like the texas boy 
who lived in a plastic bubble 
cystinosis is a genetic kidney disorder that affects about 70 
children those afflicted with the disease used to die before their 
10th birthday but now live longer due to a new drug 
generally meyers says rarest diseases are those known as 
recessive hereditary disorders these diseases result only when 
both parents have defective genes resulting in a oneinfour 
chance that an offspring will suffer a rare ailment 
perhaps the most widespread of the recessive disorders is cystic 
fibrosis which affects 20000 people 
nord uses medical librarians and others who read medical 
journals and then rewrite the information on diseases in language 
that lay people can understand it doesnt have researchers of its 
own doing any work on rare disorders 
we do everything we can in ways that cost the least meyers 
says 
the organization also is actively involved in helping the 
federal drug administration and pharmaceutical companies work 
together to develop drugs for rare diseases that effort got a 
boost with the 1983 passage of the orphan drug act which provides 
tax incentives to companies that develop drugs for orphan diseases 
the law also provided 4 million this year for research grants 
the drug companies previously ignored orphan diseases because 
its expensive to develop new drugs and because the market wasnt 
large enough to produce big profits it can cost up to 80 million 
to develop a new drug according to nord 
if theres a problem that crops up along the way well act as 
an intermediary meyers says 
to date the faa has approved 183 orphan drug programs and 23 
have resulted in medications ready for the market the drawback to 
the program is that these drugs are generally expensive for 
instance it costs about 10000 a year to supply a child suffering 
from dwarfism with a growth hormone 
the growth hormone price has remained high even though it has 
become more popular than imagined the drug is apparently being 
used by some athletes to build muscles meyers says the drug has 
found a black market because it cant be detected like steroids 
which are illegal in sports competitions 
nord also is planning to fund its own clinical research program 
later this year the organization has raised 80000 to get its 
effort moving and meyers says shes looking to get good research 
going in areas where no other research is going 
weve got to get ideas out of test tubes and into patient 
clinical research she says

editors note in a music teachers class at carnegie mellon 
university students keep an ear to the ground and its surprising 
what they hear as they write diaries describing the sounds they 
pick up they reveal a lot about themselves 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the sighs of students failing a test the 
whoosh of swimmers underwater the drone of fluorescent lights the 
thunk of a soft drink machine dispensing a can 
everyday sounds usually go unnoticed but a carnegie mellon 
university music professor is using them to help her students 
develop the ear sensitivity crucial to musicians 
associate professor marilyn taft thomas asked the 44 freshmen in 
her awareness of sound classes to compile sound diaries 
the students were told to take note of striking sounds and describe 
them in a notebook 
ms thomas was startled at the results she not only had 
collections of sounds but snapshots of the lives of freshmen 
have you ever heard people failing a test wrote melinda 
klump 18 of saginaw mich its really amazingall over the 
room are these sighs of exasperation and resignationits a very 
frustrating sound to hear even if you think youre making passing 
noises 
paul lu 19 of allentown visited a refinery and reported 
very loud steam hissing control signals beeping dump truck 
windy messy hydraulic pump feet on metal stairs do i really 
want to be a chemical engineer 
the objective of the assignment was to develop the students 
ability to listen more acutely and more critically to everyday 
sounds as well as to musical performances ms thomas says 
but it did much more than that it captured a very important 
transition in the lives of a group of young people 
serious students of music develop hearing so sensitive they can 
recognize individual notes in recordings of musical pieces ms 
thomas says 
i was trying to find new ways to actually open them to 
sound she says the diaries seemed like at least something 
that would cause them to focus on what they were listening to 
improved listening skills also can be important in other areas 
of life she says while teaching a pittsburgh antipoverty program 
in the 1960s ms thomas used music to improve ear sensitivity in 
preschoolers 
what we had to do first was open their ears she says 
kids who lived in very crowded environments had learned to close 
out sound to the point that their biggest problems when they 
started school was not listening and not knowing how to listen 
they had made a physical adjustment to survive in a very 
crowded noisy environment its the only way you can cope 
ms thomas says she knew her experiment was working when her 
carnegie mellon students became bored with the same obvious 
sounds every day and began to describe more subtle ones in 
greater and greater detail 
after walking through a university building miss klump wrote 
the coke machine in mudge hall is stubborn you put your money 
in and it makes this huge selfabusing collage of clanks before it 
gives you a coke as if it hurts to give one up 
after missing sleep for several nights to study she wrote i 
havent slept for four days everything sounds really strangeall 
the sounds are like im not really hereim in a bubble 
in another diary a freshman from rural massachusetts marveled 
at how different the cacophony of city sounds are from peaceful 
country sounds after not hearing from her little brother for a 
month she also rejoiced over the sound of his voice over the 
telephone 
underwater everything is magnified and distorted wrote 
susan shimel 19 of seneca sc movement from other swimmers 
air exhaled and bubbling to the surface to escape 
constant drone of fluorescent lights similar toa huge 
insect miss shimel wrote 
silence seemed scarce ms thomas said kids often 
mentioned missing it

puerto rican actor raul julia who portrays 
aristotle onassis in a new abc miniseries says he thinks the greek 
shipping magnate got the idea for his first fortune at the movies 
the richest man in the world the story of aristotle onassis 
tells how onassis made his first millions in tobacco and then 
bought six aging tankers that he eventually turned into an empire 
the fourhour miniseries which will be telecast on sunday and 
monday also chronicles onassis tempestuous love affair with opera 
star maria callas and his marriage to jacqueline kennedy widow of 
president john f kennedy 
julia takes over the role when onassis is 35 and is about to 
make the transition from tobacco importer to shipping magnate 
young aristo is played by elias koteas 
he was a selfmade man who left greece when he was in his 
early 20s with 250 and went to buenos aires julia says he 
sold ties on the street and worked as a telephone operator then he 
got the idea i think from watching a rudolph valentino film of 
making cigarettes for women 
onassis began importing turkish tobacco into argentina by ship 
when he learned how much money the ship owners were making he 
bought six old tankers at a bargain julia says then he found 
the shipping business was like a closed fraternity he had to marry 
into one of the great greek shipping families to make a go of it 
onassis first wife was tina livanos played by beatie edney 
daughter of stavros livanos played by anthony zerbe they had two 
children before the marriage ended in divorce tina remarried twice 
before she died 
julia says the marriage was an example of onassis determination 
to win at any cost 
he was a man who would stop at nothing to get what he 
wanted he says he was very persuasive very charming he knew 
how to manipulate people into doing his wishes he was very 
cunningabsolutely ruthless 
jane seymour also stars as maria callas and francesca annis 
plays jacqueline kennedy anthony quinn plays onassis father 
socrates and quinns son lorenzo quinn portrays aristotles only 
son alexander anthony quinn played a thinly disguised version of 
onassis in a 1978 movie the greek tycoon 
ari and maria had a very stormy passionate affair julia 
says they were both greek they loved each other madly and they 
fought as madly as they loved they never married they were both 
married to someone else i would say it lasted until he died even 
after he married jackie he saw her several times 
julia says onassis also had had another passionate affair with a 
swedish woman but we dont show that in the picture 
when she was in her 80s before she died she told a writer 
she still loved onassis he says 
onassis sometimes treated his women cruelly and had no 
consideration of their feelings julia says yet they still loved 
him to the end 
this is julias first television role since he played 
mussolinis soninlaw in the 1986 nbc miniseries mussolini the 
untold story 
prior to onassis he was in brazil for moon over 
parador a paul mazursky comedy in which he plays a latin 
american strongman who forces an american actor richard dreyfuss 
to pose as the countrys dictator he doesnt want the people to 
know that the dictator has died it sounds like a comedy version of 
the prisoner of zenda but julia says its more like danny 
kayes the inspector general 
julia has another movie coming out this summer called the 
penitents which was written and directed by character actor 
cliff osmond its about a mexican farmer who helps recreate the 
passion of christ during lent which leads to a crucifixion it 
also tells of the farmers conflict with his wife who is still a 
virgin 
julia a native of puerto rico lives in new york where he is 
closely associated with the theater he is married and has two sons 
he is a fourtime tony nominee for nine threepenny 
opera wheres charley and two gentlemen of verona his

in the new broadway drama m butterfly bd 
wong plays a star of the beijing opera a graceful charming and 
sensuous woman who seduces a french diplomat 
before the third act begins the 25yearold actor sits on stage 
in front of the audience takes off his makeup and emerges as a 
brash aggressive and embittered man 
the metamorphosis is one of the most astonishing performances on 
broadway this season 
what makes it more bizarre is that the story is based on real 
life the diplomat played in m butterfly by john lithgow 
believed he was enamored of a real woman because of wongs 
performance many theatergoers believe the same thing 
for wong who is making his broadway debut in m butterfly 
the success of the show has been particularly satisfying 
after graduating from high school he moved to new york from 
california but never got a break on broadway wong gave up after 
two years and took up television and film work in los angeles 
the potential of m butterfly written by david henry hwang 
lured him back to new york last year wong got a copy of the script 
on a monday and by the following thursday he was flying to new york 
to audition on money borrowed from his parents 
i didnt even read the whole script before i said i have to 
go he recalls after three auditions he got the part but 
rehearsals were delayed several months until lithgow completed a 
film the play finally opened in march at the eugene oneill 
theater 
wong wasnt deterred by appearing on stage as a woman 
i didnt buy into the stigma of playing a woman because i 
dont understand that stigma he says whats the big deal a 
woman is a person and this woman is a person with incredible depth 
and possibilities why not accept that as a great challenge 
plus the third act of the play is written very strongly he 
adds the impression youre left with is not a man playing a 
woman youre left with something that bangs against the two 
extremes 
before rehearsals started in january wong read books on chinese 
theater china during the cultural revolution and female 
psychology director john dexter even gave him the french writer 
colette to read 
everything you read gives insight into what youre doing 
the actor says 
i feel like ive pretty much eliminated the middle man i 
dont play him playing her i play her and i play him that is 
because the play is written in the realm of this mans 
imagination says wong referring to the character lithgow plays 
so what he sees is the most womanly most perfect vision of his 
woman 
to perfect that vision the actor also trained with jamie hj 
guan a former member of the beijing opera who also appears in 
m butterfly 
i got 20 years of beijing opera training in two weeks wong 
says there were exercises for my lower back and legs and a lot 
of work to get my body in good physical shape 
the role was more of a challenge vocally he says 
i worked with a vocal coach who coached me in a lot of the 
dialogue wong says we experimented with a lot of different 
voices a lot of different approaches to the way she spoke 
wong whose father recently retired from a post office job grew 
up in san francisco the middle son in a chineseamerican family 
i was the one who wanted to be an artist he says i 
always wanted to make things i wasnt interested in math or more 
practical things like my older brother who is a doctor in seattle 
wong seriously discovered theater while in junior high school 
he was in many school extravaganzas of old broadway musicals as 
well as community theater and semiprofessional productions 
my dad was always very supportive of my interest in culture 
he says for my parents to realize that i wanted to be an actor 
or an artist was something that was different but they turned 
around and for the last seven years have been so supportive thats 
the most gratifying thing about the work now you see their pride 
in it 
after graduating from high school wong went to san francisco 
state for about 20 minutes before moving to new york and then 
to los angeles he trained privately and not in any acting school 
preferring to learn from practical experience on stage 
california brought him small roles on television series like 
simon and simon and shell game as well as the movie the 
karate kid ii and the west coast engagement of the musical 
mail 
for now hes decided to settle down with m butterfly for 
what could be a long run 
i am an actor for certain reasons and the reasons are all 
fulfilled by this play wong says you are an actor to play 
interesting roles and to move an audience in a certain way what 
more could you possibly ask for than to have a role like this

editors note the government projects that by the turn of the 
century 1 million american farms will fail those that survive 
will be those that adapt to a changing market and new technology 
heres a look at whats going on down on the farm today and whats 
likely in store for the future

kurt alstede of chester nj grows everything from asparagus 
to zucchini on 500 acres of prime farmland that is also prime real 
estate an hours drive from manhattan these fertile fields are 
beyond the means of most people 
including kurt alstede 
no problem because of a state law that greatly reduces taxes on 
productive farmland a number of morris county property owners are 
willing to let alstede farm their land rentfree some even pay him 
not owning a farm hasnt hurt him a bit in fact the state 
department of agriculture recently named the 24yearold 
firstgeneration farmer outstanding young farmer of the year 
theres still strong viable agriculture in new jersey but 
its a different sort of agriculture says alstede a different 
sort of farmer 
in fresno county calif 3000 miles from alstedes retail farm 
market pete degroot along with his father and brother owns a 
dairy thats roughly 20 times the size of the typical american 
dairy farm 
milking 1900 cows enables the degroots to take advantage of 
economies of scale a crucial edge in an industry where as fresno 
county agent craig thomas puts it you either get bigger or you 
get out 
pete degroot 38 is a different sort of farmer too 
he neither milks cows nor drives tractors traditional farm 
chores are performed by his 20 fulltime employees degroot who 
has a degree in economics and business spends his time doing 
paperwork or meeting with lawyers or accountants in a coat and 
tie he says not in overalls 
on their opposite coasts with their vastly different styles 
pete degroot and kurt alstede actually have much in common they 
embody a growing trend in agriculture farmers who like other 
endangered species survive even thrive by adapting their 
methods to suit their surroundings 
they do it through a variety of methods including astute market 
research and creative risktaking diversification and direct 
marketing 
degroots large milkshed and alstedes small diverse crop farm 
also point the way to the two opposite poles in which farms may be 
headed 
over the next 20 years agriculture experts predict farming 
will move one step forward and one step back forward because 
dwindling profit margins for dairy poultry beef and hog farmers 
will force big specialized operations to grow bigger and more 
specialized still back because for small operations like 
alstedes diversity and direct marketing will be critical 
the trend toward more and more smaller farmers and 
megafarms will continue says mike brown director of the us 
department of agricultures southcentral family farm research 
center in boonville ark 
the usda projects that by the turn of the century 1 million 
american farms will fail most will be midsized operations that are 
neither large enough to make up for falling profit margins with 
economies of scale nor small enough to respond quickly to 
fluctuating commodity prices 
for small farmers who hope to survive into the next century 
brown says the wave of the future may well be a page from the past 
our grandparents were diversified he says the farmer 
sold milk and wheat and his wife sold eggs in town nobody worried 
about making a killing over the years they concentrated on 
keeping fluid 
as we look to the future we will readopt that philosophy of 
diversification therell be smaller profits per enterprise but 
with more winners than losers 
brown predicts there will be more people farming on the 
side turning some of their attention to profitable enterprises 
that help support the high cost of farming 
such is the case of richard kind a slippery rock pa dairy 
farmer who three years ago transformed a chunk of his 500acre farm 
into a coal mine 
western pennsylvania has lots of lowsulfur coal close to the 
surface says kind strip miners have been interested in the 
land for 30 years or longer but we never wanted to strip we were 
always afraid they wouldnt put it back right 
in 1970 kind sold his small dairy and pieced together his 
current place from the remains of a halfdozen former cattle farms 
with two sons about to join him in business he needed to expand 
the new place needed work a modern dairy barn and silos had to 
be built and a new well needed to be dug kind took out a 250000 
mortgage at the time interest rates were 6 percent he says 
they went up to 16 we paid it down very slowly and paid heavy 
interest 
he began talking to other property owners whod had their land 
stripped and he studied their reclaimed property the turning point 
came when the mcknight coal co offered kind use of land on another 
farm during mining 
in 1985 kind agreed to allow the coal company to strip 125 
acres 
at 3 a ton an acreinch of coal will run 125 to 140 tons 
kind says our coal ran near the crop line it ranged from 8 
inches to 22 inches thick and averaged 16 to 17 inches wide

<TEXT>
with mining just eight months away from completion kind says 
hes pleased with the quality of his reclaimed land best of all 
he says the coal paid off the mortgage well have a debtfree 
farm when we finish 
as more farmland is lost to development many farmers are 
finding themselves devoting more time and effort to educating new 
suburban neighbors 
more and more we have people from urban areas moving to rural 
areas people who move right next door to you then discover they 
dont like the smell of cow manure alstede says 
lack of respect for private farm property is a recurring 
problem lots of people help themselves to a picnic in your 
cornfield or theyll go fourwheeling or throw burger king 
wrappers out their car windows he says we spend more time 
along our roads picking up other peoples trash 
if farmers and suburbanites are going to coexist we have to 
promote our industry and educate people about what it takes to stay 
profitable if you want to preserve farmland and agriculture you 
have to preserve the atmosphere that allows it to be profitable if 
i cant make a living here i cant stay 
aesthetics are very important to alstede who sells his 
strawberries tomatoes and pumpkins at a hilltop farm stand 
overlooking the fields in which they were grown 
they sell vegetables at shoprite and mine arent always 
cheaper he says its the farm atmosphere that brings people 
to me 
theres little regard for aesthetics on the degroot farm there 
are no little red barns no silos no quaint clapboard house the 
larger betterrun dairies out here look very practical with open 
dirt corrals instead of barns metal pipe fences and outdoor feed 
bunks says county agent thomas 
doubling up two or more families on a single large farm was 
the survival strategy the degroots chose when 15 years ago they 
sold a 400cow dairy near los angeles and moved to fresno where 
lower property values meant more room to grow 
if all three of us were on smaller farms wed all have to do 
more physical labor pete degroot says on a larger farm you 
make less per cow and your labor costs are higher but it also will 
add up a bit more 
increasingly bigger numbers are crucial to keeping livestock 
farms profitable every time theres a price cut it brings down 
the profit per animal you have to keep adding beef swine or 
sheep theyve all gotten bigger says thomas 
bigger farms especially those in areas with cold winters and 
hot summers also will mean more animals being raised on concrete 
says norman steele animal researcher at the usdas beltsville 
md agricultural research center land values are up and time 
is money thus confinement steele says 
at beltsville and elsewhere researchers are developing vaccines 
to control the viral diseases more often seen in animals raised 
indoors theyre also harder to control than the parasitic diseases 
more common in animals raised on pastureland 
among the benefits to confinement are the ability it gives 
farmers to control each animals diet the key to increased 
production and higher profits 
todays cow already spends more time indoors than 25 years 
ago says robert graves a professor of agricultural engineering 
at penn state university we try to feed them the same every day 
and that doesnt fit well with pasture 
sending a cow off to pasture is like sending a kid off to buy 
his own lunch chances are hell buy all candy and forget about the 
carrots 
and land that can grow good pasture can probably be better used 
to grow valuable storage crops he says 
poultry farms like cattle and dairy farms will continue to 
grow the big news in poultry the debut of the turkey stud 
farm the legacy of usda poultry scientist thomas sextons 
pioneering work to improve the shelf life of turkey semen as a 
result fewer toms are needed for breeding making turkey meat 
cheaper and more plentiful 
more varied exotic produce and protein such as catfish shrimp 
and game birds will be another growing trend in a climate in which 
people will look at the markets before they look at the 
products says brown the family farm centers director 
industrial materials such as guayule a shrub used to make 
rubber and kenaf a fastgrowing plant used in the manufacture of 
newsprint could be among the crops of the future according to the 
usda whose cooperative state research service already has 
demonstration projects under way 
another promising research project on marylands eastern shore 
will eventually be expanded to a 30acre underwater farm that will 
produce 60000 tons of hybrid striped bass 
current research is designed to save farmers as well as farms 
according to graves who says tomorrows barns will feature 
mechanical guttercleaners and monorail carts that run around in 
front of the cows and dispense feed every four hours 
animals that are fed regularly can be more productive but you 
can get pretty tired of getting up every night to feed them these 
things arent flash gordon theyre possible and theyre already 
being done graves says 
farmers have tv sets too and they see how people who work 35 
hours a week live we cant promise them 40hour weeks but we can 
direct our efforts to help see to it the farmer of tomorrow has a 
better quality of life

a new breed of leaner fastergrowing 
designer livestock may soon take up residence in americas more 
fashionable barnyards 
the sheep pigs and cattle of tomorrow will be given daily 
supplements of growthregulating hormones synthetic versions of 
proteins that naturally occur in animals 
experiments at the us department of agricultures beltsville 
research center and elsewhere have shown that daily doses of the 
synthetic hormones add up to greater yields of milk and meat 
while they have not yet been approved by the food and drug 
administration for commercial use growth hormones have reduced 
fat increased yields of lean meat and improved feed efficiency in 
the laboratory 
administered to mature dairy cows growth hormones can increase 
milk production by 20 percent according to animal researcher 
norman steele 
on growing animals the effects are more dramatic when 
supplemented by increased dietary protein we can create longer 
bigger leaner animals steele says 
in one recent experiment involving two 66pound hogs the animal 
treated with growth hormones reached a goal weight of 130 pounds 
two weeks faster than his untreated brother at the end of the 
40day experiment the treated pig was 42 percent bigger 
he also was leaner it takes fewer calories to make a pound of 
lean meat than it does to make a pound of fat steele says the 
untreated hog required 26 pounds of feed per one pound of body 
weight gain the treated hog required 196 pounds of feed to gain a 
pound to a farmer that means a 30 percent increase in profits 
the news appears to be good for consumers as well its a 
natural product in people its digested and well produce more 
meat with less feed which could bring prices down says douglas 
bolt a usda research physiologist 
genetic engineering has enabled researchers to produce synthetic 
growth hormones at low prices so far daily injections are the 
only known way of administering growth hormones although the race 
is on among drug companies to develop a slowrelease delivery 
system 
steele and other scientists are now researching the dietary 
requirements of the new pig the latest in a series of 
streamlined models 
the effort to reduce fat and increase lean meat in hogs dates 
back to the emergence of vegetable oils which began replacing 
animals fats in americans diets in the 50s 
in addition to health considerations we realized that fat is 
a very inefficient way of using expensive feed steele says we 
now want that feed used to make meat 
efforts to rebuild the hog are among modern agricultural 
sciences greatest triumphs resulting in larger quantities of meat 
from animals whose longer leaner bodies now yield a bonus two 
additional pork chops and two extra ribs the result of an added 
vertebra 
commercial use of growth hormone in hogs could make the process 
complete making pork competitive with poultry both in price and 
nutrition says steele 
however there comes a point where you cant reduce fat 
anymore he acknowledges bacon doesnt fry up and its not 
very flavorful its also much harder to slice

editors note its a pawnbrokerage like no other where the 
word hock is a dirty word and all the profits go to charity 
for almost a century the provident loan society of new york has 
been a poor mans bank as its founders intended but its also 
helped some rich and famous people out of a jam 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the depression year of 1892 four decades 
after karl marx urged the workers of the world to unite in 
revolution alfred bishop mason urged the millionaires of new york 
to unite in pawnbroking 
i would have a pawnshop which would be the poor mans bank 
he wrote his fellow philanthropists where it shall not be shame 
and ruin to borrow and where loss of selfrespect shall not make a 
part of every pledge 
although pawnbroking was probably a vocation not previously 
contemplated by the likes of jp morgan and gustav schwab seven 
tycoons each put up 35000 to create the nations only nonprofit 
pawnbrokerage 
today the provident loan society of new york still has a morgan 
and a schwab on its board as always the borrower is treated with 
respect items are pledged never pawned and hock is a 
dirty word 
the provident still charges interest rates far lower than 
commercial pawnshops 23 percent annually compared to 36 percent 
and is as reputable and dependable as a bank 
but given its traditional aversion to publicity and its refusal 
to encourage borrowing the provident remains a wellkept secret 
maybe too well for the past two years the provident has run a 
deficit and had to forgo its traditional yearend contribution of 
profits to charity 
weve got to let more people know were here says samuel f 
pryor iii chairman of the board 
that never used to be a problem the providents sterling 
reputation attracted pledgors like these 
theodore dreiser evicted from his 150aweek room for 
nonpayment at the turn of the century pawned his watch for 25 
enough for shoes a hat and a hotel room he went on to get a job 
and write sister carrie and an american tragedy 
a drunken frank fay staggered in to offer a pair of 
starsapphire cuff links the actor needed money to check into a 
clinic and sober up to try out for a part in a play that was to 
open on broadway he got the loan entered the clinic and won the 
role in the play harvey the story of a drunk who sees an 
otherwise invisible 6foot rabbit 
newspaper heiress evalyn walsh mclean who pawned her star of 
the east diamond in 1932 to raise 50000 in an unsuccessful 
attempt to ransom the kidnapped child of aviator charles lindbergh 
she originally put up the hope diamond but the ultraconservative 
provident assessors decided the star was a safer bet if mrs mclean 
defaulted and the stone had to be auctioned 
the provident also was the place where tennis star bill tilden 
pawned bagfuls of silver championship trophies and king farouks 
queen put up her diamond tiara and matching necklace for 70000 
legend has it that olympian jim thorpe pledged two of his olympic 
gold medals there 
but the providents primary clientele has never been the rich or 
the celebrated 
in 1892 with destitution stalking many of the citys 25 
million people mason had envisioned a place where the poor 
mancould go when he has been robbed of his tools when he has 
been smitten with sickness or when he saw before him a chance of 
rising from man to master by borrowing a little capital to start a 
little shop 
or buy a little food in the era before welfare cash machines 
and credit cards many people needed credit for necessities but 
money panics periodically denied loans to the poor at all but 
ruinous rates 
two years after masons appeal the provident was created by 
special act of the state legislature morgan schwab cornelius 
vanderbilt and other incorporators advanced the operating capital 
with no assurance they would get it back 
that as it turned out was never in doubt because the 
provident was an immediate success all its operating capital had 
been loaned out four months after it opened and by the turn of the 
century it was loaning 100000 pledgors a total of 2 million 
annually 
the provident hit its peak in 1930 lending 44 million by the 
end of the depression 22 provident offices were together making 
about 750000 new loans a year one for every 10 new yorkers and 
more than all the citys licensed commercial pawnbrokers put 
together 
this was not surprising for the provident was as reputable and 
discreet as most pawnbrokers were sleazy and callous 
when looking for a site for a branch office the provident tried 
to find locations slightly off the beaten track to preserve 
borrowers privacy on the outside they looked like small 
classical temples inside they looked and felt like banks with 
chairs plants pictures on the wall all designed to instill 
confidence in the borrower who was leaving behind his strad or her 
engagement ring

eleven of the original 15 trustees died in office and today 
some of their descendants sit in the leather chairs they once 
occupied in the dark paneled board room in the societys stately 
headquarters at 24th street and park avenue south 
the society consists of 50 members who as a group do little 
more than choose 12 trustees the trustees in turn decide who 
will be admitted as a member 
robert mulreany the providents president says most of the 
members are people who know somebody who knows somebody 
socially or professionally about half of the members are on the 
social register a disproportionate number have gone to yale and a 
few have names like august belmont thomas e dewey jr and 
donaldson pillsbury 
occasionally there are other connections one trustee a 
successful financier had an ancestor who got through a tight spot 
with the aid of a provident loan 
although the provident is down to seven offices its role is 
more vital than ever since 1960 about 90 percent of the citys 
commercial pawnbrokers have gone out of business mostly because of 
inflation and volatile interest rates leaving only 15 survivors 
the park avenue pawnbroker remains the poor mans bank mason 
envisioned even though greater profit could be found in larger 
loans about twothirds of loans are 200 or less the typical 
pledgor is a middle or lowermiddle class wage earner often an 
immigrant 
some of the best customers are gypsies the king of one clan 
regularly pledges a 10pound belt made of gold coins soldered 
together redeeming it for ceremonial occasions 
but the provident will loan up to 15000 and it gets some 
upscale clients when the stock market plunged on oct 19 1987 
several harried investors appeared at the providents park avenue 
office mumbling about margin calls and offering gold or diamond 
jewelry for cash 
although the provident once accepted almost anything that could 
be stored and resold furs lps shotguns sewing machines today 
it mostly confines itself to items made of or containing gold 
silver diamonds or precious stones plus us stamps and coins 
mail business outside new york is discouraged 
when presented with an item a provident teller inspects it and 
offers a price because the provident can lose money if the item is 
not redeemed and must be auctioned the offer is very conservative 
usually only 20 percent of retail value 
if thats not enough the teller hands the item back with a 
smile if the customer accepts he receives a loan ticket written 
out by hand because the provident still is not computerized and 
given a year to pay off the loan with interest and reclaim the 
object 
unofficially the provident is a sucker for a sob story in 
emergencies branches may hand over a few dollars for an item such 
as a radio along with a recommendation that it be reclaimed as 
soon as possible 
if a loan is not repaid after a year the provident is entitled 
to auction the item but it tries to avoid doing so there are at 
least two written notices followed by attempts to reach the 
pledgor by telephone up to the date of the auction auctions have 
been halted with items on the block by lastminute calls from 
pledgors 
and if there is a compelling reason why the money is not 
available a lost job or prolonged illness the provident may 
hold onto an item for a few more months before auctioning it off 
only about 5 percent of items pledged at the provident are finally 
sold 
the pledgor is entitled to any auction profit exceeding the 
providents principal and interest if the pledgor cant be 
located the money is held by the state in perpetual escrow the 
providents own yearend surpluses which have totaled more than 4 
million since 1892 have gone to charities such as hospitals and 
child welfare agencies 
some items have been at the provident for years with the 
original pledgors or their descendants paying the annual interest 
charge 
for years a successful but superstitious businessman annually 
renewed the pledge of an overcoat hed pawned in his youth 
associating the original loan with the beginning of his rise 
since the 1930s the main office has been holding two violins 
whose owners now pay an annual fee of 23 cents to keep them stored 
but the providents greatest legacy is its tradition of service 
an example 
confronted with a request for a loan on a piccolo an appraiser 
in a provident branch telephoned a music store but the clerk there 
said he could not estimate the instruments value unless he knew 
how it sounded 
holding up the phone the appraiser asked the wouldbe pledgor 
an unemployed musician can you convince my friend that your 
piccolo is in working order 
the musician made the most of his chance playing the entire 
william tell overture when he was finished everyone 
tellers customers the clerk on the other end of the line burst 
into applause and he got his loan

10279 a day americans become part of a numbers game a 
bureaucracy of bean counters is watching what they do and dont do 
what they like and dont like some of the data are useful but 
does anyone really care that the most popular names for newborn 
nebraskans are katie and john

whether dieting or eating ice cream skipping school or 
studying getting married or getting divorced americans every day 
unwittingly become statistics 
it isnt done consciously of course but between government and 
private bureaucracies the bean counters have compiled significant 
collections of numbers about life in america whats typical and 
what isnt 
in fact almost every american from oklahoma gov henry bellmon 
to tiny alice feagin jones of frankfort ky is part of the 
statistics of daily life in the united states 
each day americas 244427098 people as of jan 1 work and 
play love and hate and contribute to the endless collection of 
data about themselves 
the good and the bad the fun and the tragic this information 
eventually supplies a compilation of bits and pieces of the things 
americans do to and for each other 
folks facing the battle of the bulge may take some solace in the 
estimate that on any given day 63092400 adults are trying to 
lose weight 
of those the statisticians say 51735768 try to do it by 
dieting while 37855660 are exercising to trim off pounds many 
of course are doing both 
on the other hand americans consume an average of threefourths 
of an ounce of ice cream every day of the year 
doesnt sound like much does it well that comes to 18 yummy 
pounds of the frozen confection annually 
americans eat even more cheese than ice cream downing nearly a 
full ounce daily or over 22 pounds per year 
chef john kramer used a bit more than the average at west allis 
wis last aug 6 however when he won the wisconsin state fairs 
cheese carving contest 
kramer topped four other competitors by reducing a 75pound 
block to a yellow food collage of wisconsin images including a 
milk can milk bottle real seal and bitesize samples of his 
work 
the average daily american diet the department of agriculture 
reports also includes 35 ounces of beef 27 ounces of pork 06 
ounce of fish 3 ounces of poultry 94 ounces of milk 
add to that 54 ounces of breads a halfounce of pasta about 
the same for breakfast cereals 28 ounces of sugar plus 38 
ounces of corn sweetener a little more than one cup of coffee 
159 ounces of soft drinks 25 ounces of juice 82 ounces of 
beer 08 ounce of wine and 06 ounce of liquor 
its unlikely that any individual consumes those exact 
quantities on any particular day of course but a good chunk of 
food was consumed by elderly south dakotans last july 30 
more than 125 braved 100degree heat that day for a potluck 
dinner at the pierre senior center 
usually when senior citizens are mentioned popular retirement 
areas like florida and arizona come to mind but seniors are in 
every state and community in growing numbers 
indeed the census bureau reports that nearly 6000 americans 
turn 65 every day 
and adds the national center for health statistics on a 
typical day 3212857 elderly parents receive a phone call from one 
of their children 
did you just buy a new home youre not alone 
on an average day in america 107887 people move to a new home 
and thats not all 
the federal government hires 216 new workers and 236 are hired 
by state governments 37514400 adults get less than 7 hours 
sleep 56061 drive a car after drinking alcohol 337 children are 
injured while playing with toys 1594 people are hurt in bicycle 
accidents and 108 men cut themselves seriously while shaving 
among the younger set on a normal day 36582990 children 
attend public school while 2951836 children who should be in 
school arent 
for oklahoma youngsters the statistics on those playing 
football may change a bit under a suggestion by gov bellmon he 
has proposed a rule that students who fail their studies be barred 
from extracurricular activities such as sports 
also in a typical day 6548 american couples are wed according 
to federal statistics in addition 288 couples decide to live 
together without bothering to marry and 3230 couples are divorced 
while joy and hope for the future marks the thousands of 
weddings cataloged daily tragedy was the focus of the 
russellville ark entry into the federal data bank 
sixteen people were slain in december in and near that small 
community in one of the nations worst mass murders 
fortysevenyearold r gene simmons has been charged in the case 
an extreme example of the more than 50 murders that occur daily in 
this country according to the national center for health 
statistics

in a nation with more than 244 million people crime is a 
continual concern statistics compiled by the federal bureau of 
investigation show 
no particular day is of course typical nor is any individual 
crime but on average the statistics say a day in america includes 
239 rapes 1364 robberies 1980 assaults 8419 burglaries 
18975 thefts and 3021 motor vehicle thefts 
all the news and numbers cant be bad 
take for example rhododendron ore where the us forest 
service last summer began cutting logs for breakwaters and digging 
out ponds along still creek to create quiet areas for salmon and 
steelhead to breed 
more and better spawning grounds mean more fish and in the long 
run more game for fishermen a boon for the 99000 americans who 
buy fishing licenses in an average day according to the us fish 
and wildlife service 
an estimated 78000 americans buy hunting licenses every day 
although most are sold during hunting season 
in addition 721643 people visit national parks and landmarks 
daily while the folks less inclined to outdoor activity buy some 
5643000 books 789000 records and 940000 tapes on an average 
day 
and potential future outdoors enthusiasts readers and musicians 
continue to arrive for example little alice feagin jones who 
debuted at 8 pounds on jan 1 the first baby of 1988 in frankfort 
ky offspring of wesley and alice jones 
katie and john meanwhile probably were among the first new 
nebraskans arriving 
in lincoln neb the state health department took a look at the 
names most popular with new arrivals there in 1986 the winners 
katie for girls and john for boys 
the national center for health statistics reports that 10279 
babies are born on an average day in the united states there is 
however no longer such a thing as a typical day 
the increasing use of caesarean delivery has resulted in more 
babies arriving on weekdays and a sharp decline in births on 
weekends and holidays 
no word yet on how this will affect the future of astrology 
of the more than 10000 babies born daily 1994 are children of 
unwed mothers 
the other side of birth is death and on a typical day more than 
5700 people die in this country 
some are famous some infamous most known mainly to friends and 
family for lives in which they have done their best and who feel 
the loss in ways no impersonal statistic can ever measure 
daily deaths according to the national center for health 
statistics include 1254 from cancer and 2686 from heart disease 
the most common killers also on a normal day 123 people die in 
motor vehicle accidents on americas highways 
fires join accidents among the most common threats to americans 
a toledo ohio family of eight was left homeless on aug 8 when 
a child playing with matches started a blaze that caused extensive 
damage to their apartment 
the fire was one of an estimated 1704 house fires in the nation 
if that was an average day according to the federal consumer 
product safety commission 
happily there were no injuries in the toledo fire although 
blazes claim 14 american lives daily according to the commission 
and the national center for health statistics 
while the elderly population is growing rapidly so are those in 
middle age children of the postworld war ii baby boom meaning 
that more than 10000 americans turn 40 daily 
but those folks havent been replacing themselves resulting in 
smaller populations of young people only about 8800 people become 
teenagers each day 
despite the relatively smaller size of the young population 
childrens diseases continue to threaten youngsters for example 
oklahoma health commissioner dr joan k leavitt reports a dramatic 
increase in the number of cases of whooping cough in her state 
oklahoma recorded 75 cases of the disease in the first half of 
1987 up from 56 in the same period a year earlier most cases have 
been in small children 
nationally six cases of whooping cough are recorded per day 
according to the federal centers for disease control incidents of 
the disease have risen in recent years as some parents have delayed 
having their children immunized 
while not all diseases have to be reported to federal officials 
the center estimates that on an average day americans are infected 
with 6082 cases of chicken pox 2298 cases of gonorrhea 192 
cases of syphilis 22 cases of aids eight cases of mumps seven 
cases of measles and two cases of legionnaires disease 
many of those folks join the 2753425 people who see a doctor 
every day an additional 1041095 people visit their dentist 
how do they get there most drive leading to the estimate that 
more than 30250 automobiles are sold in the united states in a 
normal day and while many are replacing others that are wrecked 
the total in use continues to grow

editors note a hearty laugh is good therapy in a lot of ways 
says a new york educator who for the past 10 years has been 
spreading the gospel of humor hes joel goodman director of the 
humor project at saratoga whose motto is jest for the health of 
it 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when a storm sent a tree crashing 
onto a motorists car in minneapolis a few years back the owner 
grabbed a pen and scribbled a few words on a piece of cardboard 
standing next to his car he cheered passing motors with his 
sign reading compact car 
now thats the way to deal with a disaster says 
humoristeducator joel goodman who tells the story often 
goodman should know he makes a living out of telling people 
humor is no laughing matter that youll live longer if you loosen 
up laugh and enjoy life 
people who laughlast quips the pintsized 38yearold 
goodman 
jest for the health 
goodman who speaks with a lot of oneliners is director of the 
humor project at saratoga a nonprofit resource and training 
center in saratoga springs he says his mission is to get people to 
use humor as a tool for handling stress and as a way to get along 
better with others 
dont laugh it works 
so far he has written seven books on humor and has spoken to 
more than 80000 people in the past 10 years throughout the united 
states canada and europe in lectures and workshops 
hes helped businesses and hospitals integrate humor into their 
daily routine hes also received a grant from a florida hospital 
corporation to study the medical implications and applications of 
humor 
goodman who has a doctorate in education also teaches graduate 
and undergraduate courses on health education at russell sage 
college in troy 
goodman says humor is important not only because of its health 
value but because of its benefits in the workplace he believes 
humor on the job boosts enthusiasm and psychic energy which he 
says are steppingstones to greater creativity alertness and 
camaraderie 
many people who are fired from their jobs get the boot not 
because they lack technical skills but because they are unable to 
get along with others he says 
goodman an irrepressible punlover started his work in humor 
education about 10 years ago with the opening of the humor 
institute 
he said he first became interested in humor when he was in 
houston where his father underwent cardiovascular surgery in the 
early 1970s he said the driver of the shuttle bus from the hotel 
to the medical center joked with passengers helping the relatives 
of critically ill patients cope with their anxieties and fears 
i got to thinking about how humor can help people in many 
walks of life by ridding them of anxiety or helping them see the 
funny side of some reallife situations he said during a recent 
inverview in his office a clutter of cartoons posters gags and 
joke books in a red brick church he converted to office space 
goodman also speaks to professionals from corporations such as 
ibm and niagara mohawk power corp medical groups and educators 
about how humor can improve productivity improve teaching efforts 
and help patients get well 
he said when he first thought of trying to integrate humor in 
the workplace he didnt think the corporate market would be 
interested in such a project 
he was wrong since directing his energies to comic relief hes 
developed programs for major corporations that look at how managers 
and executives can use humor to build morale 
hes also helped a number of hospitals set up humor rooms for 
patients equipped with games records books and movies the humor 
project has received a grant from the humana hospital corp in 
orlando fla to focus on the medical implications and 
applications of humor 
sunnyview rehabilitation center in schenectady recently hired 
goodman to conduct a staff seminar 
the first thing we did was to put up a humor bulletin board in 
the cafeteria says anita friar director of social work at 
sunnyview we asked people to contribute their favorite 
oneliners or cartoons 
friar says the hospital also has collections of humorous 
readings and audio and visual tapes that the staff distributes to 
patients 
i dont know if you can document it scientifically she 
says but sometimes focusing on a disability decreases a 
patients energy humor increases the positive energy and when 
they use that energy they get better 
scientific research supports the theory that laughter is 
important for good health laughter releases endorphins which are 
natural pain killers a good hearty laugh exercises internal 
organs like the diaphragm thorax abdomen heart and lungs 
providing a miniworkout 
goodman believes that if people would only laugh 15 times a day 
there would be fewer doctor bills 
future doctors instead of saying take two asprin and call 
me in the morning will say watch a lily tomlin special and call 
me in the morning 
humor can go a long way in romantic relationships as well 
studies show that a sense of humor usually rates no 1 or no 2 of 
qualities men and women look for in a romantic partner goodman 
says 
goodman also puts out a magazine laughing matters which 
takes a light and serious look at the power of humor in everyday 
life 
goodmans lecture topics include such things as filler phrases 
for thesis writers and career opportunities in iran are among 
the most popular lecture topics 
goodman says many adults arent comfortable with humor 
humor involves letting go he says thats why adults shy 
away from it because they think it means theyre out of control 
actually thats true because when people laugh they lose 
control of their muscles 
but humor is power you cant often control situations around 
you but you can control your internal responses to them with 
humor thats power 
goodman says he believes america is enjoying a resurgence of 
humor citing a growing number of comedy clubs and the popularity 
of television shows like bill cosbys as proof 
and there isnt anyone who doesnt have a sense of humor 
its just that some have had years of neglect

sometimes a mere title can afford a negative tipoff to the 
nature of a movie like the new columbia pictures release a 
time of destiny what does a time of destiny portend events 
leading up to the crucifixion napoleons climactic years the last 
days of john f kennedy 
then you learn that the movie concerns a blood feud in a 
basqueamerican family set against a world war ii background and 
it becomes glaringly apparent that both the title and the film ring 
false 
the costarring of william hurt and timothy hutton indicates the 
pretensions of a time for destiny but hurt has never been seen 
at such a disadvantage and huttons earnest efforts cannot rescue 
the sodden script from sinking into a bog just like one of the 
major characters 
the plot is almost impossible to synopsize since it is related 
in confusing flashbacks sometimes flashbacks within flashbacks 
the scene is san diego in wartime a tightly knit basque family is 
ruled imperiously by the father francisco rabal when his favorite 
daughter melissa leo elopes with a gi timothy hutton the father 
pursues and snatches her from the bridal chamber hutton pursues 
them in the stormy night and the father is drowned when his car 
falls into a lake 
the outcast son william hurt turns up for the funeral he 
blames hutton for the fathers death and vows vengeance the 
husbandandwife screenwriters anna thomas and gregory nava she 
also produced and he directed would have us believe that hurt was 
able to enlist and be assigned to huttons very same army unit 
following him into combat in italy 
thats only part of the films unbelievability hurt tries to 
kill hutton in combat then they seem to become buddies but at 
wars end hurt remembers his vow and the final unconvincing 
battle comes at the california mission where hutton married the 
familys daughter 
the leaden melodrama never achieves conviction and little is 
offered to explain hurts dementia except for flashbacks of the 
father locking his son in a barn its painful to witness an actor 
of hurts stature floundering in an impossible role its also 
distressful to see thomas and nava stumble after their admirable 
el norte

james e olson the forceful chairman of 
american telephone amp telegraph co who got his start cleaning silt 
out of manholes died early today of cancer the company announced 
olson who had led the telecommunications giant since the fall 
of 1986 had been operated on late last month for a tumor in the 
colon 
he was 62 the company said he died at home 
atampt president robert e allen who took over from olson after 
he became ill last month will continue to direct the company until 
the board of directors elects a new chairman company spokeswoman 
lynda beighley said 
atampts directors will meet around the time of the annual meeting 
wednesday in denver but ms beighley said she could not say if a 
chairman would be picked at that time 
olson became ill with flu on march 18 and had surgery seven days 
later he returned home april 1 and had been undergoing 
chemotherapy as an outpatient since that time 
all of us in the company are shocked at the suddenness of 
jims death allen said in a statement he was a dynamic and 
visionary leader we will miss him our legacy to him will be the 
vigor with which we carry out the strategic course he laid out for 
us during his 20 months as our leader 
allen 52 is the companys president and chief operating 
officer 
olson had made atampt more aggressive more costconscious and 
more certain of its direction since taking office in september 1986 
analysts said the company had drifted in the first years after 
the historic breakup of the bell system on jan 1 1984 when local 
phone service was split into seven regional bell holding companies 
olson who landed his first job in the bell system at age 17 
was considered a takecharge executive with an emphasis on getting 
results disdaining the fashion of corporate boardrooms the beefy 
executive wore shortsleeved shirts throughout his career 
jim olson was the ultimate tough guy i think he instilled 
a real sense of pride and determination in an atampt workforce that 
at that time needed it said jack grubman an analyst for 
painewebber inc 
i think he leaves atampt in good hands grubman said if 
this had happened a year ago it would have been extremely 
disruptive 
allen is widely considered to be atampts almost certain choice as 
a successor to olson he is a bigpicture guy grubman said 
his style is probably more overtly executive than olsons he 
said 
olson a native of devils lake nd was born dec 3 1925 his 
first job in which he cleaned manholes was as a splicers helper 
in 1943 with northwestern bell telephone co in grand forks nd 
twentythree years later olson had moved through the ranks of 
the company to become vice president and general manager in its 
iowa area he was transferred to indiana bell as vice president for 
operations in 1970 and became president of that company two years 
later 
in 1974 olson assumed the presidency of illinois bell and in 
1977 became executive vice president of atampt headquarters in new 
york he was made president and chief operating officer in june 
1985 after serving as vice chairman of the board since 1979 
olson was a graduate of the university of north dakota and 
served on the boards of many companies business organizations and 
charitable groups olson is survived by his wife jean a son 
james d olson a daughter mrs bruce paterson a brother and two 
sisters 
olsons undisclosed illness was reminiscent of that of william 
mcgowan the chairman of atampts longdistance rival mci 
communications corp who suffered a heart attack in december 1986 
received a heart transplant and returned to office in september 
1987 
both companies drew criticism for failing to announce their 
chiefs illnesses until news leaked out to the press

top leaders of chrysler corp and 
the united auto workers shook hands and exchanged weight jokes 
today before settling down to talks on a contract covering 67600 
workers in nine states 
uaw president owen bieber and chrysler motors corp chairman 
gerald greenwald shook hands over a conference table as did uaw 
vice president marc stepp and chrysler vice president anthony st 
john 
the four joked about stepps efforts to lose weight but did not 
discuss the negotiations before bieber stepp and st john went 
behind closed doors greenwald said he would not take part in the 
talks 
the officials are trying to draft an agreement to replace one 
expiring sept 14 bargainers led by stepp were to spend today and 
tuesday outlining the unions demands 
both sides will work within a pattern contract established last 
fall at ford motor co and adopted at general motors corp the 
contract must be fitted to the smaller chrysler corp the nations 
thirdlargest automaker 
the uaw also is seeking a twoyear duration for the contract so 
it will expire with the gm and ford pacts in 1990 the talks which 
normally would begin in midjuly cover wages benefits and working 
conditions 
the pattern contract forbids plant closings not announced before 
talks started and layoffs for any reason except production cuts 
caused by slow sales 
it also includes sixmonth studies in which managers and workers 
at each plant search together for ways to make their workplaces 
more efficient including organizing workers into teams on the 
assembly line 
harley shaiken a labor and technology expert at the university 
of california san diego said ford and gm are more interested in 
getting workers and managers to examine their plants together than 
in the actual results of the studies 
but at chrysler where local unions at six plants have agreed to 
socalled modern operating agreements and the company is pushing 
for their adoption at all plants the studies will have a different 
interpretation shaiken said sunday 
chrysler is smaller and it is seeking to make the turn more 
rapidly in a direction ford and gm also are headed in he said 
for chrysler the studies would be viewed as directly paving 
the way for modern operating agreements 
in an interview earlier this year st john pointed out the 
studies as a highlight of the gm and ford contracts 
at plants with the agreements managers and workers share 
decisions and design jobs so they can be performed by a team of 
workers each team member learns all tasks involved in the teams 
assignment 
workers can increase the amount they earn by learning additional 
jobs the crosstraining cuts down absenteeism costs because fewer 
standby workers are needed teams inspect their own work reducing 
the need for inspectors and workers who repair mistakes 
chrysler agreed to early talks after its attempt to sell its 
acustar inc parts subsidiary sparked a bitter companywide backlash 
that forced it to back down from the sale in early march 
also damaging workers trust in the company was chryslers 
decision to close a former american motors corp assembly plant in 
kenosha wis by years end idling 5500 workers instead of 
keeping them working at least five more years as originally planned 
chryslers contract covers 59500 active and 8000 laidoff 
workers in alabama delaware california indiana michigan 
missouri new york ohio and wisconsin

oil prices moved strongly higher today driven 
by heightened tensions in the persian gulf concerns about an 
upcoming opec meeting and technical factors one analyst said 
near midday contracts for may delivery of west texas 
intermediate the benchmark us crude stood at 1881 per 
42gallon barrel up 44 cents from fridays closing price on the 
new york mercantile exchange 
among refined products may contracts for wholesale unleaded 
gasoline were up 104 cents at 5365 cents per gallon while 
wholesale heating oil contracts were up 105 cents at 5080 cents 
per gallon 
mary t bergonia an analyst at edamp f man international 
futures inc said war talk was mainly responsible as traders 
worried that escalating hostilities in the persian gulf region 
might result in restrictions on supplies 
in washington today the white house said president reagan had 
struck at iranian oil platforms to punish iran for the mine attack 
that nearly sank a us frigate and to warn the iranians against 
sowing new mines in the persian gulf 
the pentagon said an iranian navy frigate responded by firing 
missiles at us aircraft while an iranian guided missile patrol 
boat fired on the cruiser wainwright it added that the frigate was 
attacked and set afire by us planes and an american destroyer 
aside from the war action ms bergonia said traders were also 
nervous about a scheduled april 26 meeting between five members 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and nonopec 
producers 
that meeting will be followed by a full conference by 
representatives of all 13 nations in the cartel 
any agreement to limit output could also send prices higher 
in addition the analyst said technical factors were also 
supporting the market 
noting that the may crude contract will expire at the close of 
trading wednesday she said traders believed that more industry 
buying was likely before then

chicagobased campd commodities the largest speculative firm on the

prices last friday by selling large amounts of soybean futures and 
options contracts 
grain futures started to rally this morning but campd became a 
large seller once again and prices fell 
they campd dont really control the market but their 
influence is real strong right now because of a lack of fresh 
fundamental news said victor lespinasse a trader for dean witter

demand factors campds actions could have a fairly large impact on 
futures prices

offer facet will be merged with pennzoils subsidiary 
pennzoil has informed facet that it has sufficient cash to 
complete the transaction and that there are no financing conditions 
to the tender offer and merger 
we are delighted that our efforts to maximize stockholders 
investment in facet have resulted in an agreement which provides a 
fair price for their shares said james malone president and 
chief executive officer of facet 
randal mcdonald pennzoils president and chief operating 
officer said his company as a substantial customer of facet 
intends to operate the company as a separate entity headquartered 
in tulsa with its present employees

6 but the new york company announced a series of extensions 
in doing so prospect revealed that it had been tendered since 
late last year 247170 shares of facet common stock an amount that

the first time in six weeks but only to receive deposits business 
was brisk but most customers appeared wary 
most people deposited checks which they have been unable to 
cash since the banks were closed on march 4 
ill keep my cash at home said frank farrell one of about 
20 people lined up to make deposits at chase manhattan bank when it 
opened later on maybe ill deposit cash

bfgoodrich co announced monday that its 
firstquarter net income increased nearly tenfold because of strong 
demand for some of the companys specialty chemical products 
in announcing the earnings ahead of the companys annual meeting 
in new york goodrich chairman john d ong noted that the massive 
restructuring the former tiremaker undertook a few years ago is 
now producing the expected results 
goodrich reported net income of 347 million or 129 a share 
for the quarter up from net income of 38 million or 6 cents a 
share in the yearearlier period 
sales during the quarter ended march 31 totaled 588 million up 
17 percent from 4856 million in the first quarter of 1987 
operating income from the companys largest business polyvinyl 
chloride or pvc jumped 126 percent to 576 million from 255 
million in the yearearlier quarter 
pvc is used by pipe and plastics manufacturers and in siding for 
homes though a cyclical business pvc as well as the raw materials 
used in making it currently are in short supply because of a robust 
economy the company said 
ong noted that goodrich expects to complete the sale of the 
companys interest in uniroyal goodrich within the next two months 
closing out the 118yearold companys association with rubber 
products 
during the first quarter goodrichs stake in uniroyal resulted 
in a 33 million loss mainly because of costs associated with a 
reduction in salaried enrollment ong said 
goodrich announced in december that an investment group formed 
by clayton amp dubilier inc agreed to buy its interest in uniroyal 
for 225 million 
analysts who met with goodrich executives before the annual 
meeting noted that the additional cash which will work to 
substantially reduce the companys debttocapital ratio could 
make goodrich vulnerable to a takeover 
ong and other executives stressed that they are actively working 
to see where we can invest to enhance our core businesses 
one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
goodrich management knows that that much cash in the bank is 
dangerous

imagine a world where the chore of 
fertilizing the lawn becomes a onceayear job where farmers 
drastically cut the work and expense of getting crops to grow 
where pesticides are safer all because of a microthin plastic 
coating 
its an idea that a university of dayton researcher and a major 
ohiobased fertilizer company are nourishing in a dayton laboratory 
it has its roots in the coatings that drug companies have been 
using for years on timerelease capsules 
now richard p chartoff a professor of materials engineering 
and om scott amp sons of marysville are trying encapsulation on a 
larger scale for fertilizers 
i think now the question is can we take that same technology 
and apply it to the agricultural area said michael p kelty 
director of technology development for scott 
farmers and homeowners could afford to waste some nutrients by 
having them wash away he said 
but kelty sees a day when prices rise again requiring a product 
that keeps more of the fertilizer where it is needed until it is 
used by the plants 
fertilizers been cheap labors been cheap and the input cost 
has been relativily small as fertilizer gets more expensive you 
look at other ways he said 
scott which approached the university for help is providing 
56000 for the feasibility study the states edison seed 
development fund is providing another 50000 chartoff hopes 
within a year to have some sample product from the laboratory 
to succeed all he has to do is take fairly large granules of 
urea fertilizer that dissolve easily find an appropriate plastic 
coating and figure out a way to spray it on or make it form plastic 
by a chemical reaction on the surface of the granule 
the coating must let water and bacteria in to dissolve it 
gradually but not too much or the granule will swell and rupture 
the plastic 
theres sort of a balancing act we have to do in designing the 
coating chartoff said the plastic also has to release just 
enough of the right kind of nutrient when the plant needs it and 
it must do it over a growing season 
the concept is easy but the science behind it is rather 
difficult said chartoff 48 who has been working in polymer 
science for 25 years 
some products exist scott makes a sulfurcoated product but 
the sulfur degrades into sulfuric acid and the process is uneven 
other coatings are so expensive they can be used only by nurseries 
where plants can be worth thousands of dollars an acre kelty said 
its an engineering problem we know that the particles can be 
coated but the question is what kind of process can we come up 
with that is cost effective chartoff said 
the program caught the eye of ohio gov richard celestes speech 
writers he mentioned it in his state of the state address as an 
example of businessstate partnerships in developing technologies 
i was surprised when i found out that celeste had mentioned 
it chartoff said its a rather small demonstration program but 
its the kind of thing that sounds interesting 
one of the biggest benefits could be environmental a 
considerable amount of fertilizer runs off fields into streams and 
rivers 
if we do it right the stuff will be used up as its released 
and there will be relatively small runoff chartoff said 
the us pesticide and fertilizer market is estimated at 20 
billion per year according to scotts technical abstract 
kelty said scott is more likely to aim at a 1 billion chunk of 
that for lawns and nursery plants 
scott is emphasizing only fertilizer for now but kelty sees 
applications to pesticides and expects that environmental concerns 
eventually will push encapsulation technology into the market for 
chemicals used for grain and other crops 
even if chartoffs work is successful however kelty said it 
would take three to five more years to bring the idea to fullscale 
development

japan again asked the united states on monday to 
lift trade sanctions imposed last year by president reagan as a 
result of american complaints over semiconductors sales 
japan said that it had complied with requests to open its 
markets to usmade computer chips and that continued sanctions 
would only irritate japanese manufacturers 
the comments were made as japan and the united states met in 
quarterly talks to review japans progress in opening its markets 
to the usmade chips the sanctions entered their second year 
sunday with no sign of a letup in the tough us stance 
continuing these sanctions will only damage the united states 
in the minds of japanese users said a trade official affiliated 
with the talks who agreed to discuss the matter only if granted 
anonymity we find these sanctions very irritating 
reagan accused japan of violating a 1986 agreement by selling 
semiconductors at belowmarket prices and failing to open its home 
market to americanmade computer chips he retaliated with tariffs 
of 100 percent on japanese color television sets calculators 
computers and power drills 
reagan later reduced the tariffs by 51 million saying japan 
had made partial progress in complying with the agreement 
shortly after the sanctions were announced sony chairman akio 
morita said the action was regarded in japan as the second coming 
of the black ships 
morita was referring to 1853 when us commodore matthew perry 
sailed into shimoda harbor southwest of tokyo and forced japan at 
gunpoint to open its ports after two centuries of isolation 
us trade representative clayton yeutter recently told japanese 
officials that it was still too early to lift the sanctions and 
that market access is still lower than expected 
yeutter drew exasperated reactions from the japanese trade 
official a representative of the ministry of international trade 
and industry 
its unreasonable i think to continue the sanctions now i 
think their expectations are too high they expect to get 20 
percent of the japanese market in five years i think it will be 
very difficult for them to achieve a 20 percent share the 
japanese official said 
its time for japanese users and us makers to cooperate to 
increase sales to japan he added 
according to figures compiled by miti us chipmakers have 
increased their sales in japan by 50 percent to 60 percent 
however the us share of the market has not grown significantly 
because the japanese market itself has expanded rapidly creating 
greater demand 
some japanese companies were able to avoid significant impact 
from the sanctions by transferring production of the affected 
merchandise such as portable computers to the united states 
other companies were hit hard by the sanctions according to some 
estimates the damage inflicted on japanese companies has already 
surpassed the 300 million 
the united states estimates american firms also have lost 300 
million in sales in japan because of the japanese practices but a 
us embassy spokesman earlier said the sanctions never were 
destined to end when the damage they inflicted on japan equalled 
that suffered by american companies he said the sanctions will 
continue until the basic situation changes 
the embassy official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
part of japans 300 million figure represents tariffs collected on 
japanese products coming into the united states and part 
represents goods kept off the us market because the japanese can 
no longer compete at the higher prices 
the miti official said japanus talks would not be affected by 
a dispute among the european economic community japan and the 
united states over the semiconductor agreement 
the eec has requested a threeway meeting to try and resolve 
european complaints that the original chip agreement between japan 
and the united states violates international trade rules 
established by the general agreement on tariffs and trade

sears roebuck and co the nations largest 
retailer said today its profit for the first three months of 1988 
fell more than 37 percent due to sharp earnings declines in its 
retail and insurance divisions 
sears posted firstquarter net income of 1795 million or 47 
cents a share down from 2879 million or 75 cents a share in 
the same period a year earlier 
quarterly sales increased 16 percent from 1048 billion in 
1987 to 1216 billion a record for firstquarter revenue sears 
said in a statement 
despite a 46 percent increase in sales at sears department and 
specialty stores to 604 billion income from the sears 
merchandise group fell to 187 million from 313 million a year 
earlier 
edward a brennan sears chairman and chief executive officer 
said traditional business patterns produce the lowest sales of the 
year in the first quarter while fixed costs remain constant 
the allstate insurance group reported firstquarter income of 
1832 million down from 2469 million a year earlier the 
company said the results were adversely affected by the return of 
normal winter weather patterns compared with mild conditions and 
fewer claims a year earlier revenue for allstate rose 355 
percent to 494 billion 
the dean witter financial services group was the companys best 
performer with firstquarter income of 155 million up from 61 
million a year earlier the discover card an allpurpose credit 
card recorded its first quarterly profit 64 million after 
two years of heavy investment and startup expenses 
tax reform accounted for 355 million of the decrease in income 
from allstate sears said 
the coldwell banker real estate group reported firstquarter 
income of 75 million down sharply from 393 million a year 
earlier 
brennan said the decline in income was expected but this 
should not be regarded as an indicator of results for the year 
we continue to be quite optimistic about the economy 
brennan said in a statement consumer confidence has rebounded to 
a level higher than the preoctober peak recent employment growth 
has been rapid and unemployment has fallen to its lowest level 
since 1979 we expect disposable personal income to register a 
healthy 75 percent increase in 1988 compared with 53 percent in 
1987 this favorable atmosphere should benefit all our businesses

the move came as officials of both countries met for quarterly 
talks to review the status of moves to open us access to the

reagan imposed the ban a year ago sunday claiming the japanese 
had broken a 1986 agreement by selling semiconductors the chips 
used in computers at prices below market prices and failing to 
open its home market to americanmade computer chips 
he later reduced the tariffs by 51 million saying japan had

malcolm bricklin the flamboyant 
entrepreneur who brought the yugo automobile to america once 
imported optimism to this depressed ranching town with 
multimilliondollar investments but worry has replaced hope as 
his unpaid bills pile up 
the town has been through this before most recently with the 
oil shale bust of 1982 when big promises and heavy spending on 
expensive oil production techniques evaporated overnight 
but meekers 1800 residents dont want it to happen again and 
they hope bricklin who plans to sell his daring auto business 
soon will settle his debts and resume building on his lavish ranch 
and youth camp 22 miles from town up the white river 
liens of more than 107000 are on file against the 49yearold 
bricklin in the rio blanco county courthouse and subcontractors 
throughout colorados western slope are waiting for their money 
a little guy cant carry this kind of money and im not sure 
he understands this said neil bratton the owner of a grand 
junction window company who claims bricklin owes him a substantial 
amount 
even bricklins chief aide pat carfagno admits the ranch 
where the importer hoped to establish a parttime personal 
residence owes 150000 just in meeker which is in northwest 
colorado about 200 miles from denver 
but carfagno said the scheduled sale of bricklins interests in 
global motors for more than 20 million will free up enough cash to 
satisfy western colorado creditors and to continue bricklins plans 
for an expensive youth camp on his property 
officials with global motors disclosed late last week that an 
investor group planned to buy out bricklins stake in the firm 
which brought the yugo to this country in 1985 
we have been in a cash shortage and weve been honest with 
people about that said carfagno who has worked with bricklin 
for 21 years 
weve run 7 million through this town in the last year she 
said the bulk of it in land purchases 
were here and were staying she said 
townspeople hope carfagno is right 
bricklin who moved to colorado from new york city has suffered 
some setbacks of his own his yugo business although initially 
successful began to unravel as the yugoslavian import gained a 
reputation for consumer complaints earlier in the 1970s bricklin 
failed in his bid to popularize a gullwinged plastic sports car 
that bore his name 
lured by the idea of slow western living and spectacular 
scenery bricklin came to rio blanco county in the winter of 1987 
he bought the financially troubled bowling alley in meeker and 
donated 10000 a month to the chamber of commerce to promote town 
events ranging from rodeos to sled dog races 
meeker folks say he provided jobs for many people who otherwise 
would have had to leave the wide open country they love 
but two months ago he stopped paying his bills 
im cautiously skeptically optimistic said jan hughley a 
motel owner and newly elected mayor of meeker hes done a lot 
for meeker and i hope he gets things squared away but we have to

the supreme court rejected appeals by natural gas pipeline 
companies monday to invalidate a key federal regulation aimed at 
promoting competition in their industry a ruling that affects 
billions of dollars in sales 
in other businessrelated matters the court affirmed that 
workers may not be fired for refusing on religious grounds to pay 
union dues it also rejected the use in cosmetics of color 
additives that could cause cancer and it agreed to decide whether 
donations to the church of scientology are taxdeductible 
in the naturalgase case the court left intact a regulation 
that under certain conditions requires pipeline companies to 
transport gas sold by other producers and traders pipeline 
companies had complained that the rule hurt them economically by 
forcing them to carry gas from competitors 
a federal appeals court had rejected earlier appeals by the 
pipeline companies saying they apparently were trying to stifle 
competition by attempting to invalidate the rule 
in the uniondues case the supreme court rejected without 
comment an appeal by a seattle machinists union that was attempting 
to force boeing co employee thomasine nichols to pay union dues 
the company declined to fire her although her refusal to pay dues 
violated its contract with the union 
ms nichols argued that her religious beliefs bar her from 
paying dues to unions and she offered to donate the equivalent 
amount to a charity an appeals court said she was protected from 
dismissal by federal civil rights law 
in the cosmetics case the supreme court refused to let the 
government approve the cosmeticindustry use of two color additives 
that pose a minimal risk of causing cancer despite company claims 
that the substances are safe 
an appeals court had ruled that federal law prohibits the food 
and drug administration from approving the substances orange dye 
no 17 and red dye no 19 though the cancer risks are trivial 
in the scientology case the court agreed to rule on whether 
payments called fixed donations made to the church of 
scientology by members can be deducted from federal income taxes 
the internal revenue service has argued that the payments cannot 
be counted as taxdeductible charitable contributions 
scientologists have argued that the irs has singled out their 
church for unfair treatment 
the supreme courts decision is not expected until sometime next 
year

stocks closed mixed in quiet trading today 
lower through most of the session but recovering part of the loss 
by late afternoon 
the light volume suggested that many investors refrained from 
participating in the market and most of the trading was limited to 
the major brokerages fears about the outlook for interest rates 
was a major reason for a slow day 
nobody on the face of this earth can tell which way this 
markets going for the rest of the week said robert otoole 
manager of overthecounter trading at shearson lehman hutton inc 
in new york 
falling prices in the bond market pushed yields on 
so6kyxleasury issues past the 9 percent threshhold the highest 
in three 
months this made bonds more attractive than stocks to people 
looking for a safe investment

oil prices jumped after the latest round of 
shooting between the united states and iran but lost most of the 
gains in later trading monday 
analysts said production from other sources would sharply 
diminish the impact of any cutoff of oil from the persian gulf 
states but they said the market still reacted with typical 
skittishness at the prospect 
they attributed the markets afternoon weakness to profittaking 
and technical factors 
west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude closed at 
1852 per 42gallon barrel up 15 cents from fridays closing 
price but down 40 cents from its midday high of 1892 on the new 
york mercantile exchange 
among refined products may contracts for wholesale unleaded 
gasoline settled up 069 cent at 5330 cents a gallon while 
wholesale heating oil contracts were up 075 cents at 5050 cents a 
gallon 
in washington officials said us navy vessels destroyed two 
offshore iranian oil platforms sank a defending iranian patrol 
boat and bombed two iranian navy frigates in retaliation for a mine 
attack that nearly sank a us vessel last week iran attacked oil 
facilities off sharjah and fired on at least two us vessels 
theres an overall recognition that if you shut down the gulf 
theres not so big an impact on world oil supplies because of 
the number of other producers has grown said jayne ball an 
analyst at the dean witter reynolds inc investment firm 
but markets still worry to the point that anything that 
happens in that area has got to have an impact on prices she 
added 
other analysts agreed that the hostilities spurred the early 
jump in prices attributing the later decline mainly to technical 
factors and profittaking 
the may crude contract expires at the close wednesday and so 
a lot of people took advantage of the higher prices and sold 
off said stephen j mckiernan president of the mckiernan amp co 
commodities trading firm 
ms ball said the failure of the may crude contract to break 
above 19 discouraged traders who then began the afternoon selloff

a presidential commission concluded monday 
that the us air transport system is safe for the time being but 
urged appointment of a safety czar in a newly independent 
federal aviation administration whose officials would be insulated 
from political pressures 
the nations air transportation system is safe for now 
said john m albertine chairman of the aviation safety commission 
whose final report was issued after a ninemonth study of the 
rapidly growing airline industry 
however that safety is being maintained to an increasing 
extent through delays and through what i can only characterize as 
heroic efforts of air traffic controllers airways facilities 
technicians safety inspectors and others albertine said 
the report said there was widespread public concern about the 
safety of air travel coinciding with burgeoning technological 
advances and a backlog of safety improvements waiting to be written 
into government regulations 
now is the time for decisive action by congress and the 
executive branch the study said 
the panel recommended that the faa expand its force of 
inspectors and begin conducting surprise inspections of airlines in 
addition to preannounced examinations to give the airlines 
increased incentives to keep their daytoday operations in close 
conformance with safety regulations 
it also urged the transportation department agency to publish 
stricter safety standards for commuter air carriers and to require 
private planes to contain equipment that can report their altitudes 
to ground controllers when they are making a landing approach at 
busy airports 
the report proposed a dramatic restructuring of the faa 
including appointment of a safety czar within the agency who 
could initiate or block proposed air safety regulations 
under the panels plan the faa would be removed from the 
transportation department as an independent body with streamlined 
regulatory procedures and greater authority to manage its staff and 
purchase equipment 
the faas administrator and the proposed new director of 
aviation safety would be appointed by the president to sevenyear 
terms in the interest of providing continuity and shielding them 
from political influence the faa administrator now serves for an 
indefinite term but the post has been characterized by frequent 
turnovers 
initial reaction to the report was favorable 
sen wendell ford dky chairman of the senate commerce 
science and transportation subcommittee on aviation said the 
commissions proposal to remove the agency from the transportation 
department is a muchneeded change 
ford is sponsoring a bill that would make the faa an independent 
agency a proposal endorsed monday by several industry 
organizations 
gabriel phillips executive vice president of the air transport 
association which represents the nations airlines said 
reorganization of the faa is the only way to solve personnel 
purchasing and other problems 
the seven members of the commission created by congress were 
appointed last year by president reagan they concluded that the 
1978 deregulation of the airline industry has not eroded safety as 
some critics have contended 
while the number of airline passengers has grown from about 250 
million in 1978 to 450 million last year the numbers of accidents 
passenger fatalities and injuries have all decreased the report 
said 
the commission also said that despite intense airline 
competition since deregulation it found no evidence of any growth 
in problems related to maintenance shortcuts errors by overworked 
crews or mistakes by overburdened air traffic controllers 
the safety record has continued to be excellent following 
deregulation the report said 
it also said the faa should make a priority of inspecting 
carriers undergoing expansions mergers or changes in ownership 
such events can sometimes create difficulties in managing and 
controlling operations and maintenance activities it said 
the commission said a lack of new airports is causing flight 
delays and congestion that are inconvenient but rarely result in 
accidents 
the report urged the faa to study suggestions for using airports 
more efficiently including sale of landing slots or the 
specific times an airline can land a plane and use a terminal

james e olson whose bulldog tenacity led him 
from manholes in north dakota to the chairmanship of atampt died 
unexpectedly monday after a monthlong battle with colon cancer he 
was 62 
his death came after just 1 years as leader of american 
telephone amp telegraph co the powerfully built chief executive had 
cut costs and shaken the company out of the sense of drift that 
followed the 1984 breakup of the bell system 
olson did what a lot of people thought was impossible he 
really started to turn the company around said daniel rosenbaum 
executive editor of wiretap a newsletter in morristown nj 
robert e allen 53 atampts president and chief operating 
officer will serve as acting chairman and is considered the 
favorite to succeed olson 
the centuryold atampt has enough management depth that the loss 
of olson is not expected to damage the company atampts stock fell 
25 cents a share to 2637 in consolidated new york stock exchange 
trading 
olson died just two days before the companys annual meeting 
which is to be held wednesday in denver 
atampts board of directors already had a meeting scheduled for 
this week but company spokeswoman lynda beighley said she could 
not say whether the board would name a chairman at the time 
olsons deterioration was rapid the company said the cancer was 
diagnosed after he became ill with flu on march 18 he had surgery 
seven days later for removal of a tumor in the colon he returned 
home on april 1 and had been undergoing chemotherapy as an 
outpatient since he died at home in short hills nj 
all of us in the company are shocked at the suddenness of 
jims death allen said in a statement he was a dynamic and 
visionary leader we will miss him our legacy to him will be the 
vigor with which we carry out the strategic course he laid out for 
us during his 20 months as our leader 
atampt had been criticized for not making olsons illness public 
until news leaked out to the press last week 
the situation was reminiscent of that of william mcgowan the 
chairman of atampts longdistance rival mci communications corp mci 
did not disclose that mcgowan had received a heart transplant until 
two weeks after the april 1987 operation mcgowan returned to 
office in september 
as recently as the end of last week atampt spokesmen were saying 
olson was recuperating walter murphy a spokesman said monday 
that was the best of our knowledge at the time everybody here is 
in shock 
under olson atampt cut 27000 employees closed some plants and 
unified parts of the company that had been separated under the 
consent decree that broke up the company 
olson was a blunt but gregarious executive who demanded results 
and saw his own rise through the corporate ranks as an inspiration 
for the rest of the companys 303000 employees 
he landed his first job in the bell system at age 17 during the 
summer of 1943 when he hauled buckets of silt out of telephone 
manholes in north dakota disdaining the fashion of boardrooms he 
wore shortsleeved shirts throughout his career 
i think our employees know deep down that im one of them 
he said in an interview with a freelance writer for delta 
airlines inflight magazine sky that has not yet been published 
olson was 5feet10 175 pounds jowly and mostly bald with 
broad shoulders and muscular forearms he was not fragile 
jim olson was the ultimate tough guy i think he instilled 
a real sense of pride and determination in an atampt workforce that 
at that time needed it said jack grubman an analyst for the 
investment firm painewebber inc 
i think he leaves atampt in good hands grubman said if 
this had happened a year ago it would have been extremely 
disruptive 
allen is considered to be atampts almost certain choice as a 
successor to olson analysts describe him as more softspoken than 
olson a person who favors looking at the big picture 
his style is probably more overtly executive than olsons 
grubman said but the differences do not run too deep because 
olson had been grooming allen as his successor 
olson a native of devils lake nd was born dec 3 1925 his 
father was a barber and his mother a teacher 
the same summer that he cleaned manholes in 1943 he got work as 
a cable splicers helper with northwestern bell telephone co in 
grand forks nd 
twentythree years later olson had moved through the ranks of 
the company to become vice president and general manager in its 
iowa area he was transferred to indiana bell as vice president for 
operations in 1970 and became president of that company two years 
later 
in 1974 olson assumed the presidency of illinois bell and in 
1977 became executive vice president of atampt headquarters in new 
york he was made president and chief operating officer in june 
1985 after serving as vice chairman of the board since 1979 
in september 1986 olson took office as chairman succeeding 
charles l brown who retired 
olson was a graduate of the university of north dakota and 
served on the boards of many companies business organizations and 
charitable groups he served 2 years in the us army air corps 
while in college he majored in accounting and completed half the 
credits for a law degree 
olson is survived by his wife jean a son james d olson a 
daughter mrs bruce paterson a brother and two sisters

a federal judge expressed reservations monday 
both about signing and rejecting a consent decree to regulate 
allterrain vehicles that critics say wont reduce deaths and 
injuries attributed to the machines 
rejecting the consent decree would force the government into 
timeconsuming litigation against manufacturers that would 
inevitably delay imposition of any safety measures us district 
judge gerhard a gesell said at a hearing on the case 
but signing the decree would restrict the additional measures 
the consumer product safety commission could take to improve the 
safety of the vehicles known as atvs which have been blamed for 
900 deaths and 300000 injuries in the last five years gesell said 
is it best to move in the direction of doing what one can do 
to reduce it as opposed to doing nothing about it gesell asked 
during oral argument on the proposed settlement between the cpsc 
and five manufacturers of the vehicles 
the decree would ban the future sales of threewheel atvs unless 
the manufacturers devised performance standards that would be 
approved by the cpsc it would also require warning labels on 
fourwheel models and distributors would have to offer training 
about the safe use of the machiens to owners of vehicles currently 
in use 
consumer organizations and 32 states have asked gesell to reject 
the consent decree or make modifications on the grounds that it 
would not protect consumers from the hazards of 15 million 
threewheel atvs already in use 
these critics say the decree is incomplete for not providing 
refunds for people who already purchased the atvs which the 
justice department called an imminent hazard late last year 
when it announced a temporary consent decree 
it is better than nothing but its seriously flawed james 
shannon attorney general of massachusetts told gesell 
he called the machines some of the most dangerous consumer 
products sold in this country 
shannon and others criticized provisions of the proposed 
settlement that would restrict the cpsc from taking further 
enforcement action against atvs during the 10 years the consent 
decree is in effect 
gesell said the mechanism provided by congress is stymied by 
the consent decree 
as i understand the decree the agency represented here cpsc 
is not able to issue a rule under the statute which would be in 
many respects more severe than the sanctions imposed by the 
consent decree gesell said 
you take the agency out of the game you cant tell me with 
quite the same assurance the agency is going to continue to perform 
its function the judge told howard p willens an attorney 
representing the manufacturers and distributors 
noting criticism of the cpsc as too slow to take action against 
atvs the judge questioned the notion that the agency could be 
relied upon to vigorously enforce the decree 
the commission had to be led to drink the commission wasnt 
running in here with any eagerness gesell said 
but gesell said there is something to be said for a relative 
degree of experimentation 
the consent decree unprecedented in consumer product 
regulation could prove a technique that could be of great value 
to consumers 
it would be in the public interest to have some idea if a 
system like this would work gesell said 
gesell said he was not empowered to force the manufacturers to 
give refunds to people who bought threewheel atvs and rejecting 
the decree would result in litigation that could last several years 
the judge who indicated he would rule within a week also 
expressed concern that the consent decree lacked deadlines for 
compliance with certain provisions and didnt provide a mechanism 
for evaluating its enforcement 
legislation to force the manufacturers to buy back the machines 
is pending in congress among the sponsors is sen alfonse m 
damato rny who briefly spoke at the hearing against the 
decree 
i would suggest this is a wolf in sheeps clothing damato 
said of the provisions barring further cpsc action against atvs 
the senator suggested that gesell modify the decree to give agency 
an opportunity to take further action if deaths and injuries have 
not been reduced after 12 to 18 months

sears roebuck and co beset by sluggish retail 
sales and sharp declines in income from three of its four major 
divisions said monday its firstquarter profit fell more that 37 
percent from the same period a year ago 
sales were up 16 percent however and industry analysts agreed 
with sears chairman edward a brennan that the firstquarter income 
should not be regarded as an indicator of results for the year 
the nations largest retailer reported net income of 1795 
million or 47 cents a share for the first three months of 1988 
down from 2879 million or 75 cents a share for the yearearlier 
period 
revenues increased 16 percent from 1048 billion in 1987 to 
1216 billion a record for firstquarter revenues sears said in 
a statement 
sales within the companys flagship division the sears 
merchandise group rose just 46 percent to 604 billion income 
fell more than 40 percent to 187 million 
the increase in retail sales was tiny compared to the record 47 
percent advance a year earlier brennan said firstquarter retail 
sales are traditionally the lowest of the year and blamed the 
income decline on fixed operating costs 
income from the allstate insurance group slipped nearly 26 
percent to 1832 million despite a 355 percent rise in revenues 
sears said the results were adversely affected by the return of 
normal winter weather patterns compared with mild conditions and 
fewer claims a year ago 
about 355 million of the decrease in allstates income was 
attributed to taxreform accounting changes sears said 
the dean witter financial services group was the companys best 
performer with firstquarter income of 155 million compared to 
61 million a year earlier the discover card an allpurpose 
credit card recorded its first quarterly profit 64 million 
after two years of heavy investment and startup expenses 
and the coldwell banker real estate group reported firstquarter 
income of 75 million down from 393 million a year ago 
analysts said they were not surprised by sears drop in earnings 
i dont take firstquarter earnings as indicative for the 
year said john landschultz of chicagobased mesirow financial 
corp 
but the pressure continues to be on sears to perform better 
he said youre getting modest sales gains and you need more 
in the wake of the earnings report monday sears shares lost 50 
cents to 3437 in new york stock exchange trading 
sears announced last month it was undertaking a massive 
restructuring of its retail division that could trim as many as 
4000 jobs from the divisions headquarters staff 
the restructuring which will take up to three years was 
expected to come under questioning by shareholders tuesday at the 
companys annual meeting in chicago 
walter loeb senior retail analyst for morgan stanley group inc 
in new york said the restructuring program was bound to help sears 
become more competitive in the retail arena 
three years is a little too long in my opinion but it will 
be a more aggressive organization he said 
brennan said in a statement that he was optimistic about sears 
growth in light of recent economic indicators 
consumer confidence has rebounded to a level higher than the 
preoctober peak he said recent employment growth has been 
rapid and unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since 1979 
we expect disposable personal income to register a healthy 75 
percent increase in 1988 compared with 53 percent in 1987 this 
favorable atmosphere should benefit all our businesses

the death monday of atampt chairman james e olson 
leaves robert e allen at the controls of a phone giant that is 
still adjusting to losing its status as the worlds largest company 
four years ago 
olson 62 cut costs and gave direction to american telephone amp 
telegraph co now allen 53 will be under pressure to keep the 
momentum going 
olson had drive energy and he was a bulldog that you didnt 
want to cross said fulton holmes an analyst for thomson 
mckinnon securities allen is more sophisticated maybe hes got 
that inner toughness but im going to hold off six months or a 
year until i see it 
allen began serving as acting chairman during olsons brief bout 
with cancer and is expected to be given the nod for the top job by 
the board of directors possibly as soon as this week when the 
board meets in conjunction with the annual meeting wednesday in 
denver 
atampt was staggering in september 1986 when olson took over as 
chairman on the retirement of charles l brown the company had 
lost its profitable local phone service monopolies in the 1984 
breakup of the bell system and was losing hundreds of millions of 
dollars annually on its computer business which was supposed to 
lead the company into a hightechnology future 
the company also had cut tens of thousands of jobs and morale 
was low 
olson gathered 27 top executives at a cape cod golf resort over 
that labor day weekend in 1986 they thrashed over the future 
then one by one he asked the executives to stand and asked them 
are you with me 
invariably the reply was yes business week recounted in its 
jan 18 issue 
the company is spending heavily on its longdistance network to 
solidify its nearly 80 percent share of the interstate 
longdistance market it has cut its losses on computers under the 
leadership of vittorio cassoni whom atampt hired from italys 
olivetti and the company slashed an additional 27000 jobs in a 
sweeping cutback announced shortly before christmas 1986 
in 1987 atampts profit rose to 2 billion from a scant 139 
million the previous year when earnings were depressed by a huge 
writeoff that covered the cost of plant closings job cuts and 
other factors 
olson had the difficult job of trying to maintain employee 
loyalty at the same time he was overseeing massive layoffs he 
traveled around the country giving speeches to groups of employees 
and meeting them personally 
under olson atampt has appointed a new tier of managers who 
understand the difference between atampts old monopoly standing and 
the new competitive realities analysts say 
the company has also eased off from its notinventedhere 
syndrome showing a willingness to team up with outside companies 
such as ing c olivetti spa sun microsystems inc and tandem 
computers inc 
i dont know if you want to say olson made order out of chaos 
but under his direction the company has got a much stronger vision 
of who they are and where they want to go said peter bernstein 
senior analyst at probe research inc in cedar knolls nj 
some of the problems atampt will have to face with olson gone 
morale though somewhat improved still leaves room for 
improvement atampts own surveys have found 
the computer business continues to lose money and may not 
become profitable until 1990 some analysts say the company needs 
to buy an established computer maker 
shareholders are agitating for an increase in the quarterly 
dividend which has been stuck at 120 a share since the breakup 
atampt still gets 91 percent of its revenue in the united states 
and is having a hard time cracking foreign markets a goal of the 
company since the early 1980s 
allen the man most likely to face the challenges is a career 
employee who worked his way up through telephone operating 
companies in indiana pennsylvania illinois and the midatlantic 
region in contrast to olson his specialty is in finance 
allen was named president and chief operating officer in 1986 
before that he was chairman and chief executive of the information 
systems division prior to that he was atampts executive in charge 
of corporate administration and finance

the dollar 
while the pound had touched this level recently it had not

the sharp move in the pound prompted the federal reserve to 
enter the market to sell pounds and buy dollars said ian spence

persian gulf where us forces destroyed two iranian platforms in 
retaliation for an iranian mine attack that damaged a us frigate 
on patrol in international waters 
people are focusing on the fact that there may be a boost in 
oil prices and that will benefit great britain because of its 
north sea oil fields spence said

petrocurrency and any potential boost in oil prices would 
support the currency

more expensive than fridays 19004 traders said the pound was

manville corp on monday reported its first 
quarter net income fell by 166 percent from the yearearlier 
period which had been boosted by onetime gains 
the denverbased building products company said its first 
quarter profit was 357 million or 123 per share down from 
428 million or 152 per share in the first quarter of 1987 
first quarter 1987 results included 9 million in gains from the 
sale of two real estate ventures 
sales in the quarter ended march 31 rose to 5021 million from 
475 million in the same period a year ago the company said 
despite severe competition in most construction segments 
manvilles overall performance continues to be strong said tom 
stephens manvilles president and chief executive officer 
he attributed manvilles first quarter results to the 
performance of the forest products division and the effects of 
stronger international currencies 
excluding the nonrecurring gain on the sale of our real 
estate holdings 1988s operating performance was higher than the 
record first quarter of 1987 stephens said 
manville filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy act on aug 26 1982 because it was faced with 
billions of dollars worth of lawsuits claiming damage from exposure 
to asbestos made by manville 
the federal bankruptcy court approved the companys 
reorganization plan in december 1986 but the plan cannot be 
implemented until all appeals by claimants are addressed

gold futures prices rose monday on expectations that an outbreak 
of fighting in the persian gulf could drive oil prices and 
inflation higher but analysts were skeptical about the chances for 
a sustained rally 
on other markets energy futures advanced most livestock and 
meat futures declined grains and soybeans were mixed and 
stockindex futures rose 
gold for june delivery settled above 460 a troy ounce on the 
commodity exchange in new york for the first time this month but 
the settlement price of 46170 was well below the days high of 
464 an 11week high 
silver and platinum also jumped in early trading but an 
afternoon selloff pushed their settlement prices below fridays 
final prices 
the prospect that military action between the united states and 
iran in the persian gulf could disrupt crudeoil shipments and 
drive oil prices higher was seen as a positive factor for the 
inflationsensitive metals analysts said 
but brief skirmishes such as mondays us navy attacks on 
iranian oil platforms and military vessels often have an ultimately 
negative impact on the precious metals said craig sloane metals 
analyst in new york for smith barney harris upham amp co 
you get a kneejerk response thats very quick in terms of 
people rushing in and buying the metals he said but once you 
reach the point where the buying cant sustain itself the sellers 
come in and it ends up being more damaging to the metals prices 
than being positive 
gold settled 320 to 380 higher with the contract for 
delivery in june at 46170 a troy ounce silver was 27 cents to 
35 cents lower with may at 644 a troy ounce 
crudeoil futures also fell back on the new york mercantile 
exchange after a morning rally that pushed the contract for may 
delivery to 1892 just short of the important 19abarrel level 
the market clearly reacted to the increased tension in the 
persian gulf and the usiran clash said andrew lebow an 
analyst in new york with edampf man international futures inc 
the setback apparently was motivated partly by technical factors 
and partly by statements from saudi arabia and kuwait that they 
would not reduce their production of crude oil unless nonopec 
producers also agreed to cut production lebow said 
opec has invited some nonopec producers to meet next week to 
discuss production levels 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents to 26 cents 
higher with contracts for may delivery at 1852 a barrel heating 
oil was 48 cent to 83 cent higher with may at 5050 cents a 
gallon unleaded gasoline was 64 cent to 73 cent higher with may 
at 5330 cents a gallon 
cattle and pork futures were pressured by profittaking on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
cattle futures advanced above recent highs early in the session 
sold off on profittaking then recovered to finish only slightly 
lower than fridays final prices 
hog futures ran into some technical weakness late in the day 
analysts said on the fundamental side weights of slaughtered 
animals have been relatively high and the market is still awaiting 
a seasonal drop in supplies 
i think there is this perception that nearterm supplies wont 
give you much to be optimistic about said philip stanley an 
analyst in chicago for thomson mckinnon securities inc 
live cattle were 77 cent lower to 13 cent higher with april 
contracts at 7410 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent to 
60 cent lower with april at 7907 cents a pound hogs were 50 
cent lower to 10 cent higher with april at 4480 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 40 cent lower to 35 cent higher with 
may at 5165 cents a pound 
soybean futures prices closed substantially higher on the 
chicago board of trade corn also advanced while wheat futures 
declined slightly 
the soybean market showed its underlying strength by rallying 
despite fairly heavy selling early in the session by speculative 
funds analysts said 
were in a bull market and the market just doesnt want to go 
down said victor lespinasse a trader for dean witter reynolds 
inc 
wheat was pressured by speculative selling and reports of 
beneficial weekend rains in southern wheatgrowing states he said 
wheat settled 1 cents lower to 1 cents higher with may 
contracts at 311 a bushel corn was cent to 1 cents higher 
with may at 203 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 4 cents higher 
with may at 164 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 7 cents 
higher with may at 666 a bushel 
stockindex futures advanced on the chicago mercantile exchange 
where the contract for june delivery of the standard amp poors 500 
index settled 45 point higher at 25925

points most broader indices of stock values fell slightly 
traders were trading with each other said william king 
head trader at nikko securities co international in new york 
otherwise its really been a sleepy day 
escalating violence between iranian and american forces in the 
persian gulf indirectly influenced wall street by pushing up oil 
prices which aggravated preexisting fears of higher inflation and 
rising interest rates 
the impact was first felt in the bond market where yields on 
some 30year issues surpassed the 9 percent barrier the highest 
levels in three months this made bonds more attractive to many 
investors and raised the prospect that stocks could suffer sharp 
declines if bond yields continue to rise 
gaining and losing issues were about even on the new york stock 
exchange with 771 up 765 down and 460 unchanged big board volume 
totaled 14465 million shares sharply lower than the 23416

here are highlights from the report by the 
presidents commission on aviation safety 
the nations air transportation system is safe for now 
but the government regulatory structure designed to ensure 
aviation safety is inadequate to deal with future growth and 
technological change 
there is a need for a major structural overhaul of the 
federal aviation administration making it an independent agency 
outside the transportation department 
an independent aviation safety czar should be appointed as 
part of the new faa and given authority to oversee safety matters 
with a sevenyear term the new aviation safety director could 
initiate new safety rules and block proposed regulations 
no need has been demonstrated for reimposing federal 
regulation of the airline industry although the government must 
streamline its regulatory activities to deal with rapidly changing 
events in a deregulated industry 
surveillance of airlines should be improved with heavier 
reliance on indepth inspections surprise inspections and closer 
examination of airlines undergoing major changes 
safety requirements for commuter airlines should elevated 
gradually to the same level as those for larger commercial airlines 
small private planes flying near major airports should be 
required to have equipment that informs ground controllers of their 
altitude

us negotiators suggested to soviet officials 
monday that the two nations might consider a ban on all fishing in 
a section of the bering sea known as the doughnut hole while 
scientists try to determine whether it is being overfished 
we are moving going through the hoops and everything has come 
up that we wanted said edward wolfe the state departments 
ambassador for oceans and fisheries who is heading the us 
negotiating team 
wolfe said us officials discussed with the soviets the 
possibility of either a permanent or temporary moratorium on 
fishing by foreign trawlers in the doughnut hole one of the 
richest fishing grounds in the world 
in addition the negotiators will take a look at whether the 
united states and the soviet union could enforce such a ban under 
international law or if efforts should be made to include other 
countries in imposing a fishing moratorium 
its going pretty much according to script and we are just 
laying everything out said wolfe 
wolfe said he couldnt comment on the soviets reaction to the 
us suggestions officials in the fisheries department at the 
soviet embassy were unavilable for comment 
about 20 us negotiators including representatives of the 
departments of state commerce and defense and the coast guard 
attended the first day of talks while the soviets were represented 
by about six officials 
the catch by foreign vessels in the 4500square mile doughnut 
hole roughly in the center of the bering sea has risen from about 
200000 metric tons in 1984 to over 1 million metric tons in 1987 
last month wolfe told a senate committee that besides bottom 
fish there are indications that the foreign fleet may be catching 
salmon and herring in the area 
the senate earlier this year overwhelmingly approved a 
resolution calling on the state department to negotiate a fishing 
moratorium in the bering sea 
us scientists are concerned that overfishing in the doughnut 
hole may eventually affect the catch in american waters wolfe 
said the soviets share those concerns 
representatives of the us fishing industry and the coast guard 
also suspect that foreign vessels use the doughnut hole as a 
staging ground for illegal forays into the 200mile american 
economic zone 
in january american fishermen chartered a plane and videotaped 
seven foreign trawlers which they said were illegally fishing 38 
miles inside the us economic zone off alaska the videotapes 
prompted the national oceanic and atmospheric administration to 
levy 100000 in fines against three japanese companies 
while the governments of japan china south korea and poland 
were not invited to participate in the ussoviet talks wolfe 
said he would sit down with them later to see if a multilateral 
accord was possible 
soviet and american waters surround the doughnut hole and it 
is not possible for foreign vessels to enter the area without 
passing through the us and soviet economic zones

farmers continued to get a declining share of 
the consumer food dollar in 1987 an agriculture department report 
said monday 
a selected market basket of grocery items used by economists to 
track price changes for food commodities showed that farmers 
received an equivalent of 29 cents for each dollar spent by 
consumers on those items 
the farm value share of the retail price of food in the market 
basket has declined one percentage point a penny of each dollar 
spent since it averaged 34 percent or 34 cents in the 1984 
calendar year 
according to usda records going back to 1913 when farmers got 
46 percent of the food dollar the annual share has been at record 
low levels the last three years 31 percent in 1985 30 percent in 
1986 and 29 percent in 1987 
previously the low mark was a farm value share of 32 percent 
during 1932 and 1933 in the depths of the depression it rose to 
more than 50 percent during world war ii and for a few years after 
with 29 percent of the retail cost of market basket going to 
farmers that means the remaining 71 percent went to those who 
handle raw food products after they leave the farm 
the market basket contains average quantities of domestically 
produced food bought in grocery stores excluding nonalcoholic 
beverages and fish and seafood

pennzoil co on monday announced plans to pay 
250 million in cash for an oil field equipment company but said 
the purchase had nothing to do with the 3 billion it recently 
received to settle its fouryear legal battle with texaco inc 
under the agreement which was unanimously approved by the board 
of directors of facet enterprises inc a cash tender offer of 32 
per share by a newly created pennzoil subsidiary will commence as 
soon as practicable pennzoil spokesman robert harper said 
tulsa oklabased facet had been fighting off an unfriendly 
takeover attempt by the prospect group inc which extended its 
latest offer of 2750 per share through 5 pm edt thursday facet 
had rejected two tender offers from the new yorkbased company 
pennzoil informed facet that it has on hand sufficient cash to 
complete the transaction and that there were no financing 
conditions to the tender offer and merger 
we believe facets management is a vital resource and a 
crucial part of this transaction said randal b mcdonald 
pennzoils president and chief operating officer 
we are hopeful the present management will continue in their 
positions 
facet manufactures and markets filters under the purolator brand 
name and for the private label market it also manufactures and 
markets transportation components filters and filtration systems 
and oil field production equipment 
pennzoil intends to operate facet as a separate entity and keep 
its headquarters in tulsa mcdonald said 
we are delighted that our efforts to maximize stockholders 
investment in facet have resulted in an agreement which provides a 
fair price for their shares said james malone president and 
chief executive officer of facet 
in addition we are confident that a combination with a 
company having the stature and financial resources of pennzoil will 
be beneficial to our employees suppliers customers and 
community 
the acquisition of facet is on the heels of a 3 billion payment 
from texaco that ended their courtroom battles over getty oil co 
but harper said the company had cash available for the 
acquisition before the settlement with texaco 
we had been looking at this possibility for a number of weeks 
prior to the settlement harper said i really dont think that 
you can put those two things together 
earlier this month texaco agreed to pay pennzoil 3 billion to 
end the litigation and to allow the white plains nybased oil 
giant to emerge from nearly a year under federal bankruptcy court 
protection 
after the money was transferred into houstonbased pennzoils 
bank account pennzoil executives said they hadnt decided on 
longterm plans for the sum 
were going to look and have been looking for some time at 
ways to invest the money pennzoil chairman j hugh liedtke said 
warren shimmerlik an industry analyst at the new york office of 
merrill lynch said facet appeared to be a logical fit for pennzoil 
its a distribution and you can add something to it you can 
add some value and eliminate a lot of cost and apparently that is 
what appeals to pennzoil he said 
shimmerlik and charles andrew of the new york investment firm of 
john s herold amp co each said they were not sure if there was any 
link to the texaco payment 
this is so small relative to the magnitude to the money they 
got i dont know if id call it the beginning of a spree said 
andrew 
pennzoil states that by reinvesting the money they got from 
texaco into oil and gas properties they can postpone any payment 
in taxes i dont think this the facet merger would qualify so 
it may be this is not related to the money from texaco andrew 
said 
in november 1985 a houston jury shocked texaco by agreeing that 
texaco had wrongfully interferred in a planned pennzoilgetty 
merger and awarded pennzoil 1053 billion in damages the largest 
civil award in us history 
texaco appealed a state appeals court upheld the verdict but 
reduced the 3 billion in punitive damages to 1 billion 
on april 12 1987 texaco filed for bankruptcy protection 
saying it had to do so to avoid posting a potentially runious bond 
to continue its appeal of the judgment

home shopping network inc sued drexel burnham 
lambert inc on monday accusing the investment firm of fraud in 
connection with its sale of 100 million in hsn convertible bonds 
to european investors last year 
the shopbytelevision retailer said in a suit filed in us 
district court in tampa fla that drexel fraudulently induced 
home shopping to allow a new conversion price to be set for 
swapping the bonds for hsn stock 
the suit also accused drexel and the head of its highyield 
investment bond group michael milken of secretly funneling the 
securities to its regular network of junk bond buyers and then 
acting in conjunction with the network to manipulate the hsn stock 
price downward during the 30day period for setting the new 
conversion price 
a drexel spokesman steve anreder said the firm had not yet 
seen the lawsuit but it sounds like home shopping network is 
unhappy with the market performance of its securities over which 
we have no control 
hsns action comes against a background of a broad government 
inquiry into drexels operations that arose partly because of the 
firms reported past business links with speculator and 
insidertrader ivan f boesky now serving a threeyear prison term 
for securities fraud 
drexel has denied any improper activities and hasnt been 
charged with any wrongdoing 
the hsn suit asked for invalidation of the pricereset provision 
in the bond sale and requested unspecified monetary damages for 
securities fraud breach of fiduciary duty and other violations 
hsn chairman roy speer said that in addition to the lawsuit the 
company filed a complaint with the securities and exchange 
commission against drexel and milken charging them with 
manipulating hsns stock 
when the bonds were sold last april they carried an original 
conversion price of 2580 per share at that price the company 
would have had to issue about 39 million shares of stock to redeem 
all the bonds 
but hsn said that after the bond offering was closed it agreed 
at drexels request to include a provision to allow a new 
conversion price to be set at the 30day average of hsns share 
price prior to the april 22 conversion date plus a 20 percent 
premium 
at the time of the bond issue hsn was trading at about 18 a 
share on the american stock exchange said nando di filippo hsn 
executive vice president he said the stock had fallen to about 8 
a share when the reset period started on march 10 and has fallen as 
low as 487 a share since then 
although the reset period does not expire until thursday di 
filippo said it appears the conversion price will be about 650 
which he said could result in the issuance of up to about 14 
million shares of stock 
that amount would not mean a change in control of the video 
retailer but it would dilute the value of the companys 
outstanding stock he said 
home shopping based in st petersburg fla operates two 
television networks that offer items ranging from electronics 
equipment to jewelry for sale to viewers who call while the items 
are displayed 
for the year ended aug 31 1987 the company reported a profit 
of 295 million or 33 cents per share on sales of 5821 million

a jury found in favor of robehr on the breach of contract 
complaint and ordered american to pay 105 million in damages but 
found for the airline in the fraud complaint the jury voted in 
favor of robehr in americans countersuit 
kenneth steinthal the attorney representing american airlines

high damage award and nothing to indicate the plaintiff lost any 
money 
the airline will ask judge richard j daronco on april 28 to set 
aside the verdict as being unsupported by evidence steinthal said

the ruling we obviously will be filing the appropriate motion to
