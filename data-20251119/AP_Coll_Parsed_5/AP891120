congress on monday rejected attempts to 
restrict us military aid to wartorn el salvador heeding 
president bushs admonition not to further weaken the countrys 
freely democratically elected government 
amid bitter and at times personal debate the house voted 
215194 on a procedural move that effectively kept the restrictions 
from being added to a 146 billion foreign aid bill the measure 
includes 533 million for poland and hungary and military and 
economic support for us friends and allies around the world 
the house then voted 310107 to approve the foreign aid measure 
and sent it to the senate where a similar amendment was rejected 
on a vote of 5839 the senate then approved the bill on a voice 
vote and sent it to bush 
this is a terrible amendment said minority leader bob dole 
rkan if we pass it we reward the communist terrorists and 
punish the democratically elected government 
but the past weeks violence in el salvador appeared to have 
created a shift of roughly 20 votes in the senate since the body 
voted 8218 sept 20 for military aid with no conditions 
later underscoring congressional outrage over last weeks 
murders of six jesuit priests their housekeeper and her daughter 
the house approved a nonbinding resolution asserting that bringing 
the killers to justice would be instrumental in determining 
continued us support for el salvador the vote was 4093 
rep david bonior dmich said lawmakers were coming under 
heavy pressure from christian groups to take action against el 
salvador including heavy lobbying and demonstrations at some 
members district offices 
in washington the national conference of catholic bishops 
expressed support for proposals to withhold substantial portions 
of military aid while the performance of the salvadoran government 
and military is tested 
opponents of us aid heckled bush during an appearance in 
chicago others in washington repeatedly interrupted senate floor 
proceedings and capitol police forcibly ejected several protesters 
from the chamber 
house action came just a few hours after bush said a cutoff of 
us military aid to the new government of rightist president 
alfredo cristiani would be absolutely unacceptable a pitched 
weeklong battle against the leftist fmln guerrillas was winding 
down monday as the rebels withdrew from san salvador into the 
countryside 
there is a freely elected government doing their very best 
trying to get protection from these marxistled guerrillas coming 
into the center of the city and we support president cristiani in 
his effort to restore order bush told reporters as he boarded 
air force one for a day of campaigning for gop candidates 
this is not the time to undermine a fragile democracy that is 
under attack its totally unacceptable and the day of these 
marxist attacks should end right now bush said 
my pitch is this that we must not pull away from a freely 
democratically elected government that had certification of the 
freedom of those elections he said 
debate on aid to el salvador demonstrated clearly that the new 
violence in that central american country including the the six 
jesuits and two apparent witnesses to the murders last week had 
reawakened longdormant congressional tensions 
rep david obey dwis had proposed to add language that would 
have held back 30 percent of this fiscal years military money 
until after april 1 of next year the stated intent was to keep 
pressure on the salvadoran government to solve the jesuit murders 
which some believe are a result of the resurgence of rightwing 
death squads the bill includes a cap of 85 million on military 
aid for the year 
in the senate another version of the amendment was proposed by 
sen patrick leahy dvt it would have withheld 30 percent of the 
military aid until the killers of the priests were apprehended and 
brought to trial 
to rush into this breech with this kind of amendment is 
suicide gentlemen for that country argued rep gerald solomon 
rny this amendment is a selective response to a great 
tragedy 
this is not a debate over who are the good guys and who are 
the bad guys countered rep joe moakley dmass this is a 
debate over whether the united states has an obligation to assure 
that taxpayer dollars are going to a government that protects human 
rights 
bush said he had personally told cristiani how strongly we 
feel about the killings 
and i told him that they must get to the bottom of it i am 
convinced they will the people who did this whether they come 
from the extreme left or the extreme right pay the penalty bush 
said 
bush had vetoed another version of the bill a day earlier 
because he objectd to two sections a family planning provision 
opposed by antiabortion forces and a ban on use of foreign aid 
money to persuade allies to do things that the united states cannot 
legally do itself 
on the latter issue rep david obey dwis worked out a 
compromise that would ban any quid pro quo with a foreign 
country in which us aid money is traded for policy moves that are 
against the law in the united states the compromise was more 
narrowly drawn than an earlier version which the administration 
contended would have had a chilling effect on conduct by us 
officials and diplomats 
sen robert kasten rwis said that change was inadequate for 
the administration but that a second veto of the bill could be 
avoided by attaching a legislative fix to another bill perhaps 
the mustpass deficitcutting measure expected to come up on 
tuesday 
on the abortion matter a group of abortionrights house 
supporters blasted the veto with rep barbara boxer dcalif 
contending bush acted because of a blind promise to the right 
wing of the republican party which is against family planning 
she said the rejected bill had included language that would have 
prevented any of the disputed money from going to abortions

president bush on monday vetoed the 
annual bill appropriating money for the district of columbia 
because it would allow funds from local taxes to be spent on 
abortion 
it was bushs second abortionrelated veto in two days with 
congress eager to adjourn before thanksgiving and no chance for an 
override the house by voice vote immediately passed a new bill 
without the objectionable provision and sent it to the senate 
which followed suit just before midnight 
on sunday bush vetoed the 146 billion foreign aid bill because 
it contained 15 million for a united nations population control 
agency that operates in china bush said aid to the un agency 
would make the united states a party to coerced abortions resulting 
from chinas onechildperfamily policy 
are there no limits to how far this president will go to show 
poor women whos boss in this country complained rep les 
aucoin dore now we see the president trying to be the mayor of 
the district of columbia 
but the veto was hailed by an antiabortion organization god 
bless president bush for refusing to sign a death warrant for 3000 
unborn babies susan a smith spokeswoman for the national right 
to life committee said in a statement 
it was the second time bush vetoed the dc appropriations bill 
over the abortion issue his earlier veto was in october 
the president who was returning to washington from a campaign 
trip on behalf of two prochoice republican candidates sent a 
message to the house saying the bill was unacceptable 
bush said the bill would permit congressionally appropriated 
local funds to be used for abortion on demand with no restriction 
whatsoever as a matter of law the use of local funds in the 
district of columbia must be approved by the congress and the 
president 
white house chief of staff john sununu spoke with house speaker 
thomas foley dwash earlier monday and foley asked for quick 
action on the bill so congress would have a chance to act again 
before leaving for the holidays according to presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the bill would have restricted use of medicaid funds for 
abortions only to save the life of the mother but bush objected to 
what he called abortion on demand paid for with other funds 
derived from local taxes but also appropriated by congress

the house banking committee girded monday for 
an appearance by the central figure in the collapse of a major 
savings and loan and later accusations of influence peddling 
unsure whether charles h keating jr would testify or remain 
silent 
until he sits down on tuesday we dont know what hes 
going to do joseph lewis a spokeman for the panel said of 
keating a phoenix ariz billionaire and owner of the now 
collapsed lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif 
keating contributed 13 million to the political causes of five 
us senators whose intervention with federal regulators in early 
1987 on behalf of lincoln is now being investigated by the senate 
ethics committee 
he was subpoenaed last month to be the final witness at the 
house panels hearing into why top regulators waited until april to 
seize lincoln two years after government examiners first 
recommended its takeover 
as the target of a federal grand jury probe in los angeles 
keating was being advised by attorneys to invoke a constitutional 
right not to testify according to one of his associates and 
congressional sources all of whom spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
he has every intention of appearing said bradley boland 
keatings soninlaw and executive vice president of his american 
continental corp of phoenix lincolns holding company what 
hes going to say when he gets there i dont know 
also in los angeles investors in 200 million in bonds sold by 
american continental asked a federal court monday to freeze more 
than 100 million they said was illegally transferred to banks 
overseas us district judge steve wilson scheduled a hearing dec 
4 on the request 
the committee also was scheduled to hear tuesday from m dannny 
wall who as chairman of the federal home loan bank board removed 
jurisdiction over lincoln from the agencys san francicso office 
after regulators there recommended closing it down 
the house panels chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas 
repeatedly has blamed wall for allowing lincoln to remain open as 
its losses mounted and has asked president bush to fire wall the 
estimated cost of the federal rescue of lincoln is 2 billion 
wall in turn has repeatedly accused gonzalez of conducting the 
lincoln hearings unfairly in refusing to allow him to testify until 
tuesday 
other witnesses tuesday include rosemary stewart and darrel 
dochow walls top aides at the bank board and the agency that 
replaced it last summer the office of thrift supervision as part 
of a 150 billionplus taxpayer bailout of the sampl industry 
dochow assumed responsibility for regulating lincoln after wall 
stripped the agencys san franciso office of that role ms stewart 
is the author of a 1988 side letter to a memorandum of 
understanding between the bank board and lincoln assuring the 
thrift that no information about its activites would be referred to 
criminal authorities 
we have both ends of the string here the regulator and the 
owner of the institution said lewis if both parties are 
forthcoming we should walk out of there with all the mysteries 
pretty much unraveled 
according to congressional sources keatings attorneys last 
week asked the committee if he could invoke his fifth amendment 
right to not answer questions without having to appear before the 
panel 
lewis confirmed there had been several phone conversations in 
the past week between the committees lawyers and attorneys for 
keating but would not discuss their content keatings primary 
attorney in the case john quinn of los angeles did not return 
phone calls to his office monday 
securities and exchange commission chairman richard c breeden 
told the house panel last week that his agency has turned over 
information to a criminal grand jury investigating keating 
breeden also said that the secs own investigation of keating 
and his companies rivals in size its probe of convicted stock 
trader ivan boesky and other inside dealings on wall street and 
that he is willing to further double the resources devoted to it if 
necessary 
lincoln was seized by the bank board one day after its holding 
company american continental filed for bankruptcy reorganization 
regulators have complained that the bankruptcy move has prevented 
them from obtaining records to determine the extent of lincolns 
losses 
but they have filed a suit against keating and his associates 
alleging that fraud racketeering and a variety of other illegal 
acts were directly responsible for losses of 11 billion 
the senate ethics committee meanwhile last week hired an 
outside private counsel to investigate the role of the five 
senators who received a total of 13 million from keating 
the senators alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini 
dariz john mccain rariz donald w riegle jr dmich and 
john glenn dohio have all denied any wrongdoing

despite a history as a sexual predator westley 
allen dodd never served more than 10 months in prison and 
eventually went back to the streets after each conviction now he 
stands accused of killing three young boys 
his arrest last week was the latest in a spate of sex offender 
cases that has shocked the northwest and added impetus to 
washington states effort to crack down on violent sex criminals 
while he might have been forced to move on the 28yearold dodd 
was never forced to quit 
prison and jail sentences were reduced to months and days 
ordered to treatment dodd went as long as was required and then 
promptly quit 
after a 1987 conviction a psychologist recommended that dodd be 
confined although he acknowledged that the law might not offer 
officials that option kenneth l von cleve said he found in dodd 
the most extensive sexual predator history he had ever seen in a 
man that young dodd was 26 and had detailed dozens of molestations 
involving young boys in idaho and washington 
the governors task force on community protection has come up 
with a model law that could provide help for law enforcement 
officials faced with controlling sexual deviants 
thats the kind of person our recommendations are making a 
catchnet for said task force member helen harlow of tacoma said 
of dodd 
harlow was named to the task force after her 7yearold son was 
sexually mutilated in may a sex offender who had been released 
from jail was accused of raping the boy and cutting off his penis 
the man awaits trial 
the 24member task force is due to report to gov booth gardner 
on nov 28 its recommendations for handling sexual predators 
people who stalk victims they dont know isolate them and move in 
for their attack 
the issue is expected to be at the top of the list when the 
legislature convenes in january lawmakers are expected to approve 
100 million for community protection and stronger laws 
the task forces recommendations include longer prison 
sentences registering sex offenders and carrying juvenile offenses 
into adult records more responsiveness toward victims and 
perhaps most important providing civil commitment for persons 
judged to be a danger to the community 
when were dealing with sexually predatory behavior we can 
get a hold on them prior to committing some outrageous horrible 
crime king county prosecutor norm maleng said of civil 
commitment 
only minnesota has laws providing for civil action to deal with 
future dangerousness and preventive detention 
the recommendations did not give specifics on how such action 
might be taken 
dodd is charged with two counts of aggravated firstdegree 
murder in the labor day stabbing deaths of william neer 10 and 
his 11yearold brother cole whose bodies were found in a park a 
few blocks from dodds apartment in vancouver 
he is also charged with aggravated firstdegree murder in the 
strangling of 4yearold lee joseph iseli of portland ore whose 
body was found nov 1 near vancouver across the columbia river 
dodd who is being held without bond faces arraignment nov 28 
conviction on any of the aggravated murder charges would bring a 
sentence of death or life in prison without parole arraignment was 
set for nov 28 
dodd was arrested after authorities said he tried to abduct a 
6yearold boy from a movie theater in camas 15 miles east of 
vancouver he is charged with firstdegree attempted kidnapping and 
firstdegree attempted murder in that case 
it just points out the need that there are some people we have 
to put away forever said ida ballasiotes another task force 
member 
she was appointed to the group after her daughter diane 
ballasiotes was abducted in seattle and killed a year ago by a 
workrelease inmate who had been adjudged a sexual psychopath 
gardner created the task force last spring amid a public outcry 
over the ballasiotes death and the attack on ms harlows son 
dodds history of sexual deviancy dates to age 13 when he 
exposed himself to other children from a window of his richland 
wash home according to court records 
over the past 15 years his activities increased but he avoided 
lengthy punishment or incarceration even though prosecutors said 
they tried him as strictly as the evidence allowed 
dodd served 118 days in jail after a 1987 seattle conviction for 
attempted unlawful imprisonment a gross misdemeanor he attempted 
to lure an 8yearold seattle boy into a vacant building 
in a lewiston idaho case in 1984 dodd ended up serving 10 
months but only after violating parole terms of a 10year sentence 
for maintaining contact with a victim who was a minor 
a sixmonth sentence on a morals charge was suspended in 
richland in 1982 on condition he get treatment though dodd served 
23 days after failing to meet the treatment requirement 
von cleve whose bellevue practice deals with a wide variety of 
sex offenders believes the solution lies in lengthy probations so 
that courts retain for many years a kind of control over offenders 
they violate probation and theyd be right back before the 
judge von cleve said

there are increasing signs the 
governments pledge to end racial segregation of beaches and public 
amenities could lead to conflict as well as reconciliation 
a rightwing politician says the move will fuel a spirit of 
rebellion among whites opposed to integration 
and liberals are questioning the governments sincerity 
following a cabinet ministers comment that sensitive 
facilities such as health clinics swimming pools and campgrounds 
might remain segregated 
the initial reaction to president fw de klerks announcement 
thursday was generally positive with the predictable exception of 
the farright conservative party 
however de klerks pledge that the separate amenities act would 
be scrapped as soon as possible was undercut the next day when 
provincial affairs minister hernus kriel said the repeal might not 
occur in the upcoming parliamentary session 
kriel said there was uncertainty in the cabinet about how to 
deal with sensitive areas and suggested that some facilities 
including swimming pools might be reserved solely for the use of 
local residents 
since residential areas are racially segregated this would 
effectively maintain the whitesonly status of swimming pools in 
white areas even if the separate amenities act were repealed 
tian van der merwe chairman of the antiapartheid democratic 
party said kriels remarks suggested de klerks announcement may 
have been little more than a publicity stunt 
the government is showing it is sensitive to racial obsession 
and that it is unable to do away with apartheid he said it is 
contemptible 
kriel said the governing national party did not want to move so 
fast that racial conflict resulted 
this is a transitional phase he said if something goes 
wrong during this phase it could seriously retard the reform 
process 
however rightwing whites already have signaled they are ready 
for confrontation they include johann oosthuisen mayor of the 
conservative partycontrolled town of mossel bay who wants to keep 
the local beach off limits to blacks 
i want to warn the government that there is beginning a spirit 
of rebellion amongst the whites throughout soth africa 
oosthuisen said in a defiant statement after de klerk called for 
immediate opening of all beaches 
oosthuisen complained that the government was threatening court 
action against white officials who resisted beach integration while 
taking no action when banners of the outlawed south african 
communist party were displayed at recent black opposition rallies 
the conservative party is ready as always to protect the 
rights of whites come what may the mayor said he suggested 
that national party members were for the first time grasping 
the full implications of the governments reform program and 
might decide to defect 
the conservative party leader andries treurnicht said the 
opening of public amenities amounted to a theft from the white 
communities which had paid for them 
such angry rhetoric has prompted widespread fears of a white 
backlash 
the citizen a progovernment newspaper said in an editorial 
the danger is that the more the conservative party is frustrated 
the greater chance of rightwing extremists turning to violence 
which if not stamped out could result in a race conflict that 
could destroy this country 
antiapartheid leaders meanwhile called for repeal of 
politically repressive laws and depicted de klerks announcement as 
a victory for a nationwide defiance campaign waged since august 
the campaign has included protests at which blacks sought to use 
whitesonly pools beaches hospitals libraries and parks 
the proposed repeal of the separate amenities act is a 
vindication of the view that it is the people themselves through 
mass united action who can bring down the institutions and the 
legacy of apartheid said new nation a militant blackedited 
newspaper 
the needs of the people are urgent and will not be tied down 
to the sluggish agenda of the regime new nation said it is 
for this reason that the government will continuously follow at the 
heels of the masses formalizing into law what ordinary people are 
already practicing

ja virginia es gibt einen nikolaus there 
is a santa claus 
traditionally the jolly old bagman with the braumeisters belly 
doesnt make the german scene until dec 6 the feast of st 
nicholas but christmas is pouring through the holes in the berlin 
wall weeks ahead of schedule 
like old fezziwig in charles dickens a christmas carol the 
whole city east and west is one vast substantial smile 
instead of growing furious at the 2 million poor relations 
thronging the chic downtown streets and at the clouds of exhaust 
rising from the endless influx of snorting twocylinder east german

champagne and a government welcome gift of 54 spending money 
for the children arriving wideeyed with wonder these weekend 
shopping sprees are like being invited into santas workshop for 
advance consultation on their wish list 
but it is the old people who remember berlin before the war and 
especially before the wall and thought they would never see it 
again who now really believe in santa claus

at west berlins sprawling kadewe department store 
of course she will never buy them whispered sales clerk 
jacqueline brenz but for once her life let her walk up and down

a few aisles away a team of beauticians from paris demonstrated 
a new line of guerlain cosmetics called samsara 
they coaxed a frumpy east berlin woman onto the models tall 
stool tweaked and blackened her eyelashes applied a magenta 
lipstick removed the shadow of a mustache with brush strokes of 
peach pancake makeup and fluffed out the steely gray hair that had 
been primly pinned up in a bun 
maurice chevalier said there is no such thing as an old

microphone only a more mature more experienced woman 
the audience of east germans blocking the aisle laughed 
uproariously at the blushing grossmutter who liked what she saw in 
the mirror 
it was already 20 minutes past closing time but santas elves 
in the thirdfloor toy department patiently demonstrated a 
computerized chess tutor and the hitech talking robot to 
an enthralled knot of east berlin youngsters

jackets with a woolen scarf wrapped around six times and a ski cap

here you are in the age of aids preparing 
for surgery that may require a transfusion is the blood available 
from the local blood bank safe should you have some of your own 
set aside 
yes and yes doctors say 
what if you just want some of your blood on hand in case youre 
hit by a truck or need an emergency operation is that worthwhile 
probably not say the american red cross and tradtional blood 
banks 
yes say those who freeze and store blood for a fee 
a blood transfusion is the most intimate contact you can have 
with another human being it is more intimate than sex said dr 
joseph feldschuh of new york who founded an independent frozen 
blood lab in 1985 the food and drug administration says 18 such 
companies are licensed in the united states 
freezing blood for longterm storage is nothing new the red 
cross has been doing it without charge since 1964 for people with 
rare blood and has 10000 pints in frozen storage at 56 centers 
nondonors may use it in emergencies 
companies began getting into freezing four or five years ago 
because of aids anxiety but there has been a low level of such 
activity said dr toby simon president of the american 
association of blood banks 
the pentagon kicked off the worlds largest frozen blood program 
in october a fiveyear project to draw 45000 pints a year toward 
stockpiling 225000 pints domestically and abroad for use during 
combat or disasters 
medical authorities including the american medical association 
agree that whether the concern is disease or simply the best match 
the safest blood you can receive is your own but freezing blood on 
speculation is another matter 
liquid blood has a shelf life of 42 days while frozen blood can 
be kept 20 years or more but dealing with frozen blood which must 
be thawed and cleaned of chemicals added during freezing is 
expensive and there is no guarantee it will be available where and 
when it is needed simon said 
most us transfusions are for surgery and there is generally 
time for a patient to have blood drawn a few weeks beforehand he 
said 
in an emergency the chance of contracting disease through a 
transfusion pales beside the risk of dying without it said dr 
arthur kellermann director of emergency services at the regional 
medical center at memphis and a professor of emergency medicine at 
the university of tennessee memphis 
but james w jarvis who runs a miamibased blood storage 
company said setting aside a permanent supply can provide a 
layer of protection for your family and yourself that is not 
otherwise there his personal blood storage of america inc 
recently opened an office near the federal express air shipment hub 
in memphis guaranteeing delivery anywhere in the country in six 
hours 
six hours can be too long in an emergency kellermann said we 
literally may need to give a patient blood within five or 10 
minutes of coming in the door emergency rooms often lack time 
even to crossmatch a patients blood and must simply give typeo 
the socalled universal donor he said 
the red cross and military frozen blood programs have nothing to 
do with fear of disease said dr gerald sandler the red cross 
medical director the risk of getting aids through a transfusion is 
about one in 100000 better than the odds of getting through 
your operation he said 
a greater statistical risk is hepatitis with the chances of 
infection at two to four in 100 per pint of blood a new screening 
test to be used starting next year is expected to reduce that to 
one in a hundred or less 
those risks are enough feldschuh said for concern his idant 
laboratories will store a pint of blood for 1250 a month plus 
85 in drawing and testing fees and about 45 for processing when 
its time to use the blood 
at personal blood storage it costs 295 to store a pint for 
four years and 4 a month after that additional charges totaling 
125 are likely when the blood is used plus any shipping said 
spokeswoman laura hardy 
on average a person getting a transfusion gets four pints says 
the red cross which collects half of the 12 million pints of blood 
drawn annually in the united states it puts the average cost of a 
pint of blood at 52 hospital fees may add 50 to that said bob 
rigney of the blood bank association 
most medical insurance does not pay for storing blood on 
speculation but generally covers all costs when its time to use 
the blood said jarvis whose company has freezers in florida and 
south carolina as well as memphis 
he wouldnt say how many customers he has or how much blood is 
in the freezers idant a subsidiary of daxor corp which runs 
what it bills as the worlds largest frozen sperm bank also 
wouldnt release those figures 
its not a business where anybody is going to make money for 
quite a while i feel this is the wave of the future 
feldschuh said 
the issue of frozen storage aside the red cross and american 
association of blood banks are trying to convince people to set 
aside their own blood prior to surgery for what is called 
autologous transfusions besides being safer for the patients 
autologous donations reduce the demand on blood banks 
there was a dramatic increase for several years for autologous 
donations but its kind of leveled off simon said were not 
certain whether its being optimally utilized everywhere or not 
in 1987 member hospitals blood banks and doctors drew 283000 
autologous pints a 55 percent increase over 1986 figures and 
1986 was a 50 percent jump over 1985 said spokesman rigney he 
did not have later figures 
the red cross last year drew 116400 autologous pints compared 
with 5500 in 1985 and hospitals with active surgical departments 
have encouraged it 
for autologous blood drawn prior to surgery it is reasonable 
sandler said for many patients to give blood two or three times a 
week in building up a stock of five or six pints two years ago he 
said the red cross checked on 3000 people who had their own blood 
in frozen storage because of rare types and found that 20 of them 
had actually needed transfusions 
of the 20 out of the 3000 every one of them could have done 
it in a much much less expensive way of waiting to have blood 
drawn until they knew they needed surgery said sandler who 
worries that companies sales pitches will weaken public confidence 
in traditional blood banks you cant market to the public the 
concept of freezing your own blood without marketing fear of the 
blood that most people in the community have to use 
we are not playing on anybodys fears jarvis said we are 
taking the entrepreneurial spirit that has built this country and 
applying it to science and medicine

if all goes according to plan and theres 
every likelihood that it wont a space shuttle will leave its 
florida launch pad in march 1995 carrying the first pieces of 
americas space station into orbit 
ten flights and 28 months later by the same shaky timetable 
the parts flown up piece by piece will have been assembled into a 
place where men and women can live and work for months at a time 
looking down at the earth as they silently drift across the sky 250 
miles high 
by august 1999 seven years late but just in time for the 21st 
century the space station will be finished serving as a basic 
research laboratory for medicine astronomy space physics and as 
a staging area for manned flights to the moon and beyond 
mostly what stands in the way of this rosy scenario is money 
space station freedom as it is named began as an 8 billion 
10year project when president reagan announced it in 1984 it has 
grown into a 15year marathon likely to cost 19 billion or well 
over 30 billion depending on whose figures you use 
from the start the space station has had problems with money as 
well as with identity and purpose former sen william proxmire of 
wisconsin summed up the feelings of many in congress when he called 
the space station a project in search of a mission 
nasa administrator richard truly a former astronaut considers 
the space station the cornerstone to our future in space but 
admits the program has had a sputtering past 
in the last five years space station freedom has undergone 11 
major reviews has faced nearly continual readjustments of its 
budget has had a great deal of management turnover and has 
experienced several configuration and schedule changes he says 
the management turnover reached its peak in may and june of this 
year when three top space station executives left nasa 
the budgeting process for the fiscal year that began oct 1 
the year in which the design phase ends and cutting of metal begins 
illustrates the stations travails 
president bush proposed that nasa get 205 billion for the 
space station but the house appropriations committee in july 
decided to chop off 400 million with that prospect the space 
agency made plans for a 20 percent reduction only to readjust when 
actual appropriations ended as 185 billion 
the thing thats really tough is the funding instability in 
the program says william t lenoir the nasa associate 
administrator and former astronaut who reversed a trend and 
returned to the agency from private life this year to take charge 
of the space flight and space station programs 
in june of every year we dont know what the hell we are going 
to get in october he says this year beginning in june we 
slowed the progress of the space station down because if we had 
continued to build on schedule there was a real danger that wed 
get to october and be firing contractors and laying off civil 
service employees 
the house committee on science and technology authorized 
threeyear funding for nasa to give space programs some stability 
however congressional appropriations committees who vote the 
actual money have not gone along 
so nasa has to live with the uncertainty 
we are very much prejudiced to starting to construct the space 
station in march 1995 lenoir says the choices then boil down 
he says to can we start either less of a station in march 1995 
or can we start in 1995 and let it take longer to complete and 
last on our list is okay we cant start in 1995 
the station is americas big project for the next decade even 
president bushs space goal for returning americans to the moon and 
then pushing on to mars requires that a space station be in place 
first 
when reagan in his 1984 state of the union message directed 
nasa to build the station within a decade there were giddy plans 
for having it up and running in 1992 to celebrate the 500year 
anniversary of columbus discovery of america 
to cut down on the spiraling cost nasa a few years ago divided 
the station building program into two phases intending to finish 
one before starting the other now nobody talks about the second 
block 
the latest plan envisions limiting crew size to four until the 
station is able to support a permanent crew of eight planned for 
july 1997 there will be only 375 kilowatts of power available 
until that time when it will be doubled the smaller the amount of 
power the fewer the experiments that can be run 
nasa had planned to develop a new highpressure space suit at a 
cost of some 200 million instead the existing shuttle space suit 
will be used for the space walks that will be required to assemble 
the station nasa says it wants to reduce the need for space walks 
anyway 
one plan under consideration to save both money and time is to 
develop a socalled shuttlec that would substitute a cargo 
container for the shuttle orbiter and provide more than double the 
cargocarrying capacity such a method could cut out up to seven of 
the 16 shuttle trips now planned to bring station parts into orbit 
what will the station look like in the present configuration 
there would be a truss 5085 feet long constructed from long tubes 
made of a composite material with a protective coating and joined 
like a childs tinker toy set 
two us modules the laboratory and the living quarters 
would be attached to the truss each is 145 feet wide and 44 feet 
long the japanese and european modules are of similar size 
on each end of the truss would be attached two huge photovoltaic 
arrays looking like giant windmill paddles to gather power from 
the sun two smaller structures would radiate heat out of the 
modules another structure will be a telerobotic servicer a 
sophisticated crane capable of performing precise manipulations in 
space 
the habitation module divided into a quiet zone a buffer zone 
and an active zone is where the crew meets eats sleeps 
exercises has recreation and receives medical attention if needed 
truly says that without the space station the future we dream 
of will never become the present we experience 
the working quarters of the space station will be five times the 
size of its soviet counterpart mir it will produce 10 times as 
much electrical power as skylab allowing experiments never before 
possible 
an evolved space station he says is the first essential 
step toward moving again beyond earth orbit into the solar 
system and from that will spring the return to the moon and 
journey to mars 
each time we go to the frontier and beyond says truly we 
bring back more than we hoped for this time we have the chance to 
bring back more than we can imagine

walter mondale new coke michael dukakis 
home banking miniskirts and the knoxville worlds fair were among 
the worst marketing mishaps of the 1980s a business magazine 
reports 
during a decade when knowing the customer became increasingly 
important many companies and even whole industries failed to 
understand their markets american demographics magazine says in 
its december edition 
the staff of the magazine published by dow jones amp co 
combined to select the 10 blunders of the 1980s ranging from 
new coke to the decades democratic presidential contenders 
we werent interested in poor products but rather in missing 
the market most of these were really quality products but the 
industry didnt understand its consumers explained judith 
waldrop research editor for the magazine which concentrates on 
businessrelated population studies 
waldrop said she started the project a couple of years ago after 
hearing a discussion about the influence of marketing research 
versus business instincts in product decisions 
coke was the first thing that came to mind she said of the 
1985 decision by the cocacola co to abandon its traditional soft 
drink in favor of a new formula 
but coke forgot about the giant generation that controls much 
of american business the baby boom the magazine reported 
the millions of americans in that postworld war ii generation 
grew up with traditional coke and reacted angrily to the change 
eventually forcing the company to bring back the original product 
as coke classic 
today american demographics reports classic has 201 percent 
of the soft drink market while the costly campaign to sell new coke 
resulted in only a 14 percent share for that brand 
another blunder was the 1987 effort by designers to sell 
miniskirts to women 
i thought this was ridiculous said waldrop i just dont 
want to look like this in the job situation 
miniskirts were fun 20 years ago she explained but most women 
no longer find that hemline appropriate now explained the 
analysis they have career expectations family responsibilities 
and extra pounds 
the decades democratic presidential contenders meanwhile 
based their campaigns on the traditional new deal coalition of 
blacks organized labor and middleclass liberals the magazine 
commented 
during the decade the report pointed out blacks remained a 
small share of the voting population union membership fell 
significantly and ronald reagan skillfully attacked the traditional 
liberal faith in big government 
while democrats like jimmy carter mondale and dukakis continued 
to appeal to the coalitions of the past republicans styled 
themselves as the party of opportunity and won election after 
election the report observed 
some products were close calls but did not make the disaster 
list said waldrop including wine coolers smokeless cigarettes 
and nonalcoholic beverages in general 
in addition to the democrats new coke and miniskirts other 
business bungles on the list included 
motown sticking with its traditional soul and blues artists and 
missing the rapid growth of rap music which has rocketed into a 
multimilliondollar enterprise for other record labels 
motown missed the rap market because it got old with its 
original audience the magazine reported 
the knoxville worlds fair a century ago worlds fairs drew 
millions by showing off products and cultures that were unavailable 
elsewhere today americans can watch dozens of cable television 
channels leaving little to awe them and most who really want to 
see a foreign culture can travel there relatively quickly and 
easily without awe worlds fairs are doomed to go the way of 
small town circuses said the magazine 
sears roebuck and co lost a major segment of its market share 
to k mart and walmart during the decade by ignoring demographic 
changes 
sears concentrated on middleclass america the magazine said 
while the middleclass family was declining after the economic 
problems of the decade middleincome consumers are trained to look 
for bargains and discount stores are meeting the need 
in recent months sears introduced everyday low pricing and 
added a variety of brands in an effort to turn this around the 
jury is still out on this the magazine reports 
coleco industries made millions on the popular cabbage patch 
dolls in the middle of the decade but got stuck on that product 
in 1985 the dolls accounted for 85 percent of the companys sales 
so when the market became saturated income for coleco plummeted 
home banking was an idea that was ready technologically but 
not in consumers minds despite the presence of computers in 
millions of homes many banks tried to offer home banking services 
but abandoned the effort in the face of consumer disinterest 
grandparents magazine a quality product that failed when its 
marketers were unable to obtain mailing lists to target the sales 
to the correct audience 
burger kings herb the nerd campaign in which herb was 
supposed to represent an unsophisticated consumer who had never 
been to burger king instead consumers got the idea that only 
nerds went to the restaurant

a communist party newspaper exercising the

came to acquire luxury home furnishings from abroad while their 
countrymen had to do without 
canadian lumber italian floor mosaics west german bathroom 
tiles in grand onefamily houses with immense floor space 
was how the berliner zeitung described the officials 
wellappointed homes 
party officials who over four decades of unchallenged oneparty 
rule took advantage of their high positions to enrich themselves 
are widely resented 
there is a desperate shortage of construction materials in east 
germany and many people live in cramped apartments with relatives 
nonetheless the newspaper said a stateowned potsdam firm veb 
spezialbau potsdam has in years past been responsible for 
arranging for the import of expensive furnishings for the homes of 
highranking party officials 
the firms normal task is maintenance of buildings housing 
soviet troops in east germany the newspaper said in the article 
sunday 
we got simply everything from wherever it quoted one 
former employee as saying 
many top party officials live in an exclusive community north of 
berlin called wandlitz 
egon krenz the countrys new communist leader said in an 
interview with east german television sunday night that the 
situation was changing 
krenz said that he had since becoming party chief on oct 18

elderly blacks many of whom head home to the 
south when they retire later move back north in significant 
numbers say researchers who express surprise at the finding 
a stream of elderly blacks heading from states like new york to 
florida was expected but the counterflow was something nobody 
had even imagined before said sociologist charles f longino of 
the university of miami 
we dont know if they are going back home to be with their 
kids or what said longino in a telephone interview 
longino a specialist in the elderly and kenneth j smith 
reported their findings in a paper roots black return migration 
to the south presented this weekend at a gerontological meeting 
in minneapolis 
their finding of a large flow of elderly blacks from north to 
south duplicates earlier studies for the population in general 
however since blacks and whites have different rates of 
relocation the researchers did not compare the races 
comparing peoples residence as reported in the 1980 census with 
their homes five years earlier and their place of birth longino 
and smith found that major retirement streams flow in the reverse 
of historical black labor routes 
in other words many southern blacks left home for jobs in the 
north in their youth but returned home to friends family and 
lower costs of living when they retired later however many 
reversed that move 
the study was based on the movements of about 75600 elderly 
blacks over five years 
of those people the south saw 43520 move in and 30720 leave 
the west gained 10120 and lost 6000 the northeast received 9160 
and lost 21880 and 12800 arrived in the midwest while 17000 
departed 
the older migrants entering the southern region tend to be 
younger more often married and living independently while those 
leaving the south are older more often widowed and much more 
likely to be living dependently at their destination said 
longino and smith 
for example the average age of elderly blacks moving to the 
south was 685 45 percent of them were married and 195 percent 
were disabled for those moving back north the average age was 
729 only 21 percent were still married and 298 percent were 
disabled some 724 percent of those moving south lived 
independently while only 47 percent going back north maintained 
their own household 
one possibility longino suggested is that older blacks who are 
widowed and become dependent may head back north to be with their 
children another guess the researchers suggested is that they 
may retire and move south to care for their own elderly parents 
later returning north after those parents die 
to construct a likely scenario from these few population 
characteristics is like making an archeological reconstruction from 
only a few artifacts they said 
overall the researchers found that the largest numbers of older 
persons which the researchers defined as aged 60 and over moved 
from new york to florida north carolina south carolina and 
virginia in addition a significant retirement stream was reported 
from illinois to mississippi 
california was the leading attractor for black elderly people 
however a finding that the researchers termed contrary to our 
research expectations many of those heading for california came 
from texas and new york 
looking at people moving into states the study found nine 
states in which more than half of the older blacks moving in had 
been born in that state virginia west virginia north carolina 
south carolina georgia alabama mississippi arkansas and 
louisiana

one of the many problems confronting congress 
as it develops new farm legislation for 1990 is rice and how us 
producers will fare in the growing competition for world trade 
according to agriculture department forecasts the us rice 
inventory will drop by next aug 1 the end of the 198990 
marketing year to 237 million hundredweight from a seasonal 
carryover of 267 million this aug 1 and 314 million on aug 1 
1988 
total us production this year dropped to 1564 million 
hundredweight based on november surveys from 1594 million in 
1988 however from a historical standpoint this years harvest is 
one of the largest 
but for the fourth straight year according to usda record 
keepers us rice production is falling below total use thus the 
decline in yearend rice inventories 
the us rice supply is produced in half a dozen states led by 
arkansas which accounted for more than 638 million hundredweight 
this year or about 41 percent of the estimated 1989 harvest 
others include california with 324 million hundredweight this 
year louisiana 222 million mississippi 135 million missouri 
425 million and texas 202 million 
government policy plays a pivotal role in the us rice 
sector affecting virtually every rice producer and every rice 
sale whether for domestic or export use says the departments 
economic research service participation by growers in the 
annual rice price support and production adjustment program 
currently exceeds 90 percent 
and government programs figure mightily in us rice trade with 
more than 40 percent of us rice exports shipped as food aid or 
with governmentbacked credit 
moreover the agency said in its report when world supplies are 
large and prices drop sharply a marketing loan arrangement 
allows rice producers to repay usda price support loans at rates 
based on world market prices instead of the face value of the 
loans 
in that way rice can be sold at marketclearing levels instead 
of being locked up in storage as part of the surplus inventory held 
by usdas commodity credit corp 
taxpayer costs of rice marketing loans exceeded 400 million in 
198687 when world prices were well below the us loan rate but 
rising world prices have narrowed the gap and in 198889 the 
marketing loan costs were lowered to about 60 million the report 
said 
agency economists janet livezey c edwin young and nathan w 
childs noted in their report that rice one of the worlds major 
food grains is generally consumed within the country that produces 
it less than 5 percent enters world trade 
because of the uncertainty of monsoons in asia and the 
concentration of trade among a few key countries thailand is the 
largest exporter the united states is second the global rice 
market has earned the description of being thin volatile and 
risky the report said 
yet world rice trade has virtually doubled since the early 
1960s and has risen more than 50 percent since 1970 and countries 
outside of asia have accounted for an increasing share of the 
market 
middle eastern markets more than tripled between 1970 and 1981 
because of the regions economic growth and development increased 
revenues from oil sales and large us credit guarantees the 
report said african imports rose in response to income growth 
related to increased oil sales and to increases in food aid and 
credit assistance 
world rice trade leveled off in the mid1980s in part because 
of declining asian imports the report said also successful 
adoption of highyielding rice seed and improved methods allowed 
asia to approach selfsufficiency in rice 
the analysts said the united states will continue to face 
intense competition in the world rice market although 
fluctuations in world rice output will continue to influence rice 
trade these impacts will diminish as consumption outside of asia 
increases 
the united states faces the challenge of designing and 
maintaining policies regarding us competitiveness in the world 
rice market while constraining taxpayer outlays the report said 
several issues were raised by the analysts 
the need to balance export growth and maintenance of farm 
income against the costs of payments to farmers and the marketing 
loan program 
rice productions degree of dependence on government 
programs such as marketing loans and export subsidies 
competition of the united states in higher quality higher 
priced world rice markets 
policies concerning rice stockpiles and the need to continue 
with annual acreagereduction programs 
environmental damage involved in rice production and the 
proper allocation of available water supplies

a sheriffs unpublished book about the men 
who preceded him has a little bit of everything gruesome murders 
love triangles and other lurid crimes of passion 
but it is the unsolved 1935 shooting death of newport town 
marshal george conniff that has most consumed sheriff tony bamonte 
and led to an accusation that a retired police detective killed 
conniff 
a rusted pistol reclaimed from a river is the only piece of 
evidence bamonte has in the 54yearold case 
if the only thing ive done is bring the sunshine into this 
crime then justice is starting to be served said bamonte about 
his book which is to be published next summer bamonte sheriff in 
northwestern washingtons pend oreille county for the past 10 
years would not say who is publishing his work 
conniff was shot four times and killed after apparently 
confronting two men during the burglary of a creamery sept 15 
1935 the original investigation was closed and the slaying went 
unsolved 
that investigation and a witness pleas for another probe in the 
1950s also produced no arrests because bamonte contends police 
officers involved in the inquiry covered up the crime 
with the help of the spokane police department bamonte this 
year reopened the investigation after his research convinced him 
that conniff was slain by a fellow policeman involved in 
depressionera black market thefts of dairy products 
he is certain the killer is a 90yearold former spokane 
detective the man has not been charged and has refused to talk to 
authorities 
according to bamonte nbctvs unsolved mysteries is 
scheduled to broadcast a segment on conniffs slaying in january 
he said he hopes it will offer evidence he needs to bring charges 
if one person is alive that he has bragged to about the 
killing then as far as im concerned thats enough to ask for 
charges bamonte said last week hes 90 years old now and some 
people might look at him with sympathy but ive got to look past 
that 
theres also an ethical question because time lapses does 
that forgive a crime like this thats why society has put murder 
beyond the statute of limitations he said 
because many of the potential witnesses are dead and there is 
little physical evidence chances of bringing conniffs killer to 
trial are slim bamonte admits 
but he will still try 
a decent police officer was gunned down then shot once more 
when he was down bamonte said justice shouldnt escape 
something like this im obligated to do what im doing 
the key piece of evidence the corroded 32caliber pistol found 
in august under a downtown spokane river bridge is the probable 
murder weapon bamonte said 
the former detective who bamonte suspects reported that his 
32caliber offduty revolver had been stolen shortly after 
conniffs slaying 
bamonte has taped statements from two former spokane police 
officers that a superior told them another officer was in trouble 
and instructed to throw a package off a bridge one of the men 
recently died 
bamonte believes the package contained the pistol he found below 
the bridge after a utility company stopped the spokane rivers flow 
over a nearby dam in august 
the county prosecutors office has been given regular reports on 
bamontes investigation but has not decided to reopen the case 
other evidence such as the retired detectives personnel file 
that could contain a confidential report implicating him in the 
conniff slaying is missing said police lt gary johnson who was 
assigned to help bamontes investigation 
none of the personnel files of other men employed by the 
department have been removed he said 
johnson said he would neither confirm nor deny bamontes claims 
but it very well could have been a spokane police officer 
involved the things bamonte has turned up points that way

for two months evelyn sanchez 
her husband and four children have slept on three mattresses spread 
on the tile floor of an elementary school 
were so tired of it said ms sanchez 
the family lost their home and possessions when hurricane hugo 
slammed into puerto rico on sept 18 
taking clothes a tv set and a tape player ms sanchez said the 
family rode out the storm at luiz munoz marin school a hurricane 
shelter on the outskirts of the coastal town of canovanas 35 miles 
northeast of san juan 
but god we never expected to be here this long said her 
commonlaw husband jose ramos rodriguez a garbage collector 
they are among more than 500 people waiting for federal aid and 
temporary housing in canovanas the town with the largest number of 
homeless hurricane victims in puerto rico 
throughout the island last week more than 4000 homeless people 
were being housed in 118 shelters still waiting for assistance a 
day after the hurricane the number of homeless reached 12243 
despite the efforts of thousands of emergency workers and local 
volunteers just 10 percent of nearly 160000 people who applied 
for aid with the federal emergency management agency or fema have 
received assistance some 80000 people have sought help with the 
red cross 
relief workers say the delays are due to the large numbers of 
people and homes affected by the devastatiing hurricane 
this is by far the biggest disaster we have ever dealt with 
said red cross spokesman steve grumbacher it is the most 
expensive and complicated too because the area is so large and 
because of the language situation its a monster 
puerto rico is a us commonwealth but spanish is the main 
language of its 33 million inhabitants and only an estimated 58 
percent speak english 
its also been a lousy year for disasters said grumbacher 
there was hugo in the caribbean and then it hit carolina then 
came the san francisco quake 
fema spokesman john schad said that compared with the number of 
hurricane victims along the carolina coast the number of 
applicants for aid in puerto rico is three times as high 
we are asking people to please be patient said schad 
obviously with the high numbers of applications its going to 
take some time 
gov rafael hernandez colon has accused fema inspectors of being 
arbitrary 
there is a big difference between my estimates and femas 
the governor said recently referring to the number of people the 
agency determined had lost everything 
fema estimates 8000 people suffered total losses while 
hernandez colon said the figure is about 28000 about 50000 homes 
were affected by the hurricane 
schad said that by tuesday the deadline fema expected to have 
200000 or more applications to process he said 70 to 80 percent 
of those applying would be eligible for assistance 
so far the agency has issued more than 15000 checks providing 
some 32 million in housing relief as well as small business 
loans schad said 
its not just assistance which is slow in coming 
some 20 to 30 percent of the houses in 17 towns still lack 
electricity and running water 
in stark contrast to san juan where only traces of the 
hurricanes wrath remain slabs of wood and tin roofs litter roads 
around canovanas in the adjacent towns of loiza aldea and rio 
grande hundreds of fallen palm trees lie on sandy beaches 
the government had built 883 prefabricated units or modules 
as temporary housing for hurricane victims in 22 towns 
but that still left many out and they have been waiting in 
impersonal shelters 
at first i was hopeful said jorge bonano a 23yearold 
electrician living in a canovanas shelter with his wife wanda who 
is five months pregnant they told us the houses would be ready 
the 15th of october then they said the 31st now i dont know 
 
many of the homeless impatient for either aid or homes were 
squatting on government land or vacant lots and building their own 
makeshift shacks out of whatever material they could find 
its what a lot of people are doing are doing in 
desperation said evelyn sanchez its what we are thinking of 
doing

nancy reagan wrote her memoirs my turn to 
get revenge but what she got was panned 
critics who always get the last word have been knocking her 
book as shallow and meanspirited describing it as revealing more 
about the author than she might have wanted revealed 
a few have been friendlier finding an unexpected side of the 
former first lady humor 
in the chicago tribune dorothy collin called the book as much 
fun as a long gossipy lunch 
and florence king writing in the san jose calif 
mercurynews saluted mrs reagans deftness in dismissing daughter 
pattis excuse for skipping the 1985 inaugural her husband had to 
work 
in a line ms king liked a lot mrs reagan wrote it seemed 
to me that if you were taking a couple of days off because your 
fatherinlaw was being sworn in as president of the united states 
most people would understand 
but for the most part the reviewers said mrs reagan has 
produced what barbara ehrenreich in the new republic calls a 
whining book 
the philadelphia inquirers reviewer susan page suggested that 
my turn should have been titled take that 
david lauter of the los angeles times found the book a 
relentless settling of scores displaying cattiness 
concluded lauter the result is to reinforce virtually every 
aspect of the image she would like to shed 
nancy reagan has written a book she shouldnt have agreed 
richard dyer in the boston globe instead of changing a 
hoitytoity image she is unhappy with she has reinforced it if 
you thought she cared too much about clothes and furniture and 
china and decoration and every form of appearance this book proves 
you are right 
smugness infects these memoirs said r w apple jr in the 
new york times mrs reagans selfsatisfaction and 
selfrighteousness shine out from page after page 
historian lewis gould of the university of texas who 
specializes in first ladies says he suspects mrs reagan comes 
across as more bitter than she intended that happens he says 
when people dictate memoirs into a tape recorder allowing a 
ghostwriter to polish their words 
by not having to put pen to paper the author does not have to 
think about what he is saying and the result gould says can be 
like a heated letter you read the next morning and throw away 
mrs reagan he said sent out the heated letter 
the former first lady of course gets the last laugh the one 
that is laughed en route to the bank her book is selling well 
my turn jumped to firstplace on most best seller lists it 
took the no 2 spot on the widelywatched new york times best 
seller list for nov 19 and says her agent mort janklow it will 
reign as no 1 in the list the times will print nov 26 
mrs reagan was widely reported to have been paid 2 million in 
advance royalties random house her publisher disputes that 
figure but wont disclose the actual amount industry scuttlebutt 
is that it may have been more 
random house publicist carol schneider said the first wave of 
reviews were political 
people seem to be reviewing nancy reagan rather than the 
book she said 
agent janklow says the reviews have been negative because people 
expect a first lady to write a sweet and innocent memoir something 
mrs reagans isnt 
she unburdens herself of her pentup anger and i think thats 
what makes it a wonderful book says janklow 
many critics comment on the books anger washington post 
reviewer sally quinn said she turned back the corners of pages on 
which mrs reagan mentioned being angry furious outraged 
irritated or annoyed and counted 42 turned corners in 370 pages 
one of the targets of mrs reagans anger was ms quinn herself 
for a very negative article about me another was ms quinns 
husband post executive editor benjamin c bradlee

defense secretary dick cheney says he is 
ordering the military services to plan spending cuts next year 
because the rapid pace of soviet bloc reform reduces the threat of 
war to a 45year low 
its clear that the likelihood of allout conflict between the 
us and the soviet union between nato and the warsaw pact is 
probably lower now than its been at just about any time since the 
end of world war ii cheney said sunday on the abctv program 
this week with david brinkley 
cheney said the soviets appear to be cutting military spending 
and that further us defense reductions are acceptable a shift 
in his position 
you cant watch the events unfold in eastern europe the 
development of governments headed by noncommunists the 
possibilities of free elections of opposition parties and not 
believe that that will have some longterm impact upon the security 
situation in europe cheney said 
given the changes that we see today in eastern europe i think 
its possible to contemplate the possibility over the next few 
years that we may indeed be able to reduce the level of our 
deployments in western europe cheney said 
two former white house national security advisers also said 
soviet bloc reforms enable america to reduce its troops in europe 
the pattern of postwar politics as it has developed for the 
last 40 years is now at an end henry kissinger the former 
national security adviser and secretary of state from the nixon and 
ford administrations said on abc 
zbigniew brzezinski president carters security adviser urged 
that billions of dollars be shifted from defense to help east 
european nations move from communism to democracy and a freemarket 
economy 
brzezinski appearing on the nbctv program meet the press 
called for creation of a fund for central europe modeled on the 
marshall plan that promoted the economic recovery of western europe 
after world war ii 
we spend about 150 billion on the defense of europe about 
half of our defense budget brzezinski said if we can reduce 
the level of the confrontation in central europe we will gain 
flexibility in dealing with central europe economically 
financially that we havent had until now 
cheney did not specify how great a reduction he anticipated but 
senior pentagon officials have said he plans to cut 180 billion 
over three years beginning with 1992 congress is now completing 
action on a 286 billion defense budget for the 1990 fiscal year 
that began oct 1 
in an interview with the washington post published sunday 
cheney said the spending cuts for 199197 would center on such high 
technology hardware as the b2 stealth bomber the new york times 
reported that the air force has proposed closing 15 bases and 
reducing deliveries of f16 fighters to achieve overall cuts of 34 
billion about 10 billion short of the reduction cheney has 
requested over three years 
the soviets have reduced their spending on conventional arms 
cheney said but continue to modernize their strategic nuclear 
force and have a long way to go to clean up their act in the 
third world 
he said the soviet union was in part to blame for the guerrilla 
offensive in el salvador because moscow supports cuba and 
nicaragua two nations the bush administration has accused of 
aiding the salvadoran rebels 
cheney said he would forward his recommendations on the defense 
budget to president bush in early december about the time the 
president is to hold his first summit with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev the budget package will be sent to capitol hill in 
january said cheney 
the decision to plan for the cuts was driven in part by the 
perception that the soviet threat was diminishing and in part by 
the us budget crunch cheney has maintained that soviet military 
spending has risen by 3 percent annually from 1985 to 1988 and 
that pentagon spending has fallen 11 percent

the embattled program of catastrophic medical 
insurance for retirees which last week seemed doomed has at least 
a spark of life remaining 
the senate on sunday rejected a bill to repeal the program 
following the advice of the very negotiators who approved the bill 
a day earlier that means senate and house conferees will make a 
final effort to find an acceptable way of fixing the program 
without repeal 
we ought to take another shot at it said sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas he said he had reason to believe the house 
negotiators were preparing to make another offer one that would 
kill the unpopular income surtax that finances the program but 
retain at least some coverage for catastrophic hospital expenses 
however some house members who have worked most closely on the 
issue including reps brian donnelly dmass and bill archer 
rtexas who favor repeal and henry waxman dcalif who opposes 
repeal said they knew of no new offer 
while i personally have sought to achieve some reasonable 
compromise i am now of the opinion that no such compromise 
position exists archer told the house on sunday night 
on a 34957 vote the house repeated its insistence that the 
program be repealed but the senate under a prearranged procedure 
rejected the agreement by voice vote and called for new 
negotiations 
the house and its negotiators have backed repeal for weeks with 
congress preparing to wrap up its 1989 session senate negotiators 
threw in the towel early saturday and agreed reluctantly to support 
repeal 
but on sunday bentsen said that senate concession had served as 
a shock treatment for some house members and set in motion what 
he concluded was a new movement toward compromise 
repeal of the law which was enacted with strong bipartisan 
support last year would leave most of the nations 32 million 
retirees with little or no protection against being wiped out 
financially by a serious illness 
the first major part of the medicarebased program covering all 
but the first 560 of this years hospital bills went into effect 
jan 1 protection for all but the first 1370 of doctors bills 
is due to take effect next jan 1 1990 coverage for prescription 
drugs would follow in 1991 
congress is having second thoughts about the program because of 
loud complaints from retirees who already have some kind of 
catastrophic insurance and from some of those with higher incomes 
who are having to pay an income surtax of up to 800 a year only 
about 40 percent of retirees pay any surtax and about 6 percent 
were required to pay the maximum 800 this year

hopefully be able to work on the farm the prospects for dick to 
ever run even recreationally are not being discussed said

time of two hours eight minutes and 53 seconds remains one of the 
fastest ever by a us runner he retired from marathons last year

his coveralls got caught in a drive shaft used to power farm 
equipment he suffered cuts on his calf muscles in his left leg and 
severe ligament damage to the left knee 
hes really a very lucky man to be alive wenmark said

capt rolf mueller an east german border 
guard for 15 years glanced at a womans passport and cheerfully 
waved her on behind him dozens of east and west berliners 
streamed past unchecked 
i used to be in charge of strict security now im a well a 
sort of document checker its a funny feeling he said 
as one of muellers colleagues put it ive become a tourist 
attraction 
for years the guards kept people inside east germany manned 
lookout posts asked questions and scrutinized the papers of 
anyone showing up at a checkpoint 
their icycold stares were legendary they hauled off to jail 
east germans caught trying to flee they sometimes killed wouldbe 
escapees with gunfire 
now tourists take their photographs and spectators crowd round 
them their main problem is keeping the lines of cars and 
pedestrians moving through the berlin wall and other frontier 
points 
the guards are not visibly armed one said they were issued 
pistols instead of automatic rifles after the borders to the west 
were opened on nov 9 
mueller 39 looked happy and relaxed in his new role i like 
this job he added its very good to see the people of my 
country come and go freely and they still respect me 
but others are tightlipped and many of the guards appear a 
shade uneasy standing at an open door 
except for mueller guards approached at six crossing points 
asked not to be identified by name some refused to talk or gave 
stilted responses 
according to the londonbased international institute of 
strategic studies the berlin guard regiment has 7000 members and 
another 47000 defense ministry troops are assigned to guard east 
germanys other borders 
since the abrupt decision by the embattled communist leaders of 
east germany to let the countrys 165 million citizens travel 
freely more than 6 million have visited west germany 
at the wall next to potsdamer platz a guard looked embarrassed 
as a giggling teenage girl shoved a red carnation into his hand 
ive become a tourist attraction he declared theres no 
order here any more 
mueller was among about a dozen east german guards posted at the 
glienicke bridge on the outskirts of berlin last week it was the 
scene of eastwest spy swaps in the days of the cold war 
previously only diplomats were allowed to cross the glienicke 
bridge 
we had perhaps 10 people on a busy day said the officer in 
charge recalling the earlier days in one hour this morning we 
had about 10000 how many by now who knows 
were getting as many people through with as few problems as 
possible thats my job now 
officers at a customs post set up since the bridge opened stood 
by while people walked past some toting bulging plastic bags or 
stereos 
a grayhaired customs officer shrugged he predicted a surge in 
smuggling of currency and antiques but said no one had been 
searched 
its impossible to control anything now he said perhaps 
when things settle down a bit 
nearby a corporal said he used to read a lot during his 
eighthour shifts at the bridge 
hardly anyone ever came here he said to me what has 
happened now is unbelievable ive got to adapt but this is still 
a border and it should remain one an economic and political one 
east germans must not lose pride in their country 
the corporal like other guards questioned said he hadnt 
crossed the border for a visit himself and had no plans to quit the 
military or leave east germany 
im a communist and this is my country he said 
since the 99mile berlin wall was built in 1961 at least 80 
people have died trying to escape including 61 shot by east german 
guards and about 3300 were arrested according to west berlin 
police estimates 
the last person shot while fleeing was a 20yearold waiter 
killed feb 5 a month later east germany announced it had ordered 
guards not to shoot to kill

a supreme court ruling narrowing a civil 
rights laws application is sowing confusion among lawyers and 
discouraging new litigation according to a new report 
the decision has had very serious and regrettable consequences 
for the men and women who live with the intractable realities of 
racial discrimination the naacp legal defense and educational 
fund inc said sunday 
the groups survey of lower federal court decisions showed that 
judges dismissed at least 96 discrimination claims since the 
supreme courts june 15 ruling 
the court decided that employees could not sue under the civil 
rights act of 1866 to press claims of racial harassment on the job 
the report said the ruling has led to confusion among judges and 
lawyers discouraged new litigation and hampered efforts to settle 
pending cases out of court 
the 54 ruling by the supreme court said the 1866 law was 
enacted by congress to allow newly freed slaves to negotiate and 
enforce contracts 
the high court held that it prohibited discrimination in hiring 
but not racial harassment once a person was employed 
the supreme court upheld the dismissal of a suit filed under the 
law by brenda patterson a creditunion teller who claimed she was 
subjected to racial slurs and denied wage increases by her white 
employers because she is black 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said sunday the naacp survey 
demonstrates that serious loopholes exist in our civil rights 
laws legislation to repair the damage caused by the supreme 
courts decisions in 1989 must be one of the top priorities of 
congress in 1990 
only 22 of the claims dismissed between june 15 and nov 1 
involved racial or ethnic harassment but they illustrate the 
egregious nature of the forms of harassment no longer covered by 
the law the report said 
in one case the 7th us circuit court of appeals summarily 
dismissed a racial harassment suit involving a black woman who 
claimed her supervisor made repeated sexual and racial remarks 
showing her pictures of interracial couples performing sexual acts 
courts dismissed claims of racial discrimination in 31 firings 
and 16 other cases over failure to grant promotions or transfers 
because of race in addition eight claims of employer retaliation 
and six discriminatory demotion complaints were dismissed 
seven complaints that did not involve employment discrimination 
were dismissed along with six miscellaneous complaints involving 
the workplace 
the dismissal orders were entered in 50 cases some of which may 
also raise claims of other civil rights violations but the study 
identified seven cases that will be abandoned altogether because of 
the rulings 
the decision in patterson leaves clear only two things about 
the scope of section 1981 a racially motivated refusal to hire 
violates an employees rights and a practice of racial 
harassment adopted after an employee was hired does not the 
report said 
the supreme courts decision leaves in an entirely confused 
state the application of section 1981 to other discriminatory 
employment practices said the report written by eric schnapper 
an attorney for the new yorkbased defense group 
the report noted that on successive days last august two 
federal judges in chicago gave opposite rulings on whether the law 
prohibited firings in retaliation for complaints about racial 
discrimination 
congress is drafting legislation to overturn the effect of four 
supreme court decisions involving civil rights last spring 
including the patterson case a bill is expected to be introduced 
early next year 
the bush administration said it opposes such legislation without 
determining the impact of the four decisions on civil rights 
litigation 
so far the justice department has not found any evidence to 
suggest that such legislation is needed but officials are 
continuing to review the effect of those decisions said spokesman 
david runkel 
runkel said he had not seen the naacp inc fund study but 
suggested the results could be misleading because the decision 
will force a shift of cases filed under the 1866 law to use of 
title vii of the 1964 civil rights act

when mother teresa visited the united states 
it was charles h keating jr who lent his helicopter to her to 
visit remote indian reservations in the southwest 
now this former olympic swimmer and fighter pilot a benefactor 
of charities and politicians a battler of pornographers and 
bureaucrats is the lead character in the costliest savings and 
loan failure in the nations history and a capitol hill drama 
threatening the political lives of five senators 
whether bestowing his largess on church charities civic 
causes business associates or politicians whose help he might want 
some day charlie keating has always done it with a touch of 
flash 
typifying his desire for the spotlight keating insisted on 
being the final witness in the final episode of six weeks of house 
banking committee hearings into the growth and collapse of his 
lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif 
he got his wish and is scheduled to testify tuesday 
originally orchestrated as a forum for building a case to oust 
m danny wall as the nations top thrift regulator the hearings 
instead have evolved into a nearinquisition for the senators to 
whom keating and his associates gave 13 million in his highly 
public war with lincolns regulators 
although he was formally subpoenaed by the committee keatings 
associates say he welcomes an opportunity to tell his side of the 
lincoln story that it was regulators who created the sampl 
nightmare not him 
but just how forthcoming the phoenix millionaire will be before 
congressional inquisitors was unclear as of late last week the 
target of a criminal grand jury in los angeles various 
racketeering and fraud suits and ongoing investigations by three 
federal agencies keating is being advised by some to keep his 
silence 
for keating thats a tall order from his initial entry onto 
the public stage as an antismut crusader he has been anything but 
silent 
when the home loan bank board seized lincoln last april two 
years after the federal agencys examiners recommended keating 
bluntly asserted to reporters the purpose of his largess to elected 
officeholders 
one question among the many raised in recent weeks had to do 
with whether my financial support in any way influenced several 
political figures to take up my cause he said i want to say 
in the most forceful way i can i certainly hope so 
four of five keating says he meant to influence john glenn 
dohio alan cranston dcalif donald riegle dmich and dennis 
deconcini dariz have told the senate ethics committee in 
formal responses that they did no wrong the fifth john mccain 
rariz will submit his response to the formal committee inquiry 
before congress adjourns for thanksgiving according to a spokesman 
but regulators have told the house panel they never had seen 
such bold political interference as keating engineered 
weve never experienced a guy who had so much juice said 
william crawford californias savings and loan commissioner 
altogether regulators expect lincolns failure will cost 
taxpayers up to 2 billion they contend in a suit against keating 
that the losses stemmed from fraud insider abuse and racketeering 
if our recommendations had been followed the taxpayers would 
have suffered dramatically smaller losses said william black 
one of the four bank board officials summoned to meet with the five 
senators 
born into a prominent cincinnati family with strong republican 
connections keating now 65 began a threedecadelong crusade 
against pornography in the late 1950s 
in 1970 he won an appointment from president nixon to the 
federal commission on obscenity and pornography as a selfdescribed 
book burner he promptly sued the commission to block 
publication of its report until he could write a dissent to its 
conclusion that pornography posed no threat 
a lawyer by training keating turns to suits frequently in 
waging his campaigns hes filed several against the government 
since buying lincoln for 51 million in 1984 and converting it from 
a traditional home mortgage lender into what critics say was the 
epitome of the kind of highflier thrifts that were at the root of 
industry problems that required a 157 billion taxpayer bailout 
other tactics include hiring away at large salaries the state 
and federal regulators and private auditors charged with overseeing 
his empire on behalf of the public 
the phoenix managing partner of lincolns auditor the big eight 
accounting firm of arthur young amp co helped set up the meetings 
between the regulators and the senators with a report affirming 
lincolns soundness a year later he joined keatings payroll with 
an annual salary of 950000 
glenn who accepted 200000 in campaign donations from keating 
recalled feeling livid when he learned that 
i couldnt believe it he said absolutely i felt i was 
led down the primrose path nonetheless glenn said he has no 
intention of returning the 200000 contribution 
those keating didnt hire he retained such as alan greenspan 
formerly the presidents chief economic adviser and now chairman of 
the federal reserve board then working as a private consultant 
greenspan wrote a study in 1986 defending keatings practices 
keatings business instincts and proclivity to spend whatever is 
necessary to get what he wants were developed at the knee of carl 
h lindner a reclusive cincinnati billionaire who through 
takeovers built american financial corp into a banking insurance

rates many market players stepped off to the sidelines the 
analyst said speaking on condition of anonymity 
in currency dealings the dollar which opened higher in tokyo 
following gains in new york friday remained strong as market 
players demanded the dollar for account settlements traders said 
a bank of tokyo trader said there will be strong demand for 
dollars during the next three days because of higher standards of 
account settlement by japanese firms this week than in a usual 
weeks level

currency since they are expecting a cut by the us government in 
the nations defense budget 
the bank of tokyo trader added the dollar will remain strong 
until exchange markets observe a holiday thursday

a quaint brass plate above the front door of 
jim holmans centuryold home in this historic town hints that his 
attitude isnt quite in step with preservationists on this site 
in 1897 nothing happened 
the sentiment is holmans way of thumbing his nose at his towns 
love affair with the past and with the tourists who swarm to the 
most picturesque community in the midwest 
galena whose regular population of 3800 sometimes triples with 
weekend visitors has spent years sticking with its careful zoning 
laws and strict adherence to federal historic preservation 
guidelines 
but holman and some fellow residents are fed up with having to 
maintain what they fear is becoming a living museum of antiquated 
smalltown life 
we feel confined holman said recently at a gathering in his 
home with several members of the newly formed citizens against 
excessive zoning 
were not at ease even in our own homes we feel like the 
concerns of lifelong and longterm galenans take a backseat to 
weekend galenans 
city officials including zoning administrator rik fjelde have 
a different view 
if you own a house in the historic district you have a 
certain obligation to maintain it and thats the preference of the 
majority of citizens or it wouldnt be that way fjelde said 
almost every resident of galena lives in the historic district 
whose pleasing orderliness tucked perfectly into the hills near 
the northwest corner of the state recalls a currier and ives print 
mayor terry cole elected in may has made it a priority to 
enforce zoning and preservation ordinances for property owners 
that means only federaliststyle doors on federaliststyle houses 
the attention to historical detail can be expensive a few 
months ago holman bought 200 worth of wooden railroad ties to 
complete a fence around his yard no sooner had he gotten it up 
than fjelde told him he would have to take it down and replace the 
ties with more historically correct stone 
the lowest bid i could get for stone to make a wall was 
3600 he said 
thats when holman who works in the maintenance department of a 
chemical company in east dubuque wrote a letter to a newspaper 
seeking responses from others frustrated with the regulations 
holman said he was deluged with calls leading to his committee 
the group has started petition drives aimed at securing elected 
rather than appointed members of the zoningappeals board and the 
historicdistrict advisory board as well as the removal of fjelde 
city attorney john cox however said both boards are advisory 
and under illinois statute local voters cant make them elective 
bodies 
hes probably right said charlie petitgout vice chairman 
of the committee and owner of an electrical shop but the main 
reason we did this was to get the city to pay attention to our 
problems

the death of buck helm who amazed 
rescuers by surviving four days beneath tons of concrete in a 
collapsed freeway was a grim reminder of the destruction wrought 
by the northern california earthquake 
just 20 hours earlier residents cheered the reopening of the 
san franciscooakland bay bridge as a symbol of recovery from the 
oct 17 quake which toppled a 50foot section of the span killed 
67 people and caused 7 billion in damage 
im sure this will hit a lot of people hard said steve 
whipple the state department of transportation engineer who found 
helm in the early hours of oct 21 
i was under the impression that he was going to make it 
whipple said it was just going to take a long while 
helm who turned 58 on nov 10 died of respiratory failure at 
kaiser permanente medical center on saturday evening 28 days after 
his rescue 
the rescue of the burly longshoremans clerk buoyed spirits of 
rescuers depressed by the rising death toll in the collapse of 
interstate 880 in oakland and cheered people across the country 
who watched the drama on television 
im still glad we found him and gave him a better fighting 
chance than he would have had otherwise whipple added it 
picked our spirits up and made all our work worth it 
other rescuers said they have grown accustomed to deaths from 
the quake 
its a shame that helm couldnt have made it but i guess 
thats the way life goes you dont have any promises said 
alfred anderson a construction worker who was clearing rubble from 
the collapsed 125mile section of freeway when helm was found 
alive and trapped in his compact car 
to many buck had become a symbol of survival and hope 
helms family said in a statement 
for the helms the thousands of cards and letters from all 
corners of the world gave buck and the family strength and 
encouragement and for that they are forever grateful said the 
release issued by gary frischer a beverly hills spokesman hired by 
the family after helm was rescued 
he represented more than just a person i think to many people 
he very much represented the event of the earthquake said ron 
treleven a kaiser permanente spokesman 
the 220pound 5foot10 helm suffered a fractured skull 
fractured neck three broken ribs nerve damage to his leg and 
kidney problems caused by dehydration he also had diabetes and 
high blood pressure 
others were rescued from the freeway immediately after the 
quake but helm was the only survivor to be pulled from the 
wreckage after crews began gingerly searching through rubble 
remaining on the teetering structure 
helm worked on the docks in oakland and commuted 250 miles to 
the small town of weaverville on weekends to be with his family and 
friends 
his former wife lorrie helm said he acknowledged hearing his 
family read the cards and letters sent to him by wellwishers 
although he couldnt speak or otherwise communicate

every time a breeze stirs jackie 
pucketts mind races back to that horrible september night when 
hurricane hugo smashed into charleston and devastated the state 
its hard for me to hear the wind blow and not to think of 135 
mph winds said puckett who coordinates a 24hour mobile crisis 
unit in charleston that offers help for the mentally ill and 
hurricane victims 
ill probably always remember that sound and ill probably 
never be able to be in high winds without having a twinge 
puckett is among those coping with that reminder of the sept 21 
storm which killed 29 in south carolina and caused an estimated 4 
billion in damage while helping hurricane victims confront 
psychological trauma 
two months after the storm even counselors are receiving 
counseling 
i think what was unusual about hugo was that it traumatized 
half of our state directly said nancy carter one of the state 
mental health departments two emergency response coodinators 
while the other half of the state has been traumatized responding 
and helping our victims twentyfour of the states 46 counties 
have been declared disaster areas 
the state mental health department conservatively estimates that 
60000 people will need counseling the agency arrived at the 
figure by using a formula recommended by the national institute of 
mental health that takes into consideration deaths and homes 
damaged or destroyed 
mental health officials said they do not know how many hurricane 
victims have come into regional mental health centers or been 
visited by counselors going door to door which account for about 
80 percent of the therapy nor do the officials know how many 
counselors are helping victims 
pucketts crisis unit a team of six counselors has seen 250 
people on an emergency basis so far in november compared with 
about 75 in a normal month the symptoms run the gamut 
disorientation agitation grief bewilderment hopelessness 
depression suicidal tendencies hostility survival guilt and 
sleep disorders 
the hurricane traumatized the mentally and emotionally ill 
already undergoing treatment but it also deeply affected many who 
had never before sought counseling 
weve had calls on people weve never seen before people who 
are affluent who have resources whove never been in a 
position of calling for help theyre used to pretty much 
getting along puckett said 
many relate their experiences to a dream they hope to awake 
soon and find their lives back to normal 
counselors help victims accept the situation and then try to 
rebuild their world puckett said we try to make an 
environment for them to feel safe and secure 
counselors also try to calm fears that another natural disaster 
will strike 
we cant predict another one wont hit but what we can do is 
take what we know to be true and work with that he said 
alluding to federal emergency management agency assistance 
victims survival and the historical data about the infrequency of 
hurricanes striking charleston 
helped by federal aid the state has added counselors and 
administrative staff last month the state received a 300000 
fema grant covering the first 60 days of relief the state hired 
about 25 counselors on a temporary basis with the money 
today the state planned to apply for a 15 million grant that 
would extend through the next nine months 
it seems like theres never enough counselors puckett 
said 
thats creating problems for the caregivers many of whom are 
suffering from emotional and physical exhaustion officials said 
as a result counselors are helping counselors 
the south carolina baptist convention for instance is offering 
counseling to church ministers and others who have given advice to 
hurricane victims 
weve seen a lot of ministers and a lot of lay people who hit 
the wall emotionally and had a lot of emotional questions a lot of 
spiritual questions said george w bullard jr a church 
spokesman

people in livingston county say its a 
friendly place folks trust each other and nobody ever imagined it 
as a site for a series of slayings 
but three bodies were pulled from hidden graves in a barn oct 
16 a week later a body was found in another barn shot in the 
head like the others and up to nine men are missing 
last week an elderly farm couple in the northwestern missouri 
county was charged in three killings and people here say theyre 
shaken by one of the largest and strangest murder investigations in 
the state 
prosecutors say ray copeland 75 and his 68yearold wife 
faye hired drifters to buy cattle with bad checks conspiring to 
keep the proceeds when the animals were resold and killing the 
transients to keep them from talking 
the copelands were charged in the three deaths in which the 
victims have been identified they could face the death penalty if 
convicted their lawyers say they will plead innocent at a hearing 
set for later this month and accuse prosecutors of running a 
media circus against their clients 
dale johnson of chillicothe made his firstever visit to the 
county courthouse a week ago to watch the copelands arrive for 
their arraignment like others in this town of 10000 hes shaken 
by the case 
its a friendly community everybody respects everybody he 
said usually news about gruesome killings comes from big cities 
johnson said but its close to home this time 
were just normal people said johnson one of the few 
people here who would allow his name to be published people come 
and go we dont mind other peoples business just take care of 
our own 
authorities acting on a tip arrested the copelands on oct 9 and 
charged them with conspiracy in connection with a bad check that 
day officers began digging on the 40acre farm where the copelands 
have lived for 24 years 
officers found no bodies at the site near moresville about 10 
miles west of here but in the following two weeks four bodies 
were found at two farms where copeland had done odd jobs the 
investigation into the fourth death is continuing as is the effort 
to find the missing men sheriff leland odell said 100 sites in 
the county have already been searched 
the victims whose names are known paul j cowart 21 of 
dardanelle ark john w freeman 27 of tulsa okla and jimmie 
dale harvey 27 of springfield are described as transients who 
worked for the copelands 
all had stayed at a mission in springfield 180 miles to the 
south where copeland recruited his workers prosecutors believe 
they all died during the past two years the names of the nine 
others have not been made public but they are also believed to 
have worked for the copelands during the past three or four years 
authorities said 
the copelands remain jailed on 500000 bond apiece and the man 
whose tip led to the investigation remains jailed 
jack mccormick is being held in neighboring sullivan county 
unable to make bond as he awaits a december trial in a bad check 
case 
mccormick 57 said he began working for copelands on july 26 
and was recruited from the same mission where the dead men had 
stayed he left aug 10 shortly after writing the checks that led 
to the charge against him 
in a telephone interview from jail mccormick said copeland told 
him id get a chance to gain some respect thats how he got me 
interested copeland offered 50 per day plus room and board and 
set up a checking account for mccormick to buy cattle mccormick 
said he didnt know two checks he passed were bad 
ten days after leaving the copelands mccormick reported what 
he knew to a crime hotline and that started the investigation that 
led to the couples arrest and the search for the bodies 
meanwhile though badcheck charges were lodged against mccormick 
and he was eventually arrested in oregon 
mccormick wont describe exactly what made him flee the copeland 
farm but said i did come close to getting killed police said 
he told them he had found a human skull and leg bone 
he got a 500 reward for the tip but the check charges have not 
been dropped kenny hulshof an assistant state attorney general 
assigned to the copeland case said that as far as his office is 
concerned there are not going to be any deals made certainly 
were glad he called but he did what any citizen should have 
done 
mccormick said copeland asked him whether he was close to his 
family 
he was quite surprised to hear that i did have relatives 
around springfield mccormick said 
he said well i guess youre not too close to them 
mccormick recalled he went on to add that working for him i 
wouldnt have time to talk to relatives

teaching order based in maryland they were shouting at us why 
are you here why dont you go back to the united states 
the nuns said the first raid wednesday on the church made them 
realize it was not a safe sanctuary

uniforms have been accused of that massacre 
after wednesdays raid the nuns began trying to move the 
refugees out but there were still 30 in the church when the 
soldiers came back sunday

the church but sister elena jaramillo 45 of the sisters of st 
joseph in orange county calif said we dont want to leave 
until the last refugee is out 
she said she was frightened that the dawntodusk curfew would 
trap them in the church and she feared for her life

teach class divisions dont you know there is only one class 
here

the director of the national cancer institute 
says a newspapers almost booklength account of the discovery of 
the cause of aids is offensive and is impugning two of the 
leading figures in aids research 
the 50000word story that filled 16 pages in the chicago 
tribune sunday tells a story of commitment and dedication to 
mankind and of cutthroat competition and bareknuckled 
politics of individual ego and national pride the paper said 
the story described in great detail but did not resolve 
allegations made several years ago that robert gallo the american 
scientist credited as codiscoverer of the aids virus accidentally 
or deliberately claimed the first sample of the virus isolated in 
france as his own 
what happened in robert gallos lab during the winter of 
198384 is a mystery that may never be entirely solved the story 
says 
the tribunes story includes information obtained through the 
freedom of information act and in more than 150 interviews 
conducted over 20 months the paper says 
the discovery of the aids virus which was crucial to the 
development of tests for aids and drugs to fight it is now 
credited to gallo and luc montagnier of the pasteur institute in 
paris 
dr samuel broder the director of the national cancer 
institute said in a telephone interview saturday i know both 
drs gallo and montagnier their motivation is to alleviate death 
and suffering it is a grievous insult to impugn or attach any 
other motive 
the tribune article he said is impugning the two leading 
figures in aids research for what purpose gallo and montagnier 
are excellent scientists and dont deserve this 
gallo who directs aids virus research at the national cancer 
institute in bethesda md said it is possible that he 
accidentally confused the french virus sample with his own samples 
well never know he said but he denied that he was guilty of 
any wrongdoing 
he said it was a moot point because there are many other 
isolates of the virus he had discovered himself gallo made his 
remarks in a telephone interview saturday he had not seen the 
chicago tribune story

hundreds of tamils and moslems fled 
today from an eastern district after fierce fighting between an 
outlawed tamil militia and the sri lankan army which was moving in 
more reinforcements residents said 
in southern and central sri lanka at least 40 people were 
reported killed in the struggle that continues between the 
government and the extremist peoples liberation front despite last 
weeks capture and killing of the fronts top three leaders 
a government official said the widow of the fronts supreme 
leader has been placed under guard in a colombo luxury hotel and is 
seeking permission to leave the country with her five children 
the ultranationalist front comprised of members of the 
countrys sinhalese majority accuses the government of granting 
minority tamil separatists too many concessions 
the fighting in the eastern ampara district erupted in the power 
vacuum left by indian peacekeeping troops who pulled out last month 
as part of the phased withdrawal that is to be completed by dec 31 
at least 100 people were killed thursday and friday when tamil 
militiamen attacked a half dozen police stations then battled 
government soldiers and police commandos according to government 
accounts 
a military spokesman in colombo said a battle raged for 2 hours 
sunday after 200 members of the socalled tamil national army 
attacked an army camp at kalmunai 125 miles east of the capital 
speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with government 
regulations he said 10 soldiers all sinhalese were critically 
wounded but the attack was repulsed he gave no further casualty 
figures 
residents in batticaloa 20 miles north of kalmunai said 
hundreds of moslem and tamil civilians were fleeing ampara and 
kalmunai and seeking refuge in hindu temples christian churches 
and schools 
the residents who were contacted by telephone and spoke on 
condition of anonymity quoted the refugees as saying the sri 
lankan army was continuing to move in armor and reinforcements as 
well as helicopter gunships 
government statements blamed the outbreak of violence on the 
tamil national army which it says was illegally formed army 
troops earlier were empowered to shoot members of the militia on 
sight 
the tamil revolt started in 1983 when militants sought to create 
a separate homeland from their ethnic minority in northeastern sri 
lanka more than 11000 people have been killed in fighting and 
massacres since then 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
say they are discriminated against by the sinhalese majority which 
controls the government and military 
tamils are mostly hindus sinhalese who make up 75 percent of 
the population are mostly buddhists both ethnic groups also 
include christians moslems who claim descent from arab traders 
make up 7 percent

largest prodemocracy protest ever held in communist bulgaria that 
their new leader deserves praise for allowing such unprecedented 
freedom of speech

dissent and not grant bulgarians the freedoms they demand

condemn the ruling communists and praise the ouster earlier this 
month of longtime hardline leader todor zhivkov

from the communist party said one speaker 
on saturday more than 50000 people gathered on the alexander 
nevski square in downtown sofia to demand more democracy free 
elections respect of human rights and an end to the 45 years of 
police repression that began after soviet tanks rolled in

dissent 
the latest protests follow the political downfall nov 10 of 
zhivkov his successor petar mladenov who is considered more 
moderate 
for years we have been promised radical changes in our 
society but it always turned out to be a carnival in which 
only masks were changed but the policy remained the same radoi 
ralin a leading bulgarian dissident writer said in an interview 
that is why we should not be too enthusiastic about the latest 
changes we have to see what the new leaders have to offer us

federal investigators are looking into a 
possible second instance of the governments paying for new 
international business machines corp equipment only to receive 
used goods according to a published report 
the sun reported today that ibm acknowledged last week it had 
inadvertantly sold the government used equipment mislabeled as new 
in 1984 and 1985 
ibm said it voluntarily alerted the government to the error as 
soon as it was discovered in february 1987 and has been cooperating 
in a general services administration investigation the company 
attributed the mixup to administrative error 
the sun said a second case involving used ibm equipment is also 
now under review this one in connection with a 544 million navy 
contract awarded to electronic data systems corp a major supplier 
of ibm equipment in august 1987 eds specializes in designing 
sophisticated computer systems 
the contract under review called for eds to supply computer 
software hardware and services to the navy 
under the eds bid ibm hardware and software accounted for about 
134 million of the total 544 million award 
according to unnamed sources quoted by the sun navy personnel 
contacted the fbi after discovering the ibm equipment were used and 
not new as required by the contract 
the newspaper said the fbi is investigating to determine whether 
the mixup was intentional and whether blame belongs to eds ibm or 
the navy 
for the past nine months the house government operations 
committee has been examining allegations the navy has improperly 
favored ibm over other computer makers committee hearings are 
expected to conclude later this week

striking new england telephone co workers began 
returning to their jobs today 15 weeks after contract talks broke 
down in august 
members of the international brotherhood of electrical workers 
voted to ratify a new contract sunday with the nynex corp parent 
to new england telephone 
peter cronin spokesman for the company said late sunday we 
are very pleased that our employees have ratified the contract 
about 18000 ibew workers went on strike on aug 6 the walkout 
caused long delays in directory assistance repairs and 
installation services 
about 40000 nynex workers in new york also have been on strike 
but talks broke off over the weekend between the phone company and 
the cwa which represents the new york employees 
nynex had resolved the larger regional issues with the unions 
last week covering wages and benefits then late friday night 
ibew and company negotiators completed a tentative agreement on 
local issues 
striking ibew members voted 71 in favor of both the regional 
and local packages said george nadeau chairman of the t6 council 
in maine the administrative branch of the 10 regional locals where 
the results were tallied 
both have been accepted on a comfortable margin nadeau said 
following the final tally sunday night 
the vote in new england was held at union locals across the 
region but the contract did not win favor by ibew members in 
boston 
dennis banks a business agent for the boston ibew said a sore 
point with the union was nets use of outside contractors to 
perform certain jobs as part of the local negotiations union 
officials wanted the company to end this practice or at least 
put a cap on it banks said

to the adulation of his faithful 
president nicolae ceausescu today rejected the democratic reforms 
sweeping most of the rest of the east bloc in a fivehour speech to 
a congress of the ruling communist party 
the ruling out of the capitalist system is the leading 
requirement for the creation of a just society the orthodox 
leader told more than 3000 delegates packing downtown palace hall 
many western ambassadors boycotted the gathering to protest 
human rights violations under ceausescu 
the romanian leader has also become increasingly isolated in the 
east bloc as oneparty rule unravels in one warsaw pact country 
after another under the pressure of popular unrest he showed no 
sign monday of changing course 
he urged the 38 million party members about 15 percent of 
romanias population to maintain the principles of scientific 
socialism instituted in 1965 the year he took over 
delegates in a clearly rehearsed show of affection rose 
frequently to clap and chant romaniacommunism and 
ceausescuheroism 
they were silenced after about 30 seconds by a peremptory wave 
from ceausescu who peered out from a huge dais decorated with the 
communist hammer and sickle 
organizers said 115 delegations from 82 countries were expected 
but all nato countries except turkey stayed away reformminded 
communist or socialist parties from hungary italy and finland also 
refused to attend in protest over the countrys poor human rights 
record 
attendance of any of the parties activities would be 
inconsistent with the depth of us concerns over the human rights 
situation in romania for which the romanian communist party bears 
responsibility the us embassy said in a statement 
canadian ambassador sol gray said in an interview that heads of 
diplomatic missions from nato countries had attended the last 
congress in 1984 but the human rights record was such that it 
was inappropriate to attend this affair 
romania has been a regular target of western human rights 
organizations as well as international conferences for its 
suppression of dissent and restrictions on religious freedom 
under romanian law all meetings with foreigners must be 
reported and all typewriters must be registered to permit the 
tracing of letters and leaflets 
the domestic media have not reported the gradual collapse of the 
berlin wall an indication of the tight lid on information 
gray said the situation in romania had not necessarily worsened 
in recent years but its a comparative thing with the rest of the 
soviet bloc where democratic change has affected most other 
countries 
theyve been very consistent its the rest of the world 
thats changing gray said 
the strict limits on free speech and other violations of human 
rights have added to the despair in a country with chronic 
shortages of food and other necessities 
the government justified its policy of exporting much of 
domestic production by saying romania needed to pay off its foreign 
debt ceausescu said last spring that the country had paid its 
debts but store shelves remain bare and apartments without heat 
margarine eggs meat and other staples are rationed although 
residents said stores had been stocked in bucharest to impress 
foreigners attending the congress shoppers today were still 
presenting ration books for poor cuts of deepfrozen meat at a 
packed butchers store near palace hall 
ceausescu has encouraged the creation of a personality cult 
unmatched anywhere in the soviet bloc 
delegates leapt to their feet every few minutes today during the 
speech they clapped rhythmically and chanted slogans such as 
ceausescu and the people or ceausescuthe romanian communist 
party 
ceausescus wife elena and their son nicu who are ranking party 
officials along with several of their relatives gazed impassively 
from the stage 
the main entrance was draped with a banner proclaiming long 
live the romanian communist party headed by its secretarygeneral 
comrade nicolae ceausescu 
security was high with rifletoting soldiers and police in blue 
greatcoats cordoning off the congress center and standing along 
nearby streets the government severely restricted travel to and 
from romania and turned back several foreign correspondents 
planning to cover the meeting 
the delegates to the congress can theoretically vote to replace 
ceausescu and his allies in the 41member executive political 
committee and the 431member central committee the partys senior 
bodies 
they also are empowered to reject a fiveyear plan endorsed by 
ceausescu that emphasizes central control of the economy the plan 
is in sharp contrast to the efforts by other soviet bloc nations to 
introduce more of a free market 
but any divergence from ceausescus line is highly unlikely 
since the 40 counties sending representatives to the congress 
overwhelmingly voted for ceausescu proteges

about 5000 guerrillas today 
launched major attacks in the northwest to consolidate gains made 
over the past two months guerrilla and other sources said 
beginning early today hundreds of artillery shells could be 
heard falling inside cambodia the shelling which continued into 
midday shook houses in the thai border town of aranyaprathet 
thai military and guerrilla sources said the shelling came from 
government positions in response to the guerrilla attacks 
the guerrillas main objectives were the town of svay chek and 
governmentheld positions around the village of nimit said a 
senior official of the khmer peoples national liberation front in 
aranyaprathet he spoke on condition of anonymity 
western and thai military observers on the border confirmed that 
a major attack had begun 
at the liberation fronts base of boueng trakuan about two 
miles inside cambodia guerrillas showed off large quantities of 
captured weapons including four 122mm artillery pieces mortars 
heavy machine guns assault rifles and ammunition 
sovietbuilt trucks captured from government forces were seen 
carrying weapons to forward guerrilla positions at svay chek about 
12 miles to the southeast 
more than 1000 guerrillas attacked svay chek which was 
defended by about 600 government troops said the guerrilla source 
in aranyaprathet 
the liberation front coordinated the attacks with the 
noncommunist guerrilla group loyal to opposition leader prince 
norodom sihanouk the source said the sihanoukists attacked 
government positions at kok mon close to the town of banteay chamar 
in the far northwest he said 
the guerrillas failed to take svay chek during their biggest 
offensive in 11 years beginning in late september they did 
however seize the towns of banteay chamar thmar puok and kandoul 
as well as many villages and other military positions 
thai military sources who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
said todays attacks were intended to secure those gains in advance 
of an anticipated government counteroffensive 
large concentrations of communist khmer rouge fighters also 
operate in northwestern cambodia however it was unclear how much 
of a role they played in the latest attacks 
the khmer rouge is the most powerful group in a threeparty 
coalition fighting the government in phnom penh 
the communist group took over cambodia in april 1975 and killed 
or starved hundreds of thousands of people before it was ousted by 
a vietnamese invasion 11 years ago the vietnamese installed the 
current cambodian government 
vietnam said it withdrew the last of its combat troops in late 
september

barges were backed up for more than 40 miles 
today waiting to pass through a lock at this mississippi river 
town workers said the 1000barge backup was a record 
the congestion began when workers shut down altons lock and dam 
26 on wednesday and thursday to repair a worn gate said ken 
kruchowski a spokesman for the us army corps of engineers 
the lock has since reopened but the backup has still become 
particularly bad because river traffic is heavy this time of year 
as barges carry grain shipments to new orleans for export 
officials said 
weve got 113 tows waiting to lock and 1000 barges down 
here said jim perry shift leader at the alton lock for every 
one or two we send we get two or three coming in 
although the new gate was in place by friday boats that arrived 
wednesday evening didnt make it through the lock until late 
sunday perry said 
traffic was proceeding through the lock at the normal rate of 
about 1 hours for a typical load of 15 barges and one towboat 
perry said were getting them through here pretty good were 
back to normal operation the only abnormal thing is weve got a 
hell of a lot of boats 
barges arriving this morning will probably wait six days to pass 
through the lock said billie sanna a corps of engineers worker at 
alton 
both perry and sanna said the jam was a record as many as 70 
towboats pushing 800 barges have been backed up at alton 
previously sanna said 
the wait is eating into barge companies profits said tommy 
seals marine superintendent and port captain for american 
commercial barge lines in st louis 
the delay is especially costly for smaller barge lines which 
may have their entire 40 to 50barge shipment waiting to go 
through the lock seals said he would not estimate how much his 
company would lose 
were all being hurt he said

socialist luis inacio da silvas lead 
widened today in returns that set him up for an ideologically 
heated runoff for the presidency with the conservative frontrunner 
with 993 percent of the ballots counted da silva of the 
radical left workers party had locked up second place with 161 
percent of the vote he had a 400000vote lead over the 
thirdplace candidate leonel brizola of the centerleft democratic 
labor party 
fernando collor de mello of the rightist national 
reconstruction party won the most votes in wednesdays elections 
gaining 28 percent strongly backed by businessmen and the rural 
oligarchs that dominate the countryside he ha a wide margin from 
the beginning 
brizola had 155 percent of the vote in this country of 150 
million people there are 82 million registered voters 
jose francisco rezek president of the superior electoral court 
said the remaining votes would not change the outcome because they 
are from da silva strongholds 
the rest of the vote in brazils first direct presidential 
elections since 1960 was split among several other candidates 
with no one receiving a majority collor de mello and da silva 
will meet in a dec 17 runoff the winner takes office in march for 
a fiveyear term 
brizola called a news conference sunday to announce he was not 
ready to concede defeat he said he might ask the electoral court 
to recheck vote tallies in some regions 
referring to possible support for da silvas candidacy he said 
the workers party will have to facilitate any accord with the 
democratic labor party theyll have to consider some of our policy 
proposals 
he did not elaborate 
da silva a former union leader and now a congressman ran well 
in urban industrial regions he also surprised many observers by 
picking up strong support among poor rural peasants in the north 
and northeast who traditionally vote under the guidance of 
conservative landowners 
da silva didnt talk to reporters sunday but party leaders held 
a news conference in sao paulo 
party president luis gushiken a federal representative said 
the runoff would be polarized between right and left 
collor de mello represents the rightwing elite and is closely 
linked to bankers large landholders and big businessman da silva 
represents the people he said 
the two candidates have sharp differences over key policy 
questions 
da silva known by his nickname of lula has called for an 
immediate moratorium of interst payments on the countrys 110 
billion foreign debt the third worlds largest he also proposes a 
largescale agrarian reform program and a huge transfer of wealth 
from rich to poor 
collor de mello has been vague on policy with a platform based 
largely on combating brazils corrupt state bureaucracy 
on sunday collor de mello told reporters da silvas policy 
proposals were so extreme it would be impossible for the workers 
party to broaden their base of support 
the runoff will choose a successor to president jose sarney who 
by law could not run for reelection sarney is a civilian but he 
gained office in 1985 through an electoral college vote coordinated 
by the military

president hosni mubarak today for the first 
time publicly advised the palestine liberation organization to 
accept a us plan for an israelipalestinian dialogue 
mubarak told reporters he had not yet received the plos reply 
to the plan set forth last month by secretary of state james a 
baker iii 
president mubarak expressed his hope that the reply will not 
be negative the middle east news agency said without giving the 
presidents exact words 
we do not put pressure on anyone but we must help to push the 
process forward mubarak was quoted as saying 
the comments marked a change in egypts stance previously 
mubarak had said egypt consults regularly with the plo on peace 
moves and adopts whatever decisions the group makes 
baker proposed the dialogue between israel and a palestinian 
delegation to prepare the ground for israeliproposed elections in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip the plan elaborates on 
israels own election plan 
the elections would choose palestinian delegates for talks with 
israel on interim autonomy in the two territories negotiations on 
a final settlement would be held later 
israel has told the united states it would accept the baker 
proposal if the americans provided some assurances mainly that 
the plo would be excluded from negotiations 
the plo recently requested clarifications of the baker plan and 
got a reply through egypt plo leaders were reported meeting in the 
tunisian capital last week to formulate a final answer to the 
proposal 
mubarak denied reports today that the plo had already sent its 
reply to cairo for relay to washington 
but a plo emissary arrived this afternoon from the tunisian 
capital and the middle east news agency said his mission was to 
convey the palestinian position 
it quoted palestinian sources in tunis as saying the plo is 
holding to its insistence that it alone choose delegates to the 
dialogue and that the dialogues agenda be open and unconditional 
both demands run counter to the israeli position 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir who announced the 
election proposal last may has insisted there is no possibility of 
israels relinquishing the west bank and gaza in any settlement he 
considers the territories part of the land of israel 
mubarak noted today that the united states opposes israels 
retaining the territories it has occupied since the 1967 middle 
east war 
shamir can say what he wants mubarak said the united 
states has said and is saying it supports trading

partial returns showed most 
southern voters rejecting a regional autonomy plan and some 
politicians said today the results would boost moslem rebels 
demanding an independent islamic state 
president corazon aquino proposed the plan to satisfy demands 
for selfrule by 4 million filipino moslems and to end their nearly 
20year secessionist rebellion however she never openly 
campaigned for the autonomy proposal 
moslem rebels and many christian leaders opposed the plan 
saying it was inadequate critics feared an autonomous government 
would not be economically viable if it were limited to impoverished 
and geographically separated regions 
unofficial partial returns from sundays referendum showed 
voters in only three of 13 participating provinces and nine cities 
wanted to join the autonomous government 
the supreme court has ruled that any province or city where a 
majority of the voters approve the plan will join the regional 
government 
the people of the proposed autonomous region have 
spoken mrs aquino told reporters in manila it is now the 
duty of government to carry out what the peole have decided 
complete returns were not expected before friday but election 
commissioner haydee yorac said yes votes were leading in only 
the largely moslem provinces of tawitawi sulu and lanao del sur 
in predominately christian areas voters were rejecting the plan 
by margins of up to 30to1 according to the returns in eight of 
the nine cities about 80 percent of the voters rejected autonomy 
moslems form the majority in only five of the 13 provinces 
some politicians said the rejection by a majority of the voters 
would strengthen the position of moslem rebel moro national 
liberation front 
zamboanga mayor vitalyano agan who supported autonomy said the 
outcome was a personal victory for nur misuari exiled chieftain of 
the 24000member rebel group 
in my assessment this rejection is a promotion of misuari as 
the peoples leader indirectly and a rejection of mrs aquino 
he said we expect more problems in the future because the moral 
side of the front will be strengthened 
misuari who lives in saudi arabia vowed to escalate the nearly 
20year moslem insurgency regardless of the outcome of the vote 
southern christian politicians and some roman catholic church 
leaders also rejected the proposal 
despite the fronts opposition there were no reports of serious 
violence moslem insurgents raided 10 villages in maguindanao 
province but no deaths were reported 
mrs aquino forged a ceasefire with the moslem rebels in 1986 
peace talks collapsed in may 1987 but the ceasefire generally has 
held at least 50000 people have been killed in the insurgency

beijing kept up its attacks on the united states 
today accusing congress of a disgusting performance of power 
politics in approving economic sanctions against china 
in another development an official was quoted as saying china 
is considering measures to restrict political activity in hong kong 
after the territory reverts to chinese sovereignty in 1997 
china said the us bill drawn up to protest chinas bloody 
quelling of the prodemocracy movement last spring maliciously 
vilifies and attacks the chinese government 
the bill has been sent to president bush who could veto it it 
calls for two years of trade sanctions including a freeze on 
exports of satellites helicopters and certain nuclear material 
and a halt to risk insurance for american firms in china 
the latest attack came from the national peoples congress 
chinas largely ceremonial legislature 
we hereby express our strong condemnation and lodge a strong 
protest against this hegemonic behavior of the us congress which 
grossly interferes in chinas internal affairs willfully trampling 
on the basic norms governing international relations the 
statement said 
such a disgusting performance of power politics only serves to 
reveal its own arrogance and prejudice and help people see clearly 
the stubborn position of hostility to china and its people on the 
part of certain forces in the us congress said the statement 
read on staterun television and carried by the official xinhua 
news agency 
the call for sanctions comes in the wake of the chinese armys 
bloody crackdown in early june against unarmed protesters seeking 
democratic reforms 
the bill says the unprovoked brutal and indiscriminate 
assault left 700 dead china has said some 300 people died but 
western intelligence estimates put the number as high as 3000 
the chinese government maintains the demonstrations were aimed 
at overthrowing the communist leadership 
in hong kong li hou a top chinese official in hong kong 
affairs was quoted as saying china is considering prohibiting 
contacts with overseas political groups and limiting or banning 
foreign nationals from the territorys legislature 
li speaking to reporters in the chinese city of canton said 
the measures were being considered as part of hong kongs 
postcolonial constitution to prevent attempts to 
internationalize the territory 
china is worried that hong kong will become a base for 
subversive activities against the chinese central government and 
the socialist systems on the mainland li was quoted as saying by 
the englishlanguage south china morning post

army troops raided the citys 
episcopal church today as fighting in the fiercest rebel offensive 
of the 10yearold civil war dwindled to scattered combat 
the countrys roman catholic leader predicted a backlash of 
revenge repression and witchhunting and was himself 
threatened with assassination 
national guard troops raided the episcopal church just after 
dawn and arrested several foreigners said a guard officer who 
refused to give his name a church worker said nine people 
including an american and spanish french and west german citizens 
were picked up he did not elaborate 
the church in one of the most affluent neighborhoods of the 
capital is harboring about 200 refugees from the combat 
churches especially those that work with the poor have always 
been suspect in the eyes of salvadoran rightists authorities 
believe they harbor or aid guerrillas 
troops from the elite belloso battalion today fought guerrillas 
in the workingclass neighborhood of soyapango on the east side of 
the capital but guerrillas had pulled out of most of the territory 
they seized during the offensive that began nov 11 and returned 
to mountain strongholds 
there also were reports of scattered combat in the provinces 
telephones were out in san miguel a city 86 miles east of the 
capital where there was heavy combat sunday night 
on sunday army patrols moved through streets strewn with the 
rubble of fighting on some vehicles several burned bodies could 
be seen 
people began returning to their homes or what was left of them 
but thousands remained in shelters the warfare had forced about 
40000 of the capitals 1 million people to evacuate homes in 
nowravaged neighborhoods 
about 800 mourners attended the funeral of six jesuit priests 
their cook and her teenage daughter who were slain and mutilated 
early thursday in an attack widely blamed on rightwing death 
squads 
the united states has pressed rightist president alfredo 
cristiani for a full investigation in washington sen christopher 
dodd dconn warned sunday that us aid could be curtailed if 
cristiani cannot stop such killings 
but today president bush said he disagreed with the idea of 
cutting aid 
there is a freely elected government doing their very best 
trying to get protection from these marxistled guerrillas bush 
said in washington this is not the time to pull away from 
president christiani 
the rebels said they launched the offensive in response to a 
resurgence of death squad activity and many people think cristiani 
has lost control over the military and extremists in his party the 
republican nationalist alliance 
many opposition politicians labor leaders religious and human 
rights activists are now in hiding or have left the country because 
of threats or arrests followed by deportation orders 
archbishop arturo rivera damas the catholic leader warned in 
his homily sunday that a dreadful wave of revenge repression and 
witch hunting may follow the guerrilla withdrawal 
rivera damas said before sundays funeral that there exists 
the vehement presumption that the six jesuits were killed by 
members of the armed forces or people in intimate connivance with 
them 
the archbishop whose predecessor oscar romero was slain in 1980 
by a rightwing death squad has been urged to leave the country by 
attorney general mauricio colorado 
colorado told a news conference sunday that the unnamed church 
dignitaries he asked pope john paul ii to withdraw were rivera 
damas and auxiliary bishop gregorio rosa chavez whom he accused of 
fomenting leftist violence 
he claimed he had information that both have been targeted for 
assassination 
in attendance at sundays funeral were us ambassador william 
walker and cristiani who is struggling to maintain the appearance 
of control 
the political polarization has raised questions about the 
success of a us policy that made this nation of 52 million the 
biggest recipient of washingtons aid in the hemisphere 
despite the billions human rights abuses are again on the rise 
and a rebel force of 7000 regulars and perhaps twice as many 
irregulars was able to bring the decadeold war to the capital for 
the first time 
they took about a third of the capital in the first assault and 
held onto extensive areas for most of a week also engaging in 
heavy combat in the provinces on sunday evening there were still 
isolated pockets of fighting in the capital 
the military said nearly 1000 soldiers and guerrillas were 
killed and more than 1150 wounded in the nationwide rebel 
offensive about 71000 people have died overall in the war most 
of them civilians 
radio venceremos the rebels clandestine radio station claimed 
827 soldiers were killed or wounded but gave no breakdown 
neither side gave an estimate of casualties among civilians who 
suffered heavily in the blockbyblock fighting the red cross said 
an estimate was difficult because many bodies are still in the 
streets

president bush declaring he cannot abandon 
a fragile democracy said today that any congressional aid 
cutoff to el salvador would be an unacceptable response to the 
murders of six roman catholic priests 
bush speaking to reporters at andrews air force base md as 
he left for chicago also said he had spoken with salvadoran 
president alfredo cristiani over the weekend and offered him 
technical help in investigating and bringing to justice the people 
who did the killing 
bushs comments came as congress was considering a 146 billion 
foreign aid bill that includes money for el salvador the us 
government pumps about 15 million a day in economic and military 
aid into the small central american nation which has been fighting 
a leftist insurgency since 1979 
house democratic leaders overrode the objections of some 
republicans and cleared the way sunday night for rep george 
miller dcalif to offer an amendment restricting aid to 
cristianis 5monthold government 
the move is in reaction to the killing last week of six jesuit 
priests which many take as a sign that el salvadors rightwing 
death squads have renewed their activities conservatives 
however want to increase aid to el salvador to help the government 
combat a new offensive by leftist rebels 
we strongly condemn the killing and it must stop bush 
said 
this concept of the congress of some members on cutting 
off aid to el salvador is absolutely unacceptable to me as 
president he said 
bush said cristiani assured him the government was not involved 
in the murders 
i believe it the president said and if some renegade 
forces were involved they should be brought to justice but 
absolutely cristiani would not lie to me on a matter of this 
nature 
in the past congress has restricted aid to el salvador because 
of human rights abuses cristianis arena political party has been 
linked to death squad acivity in the early 1980s 
this is not the time to undermine a fragile democracy that is 
under attack where weve seen the most brutal use of a civilian 
population to further a political end on the part of the fmln 
bush said referring to the leftist insurgency by its spanish 
initials its totally unacceptable and the day of these marxist 
attacks should end right now

robert mays sat quietly after hearing 
proof that he and his wife left a hospital 10 years ago with 
someone elses baby leaving behind their real daughter who later 
died from a heart defect 
moments after receiving the news he asked where his biological 
daughter was buried according to his attorney 
i think it depressed him he had a child he never met that 
died said mays lawyer arthur ginsburg after genetic test 
results made public sunday proved kimberly michelle mays is the 
daughter of another couple 
the 10yearold girl has been the focus of a custody battle 
between mays a sarasota roofing contractor whose wife barbara 
died in 1981 and ernest and regina twigg who claim they lost 
their newborn in a baby swap at a rural central florida hospital in 
december 1978 
john blakely the twiggs attorney said the tests give a 999 
percent certainty that kimberly is the twiggs daughter and a 98 
percent chance that the girl who died last year of a congenital 
heart defect arlena was mays the tests left no doubt about 
parentage lawyers for both sides said 
arlena raised by the twiggs as one of their own was buried in 
pennsylvania just before her death in august 1988 the twiggs 
learned through genetic testing that she wasnt related to them 
in the search for their biological daughter they discovered 
that kimberly and arlena were born three days apart at hardee 
memorial hospital in wauchula 
during a subsequent court battle mays resisted the twiggs 
efforts to subject kimberly to genetic testing the impasse was 
broken last month when the twiggs promised not to seek custody 
regardless of the outcome but they kept the option to seek visits 
with the hazeleyed fifthgrader 
after we consulted with some psychologists we determined that 
it would most likely be in kimberlys best interest to stay with 
mr mays blakely said today in an appearance with the twiggs on 
cbs this morning 
were trying to work it out so kimberly can be a real winner 
in this matter he said she can maintain her loving 
relationship with the man who she has thought to be her father 
while simultaneously she can get two new loving parents additional 
parents shes been an only child up to now

the bush administration is shackling itself to 
1930sera economic policies to fight overseas competition in the 
advanced communications and computer marketplaces a private study 
says 
the economic policy institute said the united states stands to 
lose 2 million jobs and suffer a 225 billion trade deficit by 2010 
if the government fails to help american industry compete in 
highdefinition television semiconductors computers and digital 
communications 
the study released today written by robert b cohen and kenneth 
donow concludes that unlike japan and the european community 
the united states has failed to develop a system to achieve and 
maintain competitiveness in leadingedge communications 
technologies 
us policies currently emphasize customer and convenience 
services to the nearexclusion of developing domestically produced 
equipment and improving infrastructure the report said 
without revising the antiquated policy framework that is a 
product of the 1930s the united states cannot meet the challenges 
even now emerging 
the institute cited recent news reports that the bush 
administration has reversed or undermined cabinetlevel support 
for aiding advanced imaging systems semiconductors and other 
hightechnology industries 
the institute also cited reports that the defense department 
which has earmarked 30 million for research into advanced tv 
display technology now is considering buying such equipment from 
japan and withdrawing its support of usbased hdtvrelated work 
the institute also said the administration among other things 
was considering reduced funding for sematech the 
governmentindustry consortium that is developing new semiconductor 
process technologies 
with these steps the bush administration will curtail the 
main technology initiatives that have been supported by industry 
and military leaders the institute said the result of taking 
such steps could be a major deterioration in the uss ability to 
compete in world markets 
endorsing the studys findings house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo said over the last several months this 
administration has knocked down the building blocks of a policy 
that could help reestablish americas hightechnology base we 
cant afford for hightechnology to go the way of steel autos and 
services 
congressional sources have said the white house is gunshy about 
promoting policies that smack of the industrial policy tenets 
espoused by bushs 1988 campaign opponent michael dukakis 
the white house the sources said doesnt want to be in a 
position of picking winners and losers in any competition for 
government assistance 
commerce department officials have said the administration no 
longer plans to focus on hdtv as it tries to adopt a cohesive 
telecommunications policy and that advanced television will be 
only a part of a broader consideration of a range of technological 
initiatives 
hdtv which promises crystalclear images for a wide range of 
military educational medical and entertainment applications will 
rely heavily on sophisticated computer chips and proponents argue 
it will be a technology driver to revitalize the us 
electronics industry 
bush has proposed that new technology be spurred by a reduction 
in the capital gains tax a permanent research and development tax 
credit and changes in antitrust laws to encourage joint research 
and development and production ventures 
the economic policy institute describes itself as a nonpartisan 
washington think tank supported by labor business and individuals 
the institute said cohen is a former consultant to the commerce 
department and the congressional office of technology assessment 
donow a former professor at colgate university cornell university 
and the university of virginia is a telecommunications consultant 
the institute said

guilty to reduced charges today over a badcheck case involving 
more than 7500 in ribs he bought for a cookoff last year 
seale 52 of philadelphia pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor 
counts of attempting to pass bad checks each count carries a 
possible penalty of six months 
judge william aurelius set sentencing for dec 19 
seales attorney terry gilbert said he has paid back all the 
money for the ribs he bought at a local store and from a stay at a 
local hotel expenses he incurred for his participation in 
clevelands national rib cookoff from may 2330 1988 
i need to get this case out of my hair seale said outside 
the courtroom before making his plea 
in february he was indicted on charges of passing back checks 
totaling 776713 to buy ribs from seaway food service in 
cleveland the ribs were for his sales booth at the cookoff 
in may seale was indicted again on three counts of passing bad 
checks and one count of theft in connection with checks for 3000 
in lodging and other expenses incurred during the visit 
all the original counts were fourthdegree felonies and together 
carried a possible sentence of five years 
with todays plea the theft charge was dropped and the charges 
of passing bad checks were reduced to misdemeanor charges of 
attempting to pass bad checks 
seale said cookoff promoters had asked him to lend his name to 
the event assuming his presence would boost sales instead he 
said sales were poor and expenses were high 
since leaving the radical black panthers group seale has 
pursued various book projects including writing a cookbook on how 
to fix ribs he also works as a community liaison for 
africanamerican studies at temple university

the house today rejected an attempt to slap 
restrictions on us aid to el salvador heeding the warnings of 
conservatives who said such a move would be an overreaction to the 
murders last week of six jesuit priests and two others 
on a 215 to 194 procedural vote the lawmakers effectively 
precluded the restrictions from being added to a 146 billion 
foreign aid bill that also includes 533 million to aid poland and 
hungary and money for other us allies around the globe 
the el salvador issue reopened old wounds in the house where 
the recent resurgence of violence brought to the surface harsh 
differences about what us policy there should be 
to rush into this breech with this kind of amendment is 
suicide gentlemen for that country said rep gerald solomon 
rny 
but rep joe moakley dmass asserted that the salvadoran 
military remains above the law and this congress and this 
administration have responded only with words words are simply not 
enough 
the vote came just a few hours after president bush told 
reporters that it was important to continue support to the elected 
government of rightist president alfredo cristiani 
there is a freely elected government doing their very best 
trying to get protection from these marxistled guerrillas coming 
into the center of the city and we support president cristiani in 
his effort to restore order bush said as he boarded air force 
one for a day of campaigning for gop candidates this is not the 
time to pull away from president cristiani 
bush had vetoed a version of the bill a day earlier over the 
inclusion of money for a united nations family planning agency and 
the house was expected to vote later on a version that would leave 
out both the 15 million for the ud population fund and the 
salvador restrictions 
the un agency operates in china which has a 
onechildperfamily policy that antiabortion activists say 
results in forced abortions and sterilizations 
renewing assistance to the agency after a fiveyear hiatus would 
have placed the united states in the position of supporting a 
program that in turn supports coercive abortions a program that is 
inconsistent with american values bush said in his veto message 
the new bill also would contain a compromise on a provision in 
the original bill stemming from the irancontra scandal which 
would have prohibited the administration from using foreign aid 
money as leverage to get other countries to do things it is barred 
from doing 
that kind of restriction would interfere with my 
constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations of the 
united states bush said 
but the veto also opened the door for congress to make other 
changes and house liberals moved quickly to take advantage by 
proposing restrictions on assistance to el salvador 
house democratic leaders had overridden the objections of some 
republicans and cleared the way sunday night for rep george 
miller dcalif to offer an amendment restricting aid to 
christianis fivemonthold government 
the move came largely in reaction to the killing last week of 
six jesuit priests which many take as a sign that el salvadors 
rightwing death squads have renewed their activities 
conservatives however wanted to boost aid to el salvador to 
help the government combat a new offensive by leftist rebels 
the veto marked the third time bush has cited abortion 
provisions in vetoing a bill it brought criticism from werner 
fornos president of the population institute a washingtonbased 
organization that says it seeks to bring population resources and 
the environment into balance 
hes selling out poor women throughout the world for his 
domestic political advantage a dubious political advantage said 
fornos certainly the rest of america is not marching with him in 
this insensitive callous action 
douglas johnson legislative director of the national right to 
life committee said bushs veto sent a message to population 
control agencies that if you trample on human rights by 
supporting compulsory abortion programs youll get no help from 
the us government

communist leader egon krenz today met with an 
envoy from bonn in talks expected to focus on a west german offer 
to bail out its communist neighbors economy in return for moves 
toward a free market system 
a communist daily said extremists have urged their countrymen to 
sabotage east germanys electrical system as a form of protest and 
a west german poll found that if free elections were held now the 
communists would be in third place 
east germany has told the european community that it wants a 
broad trade and economic cooperation accord and wants to start 
talks on european security matters but it rejected talk of a 
german reunification 
the letter a copy of which was obtained today by the associated 
press was written by prime minister hans modrow to the 12 ec 
governments 
rudolf seiters chief of staff to chancellor helmut kohl came 
to east berlin and met with modrow to prepare next months summit 
between kohl and krenz which will be the first ever between 
leaders of the two states to take place in east germany 
seiters met later with krenz and it was not immediately 
revealed what the two discussed east german television said a main 
question from the east german standpoint would be whether bonn is 
ready for bilateral ties on a measurably higher level without 
unacceptable conditions 
east german officials have rejected what they see as west german 
attempts to lure the state from its socialist principles by linking 
aid to the introduction of a free market economy 
krenz also canceled a trip to prague scheduled for tuesday the 
state adn news agency said without giving a reason the 
czechoslovak capital has been rocked by prodemocracy 
demonstrations similar to those which have taken place all over 
east germany today about 10000 people demonstrated 
the demonstrations here continued sunday despite the latest bid 
for support by communist leader egon krenz another big rally was 
expected tonight in leipzig which has been a hub of protest 
in an unprecedented open exchange with east german television 
from his modest new home krenz said there will be no going back 
to the old conditions the opening of the borders was the best 
proof of our sincerity about reforms 
but many of the estimated 100000 people who rallied in several 
cities on sunday to maintain pressure for free elections and other 
democratic reforms insisted on new leaders and an end to communist 
dominance of the government 
a poll commissioned by west germanys stern magazine showed the 
opposition group new forum the strongest contender favored by 22 
percent of those questioned 
the communists with 14 percent of the vote trailed both new 
forum and the liberal democratic party which has been among those 
leading calls for change although until recently it was closely 
aligned with the communists 
krenz has promised free elections but has not proposed a date 
stern said the survey was conducted by the independent west 
german polling firm forsa it said 2180 east germans were 
questioned but it did not provide a margin of error 
at an east berlin demonstration sunday most signs denounced 
communist rule and expressed popular distrust of krenz the partys 
chief of security before being elevated to general secretary on 
oct 18 
the partys daily berliner zeitung which reported on the call 
for sabotage on its front page today told citizens to ignore the 
appeals 
the newspaper confirmed earlier reports that leaflets had been 
distributed in east berlin calling for simultaneous overloading of 
electrical circuits to cause a breakdown of the system 
whoever is producing such leaflets seeks neither 
democratization of society nor economic reform the newspaper 
said he wants only a breakdown 
authorities opened east germanys borders to the west on nov 9 
in a bid to gain the trust of a populace demanding demand 
democratic change and to try to end an exodus that was sapping the 
country of young skilled workers 
adn said 50000 protesters turned out in dresden on sunday to 
denounce the countrys leadership they declared we wont let 
ourselves be blinded by the open borders 
on the second weekend of free travel nearly 3 million east 
germans crossed into west berlin and west germany between friday 
and sunday west german border police said the vast majority have 
been returning to their homeland 
ferry service across the elbe river which forms part of the 
border resumed sunday at hitzacker about 80 miles southeast of 
hamburg for the first time since 1945 
adn reported prodemocracy rallies sunday by 20000 people in 
erfurt 10000 in meiningen 10000 in frankfurtontheoder 3000 
in schwedt and 2000 in neustrelitz it said thousands protested in 
karlmarxstadt but did not give a precise crowd estimate for the 
march there or in east berlin 
the agency said about 30000 communist party backers 
demonstrated in potsdam to show support for the governments 
announced reforms 
in his television broadcast krenz said he favors a new voting 
law to meet public demands for competitive elections 
he also shrugged off a suggestion he could be ousted at a party 
congress to be held dec 1617 and at which more leadership changes 
are expected 
the television showed krenzs new brown concrete home with a 
small garden in east berlins the pankow district 
krenz said he had moved to the quiet east berlin street 
after assuming the party leadership he said other members of the 
partys ruling politburo were also moving out of the exclusive 
wandlitz complex

scientists say theyve spotted the 
farthest and oldest object ever seen a quasar that gives a peek of 
the universe near the beginning of time and challenges a popular 
theory of how stars developed 
the starlike body about 14 billion light years from earth 
possibly has illuminated like a flashlight in the fog the matter 
that spawned everything from galaxies to life itself according to 
scientists 
astronomers have looked for more than 20 years for this 
primordial stuff of which galaxies stars and then us were 
formed said astrophysicist john bahcall of the institute for 
advanced study one possible interpretation is that its been 
found 
the object was seen through the 200inch hale telescope at 
palomar observatory northeast of san diego the quasar is in the 
constellation ursa major just below the big dippers bowl 
weve found the most distant object on record said 
astronomer maarten schmidt of the california institute of 
technology we are now seeing an object as it was a little over 1 
billion years after the beginning of the universe 
schmidt and astronomers james gunn of princeton university and 
donald schneider of the institute for advanced study an 
independent research center in princeton nj report the 
discovery in decembers astronomical journal the find was to be 
formally announced today 
quasars as large as our solar system are the brightest objects 
in the universe the brightest emits more light than 1000 galaxies 
of 100 billion stars each 
astronomers believe quasars form near black holes in the centers 
of galaxies black holes are so massive their gravity sucks in even 
light but as matter is pulled in intense bursts of light also are 
emitted 
scientists say a gigantic explosion the big bang created 
the universe 10 billion to 20 billion years ago they usually cite 
15 billion years as the universes age 
on that scale the newly discovered quasar formed at least 14 
billion years ago meaning its distance from earth is 14 billion 
light years or 82 trillion billion miles one light year equals 
588 trillion miles the distance light travels in one year 
if the universe is 20 billion years old schmidt said the quasar 
would be about 185 billion light years away or 109 trillion 
billion miles from earth 
the discovery is striking unexpected and very significant 
because it suggests the first galaxies and stars developed much 
faster than can be explained by what is known as the cold dark 
matter theory said bahcall 
the theory says that cold dark matter or hydrogen gas 
clumped together because of gravity to form stars and galaxies over 
several billion years not merely 1 billion years bahcall said 
during a phone interview 
schneider said advocates of the theory may have to come up 
with new theories that make galaxies faster 
alternatively light from the quasar may be partially blocked by 
clouds of gas but not primordial gas which was uniformly 
distributed in the young universe bahcall said 
because the age of the universe is uncertain scientists measure 
a quasars absolute age and distance using a property called red 
shift 
just as a train whistle seems to shift to a lower pitch as a 
train moves away from a listener light from distant quasars shifts 
toward the color red as they move away from earth while the 
universe expands 
the newly found quasar has a red shift of 473 making it 7 
percent older and more distant than the previous record holder a 
quasar with a red shift of 443 whose discovery was announced in 
december 1987 by scientists in arizona and england 
the quasar is so distant that its light is 400000 times too 
faint to be seen by eye 
schmidt devised the idea of using the hale telescope to search 
for distant quasars gunn built an extremely sensitive electronic 
camera that made the search possible while schneider designed a 
computer program that recognized the distinguished quasars from 
hundreds of thousands of other objects 
its a fantastic technical achievement a tour de force 
bahcall said

nicolae ceausescu president and 
communist party leader of romania has created a cult of 
personality greater than any in eastern europe since soviet 
dictator josef stalin 
and despite the democratic changes sweeping the east european 
countries around romania ceausescu has firmly rejected similar 
reforms 
during his 24 years as communist party leader he has exercised 
absolute power that enabled him to carry out a foreign policy 
independent of the soviet union and to keep romanians under 
ironfisted domestic control 
the oldstyle marxist leader invested billions of dollars in a 
crash industrialization program that led to widespread food and 
energy shortages and despair for romanias 23 million people 
the longer the food lines and the more vocal the peoples 
complaints the more harshly the regime cracked down on critics 
about 30000 coal miners went on strike in the jiu valley in 
1977 and 10000 workers demonstrated in the city of brasov in 1987 
demanding freedom better living conditions and ceausescus ouster 
police arrested hundreds of demonstrators and their leaders 
disappeared in mysterious circumstances 
at a mass meeting in bucharest in 1989 ceausescu said the 
triumph of the revolution requires unity severe discipline and a 
spirit of sacrifice a firm organization is needed as well as a 
tested political leader who knows how to unite and lead the 
masses 
ceausescus firm organization was the romanian communist 
party which he turned into a personal instrument after taking it 
over in 1965 
he gradually pushed aside all leaders who opposed his policies 
and installed loyalists on the ruling 23member politburo 
including his wife elena a chemist 
the personality cult he encouraged particularly after he was 
sworn in as romanias first president took on the trappings of 
worship and pervaded nearly all aspects of public life his 
pictures lined the streets in bucharest and other romanian cities 
and bookstores were full of works attributed to him 
when he was elected president in march 1974 an official picture 
showed him holding a silver scepter as the symbol of authority 
during the ceausescu era romania once known as the breadbasket 
of the balkans became one of the poorest countries in europe 
billions of dollars were spent on industrial and public works 
projects and food was rationed as the government exported all it 
could to pay off its foreign debts the debt was eventually paid 
off in the spring of 1989 but the shortages continued 
a massive secret police kept strict control on religious and 
political expression and dissent was quickly crushed 
in the new climate of reform encouraged by the soviet union 
romania has became increasingly isolated in both east and west 
in a speeches at party meetings in 1989 he said strivings for 
reform in some warsaw pact countries represent an abandonment of 
communism 
the united states and other western powers originally encouraged 
ceausescus relatively independent foreign policy stand within the 
sovietled warsaw pact two us presidents visited bucharest 
richard m nixon in 1969 and gerald r ford in 1975 
ceausescu who took power as communist party leader on march 22 
1965 continued diplomatic relations with israel even after other 
soviet bloc countries broke them in the 1967 middle east war 
in keeping with his maverick image he denounced the sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 and afterward refused to allow 
any foreign troops in romania 
romania was the only east bloc country to send athletes to the 
1984 olympics in los angeles breaking the sovietled boycott 
ceausescu placed members of his family in key posts his wife 
was a politburo member and first vice premier and by the mid1980s 
she had become the virtual secondincommand of national life and 
shared the limelight with her husband 
western analysts and knowledegeable romanians estimate 40 
members of his family held top jobs in the party and state 
hierarchy 
born jan 26 1918 in scornicesti ceausescu was the third son 
of a large peasant family an elementary school dropout he was 
apprenticed as a shoemaker took a job in a factory and joined the 
illegal communist party youth organization at age 15 he became a

congressional leaders said today that they 
were within striking distance of agreement on a bill reducing the 
budget deficit one of the major issues lawmakers must resolve 
before adjourning for the year 
legislators meeting in private late sunday and early today made 
progress in resolving their dispute over the amount of savings in 
the package members of both parties said 
estimates of the deficit cuts it contained ranged between 13 
billion and 17 billion but lawmakers said they believed their 
differences were bridgeable 
things have developed in the last few hours that give me 
confidence that well reach agreement today house speaker thomas 
s foley dwash told reporters 
were getting down toward the end i think said rep bill 
frenzel of minnesota ranking republican on the house budget 
committee 
before they can end their 1989 session which they hope to do 
this week lawmakers will have to decide how far they will go in 
eliminating medicare benefits for longterm illnesses work on that 
issue was continuing with no indications of progress 
the house today approved 310107 a new version of the 146 
billion foreign aid bill that president bush vetoed sunday 
lawmakers removed money for a united nations agency that bush 
claimed financed forced abortions in china liberals also came out 
on the short end of a 215194 vote that would have clamped 
restrictions on us aid to violencetorn el salvador the bill now 
moves to the senate 
housesenate bargainers renewed their effort to decide how to 
roll back the 1988 catastrophic health care law the legislation 
provides coverage to elderly patients with longterm medical 
problems that otherwise could lead to financial ruin 
when enacted the measure had bipartisan and popular support 
but wellorganized lobbying by seniors objecting to the surtaxes 
they must pay to finance the program reaching 800 this year for 
the most welltodo has convinced lawmakers to undo the program 
the house wants to repeal the entire measure but the senate 
wants only to eliminate the surtax and most benefits leaving 
coverage of hospital costs and other minor provisions intact 
the two chambers agreed saturday to terminate the program but 
that deal unraveled sunday legislators remained determined to 
reach a new compromise rather than returning home to angry 
constituents 
we cant leave here without final disposition of this issue 
said senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
negotiators trying to strike a deal on a separate bill reducing 
this years federal deficit also made scant progress as disputes 
arose over the savings in the measure and some of its provisions 
president bush has threatened to veto any measure failing to 
achieve at least 14 billion in legitimate savings congressional 
experts project that the shortfall for fiscal 1990 which began 
oct 1 will be about 141 billion 
bargainers from the house and senate agreed to a budgetcutting 
deal early saturday but talks resumed sunday after many lawmakers 
said the measure fell well short of the savings target with dole 
saying he thought it was insufficient by 5 billion to 6 billion 
there seemed no disputing certain aspects of the package that 
it contains about 53 billion in new tax revenues and billions in 
concocted savings achieved by shifting various payments out of the 
fiscal year 
all sides agreed it also would have to be supplemented by 
several billion dollars in savings by retaining until at least 
january the grammrudman balanced budget laws cuts in federal 
programs those reductions began oct 1 
should congress succeed in wrapping up its business by weeks 
end it would be unusually early for a nonelection year since 
1967 they have left town as early as november in an offyear just 
once in 1983 electionyear sessions tend to end much earlier to 
allow time for campaigning 
according to congressional records sundays session was only 
the 13th time the senate has met on a sunday the first occurred 
march 3 1861 when 20 votes were taken on the issue of slavery 
incomplete records show the house has met on four other sundays 
since 1978

the publisher of the people newspaper said monday 
he has fired its editor for publishing photographs of princes 
william and harry that were deemed to be not acceptable 
wendy henry who was appointed six months ago by publisher 
robert maxwell to edit the sunday tabloid newspaper had no comment 
on her dismissal 
the frontpage photos showed 7yearold william in a pose 
captioned willies sly pee in park and a series of pictures 
of 5yearold harry in a tussle with schoolmates 
their parents prince charles and princess diana issued a 
statement deploring them as an intrusion into the boys privacy and 
a security concern 
the photos appeared to have been taken in a garden square at the 
school they attend 
maxwell said another photo in the people that he found 
unacceptable was a closeup of entertainer sammy davis jr appearing 
ill with an uncovered wound on his throat that the caption 
attributed to cancer treatment 
on sunday ms henry said of the photographs of william it is 
a charming picture taken in a public place 
the photos of harry headlined his royal cryness carried a 
caption that said shyboy harry hates his pals ragging him and 
were accompanied by a text saying he was mercilessly picked on by 
schoolmates and burst into tears whenever playtime threatens to 
get too rough 
maxwell praised ms henrys outstanding journalistic 
abilities but said there have been several occasions on which 
distressing photographs which many people found deeply offensive 
myself included have appeared in the people and there have been 
intrusions into privacy which are not acceptable to me 
both were exemplified by the photographs of sammy davis jr 
showing him with his appalling cancer of the throat and of the 
children of the prince and princess of wales he told bbc radio 
he also cited a recent picture in the people of dead bodies from 
an airliner crash 
charles heir to the throne and his wife called the pictures 
intrusive and irresponsible their statement said they have 
regularly asked editors to respect the privacy of prince william 
and prince harry at school as they want the two young children to 
have as normal a school life as possible 
in addition the attentions of paparazzi photographers have 
obvious security implications the statement said

ethiopian rebels and government officials 
met monday for a second round of peace talks and accused each other 
of impeding progress in ending africas oldest civil war 
former president jimmy carter serving as a neutral observer at 
the talks said at an opening ceremony that both sides were 
sincere and dedicated in their efforts to achieve peace 
but the delegations in statements delivered after carters 
comments made it clear they were not satisfied with each others 
behavior outside the talks 
the ethiopian government delegation accused the rebels of 
intensifying antipeace propaganda and the rebel eritrean 
peoples liberation front said the government was conducting a 
campaign of fallacious arguments disinformation and at times 
outright blackmail to impede the progress underway 
the preliminary talks which began in september in atlanta are 
aimed at laying the groundwork for substantive negotiations to end 
the 28yearold secessionist war in eritrea ethiopias 
northernmost province 
three of 13 questions remain to be resolved during the 
preliminary talks the designation of a chairman and cochairman 
for further discussions the naming of a sevenmember observer team 
and the role it is to play and the selection and duties of a 
secretariat 
carrie harmon carters spokeswoman said carter and the 
sevenmember delegations met for about four hours after the opening 
ceremony 
the talks went very well said ms harmon they got right 
down to work 
the closeddoor talks are taking place at a house in the nairobi 
area carters wife rosalynn is participating in the negotiations 
as she did in atlanta 
ms harmon would not comment on whether the delegations made any 
progress in resolving the outstanding issues or whether the 
combative tone of the opening statements were reflected during the 
talks 
during the opening ceremony ashagre yigletu head of the 
ethiopian government delegation said it was his governments 
fervent desire to see the nairobi talks successfully concluded 
and for the main substantive talks to be started as soon as 
possible 
but he said a recent major offensive by ethiopias second most 
powerful rebel group which he described as a grave and 
orchestrated challenge was an obstacle to the success of the 
current peace talks 
the rebel tigre peoples liberation front which operates from 
eritreas southern neighbor has pushed steadily southward since 
august and is seen as a growing threat to the government in addis 
ababa 
ethiopian president mengistu haile mariam has accused the 
tigrean rebels of trying to further the cause of eritrean 
separatism 
the rebels accused ethiopias government of conducting a 
futile war effort in eritrea to escalate its campaign of 
dislocation and dispersion to weaken the eritrean struggle and 
create a de facto divided eritrea 
the statement also spoke of the severe drought in eritrea that 
could threaten nearly 2 million people with starvation and urged 
the international community to provide the resources needed to 
stave off widespread famine 
the marxist rebels who hold much of eritrea have remained 
largely behind lines gained during a major offensive last year 
the opening ceremony was attended by about 200 diplomats 
cabinet ministers and journalists kenyan president daniel arap moi 
encouraged both sides to continue working together to settle the 
fighting which has killed an estimated 1 million people

president bush with an early eye on the 1990 
elections went campaigning today in illinois and rhode island for 
two republican congresswomen who disagree with him on abortion 
the trip came one day after bush cast his third abortionrelated 
veto this fall knocking back a 146 billion foreign operations 
bill because it included 15 million in aid for a united nations 
population control agency that bush blames for supporting forced 
abortions in china 
the president made no mention of abortion in remarks at a 
fundraising lunch here for rep lynn martin who is challenging 
incumbent democratic sen paul simon in next years elections 
instead he made a pitch for cutting the capital gains tax and 
passing his anticrime and clean air initiatives all of which 
have been held up in the democraticcontrolled congress 
as bush spoke at the 250aperson republican fundraiser he was 
heckled by members of the audience who shouted criticism of us 
policy in el salvador 
when a woman accused the administration of killing priests bush 
replied we are not you be quiet 
he then sought to explain why the us was supporting el 
salvador with that a man jumped up and shouted stop the 
repression in el salvador the two demonstrators and two other 
women were led out by security forces and the crowd applauded 
now whos next the president joked im here to talk 
about lynn this is not a town meeting 
a chicago district police chief richard dwyer said later the 
four protesters were charged with disorderly conduct 
later bush was bound for providence ri to raise funds for 
rep claudine schneider expected to mount a challenge next year to 
sen claiborne pell a democratic veteran of 29 years in the senate 
he also was helping raise money for gov edward diprete who is 
seeking a fourth twoyear term in 1990 as rhode islands chief 
executive 
bush said martin has been in his corner on the fight for a lower 
tax on capital gains which are the profits on the sale of 
investments such as real estate or securities 
the capital gains battle may be over for this year but the 
fact is this weve seen the votes a majority in both the senate 
and the house are on record in favor of cutting the capital gains 
rate the president said 
when congress reconvenes in the new year cutting capital 
gains is going to be one of the top items on my agenda its a 
fight were going to win he said 
on another topic bush said next months shipboard meeting with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev off malta will occur 
because america has been resolute in defense of liberty 
the president began his stop in chicago by visiting the pickard 
elementary school classroom of ana zamora a fifthgrader who asked 
his help in ridding her neighborhood of drugs 
the pressure is still on out there so you got to follow 
through on what you learn in this school said bush who was 
accompanied by illinois gov james thompson mayor richard daley 
and other politicians 
how many of you have ever heard the story about the little 
train that could picard is the little school that could he 
said 
all of you have said no to drugs and youve said yes to 
education the president said youve refused to be defeated by 
marijuana crack and terrible gang violence 
ana asked bush about how much do you arrest the people who 
use drugs 
were beginning to make the case that the user the person who 
uses drugs has to pay the penalty the president said urging 
the children that once you decide youre not going to do it then 
reach out and help somebody else 
asked about the first familys pet dog millie the president 
said fine and then disclosed he had taken the dog into the 
shower with him the night before 
she rolled in something bad the president told the children 
after bushs address to school children in september outlining a 
national antidrug strategy teachers at pickard had their pupils 
write the president about how drugs affected their lives a letter 
from ana caught bushs eye 
i never go outside because my mom gets scared that ill get 
hurt because of the gang fights she wrote president bush 
ive heard that youre pushing for a war on drugs please help 
remove drugs from our neighborhood i will do my part by saying no 
to drugs and i hope you can do yours i know this is hard but you 
can do it 
martin schneider and two other prochoice gop congresswomen 
olympia snowe of maine and nancy johnson of connecticut met with 
bush last tuesday to urge him to modify his hardline stance 
against abortion funding 
bush last month vetoed a major spending bill that would have 
allowed medicaid funding of abortions for rape or incest victims 
while bush believes abortion should be legal in those 
circumstances he opposes public funding of abortions except to 
save the womans life 
abortion rights became a heated issue in this falls offyear 
elections with democrats capturing governorships in virginia and 
new jersey against republicans who opposed abortion when bush 
campaigned in both states nov 3 he avoided any mention of his 
abortion views 
bush said friday in an interview with mutual radio i know 
that our party is big enough to have people in it who differ on 
this question 
martin 49 is a longtime bush ally who was a national cochair 
of his 1988 campaign 
she said in an interview she does not think bushs antiabortion 
stand will hurt republican candidates 
this is ironic because just a year and a half ago people 
were asking me how can george bush keep you on as national 
cochair of his campaign when youre prochoice she said 
schneider 42 is among the most liberal republicans in 
congress pell who turns 71 on tuesday announced last week he 
will seek a sixth term

groups that help refugees are bracing for what 
they expect to be a new flood of immigrants from el salvador 
following the slayings of six roman catholic priests and the 
escalation of that countrys civil war 
i have no doubt the ones who make it out will be coming this 
way said vicky stifler an attorney for proyecto adelante 
spanish for project forward a legal service representing 
central american refugees 
they travel by land foot and bus so they wont be arriving 
tomorrow itll be a few weeks before they start trickling in 
about 30 lawyers attended a training seminar on handling 
political asylum litigation over the weekend at southern methodist 
university 
the seminar sponsored by proyecto adelante the state bar of 
texas catholic charities and the south texas pro bono asylum 
representation project was aimed at relieving what officials say 
is a critical shortage of lawyers willing to assist political 
refugees 
i think this is probably the greatest area of need in this 
country that is not being met said steve anderson a business 
attorney in dallas i think a lot of the people would be facing a 
death sentence if they had to go back 
ms stifler is the only fulltime worker for proyecto adelante 
where the majority of the clients are salvadoran she and a 
volunteer handle about 1300 cases a year 
we havent had to turn anyone away so far but were not going 
to be able to continue if we dont get some help ms stifler 
said 
thousands of immigrants still are being held in detention 
centers in southern texas and are in dire need of legal assistance 
said karen keltz haring director of political asylum projects for 
southern methodist university 
ms haring said detained refugees must be prepared so they can 
effectively convince judges and immigration officials that their 
lives would be in jeopardy if they were not allowed to stay in this 
country 
many dont speak english or understand the workings of the 
court ms haring said its hard enough for someone with a 
legal degree and who speaks english fluently to do it

donald regan got in his licks monday in his 
feud with nancy reagan reviewing the book by his former boss 
wife and declaring it to be a classic of inadvertent 
confession 
in what may or may not be the last word in their 
inksplattered battle over which one of them hurt president reagan 
more the former white house chief of staff said mrs reagan 
seems incapable of understanding how her words and deeds might 
seem selfish hypocritical and indeed even frightening to those 
on the outside 
she and her ghostwriter william novak have produced a 
classic of inadvertent confession regan wrote in a washingtonian 
magazine review of my turn mrs reagans memoirs 
very sadly and most of all this book gives aid and comfort 
to those who still believe that ronald reagan never should have 
been elected president in the first place regan said 
the story so far 
in may 1988 regan having been fired 13 months earlier 
published his memoirs they pictured mrs reagan as a scheming 
shadowy distaff presidency and disclosed her use of astrologer 
joan quigley 
virtually every major move and decision the reagans made 
during my time as white house chief of staff was cleared in advance 
with a woman in san francisco who drew up horoscopes he wrote 
last month in my turn mrs reagan got even she wrote 
that regan had often acted as if he were president and deserved 
to be fired because the irancontra affair occurred on his 
watch 
she also acknowledged turning to ms quigley for advice but 
only for scheduling decisions not policy or politics she accused 
regan of having betrayed a confidential relationship with the 
astrologer she said she never guessed he would take that fact 
and twist it to seek his revenge on ronnie and me 
taking his turn regan said astrology played a bigger role than 
mrs reagan was willing to admit 
i wrote about astrology because it was an essential truth 
about the way the reagans operated regan wrote 
it was a daily sometimes hourly factor in every decision 
affecting the presidents schedule he or in this case she 
who controls the presidents schedule controls the workings of the 
presidency 
regan also raised security questions saying the nation owes ms 
quigley a vote of gratitude for not revealing to a potential 
assassin intimidate details of presidential movements 
as for the larger question regan asserted that mrs reagan in 
acidly criticizing many of ronald reagans closest advisers 
including edwin meese iii james baker iii david stockman 
alexander m haig william clark and william casey damages her 
husband and his presidency regan said 
after all he wrote these were ronald reagans choices 
made after close consultation with his financial and political 
supporters and friends in california he must have thought that 
they met his own standards

nazis 50 years ago it was the largest demonstration in 
czechoslvakia since august 1969 when some 50000 people gathered

reform movement 
the socialist daily svobodne slovo joined in the condemnation of 
the official handling of the demonstration the paper gave full 
coverage to the events even quoting witnesses of bloody beatings

country the youth the daily said 
by contrast the communist party daily rude pravo in an 
editorial today called for resolute action against provocations 
on sunday authorities arrested 10 dissidents including petr 
uhl a leading human rights activist he was charged in connection

the romanian communist party opened a party congress and 
president nicolae ceausescu denounced the democratic reforms 
sweeping much of the east bloc many western ambassadors boycotted 
the gathering to protest human rights violations 
in east germany a communist party daily said some extremists 
urged their countrymen to sabotage the nations electrical system 
as a form of protest one sunday more than 100000 people 
demonstrated in several cities to demand reforms 
about 2000 bulgarians took part in another prodemocracy 
protest sunday a day after the largest rally staged by dissidents

sweden to receive the olof palme award even if authorities issue 
him a passport 
i will not make use of that passport and i will not leave the 
country havel said 
i do not wish to serve as a false visiting card of this regime 
which wants to claim that a foremost dissident is traveling abroad 
while people are brutally beaten in the streets he said

times publishing co which will stay in atwoods hands officials 
said that company puts out books on state history and other 
nonnewspaper publications 
the evening newspaper will remain the only locally owned and 
operated daily newspaper in alaskas largest city and anchorage 
will remain one of about a dozen cities nationwide supporting two 
competitive daily newspapers allen said in a statement 
it would have been a tragedy to have outside interests control

prizewinning newspaper owned by the californiabased mcclatchy 
newspapers group the times was once the dominant paper but is now 
no 2 in circulation behind the news

president bush on monday defended salvadoran 
president alfredo cristiani and his own administration against 
suggestions of complicity in the murders of six jesuit priests in 
el salvador 
first bush told reporters that cristiani had assured him the 
salvadoran government was not involved in last weeks murders 
then at a political fundraiser the president faced a heckler who 
said his administration was killing priests 
we are not you be quiet bush shot back 
his accuser and three other people who also voiced criticism of 
us actions regarding el salvador were led out by security guards 
as the crowd applauded 
bush went on to say we must not pull our support away from a 
freely elected government in central america 
before leaving for illinois and rhode island on a political trip 
for two republican congresswomen seeking senate seats bush 
indicated he might well veto any congressional effort to cut off 
aid to the fragile democracy 
house democrats did try to put new restrictions on money for el 
salvador but that effort failed in a 215194 procedural vote 
monday as the house worked on a broad foreign aid bill bush vetoed 
for different reasons a day earlier 
there was no effort to cut off aid entirely 
bush spoke to reporters as he prepared to board air force one at 
andrews air force base in maryland near washington for the flight 
to chicago 
he said concerning el salvador this is no time to undermine a 
fragile democracy that is under attack 
bush on sunday vetoed the foreign aid appropriations bill that 
contained money for el salvador partly over a provision providing 
15 million for a united nations agency that funds a chinese 
program that is said to promote abortion as a form of population 
control 
democratic house leaders decided to open up the bill to a debate 
on money for el salvador partly in response to speculation by 
critics of the salvadoran government that the murders of six jesuit 
priests were committed by government sympathizers 
in the first place there is no question i hope in the minds 
of the american people that we strongly condemn the killings last 
week of the jesuit priests and apparently the killing of another 
priest bush said 
later spokesman marlin fitzwater cited a report still not 
confirmed that a conservative priest was killed in addition to 
the six last week 
heres a freely elected government doing their very best 
trying to protect their population from these marxistled 
guerrillas coming into the center of the city bush said and 
we support president cristiani and his effort to restore order 
this is no time to pull away from president cristiani bush 
said 
in their telephone conversation which he said had taken place 
within the past 48 hours bush said i told him how strongly we 
feel about the killings and i told him that they must get to the 
bottom of it 
bush said he had also offered cristiani technical help in 
investigating and bringing to justice the murderers 
fitzwater said this help would basically consist of 
forensics such as help in fingerprint investigation 
people who did this whether they come from the extreme left 
or the extreme right should be paying the penalty bush 
saidwe cannot condone killing 
my pitch is this that we must not pull away from a freely 
democratically elected government that had certification of the 
freedom of those elections and to continue to have a handful of 
countries supporting the outdated concept of marxist guerillas 
is unacceptable to the united states and i must tell the congress 
of the united states that i will not accept as president a cutoff 
of aid to el salavador thats it 
asked if he believed cristianis assurances that his government 
was not involved in the killings bush said absolutely i 
believe it and if some renegade forces were involved on the left 
or the right they should be brought to justice 
cristiani would not lie to me on a matter of this nature 
bush added

jurors chosen to decide the fate of a man 
accused in the bus crash deaths of 27 people viewed the charred 
wreckage of the bus today in silence as the mans trial got under 
way 
jury selection was completed in the murder trial of 36yearold 
larry mahoney of worthville who police said was drunk when his 
pickup truck crashed into a bus on interstate 71 near here in may 
1988 the churchowned school bus was taking youngsters and adults 
home from an outing 
shortly after the 12 jurors and four alternates were seated 
they were briefed by carroll circuit judge charles satterwhite and 
then taken in vans to a warehouse four blocks away where the 
wreckage of the bus and mahoneys truck is stored 
jurors also were taken to the crash site and opening arguments 
were scheduled for this afternoon 
mahoney is charged with 27 counts of murder 42 counts of wanton 
endangerment 12 counts of assault and one count of drunken driving 
in connection with the may 14 1988 accident that occurred as 
mahoney was driving his pickup truck in the wrong lanes of the 
highway 
if convicted on all counts mahoney could face prison sentences 
ranging from 20 years to life 
as he has since jury selection began nov 8 satterwhite took 
extra steps today to ensure jurors remained anonymous each was 
referred to by a number instead of by name 
under the ground rules established by the judge for the visit to 
the warehouse jurors were instructed not to talk to one another 
and the prosecution and defense lawyers did not get to lecture them 
on how to interpret what they were seeing the judge told jurors it 
would be their only visit to the site during the trial 
mahoneys lawyers have said that the construction of the bus 
which lacked safety features required on newer models would be a 
key factor in the defense the victims died of smoke inhalation 
after when fire from the ruptured gas tank engulfed the bus 
satterwhite said four jurors would serve as alternates instead 
of the customary one or two because of the length of the trial 
which lawyers say could last at least six weeks

the public should be given greater access to 
complaints against federal judges a task force appointed by a 
private research organization said monday 
the group also recommended measures to protect people 
particularly lawyers who file complaints against the judges 
the task force of the twentieth century fund said its proposals 
are intended to strengthen a 1980 law authorizing the federal 
judiciary to discipline its members for misconduct or disability 
because the 1980 procedures call for selfpolicing of the 
judiciary their legitimacy has been questioned by some critics 
the task force said the legitimacy of these reforms would be 
enhanced if an auditing mechanism were put into place 
the group proposed creating a special committee appointed by the 
us judicial conference the policymaking arm of the federal 
judiciary to oversee complaints against judges 
the committee would include lawyers scholars and members of the 
general public and generally would be authorized to reveal 
nowconfidential complaints against judges as long as the charges 
are not frivolous 
the task force headed by university of pennsylvania law school 
professor a leo levin also said it favors protecting anyone who 
files a complaint against a judge by barring the judge from any 
sanction against the individual 
we were troubled by testimony we heard from practicing 
attorneys who voiced reticence about filing a complaint out of 
concern that doing so would jeopardize their clients or hinder 
their careers the task force said 
the task force report was prompted in part by recent 
congressional impeachment and removal from office of three federal 
judges alcee l hastings of florida harry e claiborne of nevada 
and walter l nixon of mississippi 
hastings was acquitted on charges of soliciting a bribe for a 
favorable decision from the bench claiborne was convicted of 
income tax evasion nixon was convicted of perjury 
the task force said impeachment and removal should remain 
difficult in order to guarantee judicial independence but it urged 
a congressional study to determine whether the impeachment process 
should be changed to promote greater accountability for judges 
the task force also said it frowns upon any conspiracy of 
silence that allows infirm judges to remain on the bench when 
they no longer are capable of doing the work 
it is particularly important that the chief judge of each 
respective federal regional circuit exercise the obligation to 
prompt such a judge to step down before formal procedures are 
invoked the task force said 
besides levin the task force members are rep barney frank 
dmass abner mikva a federal appeals court judge here nancy 
neuman president of the league of women voters university of 
southern california law school professor judith resnik dorothy 
ridings publisher of the bradenton fla herald us district 
judge jack weinstein of new york author and northwestern 
university professor garry wills and texas tech university law

a federal prison inmate suffering from aids was on 
his way to a private hospital monday after a judge ruled the us 
bureau of prisons lacks adequate facilities to treat the disease 
lawyers in the case of leonardo botero gomez 43 said monday 
they are preparing a classaction lawsuit on behalf of all federal 
prisoners with aids 
this is a precedentsetting case putting the bureau of prisons 
on trial for their callous disregard of prisoners serious health 
care needs said attorney david tucker who represented gomez 
it is the first time a sentenced federal prisoner has been freed 
on bond for medical treatment said tuckers associate benson 
weintraub 
in washington bureau of prisons spokesmen greg bogdan said the 
agency was conferring with its counsel and seeking more information 
before responding publicly to the ruling he initially said there 
was not a large number of federal inmates with aids but later said 
the agency would not comment on that subject 
gomez sentenced may 5 to a minimum 10 years for cocaine 
trafficking is in the most advanced stage of aids and has a life 
expectancy of 24 months or less weintraub said 
on monday the inmate was en route to an undisclosed hospital 
for treatment the lawyer said 
us district judge eugene spellman ordered gomez freed friday 
on 250000 bond pending a full civil trial scheduled for january 
the inmate was released later in the day after spellmans order was 
upheld by the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta 
spellman heard testimony that gomez who is taking the antiaids 
drug azt was being treated at the infirmary of the federal 
metropolitan correctional center near miami about every four weeks 
he was sent to the aids treatment center at miamis public jackson 
memorial hospital 
the treatment lacks the quality of continuity which is 
considered necessary in treating an illness of this nature 
spellman wrote in his decision 
the judge also said the prison lacks some of the drugs necessary 
to prolong gomezs life and found that the prison doctor had seen 
gomez only twice in the previous two weeks 
the care available to gomez does not meet the requirements 
of the law spellman ruled 
the us attorneys office which sought unsuccessfully to keep 
gomez in prison pending trial refused comment on the case

james cason turned away by the senate for a 
top environmental job in the bush administration asked the white 
house on monday to withdraw his nomination 
the action effectively ends an eightmonth battle between 
president bush and environmentalists over the controversial nominee 
for assistant secretary of agriculture for natural resources and 
the environment 
withdrawal of this nomination is a great disappointment 
said agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who announced casons 
request the lobbying effort against him was both misguided and 
unfair 
there was no immediate respones from the white house which 
never waivered in its support of cason despite repeated requests 
from individual senators to withdraw the nomination 
bush was in chicago and rhode island on monday campaigning for 
republican candidates 
cason was opposed by the sierra club national wildlife 
federation wilderness society league of conservation voters and 
national audubon society 
the groups alleged that casons record in several top interior 
department positions during the reagan administration showed 
favoritism toward private development of public lands despite 
environmental concerns 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee agreed with the environmentalists and worked to defeat 
cason after his committee sent the nomination to the floor on a 
127 vote 
the senate after weeks of behindthescenes persuasion by leahy 
others including sen bennett johnston dla chairman of the 
energy and natural resources sent the nomination back to the white 
house on friday and asked that it not be resubmitted 
republican leader bob dole of kansas suggested the move after it 
became clear that a floor vote would defeat cason 
it was the first rejection of a bush nominee by the full senate 
since john tower was voted down as defense secretary in march 
since i became chairman in january 1987 the agriculture 
committee recommended to the senate the confirmation of 22 
nominees leahy said in spite of the fact that i may not have 
agreed with the presidents choice in each case i voted for their 
confirmation on the senate floor 
i would have been unable to do so with cason 
leahy said that while reagan was president cason was part of 
a team that frequently overrode the longterm national consensus to 
protect our environment favoring instead shortterm economic gain 
of a few mostly timber oil and gas interests

the magic kingdom of disneyland may be 
more than whiteknuckle rides and a cast of animated characters 
it also can be a modern religious pilgrimage two scholars say 
in addition to fantasyland tomorrowland and frontierland the 
magic kingdom could add sanctuaryland to the visitor agenda 
christopher and dbra parr said at a joint session of the american 
academy of religion and the society of biblical literature 
the two boston university doctoral candidates presented a paper 
sunday on the religious significance and spiritual pleasures of 
disneyland 
the park which evokes paradise and purity is a sanctuary from 
the hectic outside world the parrs said 
the couple admitted they were introducing unaccustomed whimsy 
into the annual meeting of religion scholars debra parr teaches 
american literature her husband teaches in boston universitys 
religion department 
while disneyland has no religious symbols on its grounds the 
parrs say messages are there 
it begins with the huge parking lot that has tall signs painted 
with cartoon characters perhaps the parrs ask goofy pooh bear 
and dumbo are the seraphim who will watch over your wheels while 
youre within the shrine 
the park itself is secluded walled off from the profane an 
island of harmony order peace the parrs say 
the magic kingdom subtly assures people that this is america the 
beautiful with a shiny future the distinctly religious message 
is that the future will bring happiness as in the song when 
you wish upon a star 
some recent churchgoing visitors to disneyland were asked what 
they thought of the parrs theory 
one compared the parks ambiance to a friendly church 
atmosphere you see all the cultures here mixing together gods 
family on a holiday together said bert oconnell of west 
lafayette ind 
however cindy myers of orange county said she saw a darker 
side with overtures of the occult in the magical fantasies the

newspaper workers lost a court battle monday in 
their bid to restore their chief editor who was fired after 
publishing remarks by a controversial parliamentarian 
a regional court declared illegal a strike by workers at the 
banner of communism newspaper in noginsk a city east of moscow 
the court said that if the workers dont return to their jobs 
tuesday they will be fired or fined 
the controversy began last month when the newspaper published a 
speech by yuri n afanasyev to the interregional deputies group an 
organization of opposition members of the congress of peoples 
deputies to which he and maverick communist boris n yeltsin belong 
the contents of the speech were not known but afanasyev has 
challenged the very underpinnings of the soviet state saying the 
official ideology of marxismleninism is outmoded 
the newspapers publishers the city government and communist 
party officials in noginsk afanasyevs home district fired the 
editorinchief of banner of communism on oct 25 the officials 
accused editor vladimir puchkov of being ideologically 
irresponsible the weekly moscow news reported 
a mass rally in defense of the newspaper was held three days 
later and its workers went on strike nov 3 to press for puchkovs 
reinstatement 
the city took the strikers to court and supporters packed the 
moscow courtroom for mondays hearing brandishing slogans such as 
lets defend the freedom of the press and hands off 
freethinking editors 
defense lawyer andrei makarov contended the strike was purely 
political and legal particularly because a parliamentary decree 
says the press should give priority to publishing materials by its 
local parliamentarians 
afanasyev testified the case was a symptom of the curbing of 
glasnost a symptom of opposition to the course defined by the 
communist party he said the court action stemmed from president 
mikhail s gorbachevs criticism of him and other outspoken 
practitioners of glasnost in a meeting with editors last month 
referring to the interregional deputies group the soviet leader 
reportedly accused afanasyev and two economists of joining with 
yeltsin to form a fascist clique striving for power informed 
soviet sources said gorbachev told the meeting afanasyev should be 
expelled from the communist party 
afanasyev the 55yearold head of the moscow state historical 
archives institute came under repeated attack in the staterun 
press after gorbachevs remarks 
the communist party daily pravda quoted afanasyev as saying the 
party has no authority and has led the country nowhere pravda said 
afanasyev who appears frequently at rallies by unofficial 
political groups and speaks in a booming baritone never backs up 
his charges with proof and has turned from historian to priest in 
another article the newspaper quoted him as saying perestroika 
marks the end of the last empire the soviet union 
he shot to fame in a nationally televised speech in may to the 
congress with gorbachev looking on afanasyev said the soviet 
leader had either listened to or influenced an aggressively 
obedient majority in the congress to elect a 
brezhneviststalinist legislature

emergency medical services in many rural areas 
are plagued by personnel shortages inadequate training outdated 
equipment and lack of financial and medical resources according to 
a report released monday 
the very nature of rural areas where residents often live many 
miles from a hospital creates special problems that can delay 
emergency services which sometimes results in death or permanent 
injury the office of technology assessment a congressional 
research office said in its report 
more federal money and better state planning could ease some of 
the problems that affect the health care of the onequarter of the 
us population that lives outside the nations metropolitan areas 
the report said 
the extent and quality of emergency medical services vary from 
state to state for example hawaii spent nearly 14 per capita on 
such services in 1988 while ohio spent 2 cents for each resident 
according to the report 
federal funds for emergency medical services reached about 30 
million annually after passage of the 1973 ems systems act but 
began to decline in 1981 when the money was folded into block grant 
programs 
in 1988 about 18 million in federal funds went to the states 
for emergency medical services 
the report argues for an increased federal role in providing 
these services to rural areas but doesnt say how much additional 
funds would be necessary 
among the options the report lists are increased federal funds 
for training and continuing education for emergency medical service 
personnel and more federally funded research and demonstration 
programs to address problems unique to rural areas 
the report also suggests development of national guidelines or 
standards for emergency medical service providers and specialized 
facilities such as trauma centers

an alabama man awaited extradition monday 
following his arrest hours after being added to the fbis 10 most 
wanted list for a 1986 shooting spree that killed a woman and 
wounded two others 
lee nell carter 34 was arrested sunday night following several 
telephone calls from viewers who said they recognized him from 
descriptions given on the television show americas most 
wanted said fbi agent john anthony 
we had no idea carter was in detroit anthony said 
fbi agents and detroit police officers arrested carter at a home 
on the citys east side where he shared an apartment with another 
man anthony said carter might have been in michigan for the past 
1 years 
carter had been sought since a nov 15 1986 shooting spree in 
mobile ala that left mesha sneed dead and two others wounded 
the incident apparently was sparked by a broken romance anthony 
said 
although carter was indicted dec 11 1986 on one count of 
murder and two counts of attempted murder police inadvertently 
released him from custody eight days later anthony said 
carter was being held pending extradition to alabama 
carter was convicted in 1979 of murdering his father anthony 
said but the suspect told police sunday that he was on probation 
for that offense

the house has unanimously approved a bill that 
would give students from china the opportunity to remain in the 
united states rather than face possible political persecution back 
home 
the bill a reaction to the oppression of students demonstrators 
by the beijing government cleared the house 4030 late sunday and 
was sent to the senate which has yet to act 
president bush is expected to sign the legislation 
the legislation waives the requirement that holders of exchange 
visitor visas known as j visas return home for at least two years 
before applying to the us government for a change in their visa 
status 
about fourfifths of the 40000 chinese students in the united 
states hold that type of visa they would be required to file for a 
change in visa status within four years of enactment of the bill 
or return to china 
the bill also requires the justice department to give special 
consideration to chinese nationals who seek asylum status in the 
united states because of chinas population control policy of only 
allowing one child per family

no one complained when carrie white napped 
through mondays celebration of her birthday at the age of 115 
the woman who may be the worlds oldest person ought to be able to 
do what she wants 
mrs white finally awakened after the party to eat a piece of 
birthday cake while photographers snapped her picture 
its quite an honor to be associated with a spunky lady that 
has made such an achievement said marjorie allen mrs whites 
guardian for the past five years 
for her age mrs white is in good health doctors say her heart 
is sound she takes no medication and seems nearly immune to colds 
and the flu 
asked if she thought mrs white would make it to 116 mrs allen 
replied you betcha 
mrs white received a certificate monday from the guinness book 
of records certifying her as the oldest living person 
not everyone readily accepts that jackson pollard of 
milledgeville ga says hes 122 born on christmas day 1866 
pollard doesnt have a birth certificate or a family bible to 
prove his age but hes gathered enough evidence that guinness is 
checking into his account the legal counsel for central state 
hospital where pollard lives verified his birthdate as before 
1870 
central state records indicate pollards mother lived to be 107 
and his father to 99 
mrs white leads a relatively active life for her age attending 
church and singing activities at the putnam memorial nursing home 
mrs allen said 
she lives to be dressed up she loves her makeup and jewelry 
she likes to primp and she likes a lot of attention she said 
mrs allen said mrs whites drowsiness during her party may 
have been the result of two private parties in the past two days 
which had interrupted her routine of sleeping from 6 pm to 10 am 
mrs white who likes to chew tobacco and eat fig newtons 
actually turned 115 saturday she began the day monday with a trip 
to the beauty shop 
the party attended by about 600 people took place in a tent on 
the ground of the nursing home where mrs white has lived for the 
past five years 
mayor tim smith proclaimed monday carrie white day in 
palatka and she received telephone calls from us sens bob 
graham of florida and david pryor of arkansas 
a group of thirdgrade students from nearby mellon elementary 
school had frontrow seats for the party because they are regular 
visitors to the nursing home 
its the chance of a lifetime to get to do this said paige 
johnson a giggly 8yearold who said 50 is old and mrs white is 
twiceold 
the students are involved in an adoptagrandparent program at 
the nursing home said teacher annie brown 
mrs white was born carrie joiner on nov 18 1874 in gadsden 
county she lived and worked near tallahassee and married john 
white who was a blacksmith or farmer 
in 1909 the day after her 35th birthday her husband committed 
her to the florida state hospital at chattahoochee a hospital for 
the mentally ill 
carrie will not talk about the past she realizes something 
bad happened and she doesnt care to remember mrs allen said 
monday 
at age 110 she was finally released from the hospital in 1984 
as part of a program to move geriatric mental patients from state 
institutions 
hospital records describe her problem as posttyphoid 
psychosis but doctors today dont recognize the term 
mrs allens attempts to locate mrs whites close relatives 
have failed although some distant cousins may have been located in 
texas

the house of commons makes its television debut 
tuesday with lights cameras but only some of the action 
a strict code has been laid down to save the mother of 
parliaments from making an unseemly spectacle of herself but while 
some honorable members dislike the whole idea others say the 
restrictions on what the cameras may show amount to censorship 
nonetheless when speaker bernard weatherill shows up on the 
nations tv sets kicking off the days debate in his black gown 
silk stockings and horsehair wig it will herald a change which 
most legislators are convinced will transform the character of 
parliament 
eight remotecontrol cameras have been installed in the ornate 
chamber and the air conditioning has been improved to cope with 
the heat from the chinese lanternshaped tv lights 
the parties have held training sessions to advise their members 
how to dress and speak on television mps have studied their 
performance on closedcircuit tv and in a special concession 
prime minister margaret thatcher has been allowed to practice 
privately in the house of commons using largetype notes so she 
doesnt have to wear glasses 
the front benches the leading members of the government and 
the opposition have been given advice about where to lean and 
where to look and to try to cover their bald patches said clare 
short of the opposition labor party 
the first live pictures from the house of commons on tuesday 
the day of the ceremonial state opening of parliament will show 
weatherill opening the days business 
then for the first time viewers will be able see opposition 
leader neil kinnock assessing queens speech and mrs thatcher 
responding 
from then on britains four national channels and the sky 
satellite network will be able to broadcast as much as they like of 
the daily proceedings live or recorded 
cspan the us cablesatellite public affairs network plans 
to offer portions of the debates to its subscribers 
cameras have been permitted in the us house of representatives 
since 1979 and in the senate since 1986 
the house of commons voted 318264 in june to allow in the 
cameras 
the house of lords britains unelected upper chamber has been 
televised since 1985 indeed even before the commons cameras 
switch on tv viewers will have seen queen elizabeth ii giving her 
regular annual address to the lords 
the commons arrangement is on a trial basis until july when the 
650 lawmakers can decide whether to make the arrangement permanent 
mrs thatcher is among those opposing the idea saying she fears 
for the good reputation of the commons 
mps have reason to be camerashy orators frequently have to 
shout over a din of boos and wisecracks while the speaker howls for 
order mps also like to sprawl out on the upholstered benches 
so a parliamentary committee has drawn up strict rules based on 
those used in canadas house of commons 
to deter members from flaunting buttons or attentiongetting 
garb cameras will be allowed to show only the head and shoulders 
of the member who has the floor 
on an occasion of grave disorder the cameras must ignore 
ruckusmakers and focus on the speaker 
the eating of oranges the reading of newspapers and the buzz 
of conversation will not be permitted to come between the mp and 
the eager viewer said conservative lawmaker julian critchley 
we shall appear as so many animated postage stamps 
former prime minister edward heath whose striking white hair 
and rumbling voice mark him as one of the best tv performers calls 
the rules illogical and completely unjustified i hope the 
television boys will soon sweep it all away 
mike broadbent who runs the bbcs commons coverage said we 
would much prefer to be in the same position as a person in the 
public galleries so we can see parliament warts and all 
the same rules have not stopped grandstanding in canada 
opposition members have flopped dead fish on the prime ministers 
empty desk and flashed a cabinet ministers home telephone number 
to get viewers to deluge him with complaints 
most of the pressure will be on kinnock and mrs thatcher 
especially during the cutandthrust of twiceweekly question 
time when mrs thatcher squares off for 15 minutes against all 
comers 
until now proceedings could be heard live on radio which was 
allowed into the commons in 1978 tv networks could play the sound 
but show only a file photo of the person speaking

the cockpit crew of flight 5050 called out all 
the proper flight checks but failed to fix a misaligned rudder 
before their plane skidded off the end of a new york laguardia 
airport runway flight recorder data indicated monday 
oh here goes nothin said inexperienced copilot 
constantine kleissas as he started a takeoff that ended in the east 
river with the jetliner in three pieces and two people dead 
a transcript of cockpit and radio conversations along with 
readings from a flight data recorder from the sept 20 crash 
however do not show conclusively whether the crackup was caused by 
human or mechanical error national transportation safety board 
investigators said 
flight 5050 headed for charlotte nc carried 57 passengers 
and a crew of six 
the safety board released a preliminary report on the 
recordings which are undergoing further analysis the two crew 
members have heard the tape and their comments are to be included 
in a later report the board said 
the transcript showed that kleissas and capt michael w martin 
had gone through a list of checks including a check of the rudder 
investigators said earlier that a device that holds the rudder 
steady during takeoff was wrongly set in the full left position 
which could account for the drift the pilot said led him to abort 
the takeoff 
the data recorder showed movement in controls that would 
normally occur as the pilot checks the positions of wing and tail 
surfaces that control takeoff and flight but the data also showed 
that the rudder position returned to 159 degrees left after 
the maneuvers when it should have been set at zero for takeoff 
all the appropriate items on the beforeengine start 
afterengine start the taxi and the beforetakeoff checklists were 
verbalized said safety board engineer james r cash in a 
description of the flight recorder conversations 
cash did not indicate however whether all the actions taken 
were at the correct time or whether all checks were actually made 
he said the first abnormal sounds on the recording came 35 
seconds before the crash when a bang was followed by a loud 
rumble he did not indicate the source of the sounds 
the transcript highlights kleissas inexperience as martin 
tells him what to do and corrects his callout of flight checks it 
was kleissas first operational takeoff of a 737 after completion 
of flight training he had flown 3300 flight hours mostly in 
smaller passenger planes 
a dialogue in the cockpit dramatizes earlier reports that 
kleissas accidentally hit a button that disconnected automatic 
throttle advances but the captain corrected the error by advancing 
the throttle manually 
i got the steering till you ah martin said 
ok said kleissas 
ok thats the wrong button pushed said martin 
oh yeah i knew that said the copilot 
its the one underneath there the captain said adding 
later all right ill set your power 
a few seconds before the plane skidded off the end of the 
runway martin took over the controls to abort the takeoff 
lets take it back the captain said 
this is followed according to the transcript by sounds 
similar to throttles hitting the idle stops rumble sound 
increases in amplitude sound of engine noise decreasing 
usair 5050 aborting kleissas said into the radio 
after 10 seconds without any human voices the copilot said 
were goin off were goin off were goin off 
this was followed by the sound of the crash and the end of the 
recording 
the safety board also released the results of drug tests on the 
pilot and copilot taken 44 hours after the crash 
the tests based on urine samples showed no trace of illegal 
substances 
the federal aviation administration suspended the licenses of 
both men two days after the crash citing their failure to appear 
immediately for drug and alcohol tests 
the drug report also quoted two new york police divers as saying 
they talked with the captain shortly after the crash and found no 
signs of intoxication both policemen were described as expert 
witnesses because of their experience with drug and alcohol abusers 
one diver edward dalessandro described martin as absolutely 
cleareyed calm and together the report said

a marxist and a conservative businessman 
on monday prepared strategies for a presidential runoff that offer 
voters a clear choice between right and left 
fernando collor de mello the top votegetter in last 
wednesdays election met with leaders of his centerright national 
reconstruction party in brasilia the capital to study tactics for 
the second round on dec 17 
luis inacio lula da silva of the radical left workers party 
huddled with his advisers in sao paulo brazils biggest city and 
industrial center 
with 993 percent of the ballots counted from last wednesdays 
vote collor de mello led the 21candidate field with 284 percent 
da silva was second with 161 percent 
more than 82 million brazilians were qualified to vote in 
brazils first free election for president since 1960 direct 
presidential balloting was banned during the 19641985 military 
regime and current civilian president jose sarney was chosen by an 
electoral college 
the new president will face a nation on the brink of 
hyperinflation burdened with huge foreign and internal debts 
the candidates admit the election will be a clear contest of 
left vs right but both are maneuvering to obtain broader support 
not only for the runoff but for a future government that must deal 
with an independent congress with added powers under brazils new 
1988 constitution 
all our contacts have an important electoral aspect but 
mainly they are aimed at creating conditions to govern said rep 
renan calheiros of collor de mellos national reconstruction party 
collor de mello 40 a former governor from the poor 
sugargrowing state of alagoas said he expects a major victory 
over da silva whose policies he characterized as radical 
his platform is sectarian restricted and extremely radical 
that alienates sectors fundamental for the formation of a 
government of national conciliation collor de mello said at a 
news conference 
collor de mello who has pledged to fight government corruption 
and reduce state interference in the economy said he would 
capitalize on the workers partys lackluster record in bigcity 
mayorships 
da silva 44 a former lathe operator and union president said 
he would paint his adversary as an ally of the hated military 
regime and a represenative of the conservative elite 
ideological polarization is inevitable said rep luiz 
gushiken president of the workers party we will try to show 
that collor de mello is a rightist and doesnt have the moral 
stature to represent the people 
he said the workers party expected to win the support of social 
democrats and especially the leftcenter democratic labor party of 
populist leonel brizola brizola came in third a scant 400000 
votes behind da silva 
brizola did not admit defeat and said his party was considering 
requesting a recount but aides said the candidate could throw his 
support to da silva

not true said steven israel owner of one times square the 
building millions stare at in the waning seconds of each year last 
year he got rid of the tourismtouting big apple that was used 
for several years and brought back the classic ball 
i think its a great american tradition israel said i 
fought hard to keep that tradition by bringing back the old ball 
and ill make sure it stays that way

solidarity leader lech walesa arrived 
monday after a successful us tour pledging that eastern europe 
and latin america would work together in improving their 
debtridden economies 
sporting a us congressional tie clasp and a medallion of 
polands black madonna walesa was greeted by hundreds of labor 
leaders and members of the polish community as he landed at 
venezuelas simon bolivar international airport on a private 
chartered flight 
walesa was in venezuela to attend a world labor summit called by 
the world confederation of labor a 50 millionmember organization 
to which his solidarity trade union is affiliated 
enthusiastic reporters broke through a cordon as walesa 
descended on the tarmac and surrounded the jovial union man who 
thrilled crowds on his us tour 
do not fear walesa is here to be with you to serve you and 
not to govern you walesa said speaking through an interpreter 
walesa said poland and latin america shared common interests in 
fighting for solutions to their foreign debt burdens 
the debt is like a man with swollen feet who cannot put his 
shoes on it is impossible to move forward said walesa 
poland owes foreign banks 38 billion while venezuela the 
fourthlargest latin american debtor owes 34 billion to banks 
mostly in the united states the total third world debt stands at 
13 trillion 
asked whether possible us aid to troubled eastern europe would 
mean less funds available for latin america and africa walesa 
pledged international solidarity in solving the global crisis 
it is a poor militant who cannot recognize the necessity in a 
brother latin america has a moral imperative to receive aid 
because of past exploitation said walesa 
walesa said solutions would come when developing nations like 
eastern europe improved the efficiency of their economies 
but not at the cost of the worker the unions must fight for 
all they can they must be strong walesa said 
but they must not strangle the system in which they operate 
he added 
walesa said he had no political ambitions in poland where a 
coalition he helped form three months ago ousted a hardline 
communist regime 
he compared himself to an antihero saying he was willing 
to serve but did not expect any honors from it 
walesa was scheduled to stay in venezuela for three days to 
attend the labor summit and meet venezuelan political leaders

two families tried in separate ways monday 
to deal with the knowledge they raised each others child and a 
legal battle loomed against a hospital their lawyers blame for 
switching newborns 
relatives said robert mays was in seclusion with kimberly the 
girl hes raised since birth more than 10 years ago and just 
discovered isnt his real daughter 
kimberly michelle mays is really the child of ernest and regina 
twigg according to the results of genetic blood tests made public 
sunday attorneys for both families say the tests also showed that 
arlena the daughter the twiggs reared was born to mays and his 
late wife barbara who died of cancer in 1981 
arlena died of heart disease last year 
when mays was told sunday that his only biological child had 
died the first thing he asked was the site of her grave said his 
attorney arthur ginsburg 
mays was expected to return to sarasota on tuesday and attend a 
news conference wednesday at his attorneys office legal assistant 
judy lee said 
the parents say the girls were born just a few days apart in 
late november and early december 1978 at hardee memorial hospital 
in wauchula in rural central florida 
with results of the genetic tests the twiggs lawyer john 
blakely said he will press the hospital harder for information 
about how the babies were switched 
the hardee memorial hospital has been uncooperative in helping 
us solve this tragedy blakely said its been a real tragedy 
for the two families and hopefully we will find out how it 
happened 
blakely has filed a federal suit against hardee memorial 
alleging employees switched the twiggs newborn for a sickly child 
through negligence medical malpractice or deliberate acts 
ginsburg said mays also might sue 
it was either a terribly negligent act or somebodys done 
something deliberately thats hurt a lot of people the lawyer 
said there isnt any fair amount of money to compensate them for 
what theyve gone through and what theyre going to go through 
harrell connelly administrator of hardee memorial was 
unavailable for comment monday the hospital switchboard would only 
take messages and calls were not returned janet adams of orlando 
the hospitals lawyer didnt immediately return calls 
the battle over kimberly was the outgrowth of the arlenas fatal 
heart condition blood tests revealed she wasnt related to either 
of the twiggs after her death the couple began a 14month search 
for the child they lost 
so far they have only seen pictures of the slender hazeleyed 
kimberly the next step is for psychologists to interview the girl 
and draw up plans for a first meeting and a schedule for visitation 
to get mays to agree to genetic testing the twiggs agreed not 
to seek custody they say theyll be satisfied with visitation 
privileges 
after we consulted with some psychologists we determined that 
it would most likely be in kimberlys best interest to stay with 
mr mays blakely said monday during an appearance with the 
couple on cbs this morning 
were trying to work it out so kimberly can be a real winner 
in this matter she can maintain her loving relationship with the 
man who she has thought to be her father while simultaneously she 
can get two new loving parents additional parents he said 
ginsburg said he hadnt talked to mays since giving him the test 
results and didnt know how kimberly reacted 
kimberly is our granddaughter she is still our 
granddaughter merle coker the man kimberly calls grandpa said 
monday were doing fine well survive well play it by ear

congress needs to put tighter reins on mass 
mailings from private groups that raise millions of dollars by 
raising questions about the future of social security and preying 
on the fears of the elderly a senate panel was told monday 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny said fright mail often 
arrives in officiallooking envelopes from groups with names 
resembling those of government agencies exhorting senior citizens 
to send money to protect their benefits 
he displayed a stack of mailings and solicitations received by 
an 85yearold new york man that moynihan said was enough to 
chill your blood 
more and more we receive letters from seniors expressing 
concern about this pattern said moynihan chairman of the 
finance subcommittee on social security and family policy there 
is a common element of fright 
sen thomas daschle dsd said there is growing support in 
congress for legislation to rein in such mailings adding that some 
groups should be thrown in jail for the kinds of things that have 
been perpetrated on senior citizens 
postal service officials told the subcommittee that misleading 
mailings are a top priority for investigators but many cannot be 
stopped under current law because they do not constitute outright 
fraud or false representation 
many mailings which may confuse some postal customers into 
believing that they originated with or had the approval of the 
social security administration or some other agency of the united 
states government cannot be successfully challenged said kenneth 
m hearst assistant chief postal inspector for criminal 
investigations 
the postal service suspects some groups use the mailings for 
padding very nice payrolls but the money is long gone by the 
time a lengthy criminal investigation can be completed said george 
c davis assistant general counsel for the postal service 
clamping more restrictions on the mailings is tricky to do without 
encroaching on free speech protections he said 
its very difficult to pass legislation that outlaws sleaze 
davis said 
the postal officials voiced support for legislation sponsored by 
sens john heinz rpa and david pryor dark that would 
require groups using officialsounding names seals and insignias 
to include a conspicuous disclaimer of government affiliation 
heinz cited groups such as the social security protection 
bureau the internal review service and the national senior 
advisory center as among those whose names imply a government 
affiliation where none exists 
we need a bigger stick to protect our constituents heinz 
said we have an obligation to stop these kinds of deceptive 
activities 
congressional concern about private mass mailings increased this 
year after many groups used the mail to mobilize opposition to the 
medicare catastrophic health insurance program enacted last year 
critics said many of the letters led senior citizens to believe the 
program would cost them more than it did 
moynihan said several direct mail companies and private groups 
that use mass mailings were invited to testify at mondays hearing 
but only two agreed to appear and one didnt show up 
the lone group to send a representative was the nonprofit 
national committee to preserve social security and medicare whose 
president martha mcsteen defended the groups educational 
mailings to senior citizens 
she said the group was founded in 1982 by james roosevelt a 
former congressman and the eldest son of franklin d roosevelt to 
be a grassroots organization watching out for social security 
moynihan however questioned whether the idea for the group 
originated with a directmail outfit that wanted a new source of 
business and recruited roosevelt to serve as a consultant 
heinz acknowledged that the groups mailings include a 
disclaimer of government affiliation but said it is difficult to 
read the fly speck print

a house panel seeking to determine whether 
political pressure scuttled a major agent orange study voted 
monday to subpoena records of white house deliberations on the 
issue during the reagan administration 
members of the human resources and intergovernmental relations 
subcommittee of the house government operations committee voted 
unanimously to authorize the subpoena 
rep ted weiss dny the chairman of the panel said he would 
not seek to serve the subpoena before next week while the panel 
negotiates with the white house counsels office for the release of 
the documents 
the panel is seeking minutes of meetings of the white house 
domestic policy council working group on agent orange for the eight 
years of the reagan administration 
the committee is investigating why a federal centers for disease 
control scientific study of agent orange exposure among veterans of 
the vietnam war was cancelled weiss said the study was either 
botched or rigged he said he wants to see if the records reveal 
whether white house policymakers had the study halted 
at a hearing before the panel in july dr vernon n houk of the 
cdc denied there was any political interverence houk was chairman 
of a scientific panel of the working group 
houk said the study was abandoned in 1986 because the cdc 
couldnt find the right data to develop a valid method to study the 
health effects of the defoliant 
but several other scientists including a former cdc researcher 
dr dennis m smith testified that the needed information 
including details of troop movements was available from the 
defense departments environmental study group 
many vietnam veterans contend that they have developed cancer or 
other ailments and that their children have a high incidence of 
birth defects because of their exposure to agent orange a toxic 
chemical used to clear dense jungle during the war there are 
34000 veterans seeking government benefits as a result of 
disabilities they say were caused by agent orange

nicolae ceausescu rejected the reform 
sweeping eastern europe and said monday the land he rules like a 
feudal lord will stick to its rigid marxist course thousands of 
supporters cheered and applauded on cue 
romanias president and communist party chief implied treason on 
the part of radical reformers in the soviet bloc they used their 
leadership position not for the people but to change the system 
he declared at the opening of the 14th communist party congress 
his voice rising with emotion 
ceausescu used no names but his remark seemed to be directed at 
party leaders in poland and hungary which have turned toward 
democracy and freemarket economies 
it is said that he urged the warsaw pact to consider invading 
poland but the reports have not been confirmed 
the romanian leader a maverick who refused to follow the 
soviets in breaking relations with israel in 1967 would not join 
the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 and has an independent 
foreign policy left no doubt monday that he does not agree with 
mikhail s gorbachevs more liberal kremlin 
in romania he said there will be still more powerful growth 
of the partys leading role and the states already pervasive 
presence will even grow in the organization and management of 
the nation 
the party cannot give up its revolutionary responsibility 
he told more than 3000 delegates in palace hall it cannot 
surrender its historical mission to another force 
his clear reference was to reform in the soviet union radical 
change in poland and hungary and the fall of orthodox communist 
regimes in east germany and bulgaria 
romania is a regular target at international human rights 
meetings for suppressing dissent and restricting religious freedom 
adding to the misery of the nations 23 million people are years of 
shortages that have led to poorly stocked grocery stores cold 
apartments and cars without gasoline 
to protest ceausescus human rights record ambassadors of all 
nato countries except turkey stayed away from opening day of the 
congress 
the us embassy issued a statement saying it was not 
represented because attendance of any of the activities would be 
inconsistent with the depth of us concern over the human rights 
situation in romania for which the romanian communist party bears 
responsibility 
also missing for the first time was a party delegation from 
hungary which is at odds with romania over alleged mistreatment of 
this countrys hungarian minority 
ceausescu spoke for more than five hours to orchestrated shows 
of affection by the delegates 
when their 71yearold leader invoked romanias determination to 
defend its independence or praised the communist party the 
delegates rose as one to chant romania communism ceausescu 
heroism or ceausescu romania and the romanian communist 
party 
delegates clapped in unison during these outbursts some of 
which lasted nearly a minute at a wave from ceausescu who has 
been in power 24 years they stopped abruptly and sat down 
his wife elena and son nicu both senior party officials 
gazed stolidly from a stage full of ranking functionaries as 
ceausescu exhorted the partys 38 million members to build 
communism 
despite criticizing the liberalization elsewhere in eastern 
europe ceausescu said romania would continue in the warsaw pact 
and the comecon economic alliance 
ceausescu appeared to indicate a change in past policy of 
unilateral military cuts by saying romania would give full heed 
to the continuous strengthening of the countrys defense 
capability 
delegates rose in protracted demonstrations of support when 
ceausescu mentioned romanias intention to defend its 
soverereignty which he did at least 10 times 
hopes rose in romania that food and fuel supplies would improve 
after ceausescu announced last spring that the multibilliondollar 
foreign debt had been paid off 
improvement has been slow however and western diplomats said 
an important reason was depleted stockpiles from years of producing 
for export to pay the debt

canadian prime minister brian mulroney told his 
soviet counterpart monday the kremlin can count on the cooperation 
of its arctic neighbor in carrying out its perestroika reform 
program 
mulroney delivered that message to premier nikolai i ryzhkov on 
the first day of the canadian leaders sixday visit said soviet 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
gerasimov noted that 240 canadian business representatives had 
arrived in moscow along with mulroney and that for the soviets it 
was clear we can count on the cooperation of business circles of 
canada in carrying out perestroika the overhaul of society 
undertaken by president mikhail s gorbachev 4 years ago 
mulroney the first canadian prime minister to make an official 
visit to moscow since 1971 signed a dozen agreements with ryzhkov 
after their talks they include accords on preserving the 
environment of the vast arctic protecting canadian businesses 
capital investments in the soviet union preventing marine 
pollution in the arctic preventing drug abuse and trafficking and 
promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy gerasimov said 
mulroney is scheduled to meet tuesday with gorbachev whom he 
has called a genuine reformer and foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze 
in addition he will help inaugurate the canadaussr 
business council whose members are hoping to conclude deals with 
the soviets during the visit 
in an interview with izvestia mulroney said the investments 
planned by business leaders will total more than 850000 and that 
figure could increase 
gerasimov noted that so far trade has been largely onesided 
with the soviet union buying wheat from canada and exporting very 
little 
canadas approach to trade contacts with the soviet union 
unlike that of italy and the federal republic of germany has been 
politicized to such an extent that ottawa at times turns out to be 
rather overzealous in abiding by various kinds of trade 
restrictions and often outperforms its southern neighbor the 
united states in this respect tass said 
the number of canadian firms offices in moscow can be counted 
on a pair of hands the number of sovietcanadian joint ventures is 
also small 
mulroney arrived from sweden where he said gorbachev is a 
genuine reformer and should be supported 
clearly this man has taken his part of the world down a brand 
new path he said

agricultural reforms undertaken by moscow are 
not likely to affect the soviet unions grain import requirements 
for at least the next few years an agriculture department report 
said monday 
the united states and the soviet union are scheduled to begin 
talks in moscow next month on a new longterm grain supply 
agreement 
with stocks of most us grains down markets are extremely 
sensitive to speculation about soviet purchases the departments 
economic research service said in a new outlook report 
for moscow the agency said the grain discussions come at a 
politically delicate time as soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
attempts to reform soviet agriculture while striving to restructure 
the government 
while the success of the reforms remains to be seen they 
likely will not seriously affect the total amount of grain the 
ussr needs to purchase on international markets for the next 
several years the report said 
the agency said us retail food prices for 1989 are up nearly 6 
percent from 1988 the largest rise since 1981 last years food 
price increase was 41 percent and the 6 percent rise for 1989 had 
been forecast for some time 
looking to 1990 the report said normal crop production and a 
slower growth in consumers disposable income will mean slower 
increases in food prices than in 1989 
an official forecast of 1990 food prices will be released next 
week at the departments annual outlook conference some usda 
economists think next years prices may be held to a gain of 4 
percent to 6 percent given normal weather during the growing 
season

a 4yearold connecticut boy is just one 
victim of a barrage of potentially dangerous toys that will bombard 
parents looking for perfect toys as holiday gifts for children a 
consumer group said monday 
we think that its a more dangerous situation this year than 
weve remembered in our 18 years of toy surveying ann brown 
chairwoman of the consumer affairs committee of americans for 
democratic action said in releasing the groups annual toy safety 
and quality report 
brown was joined by judy lavoie and her son greg of bethel 
conn 
greg had two operations after perforating his eardrum with a 
packing stick included with the pepsicolacocacola delivery 
truck listed by the consumer group as one of its most potentially 
dangerous toys 
mrs lavoie said the manufacturer new jerseybased buddy l 
corp told her that the package clearly states the stick is a part 
of the packaging and not the toy but she displayed an unopened 
model of the toy she said she bought over the weekend that didnt 
include that information 
the manufacturer temporarily suspended shipment of the trucks 
after gregs august 1988 accident and printed larger stickers 
warning parents that the packing rod should be discarded said 
george fink buddy l senior vice president 
we did not feel that after shipping 750000 of these units 
with one complaint that we had a dangerous toy said fink 
explaining why the company didnt recall the trucks already on the 
market to include the warning sticker 
toy safety has become a contradiction in terms according to 
the consumer groups 135page report that surveyed 51 toys 
brown blamed the influx of more dangerous toys on the 
powerlessness of the consumer product safety commission 
the consumer product safety commission which has jurisdiction 
over toys used to be just be a toothless tiger she said im 
afraid the tiger has now fallen over dead 
brown criticized the panels lack of a quorum of three 
commissioners since january early saturday the senate confirmed 
jacqueline jonessmith as the third commissioner and chairwoman of 
the panel 
we will look into every product on that list and make a 
determination as to whether any action is necessary said cpsc 
spokesman dan rumelt 
the report cites cpsc statistics that estimate there were 
142000 toyrelated injuries in 1988 an increase of 11000 over 
1987 nursery productrelated injuries to children under 5 totaled 
72000 in 1988 
the ada report which previously cited only toys this year 
includes infant and childrens products 
the group cites 13 toys a bakers dirty dozen of the most 
potentially dangerous toys it also recommends from among this 
years most heavily advertised toys 10 products for the toy box 
and an equal number for the trash box 
bob jacobs president of aqua sling whose water balloon sling 
shot is among the groups dirty dozen said most of the problems 
associated with the product were related to user responsibility 
we havent had anybody hurt by the product everybody thats 
had any problems with it has been with misuse of the product 
said jacobs who runs the business from his california garage 
brown recommended that product be taken off the market 
describing an incident in which one of the balloons hit a kid in 
the chest and caused temporary heart failure 
also cited among the worst toys for the 1989 holiday season are 
five toys with walt disney and sesame street character names 
including a mickeys pillow friend cuddling cushion that brown set 
afire to show its flammability 
there are stringent requirements for childrens sleepwear 
why shouldnt there be for childrens toys brown asked 
we use outside labs and internal labs to assure the safety of 
the toys said martin scheman president of illco toy co whose 
disney babies and sesame street crib and playpen toys were cited 
because they come apart easily leaving sharp edges that pose a 
hazard 
the report outlined several categories of potentially dangerous 
toys including 
items that explode to make loud noises which can damage ears 
or cause hearing loss 
projectiles that use guns or rubber devices 
toys that invite eating which young children will do whether 
edible or not 
inexpensive checkout counter toys that encourage impulse buying 
novelty items that arent toys but are sold in toy stores 
toys with inadequate or misleading age labels in some cases 
manufacturers label toys not for children under 3 when they are 
intended to appeal to exactly that age group 
items children take to bed with them that are flammable 
poorly made licensed items with familiar childhood and cartoon 
characters

the national legislature gave preliminary approval 
monday to an emergency economic package that imposes new price 
controls and bans the export of scarce goods in a bid to stop the 
slide in the soviet standard of living 
the official news agency tass said the supreme soviet took the 
action in an attempt to help retirees and other lowincome groups 
that are hardpressed by price increases and the widespread 
shortage of basic goods and supplies 
the measure bans price increases for several commodities as 
well as clothes and shoes and places a quota on the export of such 
scarce items as fish products fur and electric appliances 
tass said many soviet businesses have been exporting these 
items rather than make them available to the domestic economy in 
order to obtain coveted foreign currency 
the measure which is to be presented to the 2250member 
congress of peoples deputies during next session which begins 
dec 12 also enables the state to order production of inexpensive 
items for retirees and children that businesses have stopped 
manufacturing because they are not profitable 
deputy premier leonid i abalkin president mikhail s 
gorbachevs chief economist proposed the measures a week after a 
conference of academics and economic managers recommended 
longerterm fixes for the soviet economy the conference suggested 
measured price increases dumping unprofitable state businesses 
expanding forms of ownership and development of a stock market

nbc news finding the use of news recreations in 
its yesterday today amp tomorrow specials too confusing to 
viewers said monday it wont use the technique anymore it wont 
keep the show either 
no nbc news staff members will continue on the show including 
its anchor team of mary alice williams maria shriver and chuck 
scarborough said tom ross a senior vice president at nbc news 
three ytt specials have aired the first on aug 2 a fourth 
made by nbc news and with a news event reenactment by actors will 
air on nov 28 after that nbc said the ytt concept will go to 
nbc entertainment for further development 
once considered a candidate to be nbcs only prime time news 
series ytt was the only nbc news show on which recreations were 
used cbs news lowrated saturday night with connie chung 
series still uses them no abc news series does or will abc news 
president roone arledge has said 
nbc news president michael gartner asked if the use of news 
recreations in network news programs is on the way out had a 
prompt reply 
it is at nbc he said it was an experiment were proud 
of what we did for reasons of clarity however we wont be doing 
them any longer 
those who use recreations on the cbs and nbc programs defend 
them as accurate and wellsourced but the technique which dates 
to network radio days has been criticized in recent months by such 
traditionalists as former cbs news president richard salant 
they argue that news recreations among other things confuse 
viewers about what is real and what is recreated with actors 
playing actual people 
the ytt recreations while overseen by nbc news were made in 
los angeles by cosgrovemeurer productions which makes the nbc 
entertainment series unsolved mysteries 
in a statement announcing the change gartner agreed with the 
critics contentions saying that we have determined that the 
practice can result in confusion to the viewers 
he also said ytt experimented with other new techniques that may 
be incorporated in the new primetime news series that jane pauley 
will anchor next summer pauley is leaving as today coanchor 
in january 
in an interview gartner said that while all of ytts 
recreations were done responsibly there still seemed to be some 
confusion everytime you said recreation it sort of set off a 
little alarm in the viewers mind 
so i decided that the only way that nbc could deal with it is 
to just say there are no recreations on nbc news and that 
removes all doubt and confusion 
well hooray this is good news salant said of gartners 
decision 
cbs news spokesman tom goodman said there was no truth to 
reports chungs cbs show would drop news recreations 
were doing a mix of features interviews and segments with 
reconstructions goodman said well continue to do them 
recreations and other things as well 
saturdays chung show has no news recreations he said of nine 
shows broadcast to date three had no recreations four had 
recreation segments and two consisted entirely of a recreated news 
story he said 
everette dennis executive director of the gannett center for 
media studies has said hes not disturbed by responsible network 
news recreations he expressed reservations monday about nbcs 
decision to drop them 
i would frankly rather have seen recreations develop and 
mature as a legitimate news tool rather than simply be relegated 
back to the entertainment division he said

an american physician who was arrested and 
held overnight in connection with her work at a lutheran church 
clinic in san salvador said monday her ordeal was nothing 
compared to what the salvadoran people have suffered 
asked at a news conference whether she would return to el 
salvador after her experience in the countrys capital last week 
dr paula brentlinger said until conditions exist that would 
permit me to work as a physician i am not sure what the point 
would be 
if i were to go back now i think id be in hiding with a lot 
of other people because it was made very clear to me that i would 
not be permitted to work the family doctor from seattle said 
she was detained along with 11 foreign health professionals and 
lay church workers and three salvadorans last thursday they were 
taken to treasury police headquarters where they were questioned 
held overnight and then released 
the sick and wounded still lie unattended in the battle zones 
of the capital she said the geneva conventions despite the 
pleas of the red cross the churches and even the guerrilla forces 
are not being respected what i went through was nothing compared 
to what the salvadoran people have suffered in the last ten years 
and ten days of the war 
the doctor who said she was raised as a congregationalist has 
worked periodically since 1986 as a volunteer physician with the 
lutheran church of el salvador since september she has been 
treating patients at several sites in san salvador before that 
she was with the pacific medical center in seattle 
physicians for human rights an organization of health 
professionals that sponsored her press conference here said she 
was returning to seattle to continue her practice of medicine 
the doctor gave this account of her arrest 
at around 4 pm on nov 16 as i was preparing to examine a 
woman in labor armed and uniformed members of the salvadoran 
national guard came into the building in which we were working 
they demanded to see the passports of all the foreigners in the 
building after we handed over our documents the guardsmen loaded 
us into a pickup truck and took us to their headqaurters 
she said they were blindfolded and driven somewhere within the 
police headquarters where they were handcuffed 
treasury policemen shouted to each other that we were the 
foreigners who had been providing medical attention to wounded 
guerrilla combatants she said i was eventually taken from my 
cell where i had been forced to stand blindfolded and handcuffed 
by a treasury policeman who partly removed my blindfold and then 
yelled in my ear that i should tell him how many guerrillas i had 
taken care of at the lutheran clinic 
the doctor who told reporters that the clinic did not ask for 
the political affiliation of patients and would treat the wounded 
of either side said she was attempting to answer this question 
when another policeman entered the room asked her name and told 
her interrogator to remove the handcuffs 
at this point the interrogation became fairly courteous and 
my blindfold and handcuffs were removed she said i spend most

one million silver dollars would be minted to 
commemorate 100 years of statehood for idaho montana washington 
wyoming and the dakotas under legislation approved monday by the 
house 
a similar measure already passed the senate differences between 
the two bills will be worked out by a conference committee 
in the minting of this coin we are recognizing the importance 
of silver to all the states involved both historically and 
economically said rep pat williams dmont before the house 
passed on voice vote the bill he cosponsored 
the six states entered the union in 1889 and 1890 
williams noted that one of the largest silver deposits ever 
discovered was in montana 
the centennial coins and silver proof sets will also provide a 
helpful boost to the regional mining recovery now under way said 
rep larry craig ridaho who also cosponsored the measure 
the coins will contain 90 percent silver and 10 percent alloy 
each coin will be sold for 20 to 25 
the bill also authorizes production of a mint set that would be 
more than 99 percent silver 
the houses original bill called for the minting of 350000 
fivedollar palladium coins but the scarcity of the precious metal 
caused the body to drop that provision before passing the measure 
further study is being conducted however and williams said the 
conference committee might find a way to include the minting of 
some palladium coins in the legislation 
a fivedollar palladium coin would be sold for more than 300 
an aide to williams estimated 
the secretary of the treasury would decide on the design for the 
coins after consultation with the commission on fine arts 
according to the bill 
profits from selling the coins would help reduce the national 
debt and to pay for a traveling exhibit of historic documents 
relating to each states course toward statehood 
the coins would be sold by the treasury department at outlets 
mostly banks throughout the country

a nasa team has fleshed out president bushs 
visions of american outposts on the moon and mars with a script 
that would have four humans arriving on the red planet in 2011 and 
returning for a 600day stay in 2018 
the study delivered to the national space council does not 
contain any estimates of cost but director richard darman of the 
office of management and budget has put the price tag of going to 
mars in the 400 billion range 
the report envisions space station freedom which is scheduled 
to be completed in 1999 becoming a transportation node where 
both lunar and mars vehicles will be assembled tested launched 
and refurbished to fly again 
the report was commissioned by nasa administrator richard truly 
to provide a database for the national space council as it 
considers approaches for meeting the presidents goals 
we will not stop at the moon the report said because the 
imperative to explore will lead men and women to mars the planet 
most like earth mars offers many unique scientific opportunities 
but perhaps the most intriguing question is whether life exeists or 
has ever existed on mars 
life may exist on mars today the study said in underground 
habitats where volcanic heating melts ground ice producing a warm 
wet environment protected from harsh surface conditions 
five approaches for meeting bushs goals are laid out 
approach a would establish a human presence on the moon in 2001 
permanently occupying it in 2002 and leveling off development of 
the outpost in 2012 in order to finance start of a mars expedition 
arriving in 2016 
approach b would delay some of the science activities on both 
moon and mars in order to advance the martian arrival to 2011 
approaches c and d would alter the timelines somewhat the 
latter delaying milestones by 2 to 3 years 
under approach e activities on the moon would be cut back to 
only one mission a year humans would return to the moon one 
flight a year beginning in 2004 for tours of duty ranging from 30 
days to 6 months in this scenario the first crew of four would 
arrive on mars in 2016 
any such largescale endeavors the report says requires launch 
vehicles with much greater capacity to lift heavy payloads 
approximately 60 metric tons 132000 pounds for the lunar 
outpost and about 140 metric tons 309000 pounds for the mars 
outpost 
the shuttles cargo capacity ordered to be lowered as one 
result of the challenger accident is 38000 pounds 
the report said its planning for human exploration of the solar 
system has concentrated on use of high performance engines and a 
technique called aerobraking where the atmosphere of planet is used 
to decelerate a spacecraft and change its trajectory 
the study recommends consideringh nuclear propulsion as a major 
alternative 
no significant united states program is investigating the 
potential of nuclear thermal rocket propulsion for exploration 
missions the report said facilities for testing nuclear 
thermal rocket systems is a major issue that must be resolved in 
order to make development of this extremely effective technology 
possible

the state department on monday canceled a 
visit by a highlevel official from czechoslovakia and condemned 
the use of force by police against peaceful demonstrators in prague 
were disappointed richard schifter the head of the 
departments human rights office told ambassador miroslav 
houstecky who was handed a 600word statement of sharp us 
disapproval 
earlier margaret d tutwiler the departments spokeswoman 
said the police actions were in sharp contrast to other east 
european countries who are beginning to respond to the wishes of 
their people 
she said authorities in prague had damaged czechoslovakias 
credibility at home and abroad 
ambassador houstecky was simultanteously called to schifters 
office to receive an official protest while he probably assumed it 
was coming the envoy apparently was taken by surprise by the 
cancellation of a planned visit by jan fojtik the czechoslovakian 
communist party ideology chief 
his visit later this month was to mark a general improvement in 
us relations with the communist government secretary of state 
james a baker iii met in september in new york with foreign 
minister jaromir johanes it was the first session at that high a 
level in 11 years lowerlevel officials subsequently held other 
meetings 
schifter reminded houstecky that czechoslovakias poor human 
rights record was the major barrier between the two countries and 
that we were going to engage at high levels to overcome that 
barrier nat kingsley a department press officer said 
because of of recent violent attacks we are canceling the 
invitation the us human rights chief said the 
czechoslovakian government has totally ignored the basic thrust of 
the dialogue begun in a sincere atmosphere in new york 
the ambassador did not respond directly although he was clearly 
aware of what was going on in prague kingsley said he talked 
about a need to move forward without chaos the us official 
said 
the protest statement said the czechoslovakian government has 
made a mockery of the dialogue begun in new york we are even 
more disappointed that the czechoslovak government has demonstrated 
so violently its unwillingness to address its citizens hopes for 
democracy it said 
ending on a hopeful note the statement said for the sake of 
the people of czechoslovakia who have known democracy and freedom 
and who have suffered so obviously the united states government 
hopes the government of czechoslovakia will promptly reconsider its 
policies

the vice chief of naval operations said monday 
that the recent series of navy accidents that have claimed nine 
lives since late october has affected recruiting 
if i was a parent i would be concerned by what i read in the 
headlines in the papers adm leon a edney told a house armed 
services subcommittee hearing on whether a connection exists among 
the spate of deadly accidents 
the rash of accidents prompted the navy last week to order an 
unprecedented standdown from most routine training to allow a 
review of basic safety and operating procedures 
edney said the standdown which requires ships air squadrons 
and shore installations to interrupt normal operations and conduct 
the review for a 48hour period wont be completed until wednesday 
it will be some two to three weeks before we know what lessons 
weve learned edney told two subcommittees military personnel 
and compensation and seapower and strategic and critical 
materials its too early to have a report 
since oct 29 nine people have been killed or lost at sea and 
at least 45 people injured 
the navy counted 101 operation and training related 
fatalities between jan 1 and nov 1 including the explosion 
aboard the uss iowa april 19 that killed 47 sailors 
questioned by lawmakers as to whether the accidents have had an 
impact on recruiting edney said i think it all has an effect 
he provided no specifics 
certainly theres no question that when youve got a young man 
or woman coming into the service which is the most precious thing 
that you own youre concerned about those things edney said in 
reference to a parents response to the accidents 
complicating the situation would be if a parent has a 
perception that an institution is not doing its job thoroughly 
enough or takes a cavalier attitude or is a little bit complacent 
on safety itll affect retention and recruiting and it should 
thats why were doing everything in our power were giving 
it our best shot edney said 
the admiral reiterated the navys contention that there is no 
central thread to all the accidents he said the quality of the 
personnel remains excellent and disputed claims that the tempo 
operations are too intense for most seamen 
the tempo of operations has not increased in the last four to 
five years edney said 
budget cuts have had some effect but not on training for the 
navy 
we dont reduce their training when the money gets short we 
reduce the number of people we put through edney said

defense secretary dick cheney spurred by 
reforms in eastern europe and fiscal pressures at home on monday 
analyzed worstcase scenario budget cuts that could include a 
20 billion slash in projected spending for the 1991 fiscal year 
sources said 
cheney in more than four hours of conferences with the 
pentagons civilian leadership the chiefs of the army navy and 
air force and joint chiefs chairman gen colin powell also 
reviewed the militarys suggestions for dealing with his orders to 
cut spending by 180 billion between 199294 other sources said 
the longrange cutbacks are thought to be the most painful 
considered by pentagon leaders since the end of the vietnam war 
they envision possibly closing as many as 15 air force bases 
cutting back five air force fighter wings stretching out the 
purchase of the b2 stealth bomber mothballing the navys four 
battleships and at least two carriers and eliminating up to four 
army divisions said one pentagon official who spoke privately 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said cheney had not made any 
decisions about the reported suggestions 
this is a worstcase scenario williams said adding that 
the secretary wants the services to conduct the budget exercise 
to be ready to respond given the changes occurring under soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev and the budget pressures of the nations 
deficit 
in a dynamic era you have to have a dynamic process and plan 
accordingly williams said 
there is real pain when you cut the defense budget he said 
the question is how much pain can you take and still ensure the 
nations security 
over the weekend congress approved a 286 billion defense 
budget for the 1990 fiscal year that began oct 1 
another senior pentagon official who spoke on condition he not 
be identified by name said cheney is negotiating with budget 
director richard darmen on plans for a possible spending cut for 
the 1991 fiscal year or about 20 billion in cuts from the 
projected 317 billion a revised figured settled on earlier this 
year that takes inflation into account 
it could be that bad the official said it could be that 
we have to cut that much 
the pentagon expects to have its 1991 spending projection 
submitted to the office of management and budget by dec 8 the 
official said 
cheney ordered the armed services last week to come up with the 
180 billion in spending cuts but didnt direct how the cuts 
should be made 
the service chiefs reported back to him monday with details 
about how they would function in the coming years if such cuts had 
to be made another pentagon official said 
these are very significant cuts that we are talking about 
and congress is going to have to be made aware that there is a 
price to be paid when we talk about a smaller defense budget this 
is going to affect the folks here and the folks out there in the 
various states the official said 
in a rare confluence of budget planning discussions williams 
said pentagon officials are juggling questions dealing with budget 
uncertainties for the current fiscal year demands to produce 
budget plans for the upcoming fiscal year by early december and at 
the same time produce longterm budget projections for up to 1994 
williams said it was clear to the pentagon leadership that 
president bushs earlier projections for 1 percent spending 
increases for fiscal 1991 and 1992 followed by 2 percent increases 
in 1993 and 1994 arent realistic anymore 
we know we wont get 317 billion for 1991 but if we sat 
here dumb fat and happpy and didnt plan for the future and 
went along as if nothing had changed congress would be howling 
dont they see the deficit dont they see the world has changed 
the message has gone out we are looking for realistic goals 
williams said 
cheney has no intention of going up to capitol hill and having 
his budget thrown back in his face williams said this is 
going to be a very painful process for everyone 
williams denied that if the pentagon plans for budget cuts it 
might weaken bushs hand at the upcoming summit with gorbachev 
this is a planning process and we have to take a long look 
down the road he said 
we wont do anything unilaterally and a whole lot ifs must 
be answered these things can happen if the conventional force 
talks in vienna are successful if the strategic arms talks are 
successful if the soviets stop their meddling in the third world

the superconducting super collider will still 
meet its original standards and 59 billion price tag despite a 
conceptual flaw a highranking energy department official told 
members of congress on monday 
deputy energy secretary henson moore said doe has no plans to 
move the collider from texas contrary to a published report that 
suggested a change in the design could result in a smaller less 
powerful collider that would be unsuitable for its chosen site at 
waxahachie 
as far as were concerned nothings changed moore said in 
an interview we have no official reports requests proposals 
any different than were going to build the super collider right 
there in texas for 59 billion 
the washington post on sunday quoted unnamed us officials and 
private scientists who suggested that making extensive 
modifications in the plans could reopen the battle for the particle 
accelerator by allowing other states to argue that waxahachie is no 
longer the ideal site 
moore said information in the story was provided from people who 
are angry because we told them there arent going to be any cost 
overruns on this project 
theyre people who want to take a house we had designed to 
build and add a swimming pool to it and add all kind of extras to 
it and thought they could get it through in the name of science 
moore said 
the contractor is to provide the energy department by december 
with recommendations for any technical modifications to the 
colliders conceptual plan moore said adding that he sees 
nothing new nothing different nothing holding anything up 
weve simply told them scientists working on the ssc to 
make whatever changes you want to it just cant cost over 59 
billion and it also has to achieve the standards set for it 
originally 
congress recently approved the first 225 million to build the 
collider over an eightyear period the site south of dallas was 
chosen in november 1988 after a lengthy selection process involving 
many states 
as planned the collider would be a 53mile underground oval 
where atomic particles would be hurled at each other by 
superconducting magnets scientists would force the particles to 
collide in an attempt to break them down further to test theories 
about the building blocks of the universe 
sen phil gramm rtexas met with moore on monday and said that 
the problem is with the size of the mechanism that would inject 
proton beams into the underground ring and that it was initially 
believed that the injector could be the same size as the one used 
at the fermilab outside chicago 
because the super collider would be 10 times as powerful as the 
fermilab accelerator however scientists believe the injector 
should be enlarged gramm said 
with a 53mile machine you have got to have more power to 
start the particle around the track gramm said 
gramm said doe would come up with various options and its 
preferred choice for dealing with the injector problem which he 
called a conceptual flaw in early january

the house on monday sent president bush 
restrictions on companies that provide pornographic telephone 
services restoring sanctions that the supreme court struck down in 
june 
the limitations on the 2 billionayear dialaporn industry 
were included in a 1567 billion measure for this years health 
and welfare programs that lawmakers dispatched to the white house 
on a voice vote 
the bill lacked a provision included in the original version of 
the legislation making the first major expansion of federal 
abortion rules in nine years it would have permitted the use of 
government revenues for abortions for poor women who are victims of 
rape or incest 
that language prompted a veto by bush on oct 21 which the 
house failed to override four days later abortion rights 
supporters realizing they lacked backing from twothirds of 
congress to override another veto gave up their fight last week 
a 1988 law prohibited obscene or indecent telephone 
communications for commercial reasons five months ago the high 
court ruled that obscene messages could be banned but not indecent 
ones 
the legislation approved monday prohibits obscene telephone 
communications for commercial purposes it also requires telephone 
companies to block access to dialaporn services unless a customer 
has asked for it 
the overall spending bill also contains 47 billion for 
employment and training programs more than 15 billion for aids 
research and treatment and 54 billion to help elementary and 
secondary school students from lowincome families 
the spending bill had bounced back and forth between the house 
and senate over the last week as the two chambers disputed various 
provisions of the bill 
the last disagreement was settled monday when house members 
agreed to a senate provision blocking a 15 million reduction the 
government wanted to make in reimbursements to rural hospitals

children have the inalienable right to 
grow up in a healthy environment free from abuse or exploitation 
the general assembly declared monday in unanimously adopting a 
convention on the rights of the child 
consideration of the convention which combines scores of 
international laws began 10 years ago over the past decade un 
delegates debated such divisive issues as abortion the age for 
military recruits and adoption 
for children this is the magna carta said james grant 
executive director of the un childrens fund 
with more than 100 children watching from the galleries 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said it was the most 
important step toward realizing our common purpose of promoting and 
encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedom for 
all 
the un childrens fund and many governments and private 
agencies said the convention sets new standards that they can use 
to fight child abuse including neglect and sexual exploitation 
it sets universally accepted standards to protect almost half 
of the worlds population said jan martenson the 
undersecretarygeneral for human rights 
the agreement is vague on some contentious issues 
a clause on abortion stated only in the nonbinding preamble 
says children deserve special protection before as well as after 
birth 
the convention sets the end of childhood at age 18 but does not 
say whether childhood begins at birth or at some earlier time the 
united states supported the phrase dealing with the rights of the 
unborn 
there were strong arguments among the 159 un members over the 
provision that sets the minimum age for military recruitment at 15 
america accepted that section but most western nations wanted the 
legal draft age set at 17 or 18 
it is estimated more than 95000 childsoldiers lost their lives 
in the iraniraq war and 200000 youngsters aged 15 to 17 are 
serving in armed forces today 
norway sweden france west germany italy spain australia 
canada mexico and other nations wanted the draft age raised to at 
least 17 and the soviet union was willing to agree with that 
standard 
the united states however supported the draft age of 15 on 
grounds that the 1949 geneva conventions on warfare specify that 
age and the new convention should conform to those agreements 
jordan and algeria said they would not be bound by the clause 
dealing with regulating adoptions because islamic law already 
guarantees the protection of children iran said it would not 
comply with any provisions inconsistent with islamic law 
adoption of the new convention came on the 30th anniversary of 
the declaration of the rights of the child a statement of 
principle that had no legally binding effect the convention 
combines more than 80 treaties and declarations drafted over the 
last 60 years 
when at least 20 nations ratify the convention it will become 
binding on the ratifying nations 
last year the soviet union dropped its opposition to a provision 
recognizing the right of children to free associaion making 
support for the convention unanimous among the 42 nations drafting 
it 
the convention guarantees a child the right to enjoy a family 
life and extends international legal protection to adoption 
procedures 
it states that children cannot be separated from their parents 
except for the childs wellbeing and declares children cannot be 
sold into prostitution or slavery or exploited as bonded laborers 
to pay off debts of the parents 
but it allows the ratifying nations to set the minimum age for 
child labor and regulate working conditions 
nations signing the convention will have to report periodically 
to a new un committee on the rights of the child

senate minority leader bob dole the chief 
sponsor of a resolution commemorating the killing of hundreds of 
thousands of armenians early in this century said monday he was 
putting off the issue until next year 
but dole said he would press early in 1990 for a vote on the 
resolution and argued that it should not be as contentious a matter 
as it has become the resolution has become a flash point in us 
relations with turkey an important nato ally and home to us 
military bases 
the resolution shouldnt and neednt have any impact on 
usturkish relations dole said in a statement the 
resolution commemorates events long since past perpetrated by 
people long since dead in an imperial state long since swept away 
by history 
publicly president bush has remained quiet on the issue which 
puts him in a politically uncomfortable position as president he 
must maintain relations with turkey but as a candidate for 
president he recognized the claim of armenianamericans that their 
people had been the victims of a systematic extermination by the 
ottoman empire some 15 million armenians were killed 
dole at one point had more than 60 cosponsors for his 
resolution but a number of senators dropped their sponsorship

more than 200000 people chanting 
freedom freedom marched monday night for free elections and 
removal of the nations communist leaders 
adn the official news agency said 100000 demonstrated in 
dresden 50000 each in karlmarxstadt and halle and 10000 in 
schwerin 
activists backing new forum and other opposition groups pressing 
for more democratic change criticized what one speaker called the 
chaos wrought by 40 years of communism 
young and old braved freezing temperatures to attend the latest 
of the now regular weekly rallies after prayer services in leipzig 
the hotbed of protest in east germanys recent turmoil 
from a balcony at leipzigs opera house speakers denounced past 
rigid practices and demanded justice from the leaders who 
mishandled the economy 
hansjoachim schulz who said he had no party affiliation drew 
cheers when he accused the ruling communist party of lying and 
deceiving us and leading the country into catastrophe 
it has lost the confidence of the people schulz said of the 
party 
he voiced skepticism about the communists new reformist image 
saying a snake sheds its skin but it doesnt change 
another speaker criticized official corruption and the partys 
steadfast refusal to bend to the reform wave until mass protests 
and an exodus of east germans to the west swelled to proportions 
that could no longer be ignored 
a speaker for new forum called for a wholesale reform of 
socialism and rejected calls for reunification with capitalist west 
germany 
the fences and walls must fall but we do not want to become 
the poorhouse of greater germany said the speaker who did not 
give his name 
the demonstrators observed a moment of silence in honor of the 
czechoslovak demonstrators brutally dispersed from prodemocracy 
protests in prague in recent days about 100000 again marched on 
the czechoslovak capital on monday 
east germanys adn news agency reported the leipzig 
demonstration and noted the calls for the communists to step down 
the agency also noted placards and banners calling on east 
germans to renounce blackmarket currency trades that further

the launch team was making up lost 
hours monday as a hushhush countdown proceeded toward a 
thanksgiving eve liftoff of space shuttle discovery with five 
astronauts and a secret spy satellite 
workers were several hours behind schedule when the countdown 
started sunday but nasa reported monday they were catching up 
doing the lagging work in parallel with other launch preparations 
following a threehour launch readiness meeting monday shuttle 
managers reported that while the schedule was tight no major 
issues are being worked and the launch remained on schedule 
were right on track for a wednesday night launch everything 
is going fine space agency spokeswoman lisa malone reported 
she said shuttle officials expect all tasks to be on schedule by 
late tuesday 
workers had fallen behind in checking out systems and 
reinstalling equipment and panels on the bottom sections of the two 
solid fuel booster rockets the panels were removed earlier in the 
week so technicians could inspect computer boxes suspected of 
having faulty wiring one of the boxes was replaced 
because the mission is classified nasa remained silent on the 
exact status of the countdown it has said only that liftoff is 
scheduled between 730 pm and 1030 pm and that it will make 
the count public just nine minutes before the planned liftoff 
there also will be a news blackout throughout the mission 
it will be only the third afterdark launch in 32 shuttle 
missions the last one in november 1985 was visible for several 
hundred miles along the east coast from key west at the tip of the 
florida keys to north georgia 
this is the fifth shuttle flight dedicated solely to the defense 
department officials said the secrecy makes it more difficult for 
soviet reconnaissance satellites and a spy ship sitting off cape 
canaveral to track the shuttle 
the astronauts assigned to the mission flew to cape canaveral on 
sunday from their training base in houston they slept during 
daylight hours monday to adjust their schedule to the hours they 
will keep in space because of the nighttime launch 
the commander is air force col frederick c gregory the first 
black named to command a shuttle mission the pilot is air force 
col john blaha and the mission specialists are navy capt manley 
l carter jr f story musgrave and kathryn c thornton 
they are expected to stay in space for four days their main 
task will be to deploy a satellite which sources close to the 
project report will listen in on diplomatic and military 
communications in the soviet union and other countries

a soldier in an elite infantry unit killed 
himself after comrades beat him and put him through a mock trial in 
his underwear israeli media reported monday 
an army psychologist blamed the death on failure to find a 
political solution to the 23monthold palestinian uprising in the 
occupied territories which he said was increasing stress among 
israeli soldiers 
in another suicide report army sources said a female member of 
a unit of settler soldiers tried to take her own life by shooting 
herself in the stomach with a pistol in a tel aviv store 
hospital officials said the 19yearold woman whose name was 
not released was in fair condition no further details were given 
the suicide of 20yearold eli shahar on saturday was the second 
in the givati brigade recently a givati soldier assigned to the 
occupied gaza strip shot himself to death two weeks ago 
suicides appear to be increasing in the army generally 
on monday the military command said monday 15 to 39 soldiers 
have committed suicide in each of the last seven years and 24 
soldiers took their own lives from april through november 1989 it 
did not give figures on suicide attempts 
a report in the daily yediot ahronot said the army was 
investigating a total of 45 reported suicides in 1989 and israel 
television put the number at more than 50 
defense minister yitzhak rabin responding monday to a question 
in parliament denied suicide was on the rise in the military he 
said the army tries to prevent it by choosing draftees carefully 
and training commanders to recognize signs of distress israel 
radio reported 
dan baron a professor at bengurion university in beersheba 
who is a military psychologist in the reserves said the army was 
not equipped to deal with the stress of soldiers serving in the 
occupied west bank and gaza 
the army can deal with combat shock but i think it is not 
prepared to see how the present state of stress is different from 
the previous ones experienced by the israeli soldiers he said on 
israel television 
today we have a situation of no exit and political 
leaders who are supposed to offer an exit want to prolong this 
situation to put it mildly young people feel that nobody worries 
about providing alternatives to the intefadeh as the palestinian 
uprising is known 
col reuven gal formerly chief army psychologist said 
exposure to events in the territories of course increases 
pressure and maybe increases the tendency for violence and violent 
reactions but it does not necessarily lead to suicide 
an army spokesman confirmed the military was investigating the 
case of shahar who newspapers said was having trouble with his 
commanding officer 
the daily hamishmar said masked older recruits awakened shahar 
on saturday and carried him into a nearby tent where they beat him 
and threw soup in his face 
reports in yediot and maariv two other newspapers said a mock 
trial followed at which shahar was found guilty of disobedience and 
sentenced to four hours of guard duty and a month of kitchen work 
all three papers reported that shahar said nothing during the 
trial and trembled from fear or cold dressed only in his underwear 
and a helmet 
maariv said the unit commander watched the trial and did nothing 
to stop it 
afterward shahar returned to his tent stuck the barrel of his 
assault rifle in his mouth and pulled the trigger according to 
newspaper and radio reports 
shahars brother avi a junior officer in another army unit 
demanded the soldiers involved be punished 
it was murder maariv quoted him as saying he pulled the 
trigger but they brought him to that situation 
masked soldiers were waiting they made eli turn his back to 
them put a helmet on his head accused him of some offenses and 
sentenced him to four hours of guard duty avi shahar said on the 
television the platoon commander was there he was watching 
israel radio reported that in july a givati soldier committed 
suicide and another shot himself in the foot to escape brutality 
from comrades 
in may a military court convicted four givati soldiers of abuse 
and sentenced them to nine months in jail for beating a gaza 
palestinian with a broomstick and rifle butts the arab later died 
of beatings administered by other soldiers 
givati troopers often suppress palestinian riots in the gaza 
strip they have become known for rough and sometimes brutal action

the man accused of driving drunk on the 
wrong side of a highway and causing the deaths of 27 people in a 
church bus went on trial monday under the watchful eyes of many of 
the victims families 
a man whose wife and two daughters died when larry mahoneys 
pickup rammed the bus causing an explosion said the 36yearold 
factory worker deserved nothing less than life in prison 
forever 
to me the trial is a waste of time said army 1st sgt 
lee williams the man is guilty in my opinion and life in 
prison is the minimum that he should get 
jury selection was completed monday for mahoneys murder trial 
jurors were then taken to see the wreckage of the bus and mahoneys 
pickup locked in a warehouse as evidence in the case then to the 
crash site on interstate 71 about five miles south of carrollton 
police said mahoney was driving north in the southbound lanes 
when his pickup collided with the bus on may 14 1988 sixtyseven 
members of the radcliff first assembly of god churchs youth group 
were returning from an outing at the kings island amusement park 
north of cincinnati 
radcliff is the post office town for fort knox where williams 
was chief enlisted man of a medical company at ireland army 
hospital 
plain and simple this is a murder case special prosecutor 
paul richwalsky said in his opening statement its about who was 
involved and who was responsible its about the terrible cost of 
drunken driving 
richwalsky an assistant state attorney general read aloud each 
count of the 82count indictment naming one of the crash victims 
in each count 
many people in the audience including victims survivors wiped 
tears from their eyes or clenched their fists as richwalsky read 
the indictment 
richwalsky also laid out the prosecutions theory of events 
leading up to the crash what he described as mahoneys a day of 
drinking before he ended up on the interstate simple case 
tragic results he said 
russell baldani mahoneys lead defense laywer took only 13 
minutes to make his statement he spoke of mahoneys socalled 
friends who plied him with beer before the crash 
baldani said mahoney was extremely fatigued on the day of the 
crash and therefore more sensitive to a small amount of alcohol 
the truth will lead you to a very simple conclusion larry 
mahoney is not a murderer he said 
sixtynine people representing 29 victims families jammed the 
carroll county courthouse for the opening of mahoneys trial on 82 
criminal charges including 27 counts of murder 
seeing mr mahoney in person i think its going to be a 
stressful event for all of us said william nichols whose only 
child 17yearold william jr died aboard the bus 
mr mahoney has his whole family at the courthouse nichols 
said my wife and i are representing my son 
mahoney waived his right to be present on the jurys trip 
at the warehouse jurors milled around both wrecked vehicles 
some stopping to peer inside several seemed interested in the 
space that held the bus fuel tank which exploded upon impact 
federal investigators concluded that the tank was punctured by one 
of the bus leaf springs causing the explosion 
all the victims 24 children and teenagers and three adults 
died of smoke inhalation not crash injuries forty others escaped 
through windows or the bus rear door but many were severely 
injured 
mahoneys lawyers plan to base his defense on the bus which 
they allege was inherently unsafe the prosecution contends the bus 
safety issue is incidental and that the collision was due solely to 
mahoneys drunken driving 
this wasnt an accident said mickie muller whose daughter 
katrina survived with disfiguring burns this was a man who chose 
to drink who chose to get into a car 
bus safety has nothing to do with this issue williams said 
murder is the issue drunk driving we need to concentrate on 
that

leonardo sciascia a sicilian novelist 
who wrote of the mafia official corruption and italys political 
class died monday at age 68 his family reported 
asked once whether he feared a mafia reprisal sciascia replied 
the mafia doesnt read literature 
a family announcement said he died at his home in palermo 
capital of sicily but did not give the cause of death sciascia 
had suffered for some time from kidney problems 
he was part of the sicilian literary tradition of luigi 
pirandello and giuseppe di lampedusa who explored the character of 
people whose lives were molded by the islands history 
among sciascias bestknown works were the day of the owl 
the sicilian relatives and the winedark sea a collection 
of short stories about sicilians coping with authority figures 
he used candido voltaires candide moved to sicily 
to attack the mafia and politicians 
i have this image of sciascia of a man who had his own 
convictions which he did not intend to abandon said giulio 
einaudi sciascias publisher from 1958 to 1983 his great 
strength was the way he could make news events poetical 
one of sciascias most controversial works the moro affair 
explored the 1978 kidnapping and murder of former premier aldo moro 
by the leftist red brigades 
in the book sciascia saw the christian democratic politician as 
left to his fate by a government of his own party that refused to 
deal with his captors ignoring pleas for help written from moros 
peoples prison 
i was very interested in the friends of aldo moro who from 
this moment on so they said decided he was no longer 
himself the novelist told a newspaper interviewer 
sciascia lived in palermo but considered home to be a farmhouse 
in central sicily near his birthplace of racalmuto where he did 
not have a telephone or keep a car 
the author had a brief fling with party politics in the 1970s 
winning a seat on the palermo city council as an independent on the 
communist party ticket 
his goal was to help in an antimafia cleanup of city politics 
he resigned because of communist party overtures to the christian 
democrats

the city council reversing a vote 
taken two weeks ago decided monday to open all beaches to all 
races in durban south africas foremost resort city 
in another desegregation move the provincial administrator of 
cape town issued an order opening all beaches under his authority 
beaches in cape town also a major holiday city were opened long 
ago but some municipalities in cape town province did not take 
similar action or decided to defy the declaration by president fw 
de klerk last week that all the countrys beaches should be 
desegregated 
municipalities control most beaches and only they have the 
power to legally desegregate them despite de klerks announcement 
the durban city council voted nov 6 on a proposal to open all 
of durbans beaches with 16 members approving the measure and 14 
opposing it the proposal failed because a twothirds majority was 
required 
later the council agreed to remove signs declaring sections of 
the beaches whites only but the segregation laws remained in 
effect 
on monday the vote was 245 to open all the beaches that were 
still reserved for whites in coming weeks thousands of 
vacationers will arrive in the indian ocean city for the holiday 
season 
de klerk also has called for repeal of the separate amenities 
act that allows the segregation of parks libraries swimming pools 
and other public facilities 
parliament is expected to consider repeal when it reconvenes in 
february 
south africa has a system of apartheid that by law and custom 
establishes a racially segregated society in which the 28 million 
blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 million whites 
control the economy and maintain separate districts schools and 
health services

us troops circled an american 
military hospital with armored personnel carriers and barbed wire 
monday in an exercise panama said violated the canal treaties 
more than 200 panamanians shouted antiamerican slogans outside 
gorgas hospital while military officials of the two countries 
argued about the maneuver 
panamanian women pulled out sections of the coiled wire so some 
vehicles could reach government installations in the area armored 
personnel carriers partially blocked the entrance to health 
ministry offices across the street from the hospital 
maj manuel rodriguez a member of a joint uspanamanian 
military board told us officials the maneuver violated the 1977 
treaties under which the canal is to be turned over to panama at 
the end of 1999 because it obstructed traffic and had not been 
cleared with panamanian officials 
sources at the us southern command american military 
headquarters said panama had been told of the exercise in advance 
rodriguez claimed the purpose of the maneuver was to hide the 
wounded who are coming from el salvador where hundreds of people 
have been killed or wounded in 10 days of some of the heaviest 
fighting in the countrys decadeold civil war 
the us army holds regular military exercises which it says 
are necessary to train soldiers defending the panama canal 
relations between panama and the united states have deteriorated 
in the past two years because of us efforts to have gen manuel 
antonio noriega removed as panamas military commander a position 
from which he controls the government 
noriega has been indicted in florida on federal charges of drug 
trafficking and money laundering he denies the accusations

an emissary from west germany met with east 
german leaders monday and said the communist party may lose its 
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power as early as next year 
rudolf seiters chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff also 
said he expects a law on free elections to be approved in 1990 
party chief egon krenz standing beside seiters looked 
impassive as the west german official predicted abolition of the 
leading role guarantee for the communists 
more than 400000 people demonstrated in several cities for 
rapid reform and free elections the official news agency adn 
reported 
it said 200000 people marched in leipzig a southern city where 
the largest prodemocracy demonstrations have been held 100000 in 
dresden 50000 each in halle and karlmarxstadt and 10000 in 
schwerin 
one speaker at the leipzig rally who was not identified said 
in an apparent comment about german reunification we must not 
suppress the will for unity we are one people 
krenz described his talks with seiters as solid but said no 
specific date was set for a summit with kohl in east germany next 
month 
kohls visit the first by a west german chancellor to east 
germany is expected before christmas but after the special 
communist party congress dec 1517 
in a televised interview sunday night krenz said the congress 
might remove him as party leader 
it is a decision of my party and ive always respected the 
decisions of my party he said naturally i want to fight for 
the changes weve managed so far but if the party is of another 
opinion then they should find another general secretary 
seiters was asked specifically whether kohl would meet with 
krenz and replied lets just say he will meet with east german 
leadership 
premier hans modrow who took part in the talks said he hoped 
for a partnership between west german business and east 
germanys staterun industry 
seiters said he sounded out east german leaders on some changes 
sought by opposition groups including free elections and 
constitutional reform 
i have the impression that the constitutional change and the 
new voting law will be approved next spring he told the joint 
news conference with krenz and modrow i have the impression that 
article 1 of the constitution will be changed 
article 1 contains the leading role for the party 
removing the guarantee and opening the way for free elections 
are conditions of a financial aid program west germany has offered 
adn said many placards and banners carried in leipzig where the 
largest prodemocracy protests have been held criticized east 
germans who take advantage of their new freedom to sell valuables 
and currency on the black market 
it quoted one as saying no east german money in the west we 
are hurting ourselves 
government sources in bonn said west germany was considering a 
more favorable rate of exchange for east german visitors 
under the plan being studied east germans would be able to 
exchange up to 300 marks at a rate of 4 nonconvertible east german 
mark for 1 west german the black market rate is more than 201 
late monday adn said krenz had postponed a visit to 
czechoslovakia planned for tuesday but it did not give a reason 
large prodemocracy demonstrations have been held in prague 
seiters who spoke of the dramatic weeks germans had 
experienced carried with him details of bonns offer of economic 
aid made last week and also conditioned on east german efforts to 
create a freemarket economy 
modrow and others have have rejected what they see as an attempt 
to lure east germany away from communist principles 
in a speech to parliament on saturday modrow outlined a course 
that mixes some capitalist elements with communist planning and 
embraces many themes of the reform program pursued in the soviet 
union by president mikhail s gorbachev 
state tv said the main question was whether bonn was prepared 
for relations on a measurably higher level without unacceptable 
conditions 
a public opinion survey reported monday by a west german 
magazine indicated the communist party would run third with only 
14 percent of the vote if elections were held now 
new forum the largest opposition group led with 22 percent and 
the liberal democrats a noncommunist party was second in the 
poll commissioned by stern magazine 
krenz has promised free elections but has not set a date 
otto lambsdorff head of the centrist free democratic party in 
west germany proposed monday that tighter controls on currency and 
customs controls be established at the border to avoide smuggling 
and a buyout of east german goods and valuables 
economists in both countries fear tourists will sell subsidized 
goods in the west to earn hard currency and that some westerners 
may shop for food and clothing in cheaper east german stores 
in the first disclosure of the extent of labor losses adn said 
nearly 100000 of east germanys 165 million people had resettled 
in west germany since nov 1 and 275000 so far this year 
the figure for all of 1988 was under 40000

traffic flowed smoothly on monday the 
first workday since the quakebattered bay bridge reopened but 
officials said thanksgiving week could be the cause and suggested 
the real crunch could come next week 
the doctor who cared for buck helm the longshoreman who 
survived 3 days in his car in a collapsed section of interstate 
880 said his death saturday was partly due to a heart condition 
they had been unaware of 
however dr tom mcdonald chief of surgery at kaiser permanente 
medical center told a news conference in oakland that helm 
suffered overwhelming injuries in the freeway collapse that 
claimed 41 other lives 
in all the oct 17 quake killed 67 people injured more than 
2800 left more than 14000 homeless and inflicted an estimated 7 
billion damage 
the quake sent a 50foot section of the san franciscooakland 
bay bridges upper deck crashing onto the lower deck cutting the 
main link between san francisco and oakland the 85milelong span 
formally reopened friday 
traffic monday on the bridge was running 50 percent less than 
oct 17 said lt jim simmons of the state department of 
transportation who is toll supervisor at the bridge before the 
quake an average of 260000 cars used the bridge each day 
obviously people are still taking mass transit and coming in 
earlier said greg bayol a spokesman for the state department of 
transportation the test will come later this being a holiday 
week 
traffic also was down on the golden gate bridge which handles 
traffic southbound into the city it is used along with the 
richmondsan rafael bridge by commuters from bedroom communities to 
the east 
from 6 am to 8 am 14086 cars used the span down from 
17634 for the same period a week ago said capt jackson fong of 
the golden gate bridge district the golden gate handles about 
146000 cars daily 
the bay area rapid transit system which set records almost 
every day while the bay bridge was closed carried about 20 percent 
fewer passengers during the morning commute than a week ago by 
830 am the system had transported 65239 passengers compared 
to 78003 the previous monday said bart spokesman sy mouber 
however mouber pointed out that bart carried just 47415 
passengers on oct 5 making mondays load 118 percent of that 
before the quake 
asked if these figures meant people have permanently changed the 
way they commute mouber said i dont think we are seeing the 
results yet i think people are taking an early thanksgiving 
holiday 
next week may look a little different said mike mills a 
spokesman for the alameda contra costa counties transit system 
which runs public buses 
the number of passengers taking ac transit buses across the 
bridge on routes beginning in oakland and alameda appeared to be 
down mills said 
the number of people riding a ferry from oakland and san 
francisco was also down according to the red amp white fleet 
between 6 am and 9 am there were 1165 passengers a drop of 
472 from last monday 
according to the alameda county coroners office helm died of 
blunt trauma to his head and body respiratory failure due to 
extensive chest injuries kidney failure and abdominal infection 
before the quake helm 58 had high blood pressure and diabetes 
doctors learned after helms death that he had an enlarged 
ventricle the chamber of the heart that pumps blood into the 
arteries mcdonald told reporters mcdonald said it had not been 
possible for doctors to know about the heart problem 
the surgeon said he had been looking forward to taking helm off 
the respirator that kept the longshoreman breathing and was as 
shocked by anyone by his death we had all been so encouraged 
mcdonald said

husak they were blocked by police barriers and later dispersed 
peacefully after a threehour march 
its the end milos the demonstrators shouted referring to 
communist party chief milos jakes to fellow czechoslovaks they 
chanted stop being afraid 
jakes responded by warning the demonstrators not to go too far 
any attempts to disrupt social and political stability can 
only seriously threaten the implementation of necessary change and 
bring the society into a crisis with unforeseeable consequences 
the 67yearold leader said on television 
in a sharp break with usual practice the television devoted 
extensive coverage to the demonstrations and the official news 
agency ctk and czechoslovak radio reported the protesters demands 
for free elections 
some protesters carried banners reading red murderers to 
court a reference to the alleged death of mathematics student 
martin smid dissidents say smid was killed friday by police but 
the government called reports of the death an unfounded rumor 
the demonstrators also supported a general strike called by 
students and artists for nov 27 
in washington the state department canceled a planned visit by 
jan fojtik chief ideologist of the czechoslovak communist party 
because of the use of force against protesters 
department spokeswoman said earlier the police actions were in 
sharp contrast to other east european countries who are beginning 
to respond to the wishes of their people 
mondays demonstrations in czechoslovakia were the latest signs 
of political unrest sweeping eastern europe 
more than 200000 demonstrators took to the streets in the east 
german city of leipzig to press for free elections and an end to 
the communist monopoly on power communist party chief egon krenz 
met with an envoy from bonn in talks expected to focus on financial 
aid 
in romania however president nicolae ceausescu told a party 
congress that he rejects reforms and proclaimed the perpetuation of 
rigid communist rule 
czechoslovakias government also has rejected reforms but 
mondays protest in prague was the fourth in as many days and 
indicated severe trouble for the leadership 
police did not stop the march but they set up barriers across 
bridges on the vltava river leading to hradcany castle many 
demonstrators changed course at that point and continued to a major 
plaza old town square chanting we are the people 
the small police presence contrasted sharply with the situation 
friday when security forces severely beat demonstrators the 
violence prompted outrage at home and abroad the state department 
called on the czechoslovak government to end this senseless 
violence against its own citizens 
by attacking peaceful demonstrators czechoslovakian 
authorities further damaged their credibility at home and abroad 
said spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
also monday students began a sitin strike at prague 
universities to protest the police attacks and television reported 
some high schools had gone on strike 
vaclav havel a prominent playwright and activist whose works 
are banned in his homeland canceled a trip to sweden where he was 
due to accept the olof palme award to protest the violence in 
sweden it was announced that foreign minister sten andersson will 
go to prague to present the award to havel 
krenz postponed a tuesday visit to prague without giving a 
reason britain summoned the czechoslovak ambassador to protest the 
police beatings of two british journalists it called the weekend 
violence disgraceful and gratuitous 
according to unofficial reports student strike committees were 
negotiating with university authorities at the technical university 
in prague and the downtown film faculty 
at least three official prague theaters went on a de facto 
strike refusing to put on shows and terminating cooperation with 
official media actors said by telephone speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
a statement of the official socialist union of youth called 
fridays crackdown on student demonstrators politically 
irresponsible 
the communique was endorsed by vasil mohorita the unions 
chairman and communist party central committee secretary it was 
the first time a communist official publicly condemned such police 
action 
the march friday commemorated student jan opletal killed by the 
nazis 50 years ago it was the largest demonstration in 
czechoslvakia since august 1969 when about 50000 people gathered 
in prague a year after a sovietled invasion crushed reform

against including salvadoraid restrictions in a foreign aid bill 
two gubernatorial candidates bush campaigned for earlier this 
fall marshall coleman in virginia and rep james courter in new 
jersey lost nov 7 both shared bushs antiabortion position

defeats

last week to air their differences on the abortion issue was 
referred to by bush as a close and dear friend 
both women are seeking to oust incumbent democratic senators 
next year

two masked gunmen entered a hotel monday 
and opened fire on a group of basque politicians killing one 
elected legislator and wounding another police reported 
they identified the victims as jon muguruza 31 and inaki 
esnaola 41 both elected to parliaments lower house in the oct 
29 balloting officials at gregorio maranon hospital said muguruza 
was dead on arrival and esnaola was in grave condition with two 
bullet wounds in the head 
both were supporters of the militant basque separatist 
organization eta 
it was believed to be the first assassination of a spanish 
parliamentarian since before the outbreak of the spanish civil war 
in 1936 
muguruza and esnaola were among four deputies and three senators 
of the basque party herri batasuna popular union who were to 
swear allegiance to spain tuesday before being installed in 
parliament 
police said no group asserted responsibility for the attack that 
occurred in the restaurant of the hotel alcala at 11 pm 
they said muguruza and esnaola were with the five other elected 
basque parliamentarians and three journalists seated around a table 
when the gunmen attacked the journalists are employees of the 
basque newspaper egin 
all members of the 350seat lower house of parliament cortes 
are to swear allegiance tuesday to the constitution the first 
step in the process of establishing a new parliament that king juan 
carlos is to open december 6 
it is the first time since democracy was restored in 1977 that 
basque separatists elected to parliament planned to swear 
allegiance and take their seats other basques politicians have 
been elected to parliament but refused to take the oath and were 
not seated 
esnaola said in a recent interview that he and his colleagues 
would swear allegiance under duress because i am forced to by 
law he said the basque deputies and senators would serve in 
parliament so they could speak out for selfdetermination for the 
basque region in northern spain and serve as mediators in 
negotiations between the government and outlawed eta 
eta is an acronym in the basque language for basque land and 
liberty 
prime minister felipe gonzalezs socialist party won the october 
elections 
his government began exploratory peace talks with exiled eta 
leaders in algiers earlier this year but canceled them april when 
eta terrorists renewed their attacks 
the basque legislators were shot on the 14th anniversary of the 
death of gen francisco franco who eliminated the historic 
political rights of the spanish basques after his forces won the 
civil war in 1939 
the basque popular union is regarded as the political wing of 
the eta 
over the past 21 years eta has claimed responsibility for the 
killings of more than 600 people with most of the victims police 
or military officers 
basque populars unity has won 1015 percent of the vote in the 
three basque provinces with a population of 21 million since 
1979 
muguruzu was an elected deputy from vizcaya province and esnaola 
from guipuzcoa province

the survivors of two slain union activists went 
into federal court monday to try to prove that the 1981 murders 
were ordered by the government of thenphilippines president 
ferdinand marcos 
marcos maintained an intelligence network of agents in the 
united states who attacked and intimidated opponents of his regime 
lawyer jeff robinson told a federal court in opening arguments of 
the civil lawsuit 
gene viernes and silme domingo union activists and agitators 
against the marcos regime were shot to death on june 1 1981 
outside the offices of the alaska cannery workers union in seattle 
three men were convicted of murder in the killings which 
prosecutors said resulted from an internal union dispute over 
gambling and work assignments in alaskan fish canneries 
but friends and relatives of the dead men will try to prove that 
domingo and viernes were really killed on orders from manila 
because of their antimarcos activities 
a jury of eight and two alternates was seated monday for the 
trial expected to last three to four weeks the lawsuit names 
marcos and his wife imelda as defendants 
other defendants include the convicted killers the philippines 
government which has chosen not to defend itself against the suit 
and others allegedly linked directly to the killings 
the plaintiffs say their evidence will show not only that 
domingo and viernes were marked for death by marcos government 
but that us government agencies allowed philippine intelligence 
agents to operate in this country to keep track of antimarcos 
activity 
jailing and killing dissidents or causing them to disappear were 
weapons in marcos antiopponent arsenal before his government was 
toppled in 1986 robinson said 
all of these techniques were used by the marcos regime as 
business as usual to consolidate power and silence dissent he 
said 
evidence will show that marcos established a network in this 
country primarily in seattle san francisco and honolulu to 
keep track of antimarcos activities 
intimidation techniques ranged from using imposing bodybuilders 
to harass demonstrators at antimarcos protests to pressuring 
advertisers to drop ads in filipino newspapers that werent 
sufficiently promarcos robinson said 
robinson said evidence will show that the punishment was 
sometimes death he compared domingo and viernes with benigno 
aquino the antimarcos political leader who was killed upon his 
return to manila in 1982 and with primitivo mijares who wrote the 
book the conjugal dictatorship about marcos and who vanished in 
san francisco after he was seen with a marcos supporter 
the common thread that will tie these people together is that 
they were watched by the intelligence operation and they were 
acted against by the intelligence operation robinson said 
defense opening arguments were scheduled for tuesday 
i think that people are going to learn that the marcos 
government was responsible for these murders and that for years the 
marcos government was harassing and violating us citizens civil 
rights in this country said domingos sister cindy an 
organizer of the committee for justice for domingo and viernes 
one defense attorney in the case however called the 
plaintiffs case underwhelming 
it will become frightfully apparent how little evidence there 
is said kate alfieri a san francisco attorney representing dr 
leonilo malabed a marcos friend who allegedly maintained a slush 
fund used to pay for the murders 
the lawsuit was filed in september 1982 seeking 30 million on 
behalf of the domingo and viernes families some original 
defendants including us intelligence agencies have been 
dropped others have been added and marcos and his wife imelda 
were dismissed at one point and then reinstated 
although marcos died sept 28 the lawsuit continues against his 
estate the marcoses gave videotaped depositions in hawaii after 
they fled their homeland when their government collapsed in 1986 
mrs marcos has not been subpoenaed to testify 
other defendants are the philippines government which chose not 
to defend itself against the lawsuit and members of the tulisan 
gang convicted of killing domingo and viernes 
among the witnesses scheduled to appear is bonifacio gillego a 
onetime military intelligence officer under marcos and now a 
congressman in the philippines said sharon maeda spokeswoman for 
the committee for justice for domingo and viernes it was gillego 
she said who drew the plaintiffs attention to a key document in 
the case an account sheet for the supposed slush fund maintained 
by malabed 
the lawsuit theorizes that 15000 to pay for the murders came 
from that account of the mabuhay corp a nowdefunct company that 
had been set up to purchase a radio station 
the document among papers seized from marcos when he arrived in 
hawaii after his ouster has a heading for special intelligence 
projects and includes a listing for 15000 with the date may 17 
1981 two weeks before the murders 
the plaintiffs allege that constantine baruso who was president 
of the cannery workers union and whose gun was used in the 
killings was in san francisco that day and picked up the money 
baruso was never charged 
ms alfieri said theres no evidence that supports that 
theory 
this is all cloak and dagger activity thats been alleged 
but theres no evidence whatsoever that there was a slush fund 
she said 
ms alfieri said she was confident she will be able to ask for a 
directed verdict from the judge at the end of the plaintiffs case 
and wont even have to present defense evidence for her client 
ms domingo replied i think the problem is that the defense 
has no defense except to say that these murders were just over 
union reform and gambling

security forces arrested 16 
social workers in a dawn raid monday on the episcopal church 
combat in a guerrilla offensive was reported continuing in only a 
few isolated areas 
security forces raided at least seven churches or church schools 
sunday and monday in a backlash to the offensive that paralyzed the 
capital for a week 
us ambassador william walker blamed the raids on overly 
aggressive security forces and suggested president alfredo 
cristiani was having management control problems with extremist 
elements of his government 
i really think president cristiani is under a barrage from all 
sides i think some things are happening that he would prefer not 
to happen said walker 
church workers and war refugees they sheltered were questioned 
and the buildings were searched for arms ammunition and medicine 
said church officials workers and witnesses 
salvadoran churches especially those that work with the poor 
are considered hotbeds of leftist subversion by the right and 
authorities suspect them of aiding or harboring guerrillas 
in washington president bush said he opposed cutting off aid in 
response to the slayings thursday of six jesuit priests which 
archbishop arturo rivera damas of san salvador said appeared to be 
the work of the military 
the house of representatives rejected an attempt to restrict the 
aid voting 215194 to keep the restriction from being added to a 
foreign aid bill 
combat between guerrillas and the army was largely confined to 
the working class neighborhood of soyapango there was heavy 
fighting in apopa a town 12 miles to the north and about halfway 
along the retreat route for rebels returning to their strongholds 
on guazapa mountain 
although thousands were homeless the capital appeared to be 
returning to normal stores shops and other businesses were open 
and service stations were selling gasoline for the first time since 
last week 
the farabundo marti national liberation front high command said 
monday the offensive had dealt the government serious blows 
the fascist beast is defeated politically and militarily it 
is mortally wounded the guerrillas said on their clandestine 
radio venceremos 
national guard troops raided the episcopal church just after the 
dusktodawn curfew ended a guard officer said privately 
the church in one of san salvadors most affluent 
neighborhoods has sheltered about 200 refugees 
nine salvadorans and seven foreigners were arrested and taken to 
treasury police headquarters said a church worker who would not 
let his name be used 
the treasury police refused to confirm they had anyone from the 
church in custody treasury police used to investigate fiscal 
crimes but since the civil war began they have been in charge of 
political cases 
all those detained worked in the churchs social services 
program the church worker said 
he said the director of the program his wife and a lay worker 
were arrested sunday in their homes 
the foreigners included josephine beecher of lopez island 
wash a canadian woman a colombian a guatemalan and three people 
from spain the canadian karen ridd 28 of winnipeg was released 
late monday with a colombian collegue a canadian embassy official 
in costa rica said 
the church worker said they probably would be deported other 
foreign workers including a dozen lutheran missionaries have been 
arrested and expelled from the country in recent days 
the rev luis serrano the episcopal pastor went into hiding 
the church worker said 
the office of the archbishop of san salvador said there also 
were raids on the emmanuel baptist church and five roman catholic 
churches or schools 
the lutheran church was shuttered its bishop medardo gomez is 
an outspoken member of the national coalition seeking peace talks 
between the usbacked government and the rebels 
like many clerics including rivera damas and the slain jesuits 
gomez says nothing has been done to address the poverty ignorance 
and misery that led to the decadeold conflict in this 
massachusettssized nation of 52 million 
such opinions are deemed subversive by some on the right 
attorney general mauricio colorado blamed rivera damas and the 
auxiliary bishop for fomenting leftist violence through their 
questionable ideology 
when asked if the raids colorados statements and other 
incidents indicated that cristiani was having trouble maintaining 
control over the more extreme elements of his government 
ambassador walker said 
management control problems exist in situations like this and 
its not a management control problem that would lnd itself to a 
harvard business school analysis i mean this is war its 
fighting its death its events such as the killings of the 
jesuits that explode upon a president and hes got to pay 
attention 
cristiani campaigned as the representative of a new moderate 
wing in a party long linked to el salvadors infamous death squads 
rivera damas office said security forces had raided three other 
roman catholic churches and two schools on sunday war refuees were 
being sheltered at each of the sites 
at san franciso church five salvadoran lay workers were taken 
away by soldiers the parish priest said refusing to give his name 
he said the soldiers accused the church of running a clandestine 
clinic for wounded guerrillas the clinic is in an area held by the 
rebels 
we dont make distinctions he said we were taking care 
of everyone our work is humanitarian christian we didnt ask who 
people were but none of them had weapons 
monday evening the national police searched the hotel room of 
joseph gannon an american reporter who works for canadas maclean 
magazine police left gannons room after 20 minutes saying they 
found nothing incriminating

the first nationwide election with a legal 
opposition has produced taiwans spiciest campaign ever featuring 
a crop of candidates who are ignoring longtime political taboos in 
their search for votes 
one candidate dancer hsu hsiaodan has ignored other taboos as 
well distributing posters of herself in a topless pose as she 
campaigns on the labor party ticket for worker welfare love and 
political freedom 
legislative mayoral and other local elections will be contested 
this coming saturday by 724 candidates in the first balloting since 
the 1987 scrapping of martial law which outlawed opposition 
political groups 
fifteen political parties are fielding candidates against the 
nationalist party which has governed this island of 20 million 
people since losing a civil war to communist forces on the chinese 
mainland 40 years ago 
the new political climate has brought forth several firsttime 
candidates who are attracting attention with daring political ideas 
or provocative campaign tactics 
among those receiving the most serious notice is yeh chulan 
whose husband burned himself to death in april to avoid police 
interrogation over his advocacy of an independent taiwan 
in the local political lexicon independence means rejection of 
the nationalist claim to be the legitimate government of mainland 
china as well as taiwan 
miss yeh 40 is among 32 of the 163 candidates from the 
opposition democratic progressive party openly campaigning for an 
independent taiwan despite nationalist threats that they could face 
arrest on sedition charges 
her alliance is advocating a new country a new culture a 
slogan that no doubt is anathema to nationalist elders 
taiwan has in fact been independent for the past four 
decades said miss yeh we need to build a brandnew country 
from this reality rather than making slow reforms within an 
authoritarian system 
if reunification occurs she argues taiwan will surrender its 
economic prosperity under a communist system directed by beijing 
but many taiwanese are skeptical about her movement largely 
because beijing has refused to rule out the use of force to bring 
about reunification if taiwan declares independence 
local newspapers which long refused to publish anything but the 
official nationalist line have provided extensive coverage of the 
alliance and called for the protection of the candidates freedom 
of speech 
another candidate testing the new political climate is wang 
chinping of the newly formed workers party who is seeking a seat 
in the lawmaking legislative yuan as a socialist 
only a few years ago anyone advocating anything close to 
socialism would be considered a communist the ultimate evil in the 
eyes of the nationalists 
but wang has run an unfettered campaign as he calls for 
peaceful reforms to provide more social welfare benefits and to 
prevent big business from using government connections to evade tax 
wang 44 usually begins his campaign day at dawn by joining 
city workers sweeping taipeis streets and gathering garbage he 
remains on the streets throughout the day soliciting votes from 
factory workers taxi drivers and shop clerks 
this country needs someone to speak for the oppressed says 
wang he says his campaign staff includes students and workers who 
have been penalized or dismissed from jobs for organizing unions 
wang who owns a small book store was dismissed from the 
prestigeous tamkang university eight years ago for criticizing the 
nationalists authoritarian rule 
perhaps the most controversial candidate is the dancer hsu 
hsiaodan 30 she appears topless in a campaign poster that also 
shows her holding a bouquet of roses in one hand as she sets fire 
to pieces of paper bearing the names of famous political prisoners 
she says are victims of a nationalistcontrolled judicial system 
miss hsu wearing a floral band around her long hair 
distributes the poster sings and lights up cigarettes for 
constituents as she campaigns in kaohsiung 216 miles south of 
taipei 
she she keeps her clothes on during campaign appearances but has 
promised to bare her breasts in the legislative yuan the highest 
lawmaking body if elected 
i strip off my clothes when i confront dirty 
politicians she has said constituents can count on my 
breasts

smack out here in the desert is an oasis of 
another kind the rest house and modern youth saloon where a 
traveler can quench a thirst and get an earful of mohammed khourys 
tongueincheek philosphy 
welcome in jordan he intones from the command post behind 
his bar welcome in maan welcome in my guest house dutch beer 
german beer tea pepsi welcome 
the place is his own museum of kitsch and memorabilia clocks 
photographs electronic gadgets american cars stamps guns 
garden gnomes visiting cards foreign money 
more than 100 clocks most of them ticking surround the bar and 
lounge which are flooded by dozens of red lights including some 
inside mushroomshaped plastic stools 
on the hour a chorus of cuckoo clocks and electronic beeps 
drowns conversation 
khoury 66 opened the rest house in maan 120 miles south of 
amman the capital in 1972 
it was frequented mainly by longdistance truck drivers on their 
way from europe to saudi arabia as many as 40 trucks a day stopped 
by but a new road has been built and nowadays customers are few 
maan is a town of 25000 people mainly traders truckers and 
farmers of bedouin stock the little oasis on the old islamic 
pilgrimage route to mecca is surrounded by a flat monotonous 
desert 
khourys brand of philosophy and the accoutrements with which 
he surrounds himself echo psychedelic hangouts in places other 
than a sunbaked outpost like this 
he philosphizes life without a wife is like a kitchen without 
a knife another beer 
khoury must have one of the largest collections of portraits of 
king hussein big even for jordan where portraits of the monarch 
are everywhere 
the king is seen in dress white military uniform wearing a 
traditional keffiyeh headdress in a pilots uniform with each of 
his four wives with his children as a young monarch 
hussein can be found dressed for soccer cricket riding 
driving flying and meeting dozens of arab and other leaders 
including george bush before he became president 
electronic detectors beep crow ring or squeal whenever 
someone enters the lounge or strides around the room 
western rock or arabic music blares from one of the six stereos 
behind the bar four television sets are in various states of 
repair 
khoury pulls out his stamp collection dozens are from germanys 
era of hyperinflation in 1922 one 100mark stamp is overprinted 
100 billion marks 
in a garage outside sit two chrysler new yorkers a plymouth 
volare and an oldsmobile toronado 
khoury just sold a dodge camper and he mourns bed inside 
fridge inside i was crazy crazy to sell it 
amid the red ceiling fans red cushions red chairs and red 
carpets khoury recounts his childhood and shows a 1932 photo of 
himself standing beside his father who wears a traditional white 
headdress 
although his family is from bethlehem birthplace of jesus in 
what since 1967 has been the israelioccupied west bank khoury 
says he has spent much of his life in maan 
hundreds of business cards and currency from all over the world 
attest to his cosmopolitan clientele but khoury says the bar may 
be in danger of being closed down 
moslem fundamentalists in jordan are calling for a ban on 
alcohol 
theyre trying to ban the rest house he said theyre 
waiting for me to make a problem so they can close me down 
he opened a drawer under the bar to display a collection of 
guns picking them up one after the other raising them above his

only a handful of police remain where soldiers 
and tanks filled tiananmen square in june and in place of sandbags 
on the streets are piles of cabbages 
hundreds of thousands of tons of cabbages have been dumped on 
sidewalks throughout beijing as people stock up for winter with 
memories still fresh of a bloody spring 
some try to get rid of the memories 
i dont think about it a receptionist said i just come 
do my job and go home nobody bothers me and i dont pay attention 
to anyone 
in the spring the young woman had stayed at her workplace not 
daring to go home for four days after the violent crackdown which 
left hundreds if not thousands dead thousands more were arrested 
in nationwide sweeps that continue 
her neighbor who was in his early 20s was killed by a 
soldiers bullet the night of june 3 after he went into the streets 
to see what was happening 
the youths father was ordered to write an essay on how he had 
failed to educate his son properly there was no funeral 
are you kidding the woman said sarcastically he was a 
counterrevolutionary a thug 
a sullen mood prevails at beijings universities 
in early november investigators questioned students on the 
campus of beijing university which was at the forefront of the 
protests all students were warned at rallies to cooperate with the 
investigators or they could end up being questioned instead by the 
police 
people are still very nervous said a student at the 
university who took part in the protests of may and june we 
dont know what they will do to us next 
a student at beijing normal university another of the activist 
schools declined to meet a foreign acquaintance 
things are still quite tense she said theyre still 
investigating people you know 
she said she feared her chances of getting a passport to study 
overseas would be in jeopardy 
on tiananmen square a few dozen peoples armed police have 
replaced army soldiers standing guard people can enter the square 
only with written permission from a work unit

one section devoted to soldiers who were killed displays their 
bloodied clothing firearms and diaries there is nothing about 
civilian casualties

august to about 2000 now 
meanwhile government television has dropped its drumbeat of 
attacks on the counterrevolutionary turmoil but 
governmentproduced films showing soldiers being beaten and burned 
are still shown 
one newspaper reported recently that soldier tian yuejun had 
named his newborn son pingbao putting down the turmoil so 
the child will always remember how his father took part in 
serving the country and putting down the counterrevolutionary 
turmoil 
martial law imposed on most of beijing on may 20 remains in 
effect although military sentries were replaced by regular police 
nov 1 
nobody feels good will toward the peoples liberation army or 
the peoples armed police a taxi driver sneered but were 
more scared of the armed police theyve been trained in kung fu

the united states the soviet union and 
china are building large new embassies in nicosia adding new 
emphasis to cyprus as a key middle east listening post 
the divided island in the eastern mediterranean has more foreign 
diplomats intelligence agents foreign soldiers and journalists 
than larger arab capitals 
its importance as an intelligencegathering base grew as 
westerners fled war and terrorism in beirut 
cyprus really is on the crossroads said vladimir a 
chizkhov first secretary at the soviet embassy 
its a small country but definitely its role is greater than 
its size because its on the threshhold of the middle east and 
of course it is also the location of the cyprus problem 
cyprus has been divided since the turkish army invaded in july 
1974 to keep the island which has a greek majority from uniting 
with greece 
the turks seized the northern third of the island which the 
turkish cypriot minority declared a breakaway republic in 1983 
only turkey recognizes it 
while greek cypriot newspapers have described the new soviet 
embassy as a palace the us embassy under construction right 
across the street is called a fortress 
the 30million american building is designed mainly to be secure 
against attack some walls are nearly three feet thick set well 
back from the street the building is surrounded by a high concrete 
wall and a double fence 
direct access is impossible visitors must enter through a gate 
away from the main building then make a sharp turn left and pass 
through another gate 
metochiou street on which us and soviet embassies are 
situated has gained the nickname microwave alley because of 
the potential for the two superpowers to spy on each other 
the graceful colonnaded entrance to the new soviet chancery is 
in sharp contrast to the american building only minimal security 
is in evidence 
the new chinese embassy is done in pagodalike architecture 
nicosia also has an israeli embassy and a mission of the 
palestine liberation organization israeli mossad secret service 
operatives move about the island along with senior plo figures and 
libyan and syrian agents 
iran opened an embassy recently canada set up an immigration 
office to deal with the flood of lebanese and iranians seeking 
visas 
international news organizations including the associated 
press have set up middle east listening posts in nicosia as well 
one of their tasks is to monitor irans television and radio 
broadcasts 
cyprus has excellent telecommunications and airline links with 
the region 
complicated shortwave antannae large satellite dishes and other 
electronic gear litter the roofs of many buildings in nicosia 
while on the 6000foot summit of mount olympus is the 
golfball a large white geodesic dome that conceals british 
electronic surveillance antennae 
nearby ayios nicolaos is the base for britains 9th signals 
regiment which conducts electronic intelligencegathering from the 
forested mountains

it is not an insurmountable opportunity as 
one senator observed but there is a challenge in the changes the 
administration and congress will face because of the peaceful 
revolutions that are transforming eastern europe 
those changes are shaking assumptions and premises that have 
been the conventional wisdom of us policies and politics 
now suddenly nations that were part of the enemy camp have 
their own miniature new deal programs of us aid complete with 
american acronyms the support for eastern european democracy act 
seed for short will provide nearly 1 billion worth of aid over 
three years most of it for poland a small slice for hungary 
the pentagon already is at work on preemptive pruning of defense 
budgets knowing that unless it starts cutting congress is likely 
to start slashing 
political tenets that have stood for decades are going to be 
changing in national election campaigns republicans usually have 
been in command of the national security issue democrats often 
defensive about it to dramatize his support for the military 
michael dukakis rode around in a tank and wound up looking silly 
in one of the memorable images of the 1988 campaign next time 
that trip may not be deemed necessary 
the administration is concerned about wholesale cuts in defense 
and about pressures for swift withdrawal of american forces from 
western europe thats where the big defense money is more than 
150 billion a year with some 305000 us troops stationed there 
that posture was built around the danger of conventional attack 
from the east a risk secretary of defense dick cheney says is now 
very unlikely 
the sudden change in the east makes that money an inviting 
target in the era of deficit woes and not only for democrats the 
peace dividend could be the change that permits president bush to 
stand permanently on his campaign promise against new taxes 
nevertheless the administration is firmly against rapid cuts in 
manpower there vice president dan quayle saying that would be 
precipitous and risky cheney said us force reductions must be 
negotiated not unilateral bush proposed a reduction to 275000 
men on each side and that is under negotiation now 
what you want to do first of all is build down to parity 
cheney said in an nbctv interview noting that the soviet union 
still has about 380000 troops in east germany berlin wall or no 
wall 
those warnings may be difficult to enforce in a government beset 
by budget deficits 
ultimately if youre going to save money in the defense 
budget youre talking about a reduction in the combat forces 
committed to europe cheney said it may be possible long 
term for us to do that 
shortterm the pressure are building with suggestions that 
both sides cut back quickly 
sen sam nunn dga said the united states and nato should be 
thinking about a response should the soviet union offer to remove 
all foreign troops from european nations within a few years 
nunn chairman of the senate armed services committee said any 
such proposition should be handled with care he said the 
administration ought to be ready because soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev might produce that kind of dramatic peace move at the 
seaborne summit dec 2 and 3 
donald atwood the deputy secretary of defense said western 
nations should work for economic wellbeing in the warsaw pact 
nations lest instability jeopardize the movement toward freedom in 
the old soviet bloc 
but atwoods message also came with a caution signal now is 
not the time for unilateral disarmament now is not the time for us 
to talk about a lessening of the impact of nato 
when bush went to the nato summit six months ago with his call 
for negotiated cuts in conventional arms the modernization of 
shortrange nuclear missiles in west germany was a companion issue 
that was shelved until 1992 a concession to the bonn government 
which faced widespread domestic opposition to the new nuclear 
weapons 
there is no prospect now that those aging us weapons will be 
upgraded and the administration knows it although no one is 
saying so openly 
at the same time cheney argues that the changing situation puts 
an even greater premium on strategic weapons he said the soviet 
union is modernizing its arsenal they are not giving up he 
said in the tv interview indeed they are improving their 
strategic nuclear capability 
countering that in a shrinking defense budget is going to be 
increasingly difficult and there is concern in the administration 
that congress may try to deal with the new situation with old 
habits by insisting that the reductions spare its political 
favorites cutting the budget will mean shutting down bases and 
not just in west germany it also is going to cost defense 
contracts which means business and jobs 
the changes are not going to be politically painless 
unlike the old comic strip character pogo we are not 
confronted with insurmountable opportunities sen carl m levin 
dmich said the other day we are confronted by great western 
valueaffirming opportunity 
it does carry a price

huntington williams inside story of the 
decline and sale of abc is the kind of history that most people 
dont want to be a part of 
a highranking abc executive heaved a sigh of relief after 
reading the book thank god he said my names not in it and 
im not a source 
there are few heroes in beyond control abc and the fate of 
the networks written by williams a former speechwriter for abc 
founder leonard goldenson williams worked at abc from 1981 to 1985 
goldenson and former abc president elton rule are two of the 
books good guys who led abc to network leadership in the 1970s 
but in williams account rules successors squandered their 
inheritance and eventually forced the sale of the network to 
capital cities 
abc was the most interesting of all the networks williams 
said in an interview the secret of abc was that it gave all 
these young kids a chance to cut their teeth developing programs 
eventually the brilliant programmers left that left fred pierce 
and tony thomopoulos to run the network 
beyond control published by atheneum is at times as 
provocative as the movie network it tells of management 
brilliance and management failures of sexual peccadillos and such 
goofiness as putting a psychic on the network payroll 
richard connelly an abc public relations executive in new york 
said the company had no comment on the book 
goldenson held abc together almost with spit and chewing gum in 
the 1950s he came out of the movie industry and brought hollywood 
and television together first with walt disney then with such 
shows as maverick the life and legend of wyatt earp 
cheyenne and 77 sunset strip 
in the 1960s abc was something of a joke put the vietnam war 
on abc and itll be over in 13 weeks one joke went 
the turnaround began in 1968 when rule moved into top 
management one top abc executive barry diller developed the 
movie of the week concept another michael eisner developed 
the series happy days diller is now chief operating officer 
of 20th century fox eisner is chairman of disney 
fred silverman lured from cbs built a schedule that made abc 
first in the ratings the onetime third network was now the 
richest network and the biggest moneymaking advertising vehicle in 
the country 
after silverman left for nbc abc coasted for a while then fell 
to third place 
williams tells how abc lost producercreator stephen cannell 
who took his next show the a team to nbc where it became a 
huge hit the book tells how abc lost the cosby show which put 
nbc in first place after it had been offered by two former abc 
executives tom werner and marcy carsey 
the events that led to the sale of abc to capital cities were 
set in motion according to williams by an overheard telephone 
call 
a secretary misinterpreted the call and thought her boss was 
trying to sell the company he said that alerted wall street 
then the federal communications commission briefly considered 
changes that would allow the networks to own their affiliate 
stations since the bloom was off the oil industry the networks 
looked to wall street to be ripe for huge profits 
wall street was just waiting for abc to go into play then abc 
missed the cosby show that was the drama that led seven months 
later to abc being sold the fact that it could be done in a 
friendly manner led to changeovers at the other networks abc was 
the only network bought by broadcasters 
williams resigned from abc after the purchase but before it 
became effective in january 1986 he immediately began work on the 
book 
most of the information i got from interviews he said i 
learned more about broadcasting than i ever wanted to know i was 
trying to make sense of what i had seen it was the end of a 
dynasty at the time goldenson didnt seem to be an imposing man 
but he was a giant

jeanne sharp whose ancestors lived and 
farmed in this rural new york community before the american 
revolution is learning a hard lesson about rebellion governments 
often fight back 
sharp and more than 300 other residents who filed a lawsuit 
trying to block construction of a garbage incinerator are in turn 
being sued by lawmakers 
ive been thinking a lot about ethan allen said sharp i 
have some idea of what my ancestors went through to get here 
if they can put up with it so can i 
residents sued washington county and adjoining warren county 
last year over the proposed incinerator which is to be built in 
hudson falls about 40 miles north of albany to burn garbage for 
both counties they contend that local officials approved the plan 
without a proper public hearing 
the counties and their industrial development agency 
countersued seeking 15 million from 320 plaintiffs most of them 
washington county residents washington county later dropped out 
but warren county and the ida remain 
the residents recognizable around the area by the bright orange 
plaintiff bumper stickers affixed to their cars say the 
countersuit was filed to harass them into dropping their lawsuit 
environmentalists say it could have national implications for 
other citizen action groups that turn to the courts to challenge 
controversial projects the environmental movement even has a name 
for it a slapp suit or strategic lawsuit against public 
participation 
its a strategy to hush people up and stop them from speaking 
out said lois gibbs who led the fight over the love canal toxic 
dump in niagara falls and now runs the virginiabased citizens 
clearinghouse for hazardous waste 
this case stands out as the only one of its kind that i know 
of where government chooses to sue its own people said will 
collette citizens clearinghouses slapp suit expert 
other slapp suits which collete calls legal terrorism have 
been brought across the country by private companies involved in 
projects the idea is to squash the opposition 
people who bring slapp suits dont expect to win them he said 
they all get dropped they never go to trial warren county has 
no expectation of winning its case 
in washington county some supervisors told people they might 
lose their homes or cars as a result of the countersuit the 
plaintiffs claim 
theyre trying to harass us and intimidate us down to a 
handful of manageable troublemakers said melody brown who 
admits to being one of the more vocal incinerator opponents being 
sued 
the countersuit contends the citizens lawsuit was frivolous and 
that actions by the incinerator opponents during the sale of bonds 
for the project cost the counties 15 million 
at the original closing date for the bond sale there were 
committed purchasers as the result of the activities of the 
citizens those contracts were abrogated it was necessary to enter 
into new contracts and passage of time and a change in the market 
brought a 15 million loss said benjamin pratt a glens falls 
lawyer for the counties and ida that loss increased the cost of 
the project and with it the cost of burning garbage 
now the incinerator opponents want to add more litigation to the 
fray a federal civil rights lawsuit in response to the lawsuit 
against them theyve hired atlantabased civil rights lawyer 
robert remar 
the first amendment to the constitution gives all of us the 
right to freedom of speech freedom of association and the right to 
petition government for redress of grievances said remar when 
a government seeks to basically punish the citizens for having 
exercised those rights thats a violation of the constitution 
pratt said the counterclaim doesnt violate anyones civil 
rights 
they have the right to speak with respect to the proceedings 
and actions being taken by the government they have a right to sue 
their government if they feel that something is done improperly 
but they dont have the right to perform in such a fashion that 
they interfere with the contractual rights that the government has 
with third parties and cause a 15 million loss 
hammond robertson chairman of the warren county board of 
supervisors said he supports the counterclaim as has a majority 
of that board every time someone moves to drop it 
i have to recognize that people have some strong feelings on 
this issue said robertson but there are 110000 people in 
these two counties we have some obligation to the other 100000 
people 
while the lawsuits go on over the 80 million incinerator 
resolution isnt expected until some time next year excavation is 
nearing completion at the plant site next to the hudson river 
meanwhile the incinerator has hit a legal snag in yet another 
lawsuit a state judge ruled that the state should have required 
more environmental assessments of the project before renewing its 
latest permits that suit was brought by the village of hudson 
falls construction has stopped while the state considers whether 
to appeal 
the main point of the original lawsuit whether there was a 
public hearing on the project is still in dispute while robertson 
said a hearing wasnt required pratt said the twocounty ida held 
one 
stephanie wenk another active incinerator opponent said the 
ida hearing lasted just 45 minutes and that everyone wasnt allowed 
to speak 
the public hearing was a sham said wenk who has been known 
to tie a gag over her mouth at supervisors meetings they let 11 
people speak out of 49 then they just banged the gavel and that 
was it

the hut was little more than an 
oversize insulated packing crate its lone window smashed the 
plywood door torn off its hinges the roof caved in and a slice of 
its metal skin bent by a crowbar 
mariyam khachaturian gazed at it gratefully 
she saw a home 
it would be her first home since the armenian earthquake of dec 
7 1988 which killed at least 25000 people including her 
husband daughter soninlaw and 2yearold grandson since then 
she has traipsed from the cramped makeshift home of one relative 
to another 
the forlorn damaged oneroom hut was one of dozens dumped at a 
railyard on a plain beneath snowcapped mountains outside 
leninakan thousands of the one and tworoom shacks intended to 
shelter armenians left homeless by the quake were vandalized during 
azerbaijans twomonth blockade of armenia 
the blockade and the vandalism are part of an ethnic conflict 
between christian armenians and moslem azerbaijanis in which more 
than 120 people have been killed since february 1988 
what kind of people can do this asked lida gregoryan a 
leninakan teacher as she gazed at the destruction of the cubicles 
generously dubbed little houses in russian 
she gestured toward mrs khachaturian their grief is not 
enough and now this 
the blockade halted transport within armenia for lack of fuel 
and forced factories to close for want of raw materials official 
media have reported 
the homeless suffered most 
isnt the earth big enough for us and them asked mrs 
khachaturians friend khohazh melkonyan referring to the 
azerbaijanis 
tensions between the neighboring soviet republics in the 
mountainous caucasus date back centuries but they now focus on 
calls for the nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian area 
within azerbaijan to be transferred to the jurisdiction of armenia 
the government in moscow struggling to preserve order in the 
violencetorn republics has assumed administrative control of the 
disputed region in an attempt to neutralize it 
some azerbaijanis have said the blockade was merely a side 
effect of a general strike on the nagornokarabakh issue others 
say supply lines to armenia and nagornokarabakh were cut to 
pressure the armenians into dropping their territorial claim 
when the azerbaijani popular front agreed to end the blockade 
and soviet troops moved in to protect the trains soviet television 
showed armenian rail workers flinging open boxcar doors to find 
potatoes crawling with maggots weeks in the hot southern sun had 
ruined all the fresh food 
there was more looters had stolen boxcar loads of construction 
supplies and stripped the little prefabricated shelters intended 
for quake victims 
it was like a second earthquake said meruzhan garpetyan 
whose family is now living in a small stone house they built 
themselves 
karlin ambartsumyan chairman of the leninakan communist party 
said 90 percent of the cargo was unusable 
slabs of preformed concrete were smashed and tankcars of 
cement were diluted with sand he said authorities have said 
mixing too much sand in the concrete used for construction of 
apartment buildings and schools was one of the reasons so many 
buildings collapsed in the earthquake 
valera hairiyan a worker at the masis cargo station outside 
yerevan armenias capital said cargo on trains from azerbaijan 
was still being vandalized or stolen even though soldiers are on 
the trains he pointed to construction huts that had just arrived 
with their exterior panels pried off 
inside one hut a rolledup manifest listed what had been inside 
four beds two small tables a chair a radio a wardrobe a 
sink water pump lights and a heating system the hut arrived with 
a single bedspring a pair of broken stools and a smashed radio 
despite the damage to the huts mrs khachaturian and others in 
a crowd waiting at the leninakan railyard said they would be happy 
to find any shelter 
winter is coming what are we going to do asked aida 
gasaryan whose husband died in the quake leaving her with three 
children mrs gasaryan said she has been living in the streets or 
with friends 
the next man in the group said he and his wife have made their 
car their home and they fear they will still be there when the 
temperature drops to 30 degrees below zero as it usually does 
the armenians are furious with the azerbaijanis for the hardship 
inflicted upon them but some also accuse president mikhail s 
gorbachev and the government of letting the blockade continue for 
two months without taking steps to stop it 
couldnt the government do anything asked mrs 
khachaturians friend melkonyan are they so weak

just when things were looking bleakest in 
this icebound island of 53000 people and 1800 oxen nature came 
to the rescue 
until a few months ago this is how things looked 
the us air force was closing greenlands only international 
airport and the four radar stations it supplied 
a canadianowned lead and zinc mine was closing and offshore 
oil exploration so far has proved fruitless 
there was chronic unemployment except when the fish are 
running alcoholism and venereal disease were rampant and every 
year 50 greenlanders kill themselves its the worlds highest 
suicide rate 129 per 100000 more than double no 2 hungarys 45 
per 100000 
all of those things still stand but in november danish and 
canadian geologists announced they had found gold a 
16squaremile patch on the countrys east coast comparable in 
size to south african gold reserves 
a danish newspaper jyllandsposten reported that mining could 
begin in 5 years and could yield 12 tons of gold a year which at 
current prices comes to something like 150 million 
that should come as good news to denmark which last year 
provided semiautonomous greenland with 347 million or 86 percent 
of the islands budget 
it would also pay the 30 million a year it takes to keep open 
the sondre stromfjord airfield where a sign proclaims united 
states air force space command 
theres nothing space age about the primevallooking musk oxen 
roaming the nearby arctic hinterland but provided by the 
americans they are the only thing that flourishes around here 
the oxen today 1800 strong are the offspring of a few hundred 
shaggy beasts flown here in us transport planes four years ago 
and set loose as a gesture of good will 
the airfield nestled between a jadegreen fiord and the foot of 
a glacier is greenlands only international airport a hub of 
civilian flights 
this year the former danish colony celebrates 10 years of 
semiindependence under a homerule system with its own parliament 
and two legislators sitting in the danish parliament in copenhagen 
some income is generated by 300 us servicemen and about 2000 
danish civilians who pay income tax working at the controversial 
thule radar base in the far north 
the us military has volunteered other aid besides running the 
airport which services nuuk greenlands capital 198 miles to the 
south recently the army corps of engineers offered to help with 
public works projects in remote settlements 
the gold find which the greenlanders will split 5050 with 
denmark will augment the few exploitable resources of the worlds 
largest island notably fish and shrimp there are other problems 
just as formidable such as the suicides 
alcohol is always involved along with problems with the 
girlfriend says rene christensen the chief physician for the 
nuuk district 
women had a total of 870 abortions last year against 1100 
births 
venereal disease is 100 times higher than in denmark 
christensen says 
the economy is drained by the expensive social welfare programs 
inherited from denmark the city of nuuk greenlands largest with 
13000 people pays 14 million a year for benefits such as 
subsidized housing kindergartens and day care centers and 
unemployment free health service is provided by the danes 
the job situation never good was worsened by the international 
campaign against seal and whale hunting one of the main sources of 
income for the inuit people whose life is centered on hunting and 
fishing 
it became shameful to be seen in a sealskin coat complains 
adolf jensen a hunter from a small village 250 miles north of the 
arctic circle 
today greenlanders cant live by hunting alone though hunter 
families can supplement their incomes by using skins for clothing 
and eating the meat 
the end of professional seal hunting has led to an uncontrolled 
growth in seal herds which has been blamed by some experts for the 
sudden depletion of cod stocks several years ago 
greenland is a glacial land of primitive and permanent white 
beauty where dogsleds coastal steamers and helicopters are the 
main means of travel outside the towns 
ninety percent of greenlanders live on the west coast of the 
island which is threefourths the size of australia

most of its 870240 square miles is covered with ice 2 miles 
thick but the icefree area is still half the size of texas 
the southern coasts are snowless and verdant in summer and it 
was here that the scandinavian vikings landed 1000 years ago and 
gave the country its somewhat misleading name 
eric the red a hero of icelandic sagas established tiny 
colonies that eked out a living for 500 years before mysteriously 
dying out 
nuuk sits on a long strip of land between two fiords with 
mountains rising on either side like sentinels long rows of 
publicly built fivestory apartment blocks give the city an air of 
drabness 
today four out of five inhabitants are native inuits who are 
related by language and custom to the eskimos of alaska canada and 
siberia 
but 60 percent of the countrys administration is run by danes 
jonathan motzfeldt who has been prime minister since autonomy 
was granted says the goal is for greenlanders to take over 
entirely in its first autonomous decade he says greenland 
already has undergone a silent revolution and he wants it to 
become more selfreliant 
motzfeldt has announced deep cuts in social benefits especially 
to the unemployed from now on he says welfare clients who refuse 
a job offer in the summer will not be eligible for cash benefits 
the greenland government also has taken its first international 
loan of about 166 million in german marks and japanese yen 
denmarks rule over greenland dates to 1776 when it set up a 
trade monopoly and established missionary stations along the coast 
the americans came during world war ii when greenland was a 
midway staging area and refueling stop for troop transports and 
equipment on the way to the european theater 
us forces also supplied the greenlanders with food and 
essentials after the nazis occupied denmark which oldtimers still 
remember 
in the early 1950s the us military built defense installations 
across canada greenland iceland and scotland known as the distant 
early warning system or dew line 
the philosophy then was that the shortest distance between two 
superpowers as the bomber or ballistic missile flies is over the 
arctic but the stations have become outdated and are coming down 
the us pullout from sondre stromfjord also is exacerbating 
tensions with greenland over the thule radar base an important 
link for us defenses in its ballistic missile warning system 
thule was once a tiny inuit hunting and trapping village under 
the usdanish defense agreement of 1951 the us military 
relocated the native people and built a big phasedarray radar 
it has been a bone of contention between the united states and 
the soviet union which claims the modernization of thule in recent 
years was a breach of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
though it is a source of income for greenland it is a political 
embarrassment for motzfeldt who is under pressure from leftists 
who want to get rid of the base motzfeldt grumbles about thule as 
that stupid radar 
denmark mindful of its commitments to nato supports the us 
position that thule is nonoffensive and the greenland 
administration has little choice but to fall in line 
motzfeldt has intimated that the americans wont be welcome in 
thule unless they agree to continue paying for sondre stromfjords 
civilian airport 
we are not going to pay money to have the american bases 
here motzfeldt says on the contrary we insist that civilian 
people have the advantage of the americans presence 
despite all of its problems the latest news of the gold find 
should help make the future brighter for the first christmas in a 
long time the world can truly say yes greenland there is a 
santa claus

a constant parade of titanicsized 
icebergs slowly drifts with the currents of disko bay in sight of 
this west coast fishing port 
spawned by the northern hemispheres most productive glacier 25 
miles to the south these mountains of ice break off with a 
thunderous roar and begin their silent arctic voyage 
the barking of sled dogs which outnumber the 4000 people of 
the town mixes with the chugging of cutters and shrimp boats and 
the hum of the fish factories in the tiny harbor 
against the darkened sky the northern lights unfurl in wavy 
sheets of red and green across the horizon 
ilulissat which means icebergs in the native language is 
inhabited by inuits who are culturally and linguistically related 
to the eskimos of alaska and others in canada and siberia 
nearly everyone in the town 180 miles north of the arctic 
circle make their living from the sea 
its economy is totally dependent on shrimp and halibut catches 
which the local fishermen deliver directly to the two big staterun 
fish factories employing 350 people in the peak season 
ilulissat greenlands thirdlargest town also is known by its 
danish name jacobshavn denmark which ruled greenland for 200 
years made it an autonomous territory under the danish crown 10 
years ago 
about 50 fishing boats ranging from factory trawlers to oneman 
cutters operate during the summer from ilulissats natural harbor 
in the winters of 24hour darkness many fishermen such as 
soeren madsen go longlining on the icefjord a frozen fiord at 
the foot of the glacier 
we drive 35 miles overland across rough terrain in dogsleds to 
the fishing grounds and the temperature can fall to minus 22 
degrees fahrenheit out on the ice madsen says 
long lines strung with up to 100 hooks are sunk through holes 
cut in the ice and then hauled up by hand from the depths 
you have to return with a catch of at least 400 pounds to make 
it pay madsen says 
a typical fishing tour on the ice lasts 48 hours during which 
time the men live in low conical tents with a primus stove to keep 
warm 
the dog teams of 10 to 12 huskies sleep huddled together out in 
the open they are capable of running 12 hours nonstop 
some of the fishermen make a little extra money on the side 
driving sleds for winter tourists who come to see the natural 
wonders of the disko bay area 
in ilulissat its an unwritten law that dog sleds have the 
right of way 
ilulissat municipality includes four small outlying settlements 
of 80 to 100 inhabitants each beyond those tiny villages lie 
nothing but the glacial ice pack 2 miles thick of greenlands 
interior 
no roads link the town with its satellite settlements travel is 
by boat sled or helicopter 
the greenlandic dog a special breed protected by a ban on 
imports of other races is not tame and visitors are advised not 
to pet them 
practically every dwelling in the town has a dog team in the 
yard where fish for their fodder is hung up in racks to dry 
the dogs must be kept chained their fangs cut stray dogs are 
shot on orders from the authorities 
many hunters are embittered over an antisealing campaign waged 
by conservationists that ruined the oncelucrative skin trade 
in the early 1980s environmental groups such as greenpeace 
spurred on by french actress and selfstyled animal friend brigitte 
bardot launched highly publicized protests against the canadian 
practice of bludgeoning seal pups to death for their prized white 
pelts 
gruesome pictures of the canadian seal hunt became associated in 
the public mind with the greenlanders traditional hunt which does 
not include pups 
seal pups are born on the ice floes off northern canada and are 
rarely seen in greenlandic waters 
prices for greenlandic skins plunged in europe and the united 
states a major market banned the import of seal skins 
greenpeace eventually apologized to greenland but they should 
have admitted their mistake to the consumers as well said adolf 
jensen a hunter who comes from a tiny settlement 62 miles north of 
ilulissat

quickly now if all the members of all the

fact is you neednt bother the committees of congress the 
judicial committees or any of the myriad nongovernmental panels 
in town to build a human sidewalk to the naval academy the 
executive branch would do nicely for that 25mile stretch 
the committees of congress make more daytoday headlines but

among the cases recently brought to light 
seven of the eight members of the scientific advisory panel 
charged with reviewing pesticide issues for the environmental 
protection agency during the ronald reagan administration were 
consultants for the chemical industry including companies that 
produce pesticides in one instance the panel persuaded the epa to 
hold off for years after the agency itself concluded that the 
pesticide alar used on apples should be banned because it is a 
probable cause of cancer in humans and a known cause of 
cancer in laboratory animals alars manufacturer uniroyal 
chemical co voluntarily took the compound off the domestic market 
earlier this year epa now says it will formally announce a ban in 
january 
every one of the 10 nongovernmental members of a particular 
agriculture department committee created in 1987 to develop 
regulatory policy on the contamination of food by microbiological 
agents such as salmonella and botulism was an employee contractor 
or consultant of the food industry such contaminants cause more 
than 7000 deaths and 6 million illnesses each year the 
agriculture department argued in court that the onesided 
composition of the panel did not violate a federal law calling for 
balanced representation but in recent months has added several 
members from outside the industry 
a motor vehicle safety panel established in 1987 by the 
national highway traffic safety administration to help formulate 
the motor vehicle safety research agenda for the next decade was 
stacked with employees and others with financial ties to the auto 
industry and not one representative of consumer groups was 
appointed 
in enacting the federal advisory committee act in 1972 congress 
recognized that such panels can be a useful and beneficial means 
of furnishing expert advice ideas and diverse opinions to the 
federal government but thensen charles percy rill a 
sponsor of that law also summarized the dangers 
viewed in its worst light the federal advisory committee can 
be a convenient nesting place for special interests seeking to 
change or preserve a policy for their own ends such committees 
stacked with giants in their respective fields can overwhelm a 
federal decisionmaker or at least make him wary of upsetting the 
status quo 
the 1972 law requires that all federal advisory committees must 
be fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and 
the functions to be performed however never in the succeeding 
17 years has a federal court altered the composition of an advisory 
committee despite many legal challenges though several judges 
have harshly criticized panels dominated by special interests they 
have found the language of the law too vague to enforce 
in the case involving the agriculture departments national 
advisory committee on microbiological criteria for foods 
government attorneys went so far as to argue that the panel met the 
balanced representation requirement because the food industry 
employees are also consumers of food 
an incredulous us district judge john garrett penn interjected 
but im sure youll agree that the industry representatives 
have a certain point of view 
government attorney jeffrey gutman they perhaps have a 
certain point of view given their employment status 
penn they cant help but have isnt that correct 
gutman i will permit the court to take judicial notice of any 
predisposition that these individuals may have 
in spite of that concession by the government penn dismissed 
public citizens lawsuit and joined other jurists in expressing 
frustration with the law which he said presents various 
obstacles to appropriate judicial interpretation 
sen john glenn dohio has introduced legislation designed to 
sharpen the statutes language i am disturbed to find continued 
litigation over basic questions regarding the balanced 
representation requirement he says 
ms goldman says glenns bill contains some very useful 
sensible changes but she faults it for retaining a provision 
that allows some federal agencies to appoint panels whose members 
dont have to file even a simplified financial disclosure statement 
a final version of glenns bill has yet to be drafted that of 
course will be done in a congressional committee

hes skilled with both scalpel and pen a 
surgeon with a love for words after 32 years as a practicing 
physician richard selzer turned to writing full time but it is 
his intimate acquaintance with the art of medicine that make his 
literary works so compelling 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for more than a decade richard selzer 
lived a double life he was a literary surgeon he performed 
delicate operations with cool detachment then wrote about them 
with a vivid intimacy 
eventually the balance tipped the words took over and selzer 
began to see things 
once you have gazed with the artist you see 
things you would not have the third eye ofseen otherwise selzer was 
saying the 
other day you see the details that illuminate human misery and 
you are different 
selzer had taken up writing at 40 in an attempt to recapture 
what he felt was a lost intimacy between doctor and patient he led 
the double life for 15 years laboring over his prose between 
patients in his surgical practice at yalenew haven hospital 
during that time he wrote mortal lessons notes on the art of 
surgery and two oth on the black market 
no east german money in the west we are hurting ourselves 
one placard warned according to the official adn news agency 
in an unprecedented open exchange with east german television 
from his modest new home on sunday krenz said there will be no 
going back to the old conditions the opening of the borders was 
the best proof of our sincerity about reforms 
but many of the estimated 100000 people who rallied in several 
cities on sunday to maintain pressure for free elections and other 
democratic reforms insisted on new leaders and an end to communist 
dominance of the government 
a poll commissioned by west germanys stern magazine showed the 
opposition group new forum the strongest contender favored by 22 
percent of those questioned 
the communists with 14 percent of the vote trailed both new 
forum and the liberal democratic party which has been among those 
leading calls for change although until recently it was closely 
aligned with the communists 
krenz has promised free elections but has not proposed a date 
stern said the survey was conducted by the independent west 
german polling firm forsa it said 2180 east germans were 
questioned but it did not provide a margin of error 
at an east berlin demonstration sunday most signs denounced 
communist rule and expressed popular distrust of krenz the partys 
chief of security before being elevated to general secretary on 
oct 18 
the partys daily berliner zeitung reported today that some 
extremists had urged countrymen to sabotage east germanys 
electrical system as a form of protest the paper told citizens to 
ignore the appeals 
whoever is producing such leaflets seeks neither 
democratization of society nor economic reform the newspaper 
said he wants only a breakdown 
authorities opened east germanys borders to the west on nov 9 
in a bid to gain the trust of a populace demanding demand 
democratic change and to try to end an exodus that was sapping the 
country of young skilled workers 
on the second weekend of free travel nearly 3 million east 
germans crossed into west berlin and west germany between friday 
and sunday west german border police said the vast majority have 
been returning to their homeland 
ferry service across the elbe river which forms part of the 
border resumed sunday at hitzacker about 80 miles southeast of 
hamburg for the first time since 1945 
the agency said about 30000 communist party backers 
demonstrated in potsdam to show support for the governments 
announced reforms 
in his television broadcast krenz said he favors a new voting 
law to meet public demands for competitive elections 
he also shrugged off a suggestion he could be ousted at a party 
congress to be held dec 1617 and at which more leadership changes 
are expected 
the television showed krenzs new brown concrete home with a 
small garden in east berlins the pankow district 
krenz said he had moved to the quiet east berlin street 
after assuming the party leadership he said other members of the 
partys ruling politburo were also moving out of the exclusive 
wandlitz complex

alaskas top soldier was taken aback by the 
openness of his host a kgb colonel the colonel for his part 
seemed wryly amused at the questions from his guests thats the 
way it went when the soviets invited a group of americans to a 
barren lookout post in the bering strait a place once forbidden to 
outsiders 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was an unusual open house 
at this isolated soviet outpost where 70 camouflageclad border 
patrol conscripts guard the back door to europe 
the treeless island is a rocky and gray domain in the middle of 
the bering strait a chokepoint for vessels operating in arctic 
waters 
big diomede is 25 miles from the soviet mainland and just 27 
miles from the us island of little diomede and its 140 villagers 
the border and international date line are midway between the 
two islands 
this fall the small military garrison played host to a 
fourhour visit by alaska gov steve cowper adjutant general john 
schaeffer a uniformed kgb colonel a dozen government aides and 
four us journalists 
from the advent of the cold war in 1948 until an august 1987 
crossing in 44degree water by marathon swimmer lynne cox big 
diomede island was strictly offlimits to westerners 
the soviet border guards and a handful of alaska eskimo scouts 
warily eyed one another across the strait with binoculars 
gathering whatever intelligence they could 
then came glasnost and a rapid warmup in relations between the 
two nations 
it was exciting to be able to do this after spending so many 
years of my life looking at them from the other side said 
schaeffer who was traveling with cowper on a 12day 6700mile 
trade and friendship mission through the soviet far east 
schaeffer is alaskas ranking military officer a major general 
he is a member of cowpers cabinet in peacetime and would answer to 
the pentagon in war he commands the alaska army and air national 
guard 
i was impressed the most by their attitude schaeffer said 
things have changed and they were so open 
we could have seen almost anything we wanted to if we had had 
the time we dont have that same openness in the military in the 
united states yet 
after arriving in an orange aeroflot helicopter the group was 
escorted through a headquarters building that includes a dormitory 
dining area library armory and briefing room with walls 
displaying illustrations of british french and us missiles 
a small museum has a sign over the door in cyrillic proclaiming 
it the room of international friendship 
it contains a number of souvenirs from the bering bridge 
expedition a group of soviet and american adventurers who used 
sled dogs skis and skin boats last spring in a 1200mile 
friendship trek around the soviet far east and western alaska 
bad weather in april forced the 12member team to spend several 
days on the island 
books mostly paperbacks are wellthumbed a closedcircuit tv 
set sat unused in a corner 
outside were fuel storage tanks for diesel generators a 
halfdozen tall radio antennae and a stairway leading up a rocky 
finger to a concrete bunker overlooking the ocean 
lt col vladimir starukov a kgb border patrol officer assigned 
to escort schaeffer through the first week of the trip seemed 
wryly amused as he answered reporters questions through an 
interpreter 
morale is good here because conditions are so harsh and 
soldiers band together starukov said theyre here to watch 
the sea but observation is just part of their duties like getting 
ready for battle 
most of the draftees are in their teens calendarwatchers who 
slowly turn the pages on the days left in their twoyear hitch 
soldiers get eight rubles a month for candy and cigarettes 
the colonel said everything else they have food and shelter 
the trip home once a year is free 
starukov agreed however that salaries are low 
mom helps out he said about furlough expenses 
although there is occasional contact with eskimo hunters and 
fishermen from alaska there are no siberianyupik or 
inupiatspeaking troops on the island 
they have to take english at school although not many speak 
it starukov said 
slava vasiliv is a 19yearold sergeant from a small village on 
the volga river in the soviet interior he served a year near 
anadyr before arriving on the island and has another year remaining 
before going home 
its not long here vasiliv said everyone has their own 
interests their lives are full of work 
its considered a lonely place because its on an island but 
in reality we get a lot of guests correspondents entertainers 
people bringing in supplies 
schaeffer who was dressed in civilian clothes joked with the 
teenage troops who clustered tightly around him when they learned 
he was an eskimo general 
we both agree well continue looking at each other 
schaeffer said we dont set the policy we just do our jobs 
but now they can reduce the size of the garrison because were 
such good friends just leave one guy to wave at us

life takes strange turns but take a bright 
sandyhaired american teenager add the american appetite for 
casual clothes and what do you get thousands of ghetto and 
mentally handicapped youngsters at a network of camps in the 
ozarks of course 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
nobody would have guessed least of all 
14yearold jamie white 
but as it turned out her keen eye for casual fashion has 
brightened the lives of thousands of deprived american youngsters 
and will apparently for years to come 
she was with her father and a church group on a trip to antigua 
in the west indies in 1987 when she saw some simple cotton shirts 
and shorts fashioned from flour and sugar bags fluttering from a 
clothesline she liked them so much she bought them from the woman 
who made them 
on the plane back home she began discussing making and 
selling flour sack clothes her father joe white says by the 
time we got back home wed carved out a lot of ideas 
white and his wife debbie jo operate four christian 
nondenominational sports camps in the scenic ozark mountains of 
southwestern missouri that each summer attract 5000 children ages 
8 to 18 from 44 states and 11 other countries 
the family decided that any clothing profits would go toward 
their dream of opening additional camps solely for inner city and 
mentally handicapped children from across the nation 
a nonprofit foundation has purchased 150 acres on table rock 
lake for the new camps which the whites hope to open in 1991 
jamie a sandyhaired 14yearold with braces has seen her 
simple idea grow into a line of cotton tshirts tops shorts 
sweat shirts sweat pants and bluejean vests they are marketed 
for girls 13 to 16 under the white sands clothing co label 
white says the familyrun business has sold about 200000 worth 
of clothing in its first year mostly to little rock arkbased 
dillard department stores the nordstroms department store chain 
also carries some white sands garments and macys has expressed an 
interest in next years lines white says 
orders for next year are rolling in and white expects business 
to at least double in 1990 
this is a cinderella story all the way were david competing 
against the goliaths like esprit and guess he says 
a benefactor of the camps put the whites who had no previous 
experience in the garment industry in touch with mike dillard 
president of dillard department stores 
the chain liked jamies designs for a line of shorts and tops 
like the antigua flour and sugar bag garments and featured them in 
last springs line 
jamie also sold dillards on about 25 varieties of neon 
tshirts shorts and tops for summer along with knit jerseys and 
jean vests adorned with dozens of costume jewelry pieces buttons 
and beads for fall 
for christmas dillard is carrying a line of white sands sweat 
shirts with holiday themes 
weve just now gained the respect of stores and theyre 
saying hey these guys are a real company they can really 
produce clothes white says 
his softspoken daughter admits she doubted the business would 
get off the ground 
i thought it was going to be something wed try to do but 
wouldnt really get started she says its really done well 
jamie the oldest of the whites four children has an 
incredible knack for seeing what will sell in department stores 
its a sixth sense her father says 
jamie does the designing but relies on rick mumford one of 
1000 camp counselors and an art major at southwest missouri state 
university to actually put her ideas on fabric 
the kids at camp also help me design and tell me what they 
like and would buy she says 
the clothes are cut sewn and screened at factories in ozark 
ava and shell knob mo the fledgling company employs three people 
full time and has about a dozen parttime workers including a 
saleswoman 
jamie attends trade shows in new york where the new white sands 
lines are exhibited to buyers from major clothing companies 
she says she gets a thrill every time shes in a department 
store and sees the clothing she has designed for other teenage 
girls displayed next to big name lines 
ill see people looking through the racks and its like oh 
my gosh theyre buying my clothes she says 
but thats not the greatest thrill 
for the past 10 years about 400 ghetto and mentally handicapped 
children have spent a week each august at kanakuk kamps which were 
begun by whites father spike white in 1954 children can 
participate in 30 sports from baseball to horseback riding to 
water skiing 
its just a joy to see those kids having so much fun doing 
things theyd never get to do otherwise jamie says and they 
get a chance to know christ and develop everlasting friendships 
what of the future for this clothes designing ingenue 
i never had a dream to be a designer i like to be outside 
doing athletic things id rather be a camp director

in 1963 soviet leader nikita s khrushchev offered an olive 
branch releasing the leader of the ukrainian catholics 
metropolitan josef slipyj after 18 years in labor camps later 
that year john xxiii received khrushchevs daughter rada and her 
husband alexis adzhubei the editor of the government newspaper 
izvestia 
the thaw did not mean khrushchev was softening up on religion at 
home quite the contrary in 195964 he closed about half the 
churches in the soviet union religion he predicted would 
disappear by 1980 
nonetheless john xxiii saw an advantage in an opening to the 
soviet bloc he felt the communist governments had secured power 
and little could be gained by fighting them he also realized the 
regimes themselves were seeking better relations 
the vaticans new policy toward the east bloc came into its own 
under johns successor pope paul vi in the 1970s the vatican 
established diplomatic relations with yugoslavia and working 
contacts with poland 
the pope met five times with the longtime soviet foreign 
minister andrei a gromyko and received nikolai podgorny the 
soviet president who then had little power but bore symbolic 
importance 
concessions from the soviet bloc did not come easy however in 
1971 to advance negotiations with hungary paul vi asked cardinal 
jozef mindszenty an outspoken anticommunist to leave the us 
legation in budapest where he had taken refuge in 1956 three years 
later the pope removed him as primate of hungary 
paul vi was accused by critics of abandoning the silent 
churches of which mindszenty was a symbol but the strategy 
bore results in hungary the vatican was allowed to name bishops 
to fill vacant sees and expand religious instruction 
the election in 1978 of cardinal karol wojtyla of poland as pope 
john paul ii another strong anticommunist initially marked a 
slowdown in the vaticansoviet rapprochement 
the soviets criticized the pope in the early 1980s on grounds 
that he encouraged the solidarity labor movement in poland and 
condemned class struggle for pravda john paul was a reaganite 
and the most reactionary pope of the age 
on top of that came the attempt to assassinate john paul in may 
1981 mehmet ali agca the turkish gunman claimed he had bulgarian 
and soviet assistance for his deed while his allegations were 
never proven the attack further strained vatican relations with 
moscow 
but the rise of mikhail s gorbachev in 1985 marked another 
dramatic turn in vaticansoviet affairs 
scores of religious prisoners were freed as gorbachev 
established glasnost or greater freedom in public expression 
arrests of activists plunged 
in october 1988 the soviet government told lithuanians it would 
return their cathedral in vilnius which had been turned into an 
art gallery more than 20000 jubilant worshippers flocked to the 
first mass there in 30 years 
the vatican has taken advantage of what it calls the soviets 
new spirit this year the holy see has succeeded in naming 
bishops in lithuania byelorussia and czechoslovakia forging 
diplomatic ties with poland and arranging a visit by john paul to 
hungary 
big differences remain between the two sides particularly over 
the outlawed ukrainian catholic church but there have been hints 
moscow is prepared to soften its stance on the ukrainians 
concrete signs of this new soviet attitude exist regarding 
religion new churches are opening they are fixing up those that 
already exist cardinal jozef glemp of poland said after a trip 
to the soviet union last year 
they are facts still sporadic but real

an invitation for the first papal trip to 
the soviet union could be the crowning prize of pope john paul iis 
meeting with mikhail s gorbachev 
the popes longexpressed wish to visit his flock in the ukraine 
and other soviet regions is one of the main issues expected to be 
discussed during his official audience with the soviet president 
friday 
john paul will want to press his case for religious freedom 
legalization of the ukrainian catholic church and normalization of 
the status of the church in the baltic republics whose annexation 
by moscow has never been recognized by the vatican 
but analysts say gorbachev also will be looking for something 
from the pope such as a pledge to use his influence to stem the 
nationalist movements that are threatening gorbachevs reforms 
gorbachev and the first polishborn pope do have some things in 
common including a vision of a united europe though with a 
different emphasis gorbachev espouses a common european home 
while john paul sees christianity as europes unifying force 
church and soviet officials and john paul himself have expressed 
increased optimism that the meeting with gorbachev will clear the 
way for a pastoral visit to the soviet union home to an estimated 
8 million to 10 million roman catholics 
the pope has ruled out a political visit limited to moscow 
he has said he wants to travel throughout the country to visit 
roman catholics in areas such as the ukraine lithuania latvia 
byelorussia and kazakhstan 
a major roadblock remains the status of the ukrainian church 
which was brutally suppressed in 1946 by the stalin dictatorship 
and forcibly merged with the russian orthodox church 
ukrainian catholics who practice the byzantine rite have 
emerged from the underground in the past two years to openly demand 
official recognition by moscow by western estimates at least 4 
million ukrainians are catholics 
our position is very simple said the vaticanbased cardinal 
myroslav lubachivsky of the ukraine we want our church to be 
legalized we want to retain our byzantine rite and we want to be 
under the jurisdiction of the pope 
church officials say soviet authorities have adopted a more 
tolerant attitude toward ukrainian catholics but point out that top 
russian orthodox officials remain opposed to legalization among 
other things the orthodox church would stand to lose hundreds of 
churches it took over when the ukrainian catholics were persecuted 
the pope also wants greater freedom for the church in 
byelorussia for which he was recently able to appoint the first 
bishop in more than 60 years and for the baltic republics of 
lithuania latvia and estonia areas where nationalist and 
independence movements are strong in lithuania an estimated 80 
percent of the 3 million people are roman catholics 
the vatican is also concerned about the shortage of churches and 
priests for the catholics of german and polish origin who live in 
kazakhstan tadzhikistan kirgizia and soviet georgia 
one way the vatican hopes to remedy the situation is by setting 
up a permanent office of contact between the holy see and the 
kremlin this could be arranged during gorbachevs visit and 
possibly lead to the establishment of full diplomatic relations 
church officials say

six months after the death of ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini old taboos are breaking down in iran a heady 
whiff of social and religious tolerance is in the air 
but president hashemi rafsanjani leader of the socalled 
pragmatists treads gingerly between preserving khomeinis legacy 
of islamic values and opening up the country after a decade of 
turmoil 
revolutionary radicals are already complaining that the strict 
islamic decrees imposed by khomeini the imam or holy leader 
are being shunted aside by rafsanjani 
the complaints multiply as revolutionary fervor cools amid a 
palpable relaxation of the old shiboleths ranging from rejection of 
the west particularly the united states to a puritanical 
interpretation of islamic tenets including a strict dress code for 
women 
the creeping liberalization that followed khomeinis death june

instead of worrying about hejab the mullahs ought to concern 
themselves more about high prices food shortages hoarding and 
profiteering said farahnaz emani a middleage housewife 
she was standing in line with a couple of hundred other women in 
hejabrequired chadors outside a vegetable market to buy potatoes 
which overnight became scarce when retailers seeking higher 
prices withdrew them from the market 
my children are waiting at home to be fed and ive already 
spent eight hours in this line she complained if its not 
potatoes theres a shortage of sugar or rice all sorts of other 
things that disappear overnight from the market 
the newspaper ettelaat said the potato shortage had become a 
test of strength between the government and the middlemen 
it suggested that irans security agencies should go after 
hoarders and their secret warehouses instead of hunting foreign 
spies 
basic foods and some other commodities are rationed and heavily 
subsidized ensuring that at least some necessities are available 
at reasonable prices 
additional supplies can be had at vastly inflated prices on an 
officially tolerated black market but goods sold there are beyond 
the reach of many iranians 
shops are well stocked following the lifting of import 
restrictions the cost of some of goods has been reduced by as much 
as onethird because of more liberal exchange controls 
but the average wage comes to less than 200 a month and many 
iranians with families are forced to find second and third jobs 
inflation is officially pegged at 30 percent but diplomats 
estimate it is more than double that 
in the majlis the 270member parliament deputy abutaleb 
mahmoodi declared recently the experience of the past 10 years 
has made it clear that state control of the economy resulted in 
nothing but considerable losses hardship for the poor people and 
rampant inflation 
one should not talk about the revolution being lost as soon as 
there is discussion about using foreign resources for modernization 
and investment he said 
rafsanjani has said irans nationalized industries are running 
at only 30 percent of capacity because of shortages of raw 
materials and spare parts as well as a decade of inefficient 
management 
but another imperative is behind the drive to revive the economy 
irans population is mushrooming the birth rate is around 35 
percent a year one of the highest in the world 
by the year 2010 its population will have doubled from the 
present 140 million and economic decisions must be made now to 
avoid castastrophe 20 years hence 
despite the opposition of the radicals rafsanjani will have to 
find solutions quickly 
after 10 years of privation the people are not prepared to 
wait for long said a prominent merchant sipping sweet tea with a 
visitor in his office in tehrans labyrinthine bazaar the 
general trend right now is in favor of rafsanjani if he fails to 
deliver there will be a change 
failure to revive the economy within the next year or two he 
added will be exploited to the fullest by the radicals 
right now the radicals have been eclipsed by rafsanjani and his 
ally ayatollah ali khamenei who pushed through constitutional 
reforms giving the presidency unprecedented power and opening the 
door to a more secular regime 
but the radicals are far from eliminated and rafsanjani seems 
unable to move too precipitately 
in october he hinted iran might be willing to help free western 
hostages held by proiranian moslems in lebanon 
but he had to back off publicly at least a few days later 
under pressure from the radicals who accused him of straying too 
far from khomeinis dictums

a fear is growing among colombians that 
they may lose the war against drug traffickers not through a lack 
of determination but because of a political system they see as 
immature and in its worst crisis ever 
drug traffickers are not the cause of colombias problems 
they are the worst manifestations of a severe political malaise 
said clara lopez a former candidate for mayor of bogota the 
nations capital 
other colombians agree with her view that the government cannot 
defeat drug traffickers and their private armies through military 
confrontation alone 
lopez said the government may be forced to rally more of the 
population to its cause through political reform staunchly 
resisted in the past 
if the government refuses reform she added it could face the 
prospect of a society fatally wounded not by the drug traffickers 
but by its own internal divisions 
lopez was one of the leaders of a splinter faction of the 
liberal party in the early 1980s it was headed by luis carlos 
galan who later returned to the mainstream liberal fold 
a leading candidate for the presidential election set for next 
may galan was assassinated by drug traffickers aug 18 a deed 
that prompted president virgilio barco to declare allout war on 
the drug cartels 
lopez and other politicians of similar view maintain that while 
colombias two main parties the liberals and the conservatives 
are going after traffickers they have failed to attack the roots 
of the countrys problems 
among these problems they say is a failure to encourage the 
participation in the political process of many sectors of society 
according to the tourist guides colombia is a democracy but 
the reality is quite different lopez said in an interview 
she was referring to a small class of elites that has held power 
for generations over a mass of politically and economically 
dispossessed 
in bogota officials in luxury automobiles surrounded by 
machineguntoting outriders make the daily trip into bogota from 
the wealthy northern neighborhoods weaving around urban buses 
packed with tired perspiring people from the southern part of the 
city 
the scene in bogotas traffic symbolizes what many see as the 
alienation of the people from their government not just in bogota 
but in cities and rural sections across the country 
in many cases people simply dont consider the possiblity that 
that they have a right to determine the future of their 
communities said kathy gladden a us anthropologist who has 
studied the organization of garment workers in colombia 
lopez said the government for example has not given community 
councils a say in how tax money should be spent 
we have the power to change the names of public parks and 
plazas but thats about it she said 
the domination of the system by the two mainstream parties has 
frustrated many colombians and forced them to turn to political 
violence she said 
the fate of the 4yearold leftist patriotic union party is 
indicative of the perils of trying to work within the system 
rightwing death squads have killed 737 of the partys members 
also threatening the countrys stability along with the drug 
traffickers are six leftist guerrilla groups 
javier torres a professor of political science at the los andes 
university in bogota also contends a democratic opening is 
necessary to prevent further fragmentation of colombian society 
he said each of the 13 presidential candidates whose views 
range from left to right probably would carry on some sort of 
reform program as president but he added the reforms may not be 
enough or be the ones needed the most 
barco is to turn the presidency over to the winner on aug 7 he 
is forbidden by the constitution from running for another fouryear 
term 
torres said that colombian politicians wary of destabilizing 
the accepted order have traditionally taken a cautious approach to 
reforms and that the trend is likely to continue 
he said the more conservative candidates like hernando duran 
dussan a former bogota mayor would concentrate on improving the 
countrys industrial sector while moving very slowly to encourage 
greater political participation 
duran dussan the epitome of the liberal partys old guard and 
regarded as a hardliner is one of the three frontrunners in the 
campaign 
the other two cesar gaviria and ernesto samper are also 
members of the liberal party but they represent a younger 
generation that is perhaps more open to reform 
the conservative party weakened by internal division is given 
little chance of winning in may 
torres said that while the barco administration instituted some 
important changes such as the popular election of mayors it has 
not responded to demands for the election of governors or for other 
reforms 
critics say the reforms needed most to keep the country from 
exploding are a more efficient justice system government financing 
of presidential campaigns the election of governors a strict 
accounting of government spending land reform and more local 
government autonomy 
in the current judicial setup judges lack the autonomy to 
direct criminal investigations and prosecutions and must seek the 
cooperation of political appointees 
investigations are often determined by political interests 
and it is in the governments interest to keep things that way 
torres said 
lopez the former mayoral candidate pointed to the scores of 
judges slain in recent years as an indication societal tension has 
risen to an intolerable point drastic reform is needed to prevent 
an even bigger bloodbath she said 
right now standing still in this country is the same as moving 
backward she said if our next government is reactionary 
civil war will break out in colombia 
it would not be the first time the killing in 1948 of jorge 
eliecer gaitan who was seen as a progressive leader frustrated 
colombians hopes for change and started a war called the 
violence more than 250000 people were killed from 1948 to 1953 
according to lopez the government best equipped to avoid a 
repetition of the violence would be headed by someone who is 
willing to change the system and is supported by a coalition of 
reformists from both parties 
at national university in bogota professor pilar gaitan said 
the election of a hardliner would result in a repressive 
administration but she added that a large segment of colombian 
society views an authoritarian approach as the only way to solve 
the countrys problems 
many people faced with such a deep crisis have moved to the 
far right she said

blacks have been appearing in mainstream movies 
ever since erich von stroheim first employed black actors in 1928 
in the wedding march until then black characters were played 
by whites in blackface 
but the black characters hollywood wrote into scripts were 
always servants buffoons or evil rapists who could barely speak 
english 
as a reaction to this racial discrimination blacks from the 
very earliest days of the motion picture were producers and 
directors and owned their own film companies 
some treasures of early black cinema are now featured on a 
onehour cassette from vci home video the compilation of rare and 
historic footage comes from the black cinema collection of the 
southwest filmvideo archieves in tyler texas 
the collection of 22 allblack movies from the 1930s and 40s 
was discovered in a warehouse in 1983 the 35mm nitrate prints were 
deteriorating in most cases but were the last copies of the 
movies which depicted the reality of black life as opposed to the 
hollywood stereotypes 
in the earliest days of the motion picture black characters 
were portrayed in hollywood movies as emblems of depravity 
especially in terms of sexuality with talkies blacks became the 
quintessence of song and dance cast primarily as preachers 
servants or clowns in more modern times and even today many 
white filmmakers continue to see blacks in those ways 
independent black filmmakers emerged in the 1920s and showed 
features that reflected black life the middle and uppermiddle 
class black entrepreneurs scientists gangsters entertainers 
educators scholars lawyers beauty queens cohesive families 
more than 100 black film companies made lowbudget primarily 
bmovies for black theaters the most notable filmmakers of this 
time included noble and george johnson and oscar micheaux who made 
paul robesons first movie body and soul in 1924 
scenes from body and soul are featured on the video as are 
boogie woogie dream lena hornes first movie short rufus 
jones for president in which an 8yearold sammy davis jr 
dances and st louis blues with bessie smith 
thats black entertainment will be available on vhs for sale 
or rental beginning jan 30 the suggested retail price is 2995

imagine a pimple growing into a head but not just any head a 
replica of your own head only it has a mind of its own and a lust 
for power 
dennis bagley richard e grant one of the ad worlds leading 
stars finally meets his waterloo when hes given a pimple cream 
account he just cant seem to master it he cant come up with an 
idea or campaign thats when his zit appears 
soon it winks at him then it turns into a talking head bagley 
blames the evil advertising world on his problem and resolves to 
divest himself of all commercialism and tell the world about how 
advertising dupes the public 
the pimple though will have none of that dogoodism and 
honesty it wants to fill every home with products and items that 
no one really needs or wants 
the battle of the heads in how to get ahead in advertising 
is curious bizarre and at times distasteful the plot becomes

clarinet amaury wallez bassoon andre cazalet horn 
 
london straddles two worlds in its recent chamber music 
releases from the slavicized germanic tradition of dohnanyi to 
poulencs gallic charm and incision this compact disc exhibits the 
bulk of the latters chamber works for winds the bigboned sextet 
sometimes similar sounding sonatas for clarinet flute and oboe 
and the captivating trio for oboe bassoon and piano 
we hear an idiomatic interpretation of quintessential french 
music recorded in paris these players bring the expected high 
level of windplaying of poulencs country folk always smooth and 
never less than tasteful they sometimes reach the level of 
blandness in the sextet 
roge should be commended for his light airy playuing and 
attention to detail bourgue stands out among the winds 
particularly for his singing lines

cindy bullens mca cindy bullens 
 
the guitarbased poprock of cindy bullens will sound familiar 
to anyone who has heard the guitarbased poprock of bryan adams 
but while cindy bullens loses points for lack of 
originality the album gets high marks as a collection of tough but 
catchy songs with plenty of energy and fine singing theres enough 
variety to sustain interest too from the ballad letters of 
fire to the thundering cry for love and the rampbstyled 
where did i hide my heart 
coproducer bob clearmountain whose credits include adams and 
tina turner comes up with a mix thats clean but still has plenty 
of crunch much of it contributed by guitarist david mansfield 
adams himself helps out by singing harmony on one cut 
bullens closest brush with fame has been as a backup vocalist 
for elton john she sings much of the time like chrissie hynde or 
pat benatar and its clear shes still looking for a distinctive 
sound its just as clear she has the talent to find it

do i ever shut up jack lemmon muses 
im good for 20 minutes on hello 
how true how true lemmon in high gear can make shelley winters 
seem like a wallflower but through all the tumbling syntax comes 
the picture of a man fiercely dedicated to his art yet modest about 
calling it that 
the thing to remember about jack lemmon is that he is a harvard 
man born to eastern wealth and raised with values that might seem 
alien in anarchic hollywood he is driven in the search for 
perfection and on a number of occasions he has achieved it 
although opinion was divided on his latest movie dad most 
critics agreed lemmon was perfect in the role of the doddering 
oldster whose life is suddenly rejuvenated the movie also stars 
ted danson as the neglectful son and olympia dukakis as the 
domineering wife 
one sees a different lemmon in dad he is bald wrinkled 
frail and forgetful he gives credit for much of his transformation 
to makeup wizard dick smith with whom lemmon worked in the 
prehistoric days of live television 
after three hours in the makeup chair lemmon looked at himself 
in the mirror and exclaimed my god i hope i live long enough to 
look like this 
i thought i was 100 years old recalled the actor in a 
recent interview i was thrilled what it did very rapidly 
through rehearsals and through the early days of shooting it gave 
me a shell to kind of crawl into aside from being a great makeup 
job that was convincing from the neck up i found myself making the 
rest of my body catch up to it even unconsciously 
the one thing as an actor you dont want to do is try to be 
conscious while youre playing a scene as someone whos just 
behaving i dont want to be thinking about moving slowly bending 
over shrinking all of that it should become second nature 
because of the makeup and working with it during rehearsal i was 
able to do the role without thinking about it 
lemmons preparation also included studying the elderly thats 
a device that goes back to his early career 
when i was a kid just out of college and couldnt even get 
into a agents office in new york id put a nickle in the subway 
those were the days and just spend my time riding the subway 
passing time looking at people he recalled i tried to guess 
what they did what their background was watch their eyes their 
movements 
even back then i can remember noticing old people and seeing 
the ones where the light had gone it was just gone i remember 
thinking then theyre not living theyre existing it was 
something that really applied to this character in dad in 
parts of the film when he has been so dominated he is like a 
bellboy he even walks behind her 
lemmon was still immersed in the portrayal when he reported for 
a play in london i was playing my own age 64 a volatile guy 
man hes like a firecracker he said for the first week of 
rehearsals they were petrified id say lets go play tennis 
and i sounded like i was 101 i was still walking all bent over 
and i didnt even know it 
the distant fatherson relationship in dad differed from his 
own lemmon observed 
i had a terrific relationship with my father but i was well 
into my 30s before i realized it was nowhere near as full as it 
could be he said i was an only child and i always thought we 
were very close i loved him and i knew he loved me 
once my career was really going well i suddenly realized 
youre much more relaxed with your dad you seem to be having more 
fun with him i wonder why that is in retrospect i thought back 
and realized that i no longer had to prove myself i had been as 
long as i could remember it was not something he imposed it was 
something i automatically did 
the elder lemmon was president of a baking company and jack 
realizes his father would have liked his son to follow in the 
business 
but i got the acting bug when i was eight or nine and i 
started in summer stock in my late teens lemmon said by the 
time i finished college i was ready to go down to new york and 
save the american theater i needed to borrow some money from my 
father i told him i wanted to borrow 300 bucks 
he asked me do you really love acting i said yes as 
little as ive done i know i love it he said well good 
because the day that i dont find romance in a loaf of bread ill 
quit 
lemmon starved a little in new york before finding work in 
television that led him to hollywood where his fourth film 
mister roberts won him an academy award for supporting actor 
in 1955 the best actor award came with save the tiger in 1973 
critics have predicted another nomination for dad 
once i got into live tv in my late 20s there has never been a 
serious drop when id have to make a comeback he said we all 
make bad films they misjudge and you misjudge that happens more 
often than the hits 
but i have been able to get films that have worked not only 
at the box office but critically and with the public often enough 
so that im still around and i can still get some wonderful parts 
thank god you cant get a better part than the one i just had in 
dad

at the pull of a lever his head went down 
and he began to scroll he finished a slightly naughty little poem 
in french making sure to dot the is and cross the ts 
and looked up with an impish grin 
he is an automaton a sophisticated nearly 200yearold toy on 
display at the franklin institute in philadelphia he is a 
curiosity in art and mechanics 
wearing a red satin hat and jacket with a white ruffled collar 
he kneels at a brass writing table poised to entertain his guests 
his brain is in brass cams and clockwork motors in a large 
chest underneath the table 
the automaton writes poems in elegant fluid script and 
surrounds them with ornate borders translated from the french into 
english one of the fourline poems goes like this 
a child by ladies adored 
i am throughout all lands 
in great good favor with women 
and also with husbands 
the automaton knows three poems two in french and one in 
english he also draws adding intricate detail down to the needles 
on fir trees outside a chinese temple and the lines on a sailing 
ship two other drawings are of cupid and his love birds 
the little mechanical boy is lifelike in an eerie sort of way 
and his poems and drawings look too smooth to have been done by a 
machine 
charles penniman jr has been father to the automaton since 
he began to work at the franklin institute 17 years ago his pride 
shows as he pulls the levers that put the little boy into action 
hes naughty said penniman an episcopal priest and 
secretary of the institutes committee on science and the arts 
hes a bad little boy and hes so damn clever 
harry bolick a graduate student of architecture at the 
university of pennsylvania came to the institute to see the 
automaton and was fascinated by the machines writing skills 
im surprised by the fluidity bolick said i expected it 
to be digital like a computer but its very very refined its 
swiss engineering at its best 
the automaton was built in london around 1800 by henri 
maillardet a member of a swiss family of clockmakers penniman 
said the device reflects the fascination with machines during the 
enlightenment when clocks music boxes and mechanical toys were 
the rage 
maillardet made several other automatons but only one other that 
could write that one wrote in chinese and was made for the emperor 
of china as a gift from king george iii of england it is now part 
of a beijing museum collection 
penniman said some automatons were made as toys for the rich and 
the nobility others like the philadelphia automaton were made 
for what he called the gee whiz market and ended up in circus 
or carnival exhibitions 
the institutes automaton was among those exhibited around the 
united states by a french showman named maelzel at some point it 
was acquired by the family of john penn brock a philadelphia 
lawyer whose children gave the automaton to the institute in 1928 
at that time it was thought to have been built by maelzel 
the automaton had been damaged in a fire and was inoperable 
penniman said it was not until 1934 that an institute machinist 
halsey t roberts got the mechanical boy writing again 
when the automaton was turned on for the first time he revealed 
the name of his creator he wrote a poem in french and then signed 
ecrit par lautomate de maillardet written by the automaton of 
maillardet 
the automaton was first exhibited in 1936 dressed as a girl but 
pennimans research showed the automaton originally had been a boy 
he designed new clothing for him based on a picture he found in an 
english magazine published in 1826 and also carved new wooden feet 
for him the automaton has been exhibited as a boy since 1983 
the automaton draws with a felttip pen penniman does not know 
what was originally used but said an encyclopedia article referred 
to the automaton dipping a pen into an ink well 
the toy also has the largest mechanical memory of any machine 
ever constructed its memory is in cams about 90 brass discs 
visible through the glass in the chest under the writing table 
the cams are turned by a clockwork motor and three steel 
fingers follow the irregular edges translating the undulations 
into movements of the automatons writing hand

you can always judge a tears for fears record by 
its cover the anguished child on the sleeve of the hurting 
the conventional headshot for the multiplatinum songs from the 
big chair and the psychedelic design on their new album the 
seeds of love 
we wanted it to be a photograph that looked like a painting 
band member curt smith said of the records colorful sleeve 
reminiscent of the beatles sgt pepper and other covers from 
the summer of love 
we want listeners to wonder whats real and not real whats 
painted and what isnt we also want to portray the fact that this 
album was very different from the last one he said 
smith and roland orzabel waited four years to release the 
followup to songs from the big chair a potentially disastrous 
move in an industry that can change completely in a matter of 
months 
they tried recording songs not unlike the formula pop of their 
no 1 singles shout and everybody wants to rule the world 
but smith and orzabel quickly scrapped the material eventually 
fans stopped asking about a new record 
people forgot about us which was what we wanted smith 
said we could be left alone without any pressure to make music 
we wanted it to be new fresh and we were basically bored with what 
we had the record company polygram was a bit edgy but what were 
they going to do sue us 
american music jazz rhythm n blues gospel influenced 
tears for fears so did the harmonies and orchestras of the 
beatles psychedelic era the title track of the seeds of love 
opens with the droning chords of i am the walrus contains a 
message similar to all you need is love and in true beatles 
style reached the top 5 on the singles charts 
we were tempted to ask george martin the beatles old 
producer to work on the record but that was a bit too much 
smith said neither of us own beatles records we just picked the 
parts we remember being on them cellos highly compressed vocals 
and orchestras 
no one would confuse these intense young pop stars with the 
grinning mop tops of the beatles early days or the spaced out 
acidheads of sgt pepper consider famous last words a 
couples last night before a nuclear holocaust 
its about the acceptance of mortality making the most of 
what you have now make your life worth something now smith said 
its not just making a record its making a contribution to 
the future even though well be gone people will still be around 
were not the kind of people that just accept whats going on in 
the world 
only in their late 20s and already theyre pondering mortality 
smith insists he and orzabel have been that way most of their lives 
we did get accused of being too advanced for our years 
shouldnt be talking about those subjects theyre far too serious 
for people your age your need is when your body tells you the 
realization of having problems is important you can avoid allowing 
them to mount up by getting rid of the other ones he said 
they met 15 years ago joining a band when they were teenagers 
five years later they chose music over school putting out their 
first record the hurting in 1982 the title was appropriate 
for these two precise musicians acts of immaturity are still 
difficult to think about 
i remember nothing but that being a painful experience 
smith said the mistake of having two producers which meant that 
it was two against two me and roland would fight with the 
producers and get nowhere 
we were ridiculously precious about the record we wouldnt 
use guitars we were a modern band the stupidity of working the 
hours we did four in the morning five in the morning the lack of 
respect for our own bodies all the things we went on to correct 
they wanted their next record to be better and more commercial 
something worked songs from the big chair sold more than 9 
million copies 
it was obvious smith said shout and everybody 
theyre obvious songs you can listen and go yeah its a 
commercial song people are going to be singing this tomorrow 
it was much better than the first record we tried to make a 
commercial album and thats what we did consciously we thought 
we would use these obvious devices we wanted to relax doing it we 
didnt want to be overly precious 
control is the key when to have it when to let it go on 
the seeds of love the voices of smith and orzabel are almost 
lost under all those guitars orchestras and backing harmonies 
smith worried they were overdoing it then reconsidered 
there is a nagging in the back of your head dont get 
overindulgent but overindulgent is pretty much the way we are in 
whatever we do he said 
i do think we like to put a lot of care time and attention 
into doing it it means something to us wed like our records to 
be interesting thoughtprovoking different experimental

flann obrien was a comically anarchic 
novelist myles na gcopaleen was the toast of literary dublin for 
his columns in the irish times brian onolan excivil servant 
was an embittered drunk 
each was an aspect of one man whose appearance in the words of 
biographer anthony cronin combined elements of the priest the 
babyfaced chicago gangster the petty bourgeois malt drinker and 
the dublin literary gent 
in the recently published no laughing matter the life and 
times of flann obrien cronin fleshes out a profile sketched 13 
years ago in dead as doornails a chronicle of literary dublin 
and the alcoholic corrosion of geniuses such as onolan brendan 
behan and patrick kavanagh 
brian onolan was the real name but cronin put flann obrien in 
the title because this was the internationally famous author of a 
few dazzling books atswimtwobirds the third policeman 
the hard life and the dalkey archive 
to his drinking companions onolan was always myles the 
columnist who spun elaborate setups to puns such as dogging a 
fled horse conversed with the plain people of ireland and 
devised the book handling service to provide lovingly thumbed 
volumes for the pretentious illiterate 
taking on the thooleramawns gawshkogues pultogues thullabawns 
and turnipsnaggers he detected in the body politic na gcopaleen 
once devoted the best part of a year to berating the lord mayor for 
the stopped clock above his shop and attacked a tourism promotion 
as a plot to litter ireland with the scruff and sweepings of 
britain and america 
to patrick kavanagh he was that poor little na gcopaleen a 
genius who had just missed brilliance onolan who sneered at 
penniless bohemians and was scrupulous about buying his round 
growled about kavanagh as the monaghan toucher 
the times of flann obrien in cronins view were dreary years 
in a newly independent nation governed by politicians still 
mouthing the pieties of nationalism and revolution 
it was also precisely because of the official hypocrisy and 
the narrowness and awfulness of the official outlook there was a 
good deal of anarchism in which one could luxuriate we were 
agin everything but everything and we were rightly agin 
everything said cronin now so respectable that prime minister 
charles haughey attended the publication party 
onolans father was a british civil servant but an irish 
nationalist who spoke only gaelic at home onolan and his brothers 
were educated at home until he was 11 when he was subjected to the 
bruising discipline of a christian brothers school in dublin an 
encounter that cronin believes left lasting scars 
though they were not by any means uniformly savage the worst 
of them were scarcely human at all onolan wrote of his teachers 
years later 
he became a published author at age 28 with 
atswimtwobirds a novel within a novel in which the 
characters attempt to murder the author 
perhaps 250 copies were sold before stocks were wiped out by 
german bombs on publishers row in london onolans second novel 
the third policeman was rejected and there were no more flann 
obrien books until the hard life in 1961 
onolan entertained wholly unwarranted hopes that the hard 
life would be banned in ireland the mere name of father kurt 
fahrt sj will justify the thunderclap he told a friend 
in 1940 onolan began writing the cruiskeen lawn column in 
the irish times as myles na gcopaleen the g before the capital c 
being the eclipsis which the genitive case demands cronin 
helpfully explains later streamlined to na gopaleen 
the same pseudonym was used for his only book in gaelic an 
beal bocht the poor mouth published in 1941 
cronin considers atswimtwo birds onolans best book but 
everyone even the author saw the influence of james joyce 
joyce was a hell of a problem to him cronin said because 
joyce had used all of onolans life material the very streets 
through which he walked the institutions he attended the kind of 
people he was brought up among the catholic religion 
onolan was eager to have the great exile read 
atswimtwobirds but dismissive when told of joyces praise 
in 1954 onolan organized the first bloomsday tour of all the 
places mentioned in ulysses and on the same day myles na 
gcopaleen attacked joyce as an illiterate whose every foreign 
language quotation was incorrect 
the republication of atswimtwobirds in 1960 brought 
onolan international acclaim but by then he had lost his job his 
columns were increasingly bitter and he was customarily sozzled for 
the day by 3 pm 
his life story was clouded with lies about the number of books 
he had written about a tragically brief marriage in germany or a 
trip to paris to visit joyce 
i found him fascinating but then i dont separate the man 
from the work in that way that other people with less sense of the 
work find themselves able to do said cronin 
i wasnt able to separate that feeling from being in the 
physical presence of the man 
on his only appearance on television in 1963 onolan brusquely 
refused to talk about at swimtwobirds and began expounding 
on his current obsession with the notion that st augustine might 
have been black 
he was not sober cronin said but this might not have 
mattered except that he had half a bottle of whiskey carelessly 
stuffed into the pocket of his jacket and at a certain point the 
neck of this began to protrude so we were cut off rather 
hurriedly 
onolan died on april 1 1966 a month earlier he wrote in his 
column that anyone who has the courage to raise his eyes and look 
sanely at the awful human condition must realize finally that 
tiny periods of temporary release from intolerable suffering is the 
most that any individual has the right to expect

after 10 years singer ronnie mcdowell 
has finally accepted his role as the voice of elvis 
until recently the 39yearold country music performer has 
reluctantly used his voice as an elvis presley impersonation in 
various tv shows and movies but now hes set aside criticism that 
he is just a presley impersonator taking advantage of a dead 
entertainer these days hes embraced the part as presleys 
soundalike and made it a main segment of his career 
mcdowells singing voice will be used on the forthcoming tv 
series elvis aron presley with michael st gerard as presley 
mcdowell also was the singing voice of presley in the 1988 
miniseries elvis and me 
in 1979 he was presleys voice on 36 songs in the kurt russell 
tv movie elvis in 1984 he was presleys singing voice for 
another tv movie elvis and the beauty queen starring don 
johnson as presley 
for the big screen mcdowell sang presley songs for the movies 
sweet dreams starring jessica lange and breathless starring 
richard gere 
mcdowells presley connection began when he cowrote and 
recorded the song the king is dead the day presley died in 
1977 the song was a hit and mcdowell became a quick celebrity 
because of the record and because he sounded so much like presley 
but in the years following he found that his presleylike voice 
hindered his own identity as a performer he became known more for 
sounding like presley than for his own records 
now hes decided the presley connection is a blessing 
i guess because im getting older i dont mind the 
association mcdowell said in an interview i think back to 
when i was a kid this was a guy presley i really admired 
i feel i should be more honored than disgruntled about it 
ive decided to embrace it and have fun with it because i do my 
own thing too 
mcdowell who never met presley has had a steady career as a 
country singer he has released 18 albums and had no 1 hits with 
older women and youre gonna ruin my bad reputation 
in october he released country musics first animated music 
video american music which included cartoon characters much 
like the movie who framed roger rabbit 
mcdowell also does imitations of country stars johnny cash 
marty robbins and ernest tubb and jazz great louis armstrong 
elvis is the one the people want to hear he said i do 
marty robbins or johnny cash equally as well but its always do 
elvis 
when i was a little boy growing up in portland tennessee 
id listen to the grand ole opry on radio and i tried to emulate 
everybody i heard i got to the point i could sound like anybody 
and elvis came easier to me for some reason 
mcdowell was earning 237 a week as a lounge singer in bowling 
green ky when he recorded the king is gone spending 2800 
of his own money to make the record within weeks he was doing 
concerts that grossed 40000 but he actually made less than 
expected off the record because of business failures by companies 
associated with it media accounts have said the record sold 3 
million but mcdowell believes it was closer to 5 million 
the song will be revived on a best of ronnie mcdowell album 
due out soon 
mcdowell also has been told that some of his versions of presley 
songs will be included in a forthcoming album of music by the 
king of rock n roll 
this is probably the peak of anything ill ever do what a 
thrill this is for me

more than 1000 schools have signed threeyear 
contracts to receive the commerciallysponsored channel one daily 
news show for the classroom that debuts in march whittle 
communications said 
the 1050 signups have already exceeded whittles startup target 
of having 1000 schools participating in the service by the launch 
date 
channel one will provide daily 12minute news programs geared 
toward teens that are to be shown in classrooms during the school 
day 
the news shows also will include two minutes of paid advertising 
for products such as candy bars and deodorant the commercials have 
triggered outcries from some national education groups and state 
education officials in california and new york state who say it is 
wrong to permit companies to pitch products to a captive audience 
of students 
several cable networks have tailored commercialfree programs to 
the school audience notably turner broadcasting systems incs 
cable news network which is airing a daily 15minute news show 
overnight to be taped for use in the classroom 
but schools participating in channel one receive free equipment 
as well as programming each is given dozens of television 
monitors a satellite dish and videocassette recorders that whittle 
says would cost them 40000 to 50000 if they bought them on 
their own 
the shows are transmitted overnight to the schools for replay on 
the monitors during the school day 
whittle chairman christopher whittle said in a statement sunday 
the schools signed up to date are in 29 states including seven of 
the 10 largest and have 739000 students 
he said his sales people have approached officials in 1740 
school districts and that 440 have signed up while 221 have 
rejected the service outright talks are continuing with the other 
districts and whittle hopes to offer the service to schools in all 
50 states 
he said he is confident that the project will meet its goal of 
having 7000 to 8000 schools with an enrollment of 6 million 
students participating by the end of 1990 
whittle previously said that he has signed up advertisers who 
have committed about 50 million for the first year of the service 
and nearly 150 million for the first three years

great northern nekoosa corp has agreed to hold a 
special meeting of its directors to discuss an offer by 
georgiapacific corp to increase its unwanted bid to buy the paper 
company 
georgiapacific on sunday raised its cash offer for great 
northerns outstanding shares from 58 a share or a total of about 
31 billion to 63 or a total of 36 billion great northern 
has consistently rejected the takeover attempt 
the new bid was contained in a letter from georgiapacific 
chairman t marshall hahn jr that was delivered sunday to great 
northern chairman william r laidig the offer represents a 63 
percent premium above great northerns share price prior to 
georgiapacifics original buyout offer of oct 31 georgiapacific 
said 
great northern shares closed friday at 61 down 125 cents in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading 
great northern a paper products company based in norwalk 
conn had said the original offer was too low possibly illegal 
and held the potential for a disastrous debt load on the combined 
company 
hahn also demanded a special meeting of great northern 
shareholders and urged laidig to meet with him personally to 
discuss the proposal 
we are prepared to consider an additional increase in price if 
you come to the negotiating table early and demonstrate to our 
satisfaction that greater value exists he wrote in the letter 
which was disclosed by georgiapacific 
great northern officials issued a statement later sunday saying 
they would hold a special meeting of the companys directors 
tuesday to consider and review the terms of the revised 
georgiapacific offer 
georgiapacific spokeswoman gail smith reading from a 
statement said the giant atlantabased forest products company 
was pleased that theyre acting so expeditiously we are hopeful 
they will exercise their fiduciary responsibility and respond 
positively to our very attractive offer 
also sunday georgiapacific extended the nov 29 expiration 
deadline for its offer to midnight dec 4 
hahn said in his letter that great northerns contention that 
the takeover would subject the company to excessive debt was 
groundless he said the 38 billion in incremental debt required 
to finance the offer could be handled by the combined company 
without a restructuring or loss of jobs 
in fact the combined company will be stronger and better able 
to meet the challenges of our industry provide jobs and compete in 
the global marketplace than our two companies continuing on a 
standalone basis he wrote 
the move sunday came after great northern in an effort to 
derail the takeover asked the federal energy regulatory commission 
to force georgiapacific to obtain ferc approval before it could 
acquire any of great northerns hydroelectric project licenses in 
maine 
great northern also asked ferc to intervene in georgiapacifics 
pending hydroelectric license proceeding for its mill in gilman 
vt because the merger could affect the supply of power in the 
northeast 
great northern officials said they made the request so the 
commission would recognize anticompetitive effects of the 
proposed merger 
the merger if successful would be among the largest in the 
62year history of georgia pacific 
we intend to acquire great northern and to make the 
combination work hahn wrote in his letter 
georgiapacific which employs 44000 people had revenue of 
95 billion last year from sales of paper other forest products 
and building materials great northern with 20000 workers and 
1988 sales of 36 billion makes paper cardboard and envelopes

turf battles over regulating new financial 
products are hurting us chances to compete in the global market 
says securities and exchange commission chairman richard c 
breeden and if they dont stop we had all better start learning 
to speak japanese 
while us regulators squabble over hybrid financial instruments 
that have elements of both securities and futures contracts 
foreign markets are copying them and trading them breeden told a 
group of securities lawyers 
the protracted turf battles may be good for lawyers it may 
not be quite so good for the united states in facing international 
competition breeden said in a speech friday night to the 
american bar associations committee on federal regulation of 
securities 
americans may find themselves competing against those who have 
an established market share in a product we invented by the time we 
get out of the courthouse breeden cautioned 
the united states must develop the regulatory system that can 
accommodate innovation efficiently he said 
and ladies and gentlemen if we dont then we all had better 
start learning to speak japanese breeden told the gathering 
he called for a system of anything goes when a product has 
elements of both securities and futures 
if we license it on a securities exchange so be it well 
regulate it if the same product is licensed on a futures exchange 
so be it let it be traded there and regulated there and lets get 
out of the courthouse and back into the business of competing 
said breeden 
on another topic breeden said deregulation of the securities 
industry should be a twoway street for banks and securities firms 
he said if people want congress to modify the 1933 
glasssteagall act which bars banks from the securities business 
they also should expect congress to modify the 1956 bank holding 
company act which keeps securities and insurance firms out of 
banking 
if were going to be in the business of demolishing 
barriers said breeden who has said he favors eliminating those 
barriers were going to need to demolish them in both directions 
simultaneously and make sure we try and create equal competitive 
opportunities both theoretically and practically for everybody 
in the marketplace 
breeden also repeated his call for more funding for the sec and 
higher pay for its staff 
he said some of the money the sec raises for the government 
should be used to fund the sec where a starting lawyer makes only 
27500 a year well below the private sector and even lower than 
most other federal financial agencies 
they charge fees and they use the fee income to support their 
operations we charge fees and our fees support dairy prices and 
medicaid programs he joked adding somewhere there is a 
squadron of f15s which have been purchased with the surplus fees 
generated by the securities and exchange commission 
it was one of his first public addresses since taking over the 
sec chairmanship last month 
breeden said an appeals court decision in chicago this summer 
in which the sec was on the losing side of a jurisdictional battle 
had most ominous implications 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals held that the sec 
overstepped itself in authorizing three securities exchanges in 
new york philadelphia and chicago to trade in a hybrid instrument 
known as a stock basket 
technically called an index participation the product 
resembles a basket of stocks because it allowed investors to buy or 
sell something with a value tied to broad stock market indexes 
such as the standard amp poors 500 
but the appeals court held that the new financial instruments 
contained enough elements of a futures contract that they should be 
regulated by the commodity futures trading commission 
were never going to get rid of jurisdictional overlap said 
breeden were never going to get rid of all the litigation but 
do we want to be a nation of financial markets or do we want to be 
a nation of financial lawyers in courthouses

shoppers in search of holiday gifts for little 
ones should be on guard because potentially dangerous toys and 
childrens items are more readily available than ever a consumer 
group said today 
there are so many hazardous products on the market for children 
that toy safety has become a contradiction in terms according 
to the 18th annual toy quality and safety report of the consumer 
affairs committee of americans for democratic action 
the committee said it was inundated by potentially dangerous 
toys and blamed the pitiful ineptitude of the consumer product 
safety commission for the availability of dangerous toys 
in past years the commission only played dead this year it 
was officially dead said the report citing the panels lack of 
a quorum since january which makes it unable to take official 
actions 
additionally bottomline considerations have outdistanced 
safety considerations by toy makers said ann brown committee 
chairwoman 
dan rumelt of the cpsc said agency officials were unable to 
comment on the criticisms because they had not seen the report 
the report which previously focused on toys this year includes 
infant and childrens products because they are inextricably 
linked and it just became too dangerous to ignore said brown 
the group recommends from among this years heavily advertised 
toys 10 products for the toy box and an equal number for the 
trash box the committee also cites 13 toys a bakers dirty 
dozen of the most potentially dangerous toys from the 51 
surveyed 
bob jacobs president of aqua sling whose water balloon 
slingshot is among the groups dirty dozen said most of the 
problems associated with the product were related to user 
responsibility 
we havent had anybody hurt by the product everybody thats 
had any problems with it has been with misuse of the product 
said the california businessman the report said hundreds of people 
had been injured after being struck by water balloons fired by the 
slingshots 
an executive at lewis galoob toys inc said the company was 
unaware of any safety concerns with its bouncin babies cuddly baby 
doll that also was listed among 1989s worst toys the ada report 
said the toy has a pacifier with a stick that could poke a childs 
eye 
its a design that works and kids seem to enjoy it and it 
meets all safety regulations said stan clutton vice president 
for marketing at lewis galoob 
the committee said categories of potentially dangerous toys 
include 
exploding items designed to make loud noises which can be 
damaging to ears or cause hearing loss 
projectiles including a water balloon sling shot that use 
guns or rubber devices to throw items a distance with force 
toys that invite eating because thats what young children will 
do whether edible or not 
inexpensive toys with small parts hazardous to young children 
that are offered near the checkout counter to encourage impulse 
buying 
novelty items such as spraycan party string sold in toy stores 
where unsuspecting kids and parents can buy them emergency 
rooms have reported skin irritation from party string 
toys with inadequate or misleading age labels in some cases 
manufacturers label toys not for children under 3 when they are 
intended to appeal to exactly that age group 
flammable items including a stuffed doll cuddling cushion and 
baby linen set that burns 
poorly made licensed items with familiar childhood and cartoon 
characters 
the report cites cpsc statistics that estimated there were 
142000 toyrelated injuries in 1988 an increase of 11000 
incidents over 1987 nursery productrelated injuries to children 
under 5 totaled 72000 in 1988 according to commission figures 
quoted in the report 
the ada gives parents and child caregivers these safety tips for 
buying toys 
dont trust age recommendations on labeling and packaging 
safe and nontoxic are advertising terms that may be 
meaningless on toy packages 
never leave a child alone near water 
throw away infant pacifiers when the child outgrows them 
avoid excessively noisy toys 
all toys with wheels require adult supervision

in granting themselves a 31000plus pay 
raise house members are agreeing to stop taking 2000 a pop for 
speeches before interest groups and pocketing their campaign 
treasuries when they retire 
but with the other perquisites around capitol hill taxpayers 
can be assured their representatives would not have suffered even 
if they had given up the speeches and political money pots without 
an offsetting raise 
the current salary of 89500 goes pretty far when your 
haircuts gymnasium parking travel meals mail insurance 
retirement and telephone bills are subsidized by the treasury 
consumer advocate ralph nader who believes members of congress 
should be paid about the same as their constituents instead of 
being in the top 1 percent income bracket once portrayed the 
system as imperial legislators with their selfcontained court of 
favors 
with the pay raise the house members beginning in 1991 will 
have to give up the most profitable of those favors the speech 
honoraria many senior lawmakers for years have been padding their 
incomes by up to 30 percent that way 
the senate voted to give itself only a 10 percent pay raise and 
to keep taking the speech money for now the result is that the 
house and senate incomes will remain roughly comparable at more 
than 120000 by 1991 
like executives in the private sector salary is just part of 
the remuneration package 
the national taxpayers union says the new pay package means that 
more than half of the house will be pension millionaires that 
is once the pay hikes take effect they can be expected to collect 
more than 1 million in benefits during their lives 
house speaker thomas s foley could expect to receive a pension 
of 99199 a year 
thats on top of whatever he may have put into the house 401k 
plan a taxdeferred retirement system that many companies make 
available to employees in the private sector 
congress lets its members put away up to 10 percent of their 
incomes and taxpayers match the first 5 percent 
members get health insurance like other federal employees plus 
more personal and immediate attention if they so desire 
the attending physicians office provides doctors nurses and 
technicians who can take xrays dispense drugs give allergy and 
immunization shots and perform other services 
staying in shape is convenient at the senate health club and the 
house gymnasium the senate has an indoor tennis court the house 
has a swimming pool handball volleyball and basketball court and 
a steam room 
members pay half the cost of their 78000 life insurance 
policies 
lawmakers dont get christmas bonuses but they often take 
government or privately financed factfinding trips during the 
holidays 
those inclined toward helping the disadvantaged have visited 
desolate areas of africa sometimes with tragic results such as the 
death earlier this year of rep mickey leland dtexas on an 
airplane flight to a refugee camp 
others have been less inclined to rough it the paris air show 
is one of the annual pilgrimages for many members of congress 
everything around the capitol is geared toward making lawmakers 
feel like they own the place 
the subsidized barber shops and beauty salons cater to their 
needs at discount prices theres a private movie theater and gun 
enthusiasts have access to the capitol police firing range 
works from the national gallery of art decorate their offices 
and the library of congress is at their beck and call 
separate elevators are reserved for members only and although 
most are automatic they carry operators so members dont have to 
push their own buttons 
the restaurants have private dining rooms open to only members 
and their guests if they get tired of the food which is rather 
bland they are allowed to take as many meals as they want from 
lobbyists 
theres talk that many senior house members will retire rather 
than run again in 1992 because after that they will no longer be 
allowed to keep for personal use the money in their campaign 
chests in some cases thats more than 1 million 
but for the most part members of congress run for reelection 
again and again and would have kept doing so even if their 
salaries didnt reach six figures any time soon

the nations only public diamond mine 
which yields about 1400 gems a year to tourists will be opened 
to test drilling by four private mining companies in a plan 
criticized by environmentalists 
the exploratory drilling at crater of diamonds state park could 
lead to commercial mining at the park which presently allows 
anyone with the 3aday price of admission to seek his fortune in 
the soft bluegray soil 
the state parks recreation and travel commission voted 120 in 
favor of the plan thursday if commercially viable deposits are 
found the state could award mining rights to one of the four 
companies cooperating in the test drilling 
the sierra club and the friends of the crater of diamonds oppose 
the plan and have threatened legal action to block the exploratory 
work they say businesses dont belong in state parks and warn the 
drilling could open the way to logging or gravel mining in the area 
the decision to allow exploratory drilling came more than 2 
years after gov bill clintons appointed a diamond mining advisory 
task force to study the prospect of commercial mining at the park 
an advisory team will meet by midjanuary said john morgan a 
consulting engineer who advised the state drilling could begin as 
early as april 
the state got control of the 888acre park in southwestern 
arkansas in 1972 after a private mining company went bankrupt 
visitors are allowed to prospect in a 35acre plowed field and 
its said people have taken away diamonds as large as 40 carats 
about 78000 people try their luck at crater of diamonds each 
year 
an independent contractor selected under state bidding 
procedures will conduct the tests working for the state and the 
four mining companies 
the four companies are kennecott inc of salt lake city

japan and the united states ended three days of 
talks monday on wood products trade without an agreement on 
increasing us lumber exports to japan officials said 
negotiators on both sides agreed the talks were constructive 
and said they had deepened their understanding of each others 
position an official at japans foreign ministry and a us 
embassy official said 
however no agreement was reached on us claims that japan is 
keeping american us wood products out of its markets and 
negotiators agreed to continue talks in december or early next 
year officials said 
the united states claims japan excludes us wood products with 
high duties inscrutable product standards and an agricultural 
grading system that requires testing to be carried out domestically 
even after the products have undergone testing abroad 
during the talks us negotiators asked japan to reclassify 
certain products to enable them to qualify for lower tariff ratings 
and to simplify construction and product standardization 
procedures the us embassy official said 
no agreement was reached on tariff classifications japanese 
officials argued that the standardization procedures were devised 
to fit special japanese conditions a foreign ministry official 
said 
japanese negotiators said japans densely crowded housing and 
frequent earthquakes required special product and construction 
standards the official said 
but he said given these conditions the japanese government 
would like to make its product standardization procedures more 
rational he conceded that existing standards were quite 
difficult to understand 
us lumber exports have been increasing total exports from the 
pacific northwest for instance rose 20 percent last year from 
1987 but more than 70 percent of us wood exports to japan are in 
the form of raw lumber 
united states wants to increase its exports of higher 
valueadded products but us officials say japans intricate 
tariff and nontariff barriers are designed to encourage raw lumber 
imports and to exclude finished products from the japanese market 
both countries are trying to protect their struggling sawmill 
industries officials say privately 
trade in forest products is one of three priority issues singled 
out by the us super 301 clause of the us omnibus trade act 
which requires the us government to retaliate against countries 
which do not open their markets 
japan has until now refused to negotiate on any of the three 
issues supercomputers satellites and forest products while 
under the threat of sanctions

chinas central bank has quietly tightened 
regulations on foreign exchange limiting purchases of foreign 
currency and restricting its sale to those with airline tickets out 
of the country 
the new regulations which come several months after the 
governments crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in the 
nations capital stem the outflow of foreign capital they suggest 
the government could be considering a devaluation of the chinese 
currency but economists in beijing said they doubt that would 
happen in the near future 
under the new restrictions which apply to foreign visitors as 
well as chinese holders of foreign currency certificates can only 
repurchase 50 percent of the amount of foreign currency they 
originally sold a bank of china official said 
anyone who has converted 1000 to foreign exchange 
certificates or fecs can only exchange half that amount back into 
dollars said the official of the banks bank deposit department 
who would not give his name 
customers must also present an airplane ticket proving that they 
need the money because they are going overseas the official said 
they may make deposits to bank of china fec accounts that already 
exist 
customers may also withdraw from their fec accounts in the form 
of checks which can be cashed into foreign currencies overseas 
the official said 
the new regulations were not announced publicly but were put 
into effect about a month ago the official said 
china has a dual currency system with the yuan divided into 
renminbi for domestic use and fecs for foreigners and chinese who 
change foreign currency into yuan 
the bank of china official would not say why the restrictions 
were imposed but called them a reasonable measure 
if you change dollars into foreign exchange certificates its 
natural that you should spend the money in china he said there 
are no plans to abolish fecs he said 
its a very serious thing said an official of the beijing 
office of a europeanbased credit bank 
its a move to tighten the economy and more closely monitor 
foreign exchange said the banker who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
theyve done this because many chinese have fecs in their 
hands which they change to us dollars on the black market he 
said it is primarily to restrict the cash going out there are 
less us dollars in cash available and people have less to play 
around with in the open market 
the doublecurrency system has spawned a lively black market in 
fecs and convertible foreign currencies primarily us dollars 
chinese generally need fecs to purchase imported items and must 
prove they have dollars or other foreign currencies in order to 
travel or study abroad 
one reason for the bank of chinas move could be to discourage 
illegal foreign currency transactions 
but the black market has fallen the banker said you get 
less for dollars and the black market centers have been clamped 
down upon 
the black market price for the us dollar has dropped from 
about eight yuan a year ago to five or six yuan today the banker 
said the official exchange rate for the yuan is 37 to the dollar

the berlin wall is tumbling down and some of the 
pieces are apparently landing overseas in the united states 
more than 11 tons of debris reputed to be chunks from the wall 
arrived sunday at ohare international airport aboard an american 
airlines flight from hamburg west germany 
airline spokesman tom stack said the cargo labeled pieces of 
the berlin wall was destined for concord express an elk grove 
village shipping firm but he did not know the buyer 
we guess itll be sold as souvenirs said airline supervisor 
konstantin prause maybe as paperweights or key tags 
calls to concord express went unanswered early monday 
customs officials said the cargo was being kept at a customs 
facility 
others already have taken advantage of the clamor over the wall 
a firm called bampp imports in munster ind is using a tollfree 
telephone number to take orders for wall chunks even though it 
already has sold all 100 pounds of debris it had 
paul wells a partner in the venture said the company is taking 
orders for golfball size chunks for 10 plus 250 to cover 
shipping and handling 
bampp also sends along a copy of the customs certificate showing 
the country of origin as west germany 
thats about all you can do to prove the debris is really 
from the wall wells said 
its been pretty overwhelming he said of the response it 
started with just an ad in the local newspapers here 
the idea grew when a friend in west germany sent a chunk of the 
wall to partner william bell 
we figured everybody in the country was having the same idea 
as us but we were just lucky enough to have a connection out 
there wells said 
bell is in west germany making arrangements to ship more of the 
wall back to the united states wells said shipping costs are 
about 4 per pound he said 
wells predicted business would be brisk through christmas 
it should go pretty good a lot of people are buying it as 
a stocking stuffer he said

boeing machinists tonight will approve an 
agreement to end a strike that has virtually shut down production 
at the worlds largest maker of commercial aircraft a key union 
leader predicted 
a tentative contract which affects more than 57000 workers in 
nine states and was expected to set a standard for other aircraft 
manufacturers was agreed upon early sunday 
the agreement culminated 14 hours of talks during which a 
federal mediator took the unusual step of presenting his own 
proposal it was accepted by a 32 vote among negotiators for the 
international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
the 48day strike longest against the boeing co in 41 years 
has delayed deliveries of jets to airlines at a time of growing 
passenger loads and rising concern over the nations aging 
commerical airline fleets 
tom baker president of machinists district lodge 751 praised 
the threeyear pact as a substantial improvement over two earlier 
boeing offers 
i feel it will be ratified overwhelmingly he said 
but justin ostro an international vice president who 
coordinates aerospace industry negotiations for the machinists had 
harsh words for the agreement and the way it was reached 
theres a great deal of sacrifice on the part of these 
members ostro said they were entitled to a great deal more 
union members meet at seattles kingdome at 8 pm pst to vote 
after hearing an explanation and arguments about the contract 
meetings also are set for 5 pm cst in wichita kan and 8 pm 
in portland ore 
strikers picketing outside boeing plants sunday were happy to 
hear about the agreement 
wichita striker merle barton said his coworkers would ratify 
almost anything 
i think people want to go back to work barton said its 
a bad time for a working man to be out christmas is coming up 
taxes are coming up 
im pretty sure everybody will go for it were tired of 
standing around in the rain said elaine campbell who was doing 
just that outside a boeing jet plant in suburban renton 
boeing chief negotiator larry mckean said if the pact is 
approved strikers could return to work wednesday at this point 
were looking forward to a favorable vote on this contract and a 
return to normal operations he said 
analysts have said a settlement with the boeing machinists 
traditionally sets the pattern for other aerospace companies 
especially lockheed and mcdonnell douglas as well as for other 
unions at boeing 
baker whose lodge represents 43300 of the 57800 boeing 
workers covered by the pact said the new offer provided 
improvements in pay medical coverage overtime and the promotion 
system he gave few details 
this proposal is very close to what people indicated in union 
membership polls they would accept he said 
ostro however said the settlement included about the same 
annual wage gains 4 percent 3 percent and 3 percent that 
boeing offered before the strike baker refused to reveal the new 
figures 
the company proposed productivity bonuses of 10 percent of gross 
pay in the first year 5 percent in the second and 4 percent in the 
third and a costofliving escalator would cover almost all 
inflation the seattle postintelligencer reported today 
before the strike boeing machinists earned 888 to 1842 an 
hour without counting lump sum bonuses 
union and management negotiators had kind words for mediator 
doug hammonds proposal hammond said it was only the second time 
he had submitted his own proposed settlement in 15 years as a 
mediator 
we were kind of at loggerheads mckean said it was good 
and professional for him to step in 
it was difficult for him to do baker said had both 
parties not accepted he would have been out as a mediator 
besides the seattlearea workers the contract covers 12000 in 
wichita 1700 in portland and a few hundred others in california 
hawaii utah wyoming montana north dakota and other states 
during the strike boeing used supervisory and nonstriking 
workers to deliver 22 planes but all were virtually complete 
before the walkout 
boeing has continued to accumulate record orders including a 
deal last week with delta airlines for up to 100 jets potentially 
worth 4 billion 
that boosted boeings backlog of orders to 1718 planes worth 
85 billion both aerospace industry records 
the last boeing strike in 1977 ended after 45 days its 
longest walkout lasted 140 days in 1948

the latest hotel opening at walt 
disney world is the first phase of an unusual alliance among two 
big hotel chains and the entertainment giant 
the 758room swan owned by westin hotels and resorts was 
scheduled to open today 
together with sheraton corps 1509room dolphin scheduled to 
open july fourth the swan will anchor the nations thirdlargest 
convention and resort complex 
the huge fantasy resort is being built on 150 acres in a 
tropical setting that includes a 50acre manmade lake and 200000 
square feet of meeting and banquet space covered walkways connect 
the two hotels over a waterway which leads to disneys theme parks 
sheraton and westin have eased their competitive fervor enough 
to get together to operate the properties as a joint enterprise 
under the wing of the walt disney co 
we cooperate in some things and compete in others said 
dolphin spokesman bob mervine the companies will join forces when 
seeking the business of groups large enough to use both hotels and 
will cooperate in some operational areas he said 
we aggressively compete for the leisure market the family 
vacationer the travel trade and smaller meetings that can be held 
in either hotel mervine added 
the hotels are built and owned as a joint venture by tishman 
realty amp construction co inc metropolitan life insurance co and 
aoki corp of japan 
finishing touches give the project an unmistakable disney 
imprint two 45foottall swan statues outside one building and two 
sixstory dolphins outside the other 
disney also is in control of entertainment coordinating events 
such as appearances by mickey and the gang and running the main 
street electrical parade through the cavernous ballroom of the 
convention pavilion 
thats fitting since the complex is in the heart of an area 
bordered by epcot center and the new disneymgm studios theme park 
sheraton corp bills the convention resort complex a 
combination of rooms and meeting space as the third largest in the 
country the biggest is the hilton in las vegas followed by 
opryland in nashville tenn sheraton says 
the complex will bring the number of hotel rooms in the orlando 
area to 68300 by comparison the los angeleslong beach area 
which according to the laventhol amp horwath accounting firm leads 
the nation in the number of hotel rooms has 68000 
in addition to the swan and dolphin four hotels are under 
construction at disney world when all are finished the area alone 
will have 18 hotels with 15297 rooms

the number of working us oil and gas rigs 
declined by five this week to total 1040 after posting increases 
10 times in the past 12 weeks 
the total however showed 117 more working rigs than for the 
same week a year ago baker hughes inc reported monday last week 
the count increased by three to total 1045 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively 
producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oil producing states oklahoma posted the largest 
gain with five followed by louisiana and new mexico two each and 
ohio one 
those showing a decline in the number of operating rigs were 
wyoming five kansas four california colorado and

saudi arabia the worlds 
largest oil exporter will not surrender its majority share of opec 
production when ministers meet later this week a report predicted 
monday 
the respected middle east economic survey reported that the 
saudis will insist its share of opecs output remain at the current 
2446 percent even if nonproportionate quota increases are granted 
to other members of the cartel 
ian seymour editor of the cyprusbased oil industry newsletter 
wrote after discussions with senior saudi officials that there is 
no way in which saudi arabia would be prepared to surrender even a 
token part of its output share in order to facilitate agreement on 
a new quota system in vienna 
members of the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries have been squabbling over quota allocations and several 
nations have consistently produced beyond their established limits 
in open defiance of the opec ceilings 
opec is scheduled to meet saturday in vienna austria to seek a 
formula to satisfy demands by various members for higher production 
limits while at the same time trying to avoid a major hike in the 
overall quota that could hurt prices 
world oil prices have remained relatively stable in recent 
months thanks to strong demand from developing nations 
oil ministers from persian gulf nations including saudi arabia 
held a strategy session here monday in preparation for the opec 
meeting 
an official speaking on condition of anoynmity said ministers 
from the gulf cooperation council discussed developments in the 
world oil market and reviewed future oil strategy for the gcc 
member states during a 90minute session 
the six gcc ministers met after a session of the 11member 
organization of arab petroleum exporting countries 
in addition to saudi arabia the gcc includes qatar bahrain and 
oman as well as kuwait and the uae oapec includes saudi arabia 
kuwait qatar iraq algeria libya the uae egypt bahrain 
syria and tunisia 
algerian oil minister sadiq busina after the oapec session 
called for a flexibile approach on the quota distribution he 
said that such an agreement must be reached fast 
algeria an opec hardliner who favors low output to bolster 
prices has been critical of opecs decision in september to raise 
the overall quota by 1 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter 
to 205 million barrels daily 
seymour also wrote there is considerable scepticism in saudi 
oil circles as to whether the quota redistribution proposed in 
geneva would be either achievable or workable 
at the september meeting in geneva iran introduced a new plan 
for sharing production which got only preliminary consideration 
because it was presented late in the session 
the proposal expected to be reheard at saturdays meeting 
called for raising the overall output cap to 215 million barrels a 
day to meet the demands primarily of kuwait and the united arab 
emirates gabon and ecuador also would get higher ceilings while 
other member quotas would remain the same or be reduced

after almost two years of wrangling and 
uncertainty new hampshires largest electric utility appears ready 
to emerge from bankruptcy under new ownership that seems to have 
state and industry support 
northeast utilities of hartford conn came out of lastminute 
negotiations between shareholders and creditors saturday as the 
winning bidder to take over public service co of new hampshire and 
its 36 percent share of the seabrook nuclear plant that forced it 
into bankruptcy 
the tentative agreement on northeasts 23 billion takeover 
proposal was to be presented today to us bankruptcy judge james 
yacos it calls for annual rate increases of 55 percent for seven 
years 
shareholders and creditors of public service still must take a 
formal vote on the northeast plan and any others still on the 
table then yacos will hold confirmation hearings to make sure the 
chosen plan will do what it says it will do 
public services investors stand to lose about 16 billion in 
the utilitys reorganization with shareholders absorbing the brunt 
of the loss an attorney said 
its a pretty significant loss that is primarily being 
suffered by shareholders said howard berman an attorney for the 
shareholders 
new hampshire gov judd gregg who announced the tentative 
agreement withheld official endorsement of the northeast plan 
until state negotiators can go over it once more 
there still are many uncertainties to be resolved before this 
case is concluded public service spokesman nicholas ashooh said 
other new england utilities have raised the possibility of 
antitrust action 
northeast is new englands largest electric utility and public 
service has almost 400000 customers in new hampshire 
state legislators still must meet in a special session expected 
to be scheduled today before jan 1 to vote on whether to modify a 
state law that bans advance charges for seabrook before it begins 
commercial operation every takeover proposal relied on an 
electricity rate plan that called for rate increases beginning jan 
1 and those rates would include seabrook costs 
several attempts in the past to repeal the law have failed 
senate majority leader edward dupont and house speaker douglas 
scamman said they thought chances are good that the law will be 
modified

the chicago board of trade as selling to take profits weighed on 
soybean futures 
soybean futures were on the defensive throughout the day because 
of commercial fund selling analyst joel karlin of research 
department inc said 
karlin said the selling was technical in nature on the 
perception that soybean futures were overbought futures also were 
pressured by a lack of export business 
corn prices were lower due to a spillover effect from the 
selloff in the soybean pits although corn futures received support 
from reports of far east buying and news that mexico may enter the 
market this week 
wheat prices received a boost from concerns about dry weather 
conditions in the winter wheat crop region karlin said the latest 
six to 10day forecast by the national weather service is calling 
for continued dry conditions in the central plains 
at the close wheat was a cent to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 410 a bushel corn was a 
cent to 2 cents lower with december at 237 a bushel oats were 
1 cents to 2 cents lower with december at 145 a bushel 
soybeans were 8 cents to 10 cents lower with november at 575 
cents a bushel

five unions representing denver post employees 
have ratified contracts with the newspaper including one local 
that organized a 14month circulation boycott campaign after taking 
steep pay cuts 
unions representing mailers typographical workers paper 
handlers stereotypers and pressmen ratified contracts with the 
newspaper sunday 
the post had been locked in a dispute with denver mailers union 
local 8 whose members load delivery trucks and operate machines 
that insert supplements since the paper cut mailroom employees 
wages by 42 percent to 52 percent in august 1988 
we are gratified that the denver post and its employees have 
entered into a renewed partnership for the future post chairman 
w dean singleton said with this cooperation between labor and 
management the post is poised for excellent growth in the years 
ahead 
the mailers agreement establishes a threeyear timetable for 55 
journeymen mailers to draw within 11 percent of the wages they 
received before the cuts were made in 1988 
another 22 lessexperienced mailers will get smaller wage 
increases than the journeymen the mailers union also represents 
about 100 parttime employees 
we were not overwhelmingly pleased but we were forced to 
accept reality mailers local president ray benoit said 
during the boycott campaign the union urged post subscribers in 
radio advertisements to cancel their subscriptions despite the 
effort the newspaper recently released circulation figures showing 
an increase in subscribers 
the agreements between the company and the other four unions 
call for 160 union members to receive 500 bonuses in each of the 
next two years and a 4 percent wage increase in the final third 
year of the contract 
the paper handlers accepted a company offer to extend the 
contract to five years they are to receive a 4 percent wage 
increase in the fourth year and a 5 percent increase in the fifth 
year 
machinists and engravers unions considered but did not vote on 
the company proposal and said they would seek to reopen talks

a nation on the brink of 
hyperinflation burdened with huge foreign and internal debts is 
the potentially explosive economic scenario awaiting brazils next 
president 
but only painful recessionary economic policies can deactivate 
the hyperinflation time bomb and the next chiefofstate may not 
have the time or the support to implement such policies say 
economists and businessmen 
if the next president does not act quickly to undertake real 
economic adjustments then his political authority and credibility 
will be greatly weakened says us economist jeffrey sachs 
the real essence of brazils economic future will probably be 
decided in the first few weeks of the new government he said 
the challenge will fall to either conservative fernando collor 
de mello or marxist luis inacio lula da silva who compete dec 17 
in a presidential runoff election 
collor de mello of the centerright national reconstruction 
party led a field of 21 candidates in the nov 15 election 
brazils first free balloting for president in 29 years the former 
state governor had 284 percent of the votes with 993 percent of 
the ballots counted monday 
da silva a former trade union president of the radical left 
workers party was second with 161 percent 
both candidates say restarting economic growth is the top 
priority 
the new president who takes office next mar 15 will confront an 
annual inflation rate of more than 1300 percent a foreign debt of 
about 110 billion the largest in the third world an internal 
government debt of 120 billion and a public deficit equal to 6 
percent of the countrys 350 billion gross national product 
the cure for high inflation is the sharp contraction of the 
budget deficit which can be achieved by cutting public spending 
reducing subsidies and increasing taxes and public utility rates 
sachs said at a recent seminar in sao paulo 
government intervention in the economy was common under the 
military regime that ruled brazil from 1964 to 1985 that policy 
continued under president jose sarney who took power in a 1985 
election controlled by the outgoing generals 
sachs said his proposed economic stabilization measures would 
provoke a recession that would last about one yer after which he 
predicted brazils economy would start recovering 
economist joaquim eloi cirne de toledo of the university of sao 
paulo warned that the next president might not have the popular 
and political support needed to adopt economic austerity measures 
when the next president takes office the monthly inflation 
rate probably will be about 65 percent which is not enough to 
destabilize the economy toledo said 
if the economy is not about to collapse it will be difficult 
to convince congress and the public of the urgent need for 
austerity measures toledo said 
by april 1990 inflation will be about 70 percent a month 
toledo said he predicted the new government then would impose 
price and wage controls that would bring inflation down to 6 or 7 
percent 
but inflation would soon start accelerating again and by the 
end of the year it will be 80 percent a month he said 
at this stage hyperinflation will probably explode and only 
then will the new president have the public support to restructure 
the economy 
toledo said the restructuring would a require a reduction of the 
public deficit by renegotiating longer repayment periods and lower 
interest rates on brazils internal debt 
the internal debt is financed by government securities that pay 
more than 1 percent daily interest rates 
brazil also must negotiate longer repayment terms and lower 
interest rates on its foreign debt on which it currently pays 
145 billion annually said toledo 
john mein executive vicepresident of the american chamber of 
commerce said in an interview that brazils next president may not 
have enough time to adopt the measures needed to eliminate the 
threat of hyperinflation 
the presidential honeymoon with the people and congress could 
last between 45 days and six months hardly enough time to set in 
motion the structural changes in the economy needed to bring 
inflation under control mein said 
mein said the new government must open up the economy to more 
foreign investment diminish its interference in the economy 
privatize badly managed and unprofitable state enterprises and 
institute tax reforms to close loopholes that encourage widespread 
tax evasion 
the government also will have to devalue the new cruzado 
brazils currency by at least 30 percent to make local goods more 
competitive on the international market mein said

rep richard a gephardt the democratic 
leader of the house and sen john heinz a prominent republican 
joined monday in criticizing the bush administration for cutting 
back support for making the united states competitive in high 
technology 
heinz rpa a member of the senate banking committee 
emphasized concerns that cut across party lines 
as a republican i feel very strongly that it would be a 
mistake for my party and the bush administration to discover that 
our failure to comprehend reality had irreparably undermined ths 
nations national security and its ability to remain a world 
leader he told a news conference 
gephardt denounced what he called the high priests of free 
trade and free markets 
there are people who believe that other economies around 
the world operate exactly like ours and that the freemarket 
ideology and the freetrade ideology reign in practice everywhere 
in the world he said 
the problem with that belief is that i think it is out of 
synchronization with reality gephardt said so what america 
has to do is to fashion a publicprivate cooperation so that we can 
compete in the world as it is 
both legislators noted a report issued monday on us 
telecommunications policy by a private group the economic policy 
institute it predicted a loss of 2 million us jobs by the year 
2010 and an annual trade deficit 225 billion larger than it would 
otherwise be unless the government helps us industry compete 
against japan and western europe 
the most critical areas according to the report are 
television computers digital communications and semiconductors 
the electronic chips now at the heart of all telecommunications 
the study concluded that unlike its economic rivals the united 
states has failed to set up a system for staying competitive in 
leading communications technologies 
in a statement to the senate on sunday heinz cited another 
report made public monday this one from the national advisory 
committee on semiconductors that committee included government 
officials as well as leaders in the industry 
the us merchant semiconductor industry has lost its dominant 
world market share in the past 10 years the panels report said 
because technological leadership is cumulative once 
technological leadership is lost it is very difficult to regain

the traditional thanksgiving meal of 
turkey cranberries stuffing and pie will cost more this year a 
purdue university economist says 
food prices rose about 5 percent in 1989 compared with a 4 
percent increase from 1987 to 1988 said agricultural economist 
joseph n uhl 
and these price increases are likely to continue through 1989 
and into 1990 uhl said 
the good news for thanksgiving is that turkey prices are lower 
this year because of increased supplies and more grocery specials 
ham costs about the same as it did last year uhl said 
because of bad weather last winter and spring the cranberry 
crop is about 4 percent smaller than last year wheat prices also 
are up meaning breads and stuffing will be more expensive the 
size of the sweet potato crop has declined by 1 percent from 1988 
almonds hazelnuts pistachios and pecans will be in shorter 
supply for holiday baking and snacking this year although peanuts 
and walnuts will be plentiful the economist said 
vegetable prices especially for potatoes onions tomatoes and 
lettuce will remain relatively high for the rest of the year he 
said 
prices for holiday baking supplies also are higher this year 
the effects of the 1988 drought and this years strong us 
and worldwide demand for food products has caused sugar flour 
shortening eggs and butter to rise uhl said 
even oatmeal cookies will be more expensive due to the 
increased demand for oats and chocolate prices will be somewhat 
higher as supplies decrease however pumpkins are plentiful for 
holiday pies 
holiday beverages will cost more this year coffee prices are 
down but orange juice and soda are up milk and dairy prices are 
substantially higher and higher prices for eggs means more 
expensive eggnog 
uhl blamed the drought tighter food supplies and a strong 
consumer demand for food for raising the price of eggs milk bread 
and beef 
further price increases can be expected in coming months he 
said normally for perishable products it takes three months 
for the full effects of a farm price increase to be reflected in 
grocery store prices

eastern airlines is trying again to work out a deal 
to sell its latin american routes and other assets to rival 
american airlines a spokesman said monday 
they approached us again weve had some occasional 
discussions concerning their latin american network said jim 
brown a spokesman for american at its headquarters in dallasfort 
worth texas we are receptive to assets purchases no 
announcement is imminent 
eastern spokesman robin matell declined comment on details of 
the negotiations published by the wall street journal 
the journal quoting unidentified sources said negotiations 
began about 10 days ago and continued through this past weekend 
the sources said the talks included close telephone contact between 
frank lorenzo the chairman of easterns parent texas air corp 
and chairman robert crandall of amr corp parent of american 
the journal report said the latin american routes valued at 
365 million are part of a 400 million to 500 million assets 
package 
speculation that eastern would renew efforts to sell the 
lucrative routes was fueled earlier this month because some 
creditors were concerned about cash shortfalls in easterns 
rebuilding plan 
hit by a crippling strike march 4 eastern filed five days later 
for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
miamibased eastern has been rebuilding as a smaller carrier 
without the unions after selling off a number of assets to pay its 
debts 
however extended talks with american keenly interested in the 
latin american routes as it builds up its miami operations 
foundered about three months ago at that time eastern said it 
would keep the routes and planned to emerge from chapter 11 early 
next year at as much as 90 percent of its prestrike size 
but that meant eastern had to overhaul its reorganization plan 
for creditors the carrier recently received a 60day extension of 
its filing deadline for the revised plan 
the journal said a major sticking point to be overcome in 
negotiations was a lawsuit that continental airlines easterns 
sister carrier has pending against american in a dispute over 
computer reservations continental has been seeking as much as 1 
billion in damages 
that suit undercut the earlier talks between eastern and 
american the nations largest airline according to the newspaper 
a source said american wanted whatever amount it paid to settle 
that suit to be included in the latin american package in a way 
that would show as little as possible the package being negotiated 
also includes some continental routes and airport gates the report 
said

a farm chemical trade association said monday 
that a total ban on the use of crop fungicides would boost consumer 
food prices by 13 percent and reduce the supply of fruits 
vegetables and peanuts by 24 percent 
jay vroom president of the national agricultural chemicals 
association said he wanted to call attention to the enormous 
benefit and the very small risk that result from the use of 
fungicides and other hightech farming methods on food supplies 
in my view the debate regarding the safety of our food is 
almost totally riskdominated vroom said there is precious 
little mentioned about the benefit side of the equation 
an economic study showing the effects of a ban on fungicides 
chemicals applied to crops particularly fruit and vegetable to 
prevent plant diseases was released by the association at a news 
conference here 
the study paid for by the association was done by grc 
economics a washington dc consulting subsidiary of hill and 
knowlton inc 
the environmenal protection agencys spokesman on pesticides al 
heier said we have always been concerned about fungicides but 
were not going to cancel all of them 
heier said federal law requires the agency to balance benefits 
against risks when judging any pesticides and said the agency 
adheres to that mandate 
john m urbanchuk senior vice president and director of 
economics for the consulting firm said if fungicides were 
eliminated you the consumer would pay more for lowerquality 
produce you would find that many fruits and vegetables no longer 
look or taste the same as before and they would cost much more 
for example he said crops hit hardest would include popular 
salad bar crops such as carrots which would rise 80 percent 
lettuce 40 percent tomatoes 40 percent and onions 34 percent 
prices of other major crops also would go up sharply he said 
peanuts and peanut butter would rise 68 percent peaches 37 
percent and potatoes 37 percent 
production of fruits would decline by 32 percent vegetables by 
21 percent peanuts by 68 percent and the major grains such as 
corn and wheat by 6 percent he said 
urbanchuck said in his statement that poorer families would 
suffer the most by not being able to afford higher prices for 
fruits and vegetables 
lisa lefferts of the center for science in the public interest 
said she had not studied the chemical industrys report and had no 
way to dispute the studys figures 
but she said the current way of growing food with large 
amounts of fungicides and other chemicals isnt the only way to 
do it 
in fact she said the national academy of sciences recently 
reported on alternate ways of farming to reduce the contamination 
of soil water and air by cutting back on chemicals 
were confident and so is the national academy of sciences 
that we can produce foods profitably and competitively using far 
fewer fungicides and other pesticides lefferts said in a 
telephone interview 
the most telling statistic would be not how much reduced 
fungicide use would cost consumers but how much it would cost the 
chemical industry she said 
fungicides represent about 370 million or 74 percent of the 5 
billionayear farm chemicals industry association officials said 
an advisory board for the study included representatives of the 
association the national association of wheat growers national 
food processors association fertilizer institute resources for 
the future and the agriculture department

mounting a proxy fight for control of the lin board 
lin said its board would review the revised proposal on a 
timely basis but urged its shareholders against tendering to 
mccaw until its board announced its recommendation bellsouth said 
it was studying the revised offer but that its first reading 
indicated its own deal with lin offered more strength and value 
to lin shareholders 
in trading in the overthecounter market lin climbed 437 a 
share to 12012 while mccaw fell 125 to 3575 bellsouth rose 
50 cents a share to 5175 on the new york stock exchange 
analysts said they valued mccaws new offer at 123 to 128 a 
share compared with 110 to 113 a share under mccaws previous 
offer and 117 to 124 a share under the bellsouth offer 
bellsouth is expected to sweeten its offer 
mccaw the nations largest cellular company has been pursuing 
lin since early june but lin has resisted and agreed instead to 
merge its cellular operations with those of bellsouth in a deal 
that would create a cellular company larger than mccaw 
under its latest offer mccaw said it pay 150 a share for 225 
million lin shares or 34 billion its previous offer was 125 
per share for 22 million shares a total of 275 billion 
mccaw already owns about 51 million lin shares and the revised 
offer would give it 512 percent of lins 539 million shares 
fully diluted 
in addition mccaw said that as soon as possible after the 
tender offer is completed mccaw would have lin buy 425 million of 
mccaw stock and distribute it to lin shareholders at a value of 
1617 in stock for each lin share held 
the new offer expires at midnight est dec 15 although it would 
be extended until the lin shareholder meeting if lin puts the bid 
to a vote 
under the deal with bellsouth lin shareholders would get a cash 
dividend of 42 a share stock in the new cellular company that 
would be created by the merger of lin and bellsouth cellular 
interests and stock in a new company that would consist of lins 
seven television stations 
the participants in both deals have offered guarantees that lin 
shareholders who hold on to their stock in the cellular company 
will get private market value for it several years down the road 
the bellsouthlin deal is being submitted to a vote of lin 
shareholders on jan 12 and mccaw wants its proposal considered 
then also 
bellsouth and lin said in announcing their merger deal in 
october that they felt the deal could be closed in the first 
quarter of 1990 
but mccaw said regulatory approvals could delay the 
bellsouthlin deal for up to a year mccaw said its deal could be 
closed much sooner and said it would demonstrate its confidence in 
that by pledging to pay interest of 12 percent annually on its cash 
tender offer if the offer closes after march 31 1990 
mccaw said last week it has received firm commitments totaling 
3 billion from a 22bank syndicate which with about 12 billion 
of its own cash and marketable securities is enough to complete 
the tender offer

on other markets precious metals and energy futures were 
higher while grain soybean livestock and pork futures were lower 
copper settled 60 cent to 3 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in november at 1062 cents a pound 
news that copper stocks in london metal exchangeapproved 
warehouses increased by 12000 metric tons weighed on the market 
analysts said the increase in stocks indicates the economy is 
weakening 
copper is an industrial metal and an economic slowdown means 
less building of homes where copper is used in pipes and less 
industrial uses said analyst peter cardillo of josephthal amp co 
in new york 
defense secretary dick cheneys remarks sunday that there could 
be major cuts in defense spending was also seen as a bad sign for 
copper 
precious metal futures rallied on the comex as prices on the new 
york stock exchange fell and the us treasury bond market 
retreated 
cardillo said gold prices also were influenced by the failure of 
producers to sell at current prices he said that gloom over 
government figures indicating a slowing economy also were a boost 
to prices

ounce silver was 16 cents to 29 cents higher with november at 
5688 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean prices closed lower on the chicago board of 
trade as selling to take profits weighed on soybean futures 
analyst joel karlin of research department inc said the selling 
was technical in nature on the perception that soybean futures were 
overbought futures also were pressured by a lack of export 
business 
corn prices were lower due to a spillover effect from the 
selloff in the soybean pits although corn futures received support 
from reports of far east buying and news that mexico may enter the 
market this week 
wheat prices received a boost from concerns about dry weather 
conditions in the winter wheat crop region karlin said the latest 
six to 10day forecast by the national weather service is calling 
for continued dry conditions in the central plains

with the rally led by heating oil 
a cold snap on the east coast last week generated interest in 
heating oil on expectation of increased consumer demand said 
analyst jerry samuels of shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
also acting as a spur to prices is the coming meeting in vienna 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries ministers 
you dont sell before opec meetings samuels said

with december at 2007 a barrel heating oil was 53 cent to 81

gasoline was 27 cent to 50 cent higher with december at 5222 
cents a gallon 
livestock and pork futures were lower on the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
the drop in hog futures reflected lower cash market prices said 
analyst mike swinford of balfour maclaine corp in chicago frozen 
pork bellies were lower due to the rejection friday by the us 
department of agriculture of offers for purchases of pork bellies 
to ship to poland 
cattle prices were mostly lower but received some support from 
higher cash prices swinford said 
live cattle were 30 cent lower to 35 cent higher with december

in a boost to the nations corn farmers the 
treasury department said monday it plans to give a tax break to a 
new ethanolbased fuel additive that president bush brought to 
public attention last summer 
the change in treasury department policy would make ethyl 
tertiary butyl ether or etbe eligible for the same fueltax 
examption now applied to ethanol that is blended directly into 
gasoline 60 cents per gallon of additive 
a public hearing on the plan is scheduled for jan 4 said steve 
pyrek a spokesman for the internal revenue service 
the tax break could make it economical for oil companies to make 
the ether additive from ethanol rather than methanol a product of 
natural gas supporters say that would be a boon to the farm belt 
as it is estimated that etbe manufacturing would consume 50 million 
bushels of corn a year 
the environmenal benefits are great the benefits to 
agriculture are great this policy change on the part of the 
administration is a tremendous victory for us all said sen tom 
daschle dsd 
bush drove an etbepowered car during a trip this spring to 
nebraska to promote clean air legislation that proposed requiring 
the sale of a million such cleanfuel automobiles in the nations 
most polluted cities 
cars running on etbeblended gasoline emit less carbon monoxide 
unburned hydrocarbons and toxics such as benzene daschle said

dun amp bradstreet corp said monday it had agreed 
to buy mainframe computer software maker management science america 
inc for 333 million in cash 
new yorkbased dun amp bradstreet said the companies reached a 
definitive merger agreement at a price of 1850 a share after 
unanimous approval by msas board of directors 
msas stock rose 6 a share to 1812 a share in 
overthecounter trading a gain of about 50 percent 
the two companies are close and leading competitors in providing 
mainframe software for general ledger accounting accounts payable 
accounts receivable and inventory control 
although mainframe computers are perceived as dinosaurs by some 
the software segment the companies serve is growing a healthy 16 
percent a year the deal comes at a difficult time for dun amp 
bradstreet a 43 billion business information company which last 
week announced an expensive overhaul of its creditservices 
operation after widespread consumer complaints the company said 
pershare earnings would fall about 10 percent next year 
atlantabased msa recently returned to profitability it earned 
about 10 million in the first nine months of this year after 
losses of 20 million in the same period a year earlier it is less 
than a tenth the size of dun amp bradstreet with 196 million in 
revenue through the first three quarters 
dun amp bradstreet said it would merge msa with its own slightly 
smaller mccormack amp dodge software operation to create a new 
organization with its own board of directors dun amp bradstreet 
software services 
the company will focus on products for mainframe computers made 
by international business machines corp but will also make 
software for digital equipment corp computers and certain other 
vendors dun amp bradstreet said 
msas chairman and chief executive john p imlay jr will be 
chairman and principal executive officer of the new unit frank h 
dodge president of mccormack amp dodge will be vice chairman 
given the constant changes in the very competitive software 
and services industry this merger is a tremendous opportunity for 
both organizations imlay said in a statement 
completion of the deal depends on clearance by antitrust 
authorities which could take time because the businesses overlap 
so closely but imlay said in an interview that the business is 
so big with so many competitors that he did not expect a 
problem 
the deal also depends on dun amp bradstreet being tendered a 
majority of the outstanding shares by the current msa shareholders 
toward that goal dun amp bradstreet said it already had commitments 
from holders of 40 percent of msas shares 
one of the msa shareholders that agreed to tender its shares was 
ibm which bought a 5 percent stake earlier this year in addition 
imlay himself owns about 16 percent of the shares and is tendering 
them 
in an effort to reassure customers dun amp bradstreet said the 
products of both msa and mccormack amp dodge would be preserved and 
enhanced sometimes companies try to save money by eliminating 
overlapping products 
charles federman a partner in the investment banking firm of 
broadview associates of fort lee nj said some customers might 
desert in spite of the assurances users have just had their 
status unquoed he said 
but imlay in an interview denied there was anything to fear 
both of us has a history of great customer service and thats why 
were together really he said

a connecticut utility said monday it 
would drop out of the bidding for public service company of new 
hampshire if an endorsed offer by another connecticut power company 
holds up 
united illuminating of new haven conn made the decision after 
an announcement saturday that creditors and shareholders had 
endorsed a bid by northeast utilities of berlin conn 
public service also has made a proposal to bring itself out of a 
22monthold bankruptcy reorganization public service lawyer 
richard levin said the utility has not decided whether to stay in 
the competition levin said public service first wants to study the 
northeast proposal 
larry smukler the states chief negotiator in the bankruptcy 
negotiations said the state would not comment on the plan until it 
had studied it although we anticipate agreement 
the comments came in the first us bankruptcy court session 
since public service creditors signed on to the 23 billion 
northeast buyout proposal 
bankruptcy judge james yacos gave northeast until 5 pm next 
monday to submit its agreement to parties in the case the first 
bankruptcy of a major utility since the great depression 
if shareholders creditors and the state still agree on 
northeast utilities consensual plan united illumniating said it 
would withdraw its proposal 
northeast also said it hoped to reach agreement with the state 
on a rate plan by the end of the week 
despite the creditors backing shareholders and creditors still 
must take a formal vote and the judge will make a final ruling on 
the proposals 
also monday officials set a tentative dec 14 date for a 
special legislative session to amend or repeal a state law that 
bars charging ratepayers for power plants before they operate 
the three plans for the utility call for rate increases 
effective jan 1 to begin paying for the seabrook nuclear plant 
making any change in the law necessary by that date 
completed in 1986 the plant remains idle for lack of a federal 
operating license but its owners expect it to begin operating 
early next year 
the northeast plan calls for annual 55 percent rate increases 
in each of the next seven years but allows for additional hikes if 
fuel costs skyrocket or northeast is unable to earn a specified 
return on its investment

texas instruments inc said monday it plans to cut 
up to 1500 jobs mainly in the united states citing a slowdown in 
demand for its computer memory chips 
the cut would represent a reduction of slightly less than 3 
percent of its us work force if all the cuts came in the united 
states accounting for some of the cuts is the closing of an 
obsolete wafer fabrication plant in dallas 
texas instruments said it would take a pretax charge against 
earnings of about 55 million in the fourth quarter about 25 
million covers the cost of cuts and upgrades in the semiconductor 
business while the rest is split evenly between cost reductions in 
the information technology group and cost adjustments on 
fixedprice defense contracts 
the move came later on a day in which the company announced in 
japan that it will hire several hundred japanese scientists and 
engineers for a new research and development center in tsukuba 
about 40 miles northeast of tokyo 
texas instruments spokeswoman terri west said the company plans 
to seek the job reduction as much as possible through voluntary 
means such as retirements early retirements at age 55 
voluntary terminations and bridged early retirements for those 
younger than 55 
two similar reduction efforts earlier this year resulted in 
about 2000 jobs being trimmed from the firms corporate and 
defense systems groups 
the company has about 75000 employees worldwide with about 
51000 of those in the united states about 80 percent of the us 
workforce is concentrated in texas 
reductions will be sought within information technology group 
operations in hunt valley md johnson city tenn north texas 
and the texas cities of austin temple and houston 
semiconductor group reductions will be asked in dallas 
voluntary reductions will be sought among materials and control 
groups personnel at attlesboro mass and versaille ky 
specific targets at each facility are being withheld ms west 
said 
the cutbacks in materials and controls group are necessary 
because of a weakness in the appliance market and a slowness in the 
automotive market ti officials said in a statement explaining the

shearson lehman hutton inc said monday it is 
cutting stockbroker commissions for the first time in 15 years 
reflecting an industrywide slowdown in brokerage activity by 
individual investors 
shearson the nations secondlargest retail brokerage said the 
portion of the commission that a broker gets for selling investment 
products would be trimmed by 1 to 2 percentage points in 1990 
analysts said the reduction was the first direct commission 
cutback by a brokerage house on wall street where profits have 
lagged partly part because of an exodus of individual investors 
since the october 1987 stock market crash 
in the past year other firms have imposed a variety of customer 
fees that go directly to the brokerage but do not affect the size 
of brokers commission 
such fees result in a slightly higher take for the company 
than it does for the representative but its not as brutal as 
this said james p hanbury a securities industry analyst with 
wertheim schroeder inc 
youre trying to raise the revenue to the firm because the 
overall business is not that robust he said either the 
business gets better or youre going to see other firms cutting 
commissions 
shearson which is 61 percent owned by american express co has 
been contemplating trimming the commission a broker gets known as 
the payout rate by 4 to 5 percentage points over the next four to 
five years said shearson spokesman michael oneill 
shearson retail brokers brought in commissions averaging 
228000 this year shearson paid 465 percent of the total back to 
brokers and their supervisors in direct payments employee benefits 
and deferred payments 
in 1986 when an average shearson retail broker brought in 
265000 in commissions the payout rate was 43 percent 
shearson also has been stung by declining profits and a low 
stock price the firm earlier this month announced it was laying 
off up to 800 employees and restructuring its senior management 
the management changes are expected to be announced after 
thanksgiving 
shearson stock fell 37 cents to close at 1637 in new york 
stock exchange trading monday 
while not slashing commissions virtually all wall street firms 
have imposed handling fees on customer accounts to help enhance 
revenue without boosting expenses 
earlier this month for example bear stearns amp co imposed a 
250 handling charge on all individual investors stock and bond 
trades merrill lynch amp co the nations largest brokerage 
boosted its service charge last year to 235 for each trade from 
185 
the securities industry association expects thirdquarter 
industry pretax profits to be about half of the 1 billion in 
pretax profits in the second quarter 
the secondquarter profit marked a sharp jump from 200 million 
in the previous quarter and was attributed to increased volume and 
declining interest rates the bulk of the recovery came from the 10 
largest investment banks many of which recovered from 
firstquarter losses 
but retail commissions accounted for just 17 percent of revenue 
in the first half of the year unchanged from 1988 but down 25 
percent from 1987 and 35 percent from 1980 
at shearson the reduction in the payout rate is intended to 
increase revenue to avoid a credit rating downgrade of its 
commercial paper by moodys investors service inc 
hardwick simmons a shearson vice president and head of retail 
brokerage operations told shearson brokers at a meeting in beverly 
hills calif last week that reducing the payout rate would help 
placate moodys 
a lower commercial paper rating would squeeze shearsons profit 
margin on the difference between what it costs the firm to borrow 
money and what it earns 
simmons said a downgrade of one notch in the commercial paper 
rating could cost shearson 20 million a year in higher interest 
payments and a twonotch downgrade could cost double that amount 
commercial paper is a shortterm corporate iou that companies sell 
to raise money to run operations 
our payout rate is too high simmons said the industry 
cant take it

machinists who struck boeing co for 48 days 
voted monday evening on a threeyear contract offer that covers 
57800 workers in at least nine states and could become a standard 
for the aerospace industry 
union members voted near wichita kan and were to gather in 
seattle and portland ore to vote on the agreement reached sunday 
with the worlds biggest manufacturer of commercial jets results 
were not expected until early tuesday 
tom baker president of seattles district lodge 751 of the 
international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
predicted earlier that the deal would be overwhelmingly approved 
boeing chief negotiator larry mckean said strikers could be back at 
work wednesday 
the companys secondlongest strike virtually halted production 
delaying deliveries to airlines at a time of growing passenger 
loads and rising concern over aging jets 
the machinists union represents about 43300 workers in seattle 
12000 in wichita 1700 in portland and a few hundred more in 
scattered sites including california hawaii utah wyoming 
montana north dakota and other states 
reporters were barred from the meeting at the kansas coliseum 
north of wichita dozens of people stayed only long enough to pick 
up a sevenpage explanation of the offer 
there was no clearcut sentiment among union members who left 
early 
i voted to go back to work said rodney nobles of wichita 
i think its a good contract they gave us our lumpsum 
improvements 
galan smith 22 of wichita said he voted against the contract 
were wanting a larger wage increase in the general wage he 
said weve been out long enough we feel like they should make 
up for some of what weve gone through 
baker said the proposed contract substantially improves two 
earlier boeing offers including boosting the total dollar value 
other union leaders were less satisfied justin ostro an 
international union vice president who coordinates aerospace 
industry negotiations for the machinists said boeing workers were 
entitled to a great deal more 
boeing officials said they were pleased with the pact 
according to a handout distributed at the kansas coliseum the 
offer included four major improvements from the oct 3 proposal 
machinists overwhelmingly rejected before going on strike the next 
day 
lumpsum bonuses of 10 percent of gross pay the first year 5 
percent the second and 4 percent the third 
a 60centperhour costofliving increase immediately with 
quarterly increases thereafter 
an increase in the costofliving adjustment base pay by 45 
cents an hour to make up for a 1986 adjustment workers didnt get 
a cut in mandatory overtime to two consecutive weekends and 
144 hours per quarter with doubletime pay after 160 hours down 
from 200 mandatory hours of overtime per quarter and four 
consecutive weekends in the previous contract 
machinists have said that after six years of accepting yearly 
bonuses rather than wage increases boeing workers were entitled to 
a healthy chunk of the companys prosperity 
boeing had record earnings in its most recent quarter and has a 
backlog of orders for more than 1700 jets worth about 85 billion 
with delivery dates stretching beyond the turn of the century 
a settlement with boeing machinists traditionally has set the 
pattern for other aerospace companies especially lockheed corp 
and mcdonnell douglas corp as well as for other unions at boeing 
the seattle professional engineering employees association 
which represents about 28000 engineers and technical workers has 
agreed to extend its contract with boeing which expires dec 1 
boeing helicopters in philadelphia and united auto workers local 
1069 which represents about 3000 production workers extended 
their pact beyond its oct 4 expiration 
union contracts between machinists at mcdonnell douglas in 
torrence calif and lockheed corp at burbank calif expired in 
october but negotiations have been extended those talks are 
separate from the boeing negotiations and the outcome of the 
seattle talks had no direct effect 
don nakamoto spokesman for machinists district lodge 727 in 
burbank acknowledged the boeing developments have been closely 
watched 
im sure it will have some impact nakamoto said its 
hard to say what it will be but i think both parties will be taking 
a hard look to see what it means to our talks 
during the strike boeing using supervisory and nonstriking 
workers delivered 22 planes but all were virtually complete and 
out of the factories before the walkout 
boeing has said the strike will have a serious financial impact 
during the last quarter of the year but has not given specific 
forecasts 
the last boeing strike in 1977 lasted 45 days there was a 
19day strike in 1965 and a 140day walkout in 1948
