thousands of workers on thursday 
joined a 4dayold strike organized by prosandinista labor unions 
disrupting banking postal and telephone services nationwide 
police made no effort to dislodge strikers from government 
buildings and there was no indication that negotiations between 
the government and strikers would take place 
the usbacked government of president violeta barrios de 
chamorro has declared the strikes illegal saying they are 
politically motivated the government accuses the sandinistas of 
fomenting the labor unrest to undermine mrs chamorros economic 
recovery program 
on wednesday night seven prosandinista strike leaders were 
detained for two hours including lucio jimenez the 
secretarygeneral of the sandinista workers central the 
government said it was meant as a warning to other labor leaders to 
obey the law and not cause disorder 
the sandinistas say they are supporting the strikes because the 
new governments policies are threatening the gains of their 
revolution they contend the government has broken its promises not 
to fire public employees and say the unions are entitled under the 
constitution to a say in making national economic policy 
public employees won a 100 percent salary increase and other 
concessions during a crippling sandinistaled strike in may 
despite the governments warning the work stoppages continued 
to spread 
about 3800 telephone and postal workers joined the strike 
wednesday night operatorassisted international calls were not 
going through which caused considerable difficulties because most 
nicaraguans do not have directdial capability telex service 
continued normally 
the telephone and postal workers were staging what their leaders 
called a crossed arms strike similar to a sitin 
on thursday about 12500 bank employees began a similar strike 
action banks were open but no service was available 
about 3500 employees at the ministry of agriculture also went 
on strike thursday union leader jose angel bermudez said 
radio nicaragua reported wednesday night that thousands of farm 
workers had also gone on strike 
ramiro guardian vicepresident of the council of private 
enterprise a major business group said the strikes were 
preventing the planting of cotton an essential crop in nicaragua 
he blamed the labor protests on hotheaded sandinistas 
strikes continued thursday at other government offices 
including the customs service and the foreign labor construction 
transportation commerce and finance ministries 
air traffic controllers at sandino international airport 
threatened to strike and electrical workers announced they may 
begin scaled cuts of energy to the country 
students at most universities were also on strike on wednesday 
students briefly took over the stateowned radio nicaragua and 
national television system to read statements in favor of the 
strike 
jimenez claimed some 80000 workers in both the public and 
private sector were on strike as of thursday but estimates of the 
number of strikers by the sandinistaled unions have been 
exaggerated since the strike began on monday 
ariel bucardo president of the farmworkers federation said 
1000 members of his group were en route to managua the capital 
to support the strikers he said his union wanted the government to 
repeal laws allowing the return of some land confiscated by the 
sandinistas to the original owners 
the sandinistas redistributed some 5 million acres of land most 
of it held in absentia by wealthy nicaraguans who fled abroad 
during the sandinistas 10 years in power 
mrs chamorros new economic plans include returning most 
stateowned companies to the private sector and reorganizing the 
government both moves likely to cause job reductions 
the sandinistas led by daniel ortega were defeated in the feb 
25 elections by mrs chamorros 14party coalition

potentially fatal clots that develop after 
surgery may be triggered by high levels of a blood protein 
suggests a study published today 
mice that carried a human gene to make them produce excessive 
levels of the protein developed clots in their tails and hind feet 
researchers reported 
if further research confirms the link patients at risk for 
clotting may be identifiable before surgery by measuring their 
levels of the protein said researcher laurence erickson of the 
upjohn co in kalamazoo mich 
atrisk patients could receive preventive therapy and 
researchers may someday find a way to lower a persons level of the 
protein as a preventive step he said 
the protein called plasminogen activator inhibitor1 or pai1 
normally keeps the body from destroying clots prematurely 
the clotting condition is called deep venous thrombosis clots 
appear in veins usually in the leg they can kill if they break 
free and travel to the heart or lung 
clotting can appear after major surgery in cancer patients and 
people with an inherited tendency to develop them the condition is 
treated with anticlotting drugs 
between 200000 and 300000 cases occur in the united states 
each year with perhaps 20000 or more deaths a year said venous 
thrombosis researcher dr philip comp of the university of oklahoma 
comp said he believed it would be difficult to manipulate pai1 
levels to prevent the clotting disorder as for indicating patients 
at risk he said high levels in the blood may signal conditions 
unrelated to the risk even if high levels were related he said 
only a small percentage of people deemed at risk would probably get 
clots anyway 
erickson and upjohn colleagues presented their study findings in 
todays issue of the british journal nature 
the mice were given the extra pai1 gene before birth clotting 
appeared shortly after birth and resolved after production of 
pai1 fell back to normal

when the weather heats up sperm production goes 
down and this may explain why fewer babies are born in the 
springtime according to a study today 
while the study documents that men produce less sperm during the 
summer it does not definitely explain why 
population experts have long noticed that fewer babies are born 
in the spring months than at any other time of the year 
the researchers based at the chemical industry institute of 
toxicology in research triangle park nc dismissed one obvious 
explanation for the summertime dearth of conceptions 
they said that the available evidence does not support the 
idea that because its so hot people simply have sex less often in 
the summer 
what they found instead was that semen quality deteriorates 
during the summer 
this phenomenon may account at least in part for the reduction 
in the birth rate during the spring in regions with warm 
climates the researchers concluded 
the study directed by dr richard h levine was published in 
the new england journal of medicine it was conducted on 131 men in 
steamy san antonio texas 
all of the men worked outdoors at least part of the day their 
sperm concentrations were onethird lower in summer than in winter 
about 18 percent of their children were born in the spring 
compared with almost 30 percent in the fall 
there can no longer be any doubt that concentrationrelated 
measures of semen quality are reduced during the summer the 
researchers wrote 
exactly why however is unclear high temperatures interfere 
with the testicles ability to make sperm but in this study 
summer sperm production was lower even in those who spent part of 
the day inside in air conditioning so torrid summer weather may 
not be the whole answer 
the immediate implications of these findings is that although 
sperm counts are lower in the summer the mediating factor is not 
the heat of the summer wrote dr peter j snyder of the 
university of pennsylvania 
in an editorial in the journal he suggested another possible 
explanation maybe its the extra daylight not the heat that 
makes men less fertile in the summertime

see dick and jane run as long as its 
not from the childrens room to the rest of the oak lawn memorial 
library where trustees have adopted a pg13 librarycard 
policy 
beginning in september parents of children under age 14 will 
have the option of a library card that would restrict their young 
to the childrens room of the library period 
time magazine in the periodical area would be off limits 
ray bradburys book fahrenheit 451 in adult fiction would 
be out of reach so would whos who upstairs in the librarys 
reference section 
trustees say in an age in which children are bombarded with 
violent and illicit images the card will give parents the option 
of confining their children to appropriate reading material 
parents who arent interested in the special card may still get 
cards for their children that will give them free rein of the 
library 
i think the issue here is parental rights said dave 
gallagher a sevenyear trustee of the library who voted in favor 
of the plan at the boards june meeting 
as far as im concerned the whole policy puts in into the 
hands of the parent and takes it away from the library a 
government body said gallagher the parent has a choice and 
thats the key word here choice 
under the plan kids wishing to leave the librarys lshaped 
childrens area would be required to show a staff member their 
card if they have the special juvenile card they will not be 
allowed to leave the room 
the proposal which passed 31 with three members absent has 
met with the approval of some parents 
i wouldnt get the cards for my kids but i wouldnt criticize 
the board for issuing them grace kreten said last week as she 
browsed through the childrens section with her children 
10yearold kelly and 6yearold peter 
if youre on top of things as a parent then the library 
doesnt have to be mrs kreten said 
twelveyearold jason pollard a fan of sports books shrugged 
when asked about the new policy saying i dont care what they 
do 
others questioned the wisdom of the policy 
the library should be a place where everything is available 
said donna kordas who regularly brings her four children ages 2 
to 15 to the only library in this suburb south of chicago 
oak lawn librarians declined to discuss the new policy 
oak lawn is not unique in instituting such a card nearby 
arlington heights has a similar system already in place officials 
of the american library association said they feared the cards were 
a bad precedent 
if just one parent signs that card that denies child free 
access in the library weve been set back said association 
president richard dougherty kids who read succeed anything that 
puts barriers in front of that is not good he said 
the association does not keep statistics on how many of the 
nations 103000 libraries have such systems although the trend 
has been away from them said judith krug director of the 
associations office for intellectual freedom 
but every once in a while like in oak lawn the trend is 
reversed she said 
some child and adolescent psychiatrists also questioned the 
proposal 
the more children read the better off they are said dr 
aaron esman an adolescent psychiatrist who teaches at cornell 
university medical college in new york it almost doesnt matter 
what it is 
for libraries to discourage children from reading is 
inappropriate developmentally and culturally disastrous 
a nonprofit organization called friends of the oak lawn library 
said it would lobby with the board to reverse its decision 
ours is a very open library said monica stock secretary of 
the group how do they know that a child has that card are they 
going to mark them with a scarlet a

the 30 youths from around the country 
assembled at this summer sleepaway camp are here to study torts 
not sports 
welcome to the national lawcamp the child of a recently 
graduated lawyers shock bewilderment and fear during his first 
weeks of law school 
the camp offers students an introduction to law study without 
the intense grade competition the imposing professors personified 
by the late john houseman in the movie paper chase and without 
the hefty cost 
one of the things i saw was that a lot of students use their 
first year of law school to see if thats what they want to do 
said camp organizer chris salamone a fort lauderdale litigator who 
got his law degree two years ago from nearby nova university 
the threeweek camp is aimed at letting students know what 
theyre in for at law school for 1995 compared to typical 
tuitions that run into five figures the campers range from age 15 
to the mid20s and if theyre certain thats what they want the 
camp should give them a headstart on the oftenmystifying law 
school experience said salamone 
his father anthony has 30 years experience running summer 
sports camps mostly in new jersey and is helping get lawcamp 
going 
the students staying on the barry university campus in this 
miami suburb will find out about the heavy workload and the 
competition in a law career salamone said legal ethics also will 
be stressed 
were not all michael cusacks nova law professor michael 
flynn referring to an la law television lawyer told 
students as the camp opened sunday evening we spend very long 
hours its very hard work thats all 
ellis rubin one of miamis bestknown defense attorneys was 
the camps first guest lecturer 
you have to pay your dues you have to put in extra hours 
its very difficult to break in rubin said if you reach a 
point where youre valuable to other people then you will receive 
your reward 
rubin an attorney 39 years said that only in the past 15 years 
has he earned a comfortable living 
if after hearing such deglamorizing accounts students decide 
against a law career salamone said they have saved law school 
tuition and spent three weeks in south florida and you will know 
more law than 99 percent of americans so that cant hurt 
the campers will be taught by law professors who then stay 
around to study with them and answer questions salamone said that 
law professors often are inaccessible leaving beginning students 
confused and scared 
law school concentrates on analysis and procedure rather than 
the simple answeroriented teaching most students are used to 
salamone said 
law schools dont tell you what theyre doing they just do 
it salamone said 
the camp also offers mock trials and a law school admission test 
seminar and sample test 
its perfect for this time in my life said jennifer 
edwards a florida international university junior who hasnt 
decided on a career im not really sure what im going to do 
im hoping this will kind of push me over the edge 
sixteenyearold voselyn williams a senior at miami archbishop 
curleynotre dame high school plans to become a corporate lawyer 
she sees the camp as good preparation 
i dont want to go into anything blind she said 
as with any summer camp there are field trips to the broward 
county courthouse jail and crime lab 
its not all statute books and case studies time is planned for 
pool lounging softball volleyball and something that could come 
in handy after the future lawyers send their clients bills out a 
martial arts demonstration

the moslem pilgrims who crowded into the 
moessem tunnel in mecca were hurrying to perform the ritual of 
stoning the devil the climax of the annual pilgrimage or hajj 
many were running to their deaths 
what was supposed to be a joyful celebration by 2 million 
moslems from around the world suddenly became a nightmare of 
trampled bodies 
saudi arabian officials said 1426 pilgrims died monday trapped 
in the stampede in the 600yardlong tunnel hundreds more were 
injured 
the monthlong pilgrimage which every moslem must make once was 
coming to its end religious fervor was high 
it was the first day of the threeday eid aladha or the feast 
of sacrifice that marks the prophet abrahams willingness to 
sacrifice his son to god 
three piles of stonework represent the three devils who tried to 
tempt abraham away from sacrificing ishmael as a demonstration of 
his faith 
the hajjis the men in seamless white ceremonial robes as 
required by islamic custom the women in specially tailored clothes 
covering them from head to ankle were eager to get to the 
stonethrowing site in a bowlshaped vale hemmed in by rocky 
scrubstudded hills 
the tunnel 30 feet wide and 25 feet high is carved out of 
the moessem mountain to funnel the pilgrims to the holy site 
at one end is the tent city where pakistani and indonesian 
hajjis were camped out after the ceremonies in mecca birthplace of 
the prophet mohammed and islams holiest shrine 
the other end leads to the stoning arena called gamarat aqabah 
nearby there is a slaughterhouse used by the hajjis to kill 
hundreds of thousands of sheep during the threeday feast 
it was 10 am when disaster struck 
thousands of hajjis who had already stoned the devil were 
returning from gamarat aqabah on a pedestrian bridge from which 
they had cast their pebbles heading for the tunnel entrance 
under the pressure of the human tide the railing on the bridge 
collapsed seven pilgrims tumbled 25 feet off the bridge into the 
crowd of people coming out of the tunnel 
the bodies crashing into the throng touched off panic only 
those at the entrance of the tunnel knew what had happened 
behind them pilgrims continued to move inside soon the tunnel 
which has a capacity of 1000 was jammed with what authorities 
later estimated at 50000 pushing shoving pilgrims 
pilgrims heading for gamarat aqabah were also ignorant of what 
had happened and they kept thrusting forward 
soon those trapped inside the tunnel began screaming the panic 
spread like wildfire 
witnesses said many feared terrorists had struck as they did in 
mecca last year when a series of bombings killed one man and 
wounded 16 others 
in 1987 more than 400 people were killed in riots that saudi 
authorities say were instigated by iranian militants 
soon after the accident at the mouth of the tunnel there was a 
power failure no one knows exactly why the lights went out and 
the ventilation system went off 
the temperature in the open was 112 degrees the tunnel became a 
furnace 
people began to faint particularly the elderly in the 
suffocating congestion men and women tried to claw their way out 
in the darkness trampling over the fallen 
it was the same outside 
no one could go forward or back people were falling on 
each other the bodies piling on each other there was a mad 
rush and screaming an aide to the interior minister prince 
nayef said on saudi television 
one survivor said it was terrible people were rushing in 
opposite directions when one stumbled scores trampled him and 
hundreds fell on top of them in no time 
another a lebanese sobbed i was pushed and fell over about 
20 corpses others were still pushing in two directions and walking 
on top of me may god forgive me for trampling on the others 
as the scale of the disaster became evident security police 
forced their way through the sea of pilgrims to rescue those 
trapped in the tunnel which by then had become a tomb 
they sealed off both ends of the tunnel and threw ropes inside 
to pull out anyone who could grab hold they also threw in plastic 
bags of cold water for those trapped to drink until they could be 
reached 
first aid squads treated hundreds of victims on the spot 
ambulances nosed through the crowds taking the injured to 
hospital the dead to the morgue 
the wailing and weeping soon diminished replaced by a numbed 
quiet 
for islams faithful dying in mecca is supposed to be a joyful 
thing but for those who lost relatives and friends there was the 
ordeal of going around meccas 10 hospitals looking for them 
trying to find out if they were dead or alive 
one man woke up in a hospital bed after being unconscious for 24 
hours shouting for his wife no one knew where she was 
four young egyptian men with bloodshot eyes stood outside a 
morgue seeking word of a missing companion 
they had been about 10 yards from the mouth of the tunnel when 
disaster struck their friend had been ahead of them they never 
saw him again

amid escalating warfare between arts 
supporters and religious conservatives the fate of the national 
endowment for the arts may be decided this summer in a bruising 
house floor fight 
legislators on both sides agree that when congress votes on 
whether to extend the federal arts agencys life for another five 
years it almost certainly will impose restrictions on the content 
of works that receive taxpaid grants from the endowment 
the furor began more than a year ago with criticism of nea 
support for exhibitions of sexually graphic images by photographer 
robert mapplethorpe and artist andres serrano in recent months it 
has erupted in a barrage of emotional newspaper and radio 
commercials letterwriting campaigns and court battles 
endowment chairman john e frohnmayer caught in the crossfire 
since he took office nine months ago came under renewed attack 
last friday when he overruled an nea panels recommendations and 
rejected grants to four avantgarde solo performance theater 
artists 
the people for the american way action fund a liberal lobbying 
group said frohnmayers decision has the smell of politics all 
over it and was intended to placate rightwing critics of the 
arts endowment 
one of the rejected artists john fleck of los angeles charged 
that theres a strong movement going on to wipe out different 
voices to have a homogeneous voice that suits certain peoples 
morals 
solo performer rachel rosenthal of los angeles reportedly 
refused to accept her 11250 endowment grant saying the four 
rejected artists were among the best in their field why should i 
be considered clean and theyre considered dirty she asked 
ms rosenthal also refused to sign a controversial pledge that 
she would not use endowment funds for obscene indecent or 
blasphemous art a condition imposed by congress last fall at the 
urging of sen jesse helms rnc 
endowment officials say that of the 2000 grants awarded so far 
this year 670 artists or arts institutions have signed the 
agreement and received government money 12 have signed the pledge 
with letters of protest and a halfdozen have rejected grant 
awards the rest havent yet responded 
on the same day he rejected the four grants frohnmayer told an 
audience in his home town of portland ore that the stakes in the 
mushrooming controversy were high 
a remarkable experiment that has lasted the last 25 years and 
has so enriched our country is indeed threatened with either 
extinction or severe crippling because of 20 images out of a 
million we have funded he said 
frohnmayer who opposes the helms amendment said the arts 
community must share the blame for the bitter controversy that 
imperils the endowment an independent 171million federal agency 
whose arts grants must be matched by local private funds 
weve acted much like spoiled children asking our parents to 
continue sending us money regardless of what we do how we spend it 
or whether we are prepared to be held accountable he said 
nea officials refused comment on published speculation that 
frohnmayer might resign after the endowments reauthorization bill 
passes congress when asked during his portland speech if he 
planned to resign frohnmayer answered firmly no way 
although no date has been scheduled for house action on the nea 
bill arts lobbyists expect a vote sometime before legislators 
begin their monthlong summer recess in early august 
three or four major proposals circulating among house members 
include a conservative plan for severe restrictions on nea grants 
and a major overhaul of the endowment that would shift a 
substantial portion of grant funds directly to state arts councils 
some conservatives favor abolishing the endowment 
at the heart of the debate are conflicting arguments over the 
governments proper role in supporting the arts 
the arts community and its supporters contend that restrictions 
on nea grant recipients amount to government censorship that 
argument is rejected by conservative lawmakers and religious 
fundamentalists who say the real issue is the taxpayers right to 
decide where their money is spent 
the conflict is dramatized in toughly worded newspaper ads and 
radio spots sponsored by people for the american way and its 
nemesis the christian coalition led by evangelist pat robertson 
who was a conservative presidential candidate in 1988 
do you want to face the voters in your district with the 
charge that you are wasting their hardearned money to promote 
sodomy child pornography and attacks on jesus christ robertson 
asked in a fullpage letter to members of congress that was 
published in the washington post and usa today 
people for the american way put such performers as colleen 
dewhurst kathleen turner and garrison keillor on the air to 
counterattack 
imagine a world in which millions of people are at the mercy 
of a small band of extremists in which works of art are subject to 
government censorship and freedom of expression is a crime said 
miss dewhurst now stop imagining welcome to america 1990

democrat ann richards is not just looking 
for votes shes looking for her opponent in the texas governors 
race 
shes looking for gop nominee clayton williams the millionaire 
oilman and rancher who calls himself just a working cowboy 
ms richards the twoterm state treasurer claims that williams 
has been ducking her since he made a series of embarrassing remarks 
about women rape and youthful visits to prostitutes 
the only way clayton williams can win is if they keep him from 
being in the public eye if they can keep him from talking to the 
press if they can take him only to places that are very staged 
where he is not given access to the press she said 
williams shrugs off her barbs 
were ahead in the polls im going to work to stay that 
way he said 
williams for weeks declined to agree to a debate with richards 
but last week the two candidates finally began trading proposals 
about when where and how to face off 
we dont schedule our campaign for her convenience williams 
spokesman gordon hensley said of richards were starting to rock 
and roll in this campaign and shes still slipping and sliding 
williams drew fire in late march when he compared rape to bad 
weather he said that if it were inevitable relax and enjoy it 
then during a visit to the white house williams said he felt 
uncomfortable running against a woman 
i said i didnt want to be his mother i just want to be 
governor ms richards retorted 
finally williams admitted to the houston post that he had been 
serviced by prostitutes in his youth 
aides insist the colorful republican hasnt lowered his profile 
both candidates have spoken to many of the same groups just at 
different times 
williams has maintained an active pace they say including a 
trip to mexico for trade talks a dallas fundraiser featuring 
president bush and a fastmoving trip to the texas coast when the 
supertanker mega borg threatened to dump 38 million gallons of oil 
into the gulf of mexico 
any time you move from a primary to a general election there 
are certain dynamics of news coverage that change its important 
for us to make sure that when you have an event you go out and 
discuss particular issues hensley said 
the most recent public opinion poll published in late may gave 
the edge to williams 
the texas poll conducted for hartehanks communications inc 
showed the republican running ahead 46 percent to 38 percent with 
a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points the poll 
also found a gender gap in which men more strongly supported 
williams while women looked more favorably on richards 
williams who spent 6 million of his own money in a 9 million 
primary race is repeating one tactic that helped him win the gop 
nomination he began airing television commercials late in june 
more than four months before the november election 
ms richards said she wouldnt try to match the early ads 
one reason is it costs too much money and the publics memory 
is short she said there are two sides to claytons going up 
on tv early the good side is that they must feel like they need 
to the bad side is i know how much tv can drive poll numbers 
one issue sharply dividing the two candidates is abortion 
williams who opposes abortion except in cases of rape incest 
or danger to a womans life assailed ms richards for opposing 
legislation that would require teenagers to get parental consent 
ann richards has allowed the liberal feminist proabortion 
groups to set her agenda he said 
ms richards responded government has no business interfering 
in our lives any more than is necessary 
the two also duel over who is more qualified to be governor 
williams maintains his experience in the oil gas cattle and 
banking industries gives him the business perspective needed to 
control a government that spends 24 billion a year 
im an outsider and not part of the austin establishment a 
williams administration will challenge the status quo he 
promised 
ms richards links williams with another millionaire republican 
oilman retiring gov bill clements who had no earlier experience 
in public office 
weve played games all these years by electing someone who 
is not a part of government and youve seen the results of that 
they cannot make the system work ms richards said

after the floodwaters drained away 
shahar banu and her grandson returned to their village and found 
the earth slipping under their feet 
megaiyas land is eroding fast as it does every year the 
latest deluge by the monsoonswollen jamuna river and the receding 
water ate more loose topsoil this summer but now the erosion is 
threatening the village itself 
the countdown to destruction has started said hedayetullah 
almahmud a civil administrator at megaiya in the northern 
sirajganj district 
this summers flood washed away thousands of huts and weakened 
the foundations of the few concrete buildings in the village of 
3000 people 
district officials fear that in five years the erosion will 
trigger the collapse of the regions oldest establishment a school 
built in 1919 as well as a college a hospital a granary and at 
least 50 shops 
annual flooding is a major problem in bangladesh a lowlying 
delta crisscrossed by hundreds of rivers tens of thousands of tons 
of rice the staple of bangladeshis are lost to the encroaching 
rivers every year and the government reports hundreds of deaths 
the country is one of the poorest in the world with a per 
capita income of 160 when there are no floods bangladeshs 110 
million people are often reeling under drought the coastal areas 
are buffeted by frequent hurricanes 
flooding is a problem which brings temporary sufferings but 
here in our area river erosion is the main problem said abul 
kalaam azad a local official in megaiya 
mrs banu and her 15yearold grandson are resigned to the fate 
only allah can help us we have nothing else said mrs 
banu a 55yearold widow 
besides megaiya erosion is threatening the neighboring kazipur 
area also in sirajganj district azad said 
sirajganj 60 miles northwest of the capital dhaka was the 
worsthit in last months floods 
more than 600000 people were stranded in the sirajganj district 
and another 200000 in neighboring bogra people fled their 
inundated homes to take refuge atop levees and on the roofs of 
brick and cement houses 
most houses in the impoverished district have mudcoated bamboo 
walls and thatched roofs that wash away within a few hours whenever 
the jamuna floods 
azad said the jamuna has destroyed at least 20 villages in the 
past three years displacing 30000 inhabitants many of them 
resettled in neighboring districts or moved to cities he said 
last month the jamuna overflowed in at least 43 places during 
its 185mile journey from the hills in the north to the southern 
delta on the bay of bengal a water development board official said 
officials say privately that government efforts to tackle the 
annual deluge in the countryside have been halfhearted 
they say the focus of the flood control measures has been dhaka 
a city of six million people which was badly hit by floods in 
1988 at least 1400 people died nationwide in that years floods 
government officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
president hussain muhammad ershads administration has spent the 
equivalent of about 31 million to build a giant earthen dam around 
dhaka 
in megaiya many residents are preparing to move 
on sunday workers began emptying the 13yearold granary and 
shopkeepers shifted their wares to another place one mile away 
in another five years the building we are sitting in may be 
gone if the river continues its destruction at the current rate 
almahmud the civil administrator said 
government officials and local activists apparently have no 
solution yet to the erosion 
we think we will have to live with it azad said

hormone injections can reverse some of the damage 
of aging on the body and give people back the firmer flesh of their 
younger years a study released today says 
researchers found that injections of human growth hormone a 
oncerare protein made through genetic engineering will help old 
people build up sagging muscles take off flab and grow more 
youthfullooking skin turning back the clock as much as 20 years 
in just six months 
however they caution that the treatment is not the fountain of 
youth and should not be used routinely until questions are 
answered about its longterm effects and possible hazards 
and while it will firm up bodies it will not undo many of the 
other ravages of aging such as failing eyes and dying brain cells 
its also expensive with the costs of medicine alone for an 
average man running more than 10000 a year 
the pilot study conducted at the medical college of wisconsin 
involved 21 healthy men 61 to 81 years old 12 received the shots 
while nine received no treatment for comparison the volunteers who 
got the shots said treatment made them look better and feel 
stronger and their wives agreed 
what we saw over six months was that several of the body 
composition changes of aging were reversed said dr daniel 
rudman who directed the study these represented the reversal of 
one or two decades of aging with regard to these factors 
overall the mens lean body mass which is mostly muscle 
increased 9 percent their fat tissue decreased 14 percent and 
their skin became 7 percent thicker 
until now doctors have given this treatment known as human 
growth hormone mostly to children whose growth is retarded because 
they dont make enough of the protein 
however the bodys production of growth hormone also slows as 
people reach their 30s in about onethird of people it virtually 
stops by age 60 
this study is an early investigation of whether it may be 
useful to treat this very very large number of elderly people who 
have stopped secretion of human growth hormone rudman said 
such routine treatment would be expensive the hormone cannot be 
given in pill form and in this study people received three 
injections a week the size of the dose depends on the patients 
weight treating a 155pound man for one year would cost 13800 in 
medicine alone 
rudmans research was published in the new england journal of 
medicine 
while the study found no serious side effects from the hormone 
the volunteers blood pressure and blood sugar levels rose 
slightly rudman said doctors should be cautious in giving the 
hormone to elderly people who already have these problems 
rudman said he expects the treatment to be used first for 
relatively short periods to build up the bodies of frail elderly 
people such as those about to undergo surgery 
he said the therapy probably would not make people live longer 
but could improve the quality of life stronger muscles and 
healthier skin should result in better mobility fewer falls and 
less skin sores 
to prevent rather than reverse the effects of aging treatment 
might need to start when people are in their 30s or 40s rudman 
said much more research into the possible benefits and hazards will 
be necessary before such therapy becomes common 
in an accompanying editorial dr mary lee vance of the 
university of virginia described the work as an important 
beginning 
but she cautioned because there are so many unanswered 
questions about the use of growth hormone in the elderly and in 
adults with growth hormone deficiency its general use now or in 
the immediate future is not justified 
among the questions that remain are safety issues about its 
effect on metabolism whether it actually improves muscle function 
at what age treatment should start and how much of the hormone 
people need

most rural hospitals that have gone out of 
business were losing money because of their high operating costs 
rather than inadequate government subsidies congressional 
investigators say 
hospitals and members of congress have blamed a disparity in 
medicare payments to rural and urban hospitals for the financial 
plight of many rural facilities 
but a report by the general accounting office appears to support 
the bush administrations contention that rural hospitals are 
losing money primarily because their costs are too high 
medicare was not a major factor contributing to the financial 
decline and closure of most rural or urban hospitals that closed 
between 1985 and 1988 said the report released this week 
threefourths of the failed hospitals either profited from 
medicare patients or lost less money from treating them than other 
patients the report said 
under pressure from the health care industry congress last year 
decided to phase out the differential in medicare payments to rural 
and urban hospitals over five years the gap was cut from 12 
percent last year to 8 percent this year 
sen tom daschle dsd argued that inadequate medicare 
payments had cost rural hospitals money and reduced the health 
services to rural americans 
rep byron dorgan dnd introduced legislation this spring to 
eliminate the differential altogether next year 
most of the troubled hospitals are located in the central united 
states according to gao studies 
some 48 percent of the 140 rural hospitals that closed from 1985 
through 1988 were in texas and other south central states and 22 
percent were in the north central region 
failed rural hospitals usually are small and have low occupancy 
rates which contribute to their high operating costs the gao said 
hospitals that closed had occupancy rates 35 percent to 52 
percent lower than facilities that remained open the investigators 
said 
the investigators did say they could not rule out that medicare 
may have contributed disproportionately to the demise of some 
of the hospitals 
the department of health and human services inspector general 
found last year that more than 40 percent of rural hospitals made 
money on the medicare program because they operated at lower costs 
than other hospitals 
hospitals that were losing money tended to be smaller have 
lower occupancy rates and bigger stafftopatient ratios and keep 
patients longer according to that study

large increases in sales receipts for both 
crops and livestock are adding up to what the agriculture 
department sees as a banner year for farm income 
as charted by usda economists farm sales receipts make up the 
lions share of gross farm income big production and strong prices 
mean fat receipts 
government payments income from custom work sales of forest 
products and other miscellaneous cash sources account for the 
remainder 
on the other side of the ledger are farm expenses the costs of 
producing crops and livestock feed seed fertilizer interest and 
all the other related items go into that column 
in 1990 according to the departments economic research 
service farmers nationally may gross a record of 162 billion to 
168 billion from crops and livestock sales up from 158 billion 
in 1989 
livestock sales are expected to be in the range of 84 billion 
to 87 billion while crops sales are forecast at 77 billion to 
81 billion all figures are rounded 
not all products will share in the 1990 gains however the 
national figures also cloak the inequities farmers always face from 
one part of the country to another from one commodity to the next 
soybeans probably will be the only major crop showing smaller 
cash receipts in 1990 says economist diane bertelsen soybean 
prices are expected to be down about 15 percent from a year 
earlier and with little change in production soybean receipts are 
likely to be off 4 percent 
bertelsen writing in the july issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine said farmers will probably boost their sales of corn and 
other feed grains by 2 billion to 4 billion from last year 
fall corn prices are not expected to weaken as much as 
previously expected so the annual price could remain near last 
years average of 240 to 245 per bushel she said 
the price outlook reflects increased estimates of exports and 
domestic feed use despite a possible boost of 5 percent to 10 
percent in production this year tight supplies also are a 
contributing factor 
wheat production is expected to rise onethird this year while 
prices probably will be down 15 percent to 20 percent from last 
years level cash receipts for wheat cotton fruits and 
vegetables may be up less than 5 percent from 1989 
bertelsen said total livestock receipts in 1990 are forecast to 
rise by as much as 3 billion from last year to the forecast range 
of 84 billion to 87 billion 
reduced pork production and tight supplies are pushing hog 
prices up more than 20 percent from last years average while 
relatively stable beef production is likely to lead to a 3 percent 
to 4 percent increase in prices she said 
thus cattle and calf receipts may be up by as much 8 percent 
from last year while hog sales may rise by 20 percent 
poultry production is forecast to be up by about 7 percent in 
1990 although price declines of around 6 percent or 7 percent 
probably will keep total poultry and egg receipts flat at about 
15 billion bertelsen said 
looking at expenses the analyst said that prices of feed grain 
are showing less weakness than had been expected 
in the first quarter of this year economists thought the index 
of prices paid by farmers for feed would decline by 20 percent this 
year but now the decline is expected to be only half of that 
about 10 percent 
as a result 1990 spending for feed may decline only slightly 
this year and remain within 1 billion of 1989s 24 billion 
uncertainty about feed costs may be behind producers cautious 
approach to expanding herds despite higher hog and cattle 
prices bertelsen said 
spending for manufactured input items used in production 
overhead and operating expenses probably will increase 3 percent to 
5 percent this year interest expenses are expected to remain near 
15 billion for the third consecutive year 
meanwhile direct government payments to farmers probably will 
drop 2 billion or more to around 8 billion to 10 billion 
after adding up all the sales receipts and other figures 
deducting expenses and making other adjustments farmers nationally 
are expected to have a net cash income this year of 55 billion to 
59 billion compared with about 54 billion in 1989 the record 
was 572 billion in 1988 
by the agencys reckoning net cash income measures the value 
of commodities sold in a calendar year plus government payments 
less outofpocket costs some commodities sold actually may have 
been produced in earlier years and stored until marketed 
in another method of accounting the agency says net farm 
income may be in the range of 47 billion to 51 billion 
compared with last years record of 49 billion 
net farm income is used to measure the value of agricultural 
production whether sold or stored in a calendar year plus 
government payments minus all costs including depreciation and 
other allowances

western leaders began arriving wednesday for a 
summit to overhaul nato for a less militarized future as president 
bush said moscow could ease the flow of financial aid by curtailing 
defense spending 
faced with a rapidly diminishing threat from the soviets 
leaders of the 16 nato countries will open two days of talks 
thursday to discuss the political and military future of the 
alliance 
there were stirrings of unease from british prime minister 
margaret thatcher the host for the meeting about us proposals 
to make nato appear less threatening to moscow 
the prime ministers consistent point has always been that you 
dont prevent war by going soft a british government source 
said you prevent war by keeping up your guard and by deterring 
anybody who might have belligerent ideas 
bush arrived in london shortly after dawn thursday after an 
overnight flight from kennebunkport maine 
wrapping up a seaside vacation he told reporters he would look 
more favorably on western aid for moscow if the kremlin spent less 
money on defense 
i hope that given the changes in the world theyll be able to 
curtail that defense spending some bush said 
if they do i think it will be much easier for the west to 
give them certain kinds of economic assistance he said it 
will be a very good thing 
bush did not mention previous us demands that the soviet union 
adopt westernstyle economic reforms as a condition for receiving 
aid 
while he did not spell out specific goals for reducing moscows 
military spending bush has said the kremlin should drop its annual 
5 billion subsidy for cuba 
prodded by west germany and france western countries are 
debating whether to come to the assistance of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev and his crumbling economy western aid is 
widely seen as a way of easing soviet objections to a united 
germany being a member of the north atlantic treaty organization 
west germany already has agreed to pump 31 billion in loans 
into the soviet economy west european leaders agreed late last 
month to consider assistance for moscow but put aside a proposed 
15 billion aid package 
for his part gorbachev on wednesday gave himself and the soviet 
leadership two years to improve citizens lives or resign 
i think that in two years if there are no changes this 
leadership must go gorbachev told a tv interviewer as he entered 
the kremlin palace of congresses on the third day of the communist 
partys 28th congress 
it was the first time the soviet president and party leader who 
is facing bitter criticism from both radical reformers and party 
traditionalists has given himself and the leadership a deadline 
for turning around the countrys political economic and social 
problems 
on the eve of the london summit machine guntoting police 
guarded heathrow airports vip lounge and sharpshooters watched 
from the rooftops as a string of prime ministers foreign ministers 
and defense officials began arriving 
the early arrivals included the prime ministers of greece 
iceland denmark and spain canadian prime minster brian mulroney 
and secretary of state james a baker iii were arriving late 
wednesday 
security was expected to be even tighter on thursday during 
almost simultaneous arrivals by bush french president francois 
mitterrand and west german chancellor helmut kohl 
with the collapse of the sovietled warsaw pact nato is 
exploring ways to bring the nowoutdated military alliance into 
line with a changing world 
western leaders hope the changes will ease soviet concerns about 
east germany leaving the warsaw pact to join with west germany as a 
united nation in nato 
bush has proposed that nato leaders formally declare that 
nuclear weapons would be used only as a last resort a reversal of 
the 4decadeold policy favoring a firstuse nuclear option in the 
event of attack 
he also has recommended the eventual withdrawal of 1470 
nucleartipped artillery shells from europe and a reduction in nato 
forces along what is now west germanys eastern border 
western officials released some details of bushs proposals in 
advance perhaps to bolster gorbachev against conservative critics 
at a soviet party congress under way in moscow 
a senior british governnment source said mrs thatcher was cool 
to the idea of declaring nuclear arms as weapons of last resort 
and also was uneasy about the withdrawal of some 1400 nuclear 
artillery shells from europe 
referring to reduced eastwest tensions the source said the 
important thing is to recognize the enormity of the changes that 
have occurred but not to assume at the same time that all threats 
have disappeared 
in another step aimed at reassuring moscow west german defense 
ministry sources said in bonn that the government was willing to 
consider a soviet proposal that would limit the number of 
postunification german troops to about 400000 
that figure would correspond to the combined strengths of soviet 
and us forces in the region under a formula expected to be 
approved in conventional force reduction talks in vienna

president bush departed wednesday 
evening for the nato summit in london after advising the soviets 
anew to cut their military budget before looking to the west for 
economic help 
bush flew by marine one helicopter directly from his oceanfront 
home in kennebunkport to pease air force base in new hampshire 
then stepped aboard air force one for the overnight flight across 
the atlantic after a goodbye kiss from his wife barbara who flew 
back to washington 
the presidential aircraft left just after 725 pm and arrived 
in london on schedule at 2 am edt 
before wrapping up a sixday respite along the rocky coast of 
maine bush got in a final full day of recreation including 
boating and an early morning round of golf he headed out on the 
links despite a bandaged right hand that he cut cleaning fish he 
caught tuesday 
he paused on the 18th green at the cape arundel golf club to 
comment on soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadzes remark at 
the communist party congress in moscow that the soviets had 
ruined their country by squandering a quarter of our budget 
on military expenditures 
bush who has resisted calls by french president francois 
mitterrand and others to proffer western aid to the ailing soviet 
economy said he always maintained the soviets are spending too 
much on their military 
i hope that given the changes in the world theyll be able to 
curtail that defense spending some said the president and if 
they do i think it would be much easier for the west to give them 
certain kinds of economic assistance 
bush added that as a former chief of the central intelligence 
agency he was not surprised by shevardnadzes statement 
cutting the soviet military budget would free up funds to do 
more at home and itll also free up westerners willingness to try 
to assist on the economic front said bush 
it wasnt clear whether shevardnadze meant to refer to the 
soviet government budget or the soviet economy as a whole the 
united states spends about a quarter of its federal budget on 
defense but only about 6 percent of gross national product a 
recent cia estimate said the soviet union probably spends 18 
percent of a far smaller gnp on defense and some soviet economists 
have said the proportion could be a quarter or more 
bush plans 32plus hours of talks and ceremony with the 15 nato 
allies 
he already has sent the nato partners a proposal for 
farreaching shifts in the alliances military strategy in light of 
the disintegration of the warsaw pact 
a centerpiece will be to declare that the alliance would only 
resort to nuclear weapons as a last resort a step back from the 
flexible response doctrine nato has relied on since 1967 
after the whirl of events in the british capital bush will hop 
back aboard air force one friday for a 10hour flight to houston 
where the annual economic summit of the worlds seven wealthiest 
industrialized nations begins monday 
bush conferred with top advisers earlier in the week at his 
walkers point summer home on both summits and spoke by telephone 
tuesday with the prime ministers of denmark belgium and the 
netherlands 
bush spent much of his time in maine golfing fishing boating 
or playing tennis 
since he had to depart before dark on this independence day 
holiday the local fireworks were held a night early bush watched 
the tuesday night display from the wooden deck of the us coast 
guard eagle a threemasted tall ship 
bush readily lifted the bandage on his hand to display his 
fishing wound 
big fish yesterday a lot of them he boasted adding 
that he speared myself while filleting one of them

fed up with cubas refusal to 
recognize their government panamas leaders have ordered most of 
havanas diplomats out of the country 
eleven of the 15 cuban diplomats accredited in panama must leave 
within 10 days assistant foreign minister jose raul mulino said 
wednesday he said the embassy was advised of the expulsion orders 
on tuesday 
due to the repeated and systematic hostile conduct by the 
government of cuba against the legitimate elected government of the 
republic of panama the foreign ministry said in a statement 
only the charge daffaires the commercial and economic attaches 
and the consul will be allowed to remain 
cuba has repeatedly refused to recognize the legitimacy of the 
government of president guillermo endara which was installed 
during the us invasion that toppled strongman gen manuel antonio 
noriega on dec 20 
endara was on his way to victory in may 1989 presidential 
elections when noriega had the voting annulled 
noriegas wife felicidad and several of his associates took 
refuge at the cuban embassy after the us invasion and former 
noriega legislator luis gomez remains there 
in march the panamanian government gave mrs noriega his 
daughters sandra lorena and thais his soninlaw jean bauchamps 
and 10monthold grandson safe conduct out of the country 
it also expelled the cuban ambassador lazaro mora the 
highestlevel panamanian diplomat in cuba is a mission secretary 
us troops had surrounded the cuban embassy and residence after 
the invasion and noriega opponents picketed the embassy several 
times 
cuban president fidel castro had supported noriega who shared 
castros contempt for washington after us officials accused the 
panamanian leader of drug trafficking and pressured for his 
resignation 
noriega who took refuge in the vaticans embassy after the us 
invasion later surrendered and was flown to florida where he is 
awaiting trial on drug trafficking and moneylaundering charges 
cuban officials refused to speak with an associated press 
reporter who went to the embassy there was no unusual activity 
around the compound

perus presidentelect ended a bittersweet visit to 
his parents homeland today with private gifts for his stricken 
country including 66000 from an elderly woman who wanted to help 
perus hungry 
alberto fujimori did somewhat better in eliciting private 
donations than in gaining promises of aid from the japanese 
government 
japanese officials have denied that perus request for economic 
aid will be treated differently because of fujimoris japanese 
ancestry which he emphasized during the fiveday visit just as 
eagerly as he had while running for the presidency 
prime minister toshiki kaifu resisted making specific promises 
of aid until fujimori provides a concrete plan to cope with perus 
2000 percent annual inflation and 22 billion foreign debt 
officials said 
but citizens thrilled by the appearance of the first person of 
japanese ancestry to win national leadership outside japan showered 
the 51yearold former agronomist with money 
by midmorning today between 5 million and 10 million had 
been collected according to peruvian embassy officials 
fujimori who made a triumphant return to his parents hometown 
of kawachi on wednesday was to fly home later today 
among the private donors was 81yearold haruko miike of tokyo 
dressed in an elegant grey kimono the former restaurant owner 
handed a check for 10 million yen or about 66400 to fujimori at 
a downtown hotel as a gaggle of flashbulbs went off 
im happy mr fujimori will become president but i learned 
that there are a lot of people suffering from poverty in peru i 
wanted to do something while im alive she told kyodo news 
service 
because of the drought many children are starving fujimori 
told ms miike id like to use this to help the children 
another gift of 10 million yen in bills wrapped in a bluepaper 
bundle was given to fujimori by 78yearold taiji nagano a 
realestate company president he exhorted the presidentelect to 
do your best 
fujimori takes office july 28 perus independence day 
ivan pinto a peruvian embassy official said fujimori had 
received gifts from all over japan during the last few days mostly 
for the victims of a drought that has devastated the coastal areas

a jury convicted a christian science couple of 
manslaughter in the death of their 2yearold son in a case that 
weighed religious faith against parental responsibilities to 
provide medical care 
some jurors cried after finding ginger and david twitchell both 
34 guilty wednesday of involuntary manslaughter in the 1986 death 
of their 2yearold son robyn who suffered a bowel obstruction 
it has been hard on everyone and it was certainly hard on 
the jury david twitchell said minutes after the verdict was read 
this has been a prosecution against our faith 
but prosecutor john kiernan said the case was about crime not 
religion 
what the case proved is the right to believe is absolute the 
right to practice is not kiernan said 
a sentencing date is to be set friday 
the twitchells remain free but each faces up to 20 years in 
prison 
defense attorney rikki klieman said the twitchells will appeal 
she contends judge sandra hamlin failed to instruct the jury 
properly on a religious exemption that applies to child abuse laws 
the suffolk county superior court jury deliberated more than 14 
hours 
since 1980 there have been seven prosecutions of christian 
science parents five have been convicted one acquitted and one 
case was thrown out according to child rights activist rita swan 
who said no cases were tried in the 1970s 
founded in 1879 by mary baker eddy the church of christ 
scientist believes that physical disease like sin can be healed 
by spiritual means alone 
nathan talbot a spokesman for the bostonbased christian 
science church said hes confident the verdict will be overturned 
on appeal 
were deeply disappointed its still an unresolved issue 
he said it certainly isnt going to change spiritual healing 
robyns sickness and death on april 8 1986 were graphically 
detailed in two months of testimony that some experts said placed 
the christian science church on trial 
the important thing is to send a message to other christian 
scientists said swan who with her husband founded childrens 
healthcare is a legal duty inc in 1983 after their child died of 
meningitis when the christian scientist couple relied on faith 
healing 
their church has lied and lied and lied to them swan said 
in an interview from sioux city iowa where child is based 
the twitchells were accused of recklessly and wantonly causing 
robyns death by denying him conventional medical treatment 
trial testimony began may 4 with a jury tour of the twitchells 
former home in boston and deliberations began monday the 
twitchells now live in brentwood ny with their two other 
children 
david twitchell testified at the trial his wife did not 
prosecution witnesses described what robyn might have felt 
during his last day from agonizing pain to frequent vomiting 
medical experts also testified the boys life could have been saved 
by medical intervention almost up until the end 
klieman argued that though the twitchells made a mistake in not 
calling in a doctor their son did not appear to have a 
lifethreatening illness she also said the twitchells were being 
persecuted in violation of fist amendment rights to freedom of 
religion 
but kiernan said parents have an obligation to protect their 
children and that they sacrificed their child for the sake of their 
beliefs 
the case was built on testimony from medical experts emergency 
personnel christian science practitioners and former neighbors of 
the twitchells 
among key issues were the severity of robyns symptoms his time 
of death his parents actions in calling in christian science 
practitioners and whether the christian science church allows 
medical treatment when prayer fails

east german workers who have mounted warning 
strikes to press for higher wages and job security are only 
increasing the chances that their jobs will be eliminated west 
germanys economics minister says 
the minister helmut haussmann said in an interview published 
today by the newspaper die welt that east german industry must 
become more productive before its workers can afford to make 
demands 
in the next few weeks it will become clear who gets the upper 
hand psychologically whether its those who bring hope new jobs 
and a new way of life or the fearful and maybe even the 
malevolent he was quoted as saying 
lack of selfcontrol on the salary front will lead straight to 
unemployment haussmann said 
brief warning strikes involving up to 30000 people began 
monday the first work day after east and west germany formally 
merged their economies currencies and social welfare systems 
the east german news agency adn said several thousand metal and 
shipyard workers continued work stoppages on wednesday at plants in 
northern east germany 
the workers are demanding more pay better onthejob training 
and a guarantee that they will keep their jobs for at least two 
years adn said 
but there are few guarantees in the free market into which east 
germany is now entering and economists have predicted that up to 
one third of the former communist states 8000 businesses could 
fail 
the experts say as many as half of east germanys 8 million 
workers could lose their jobs under the pressure of competition 
from west germanys powerful and productive companies 
haussmann said some of this weeks strikes appeared to have been 
staged under remote control presumably from west germany 
whose powerful ig metall union has been helping its east german 
branch recruit thousands of members in recent weeks 
amid the labor unrest the east german cabinet set dec 2 as the 
date for electing members to an allgerman parliament and west 
germanys governing coalition gave its assent 
east germanys parliament still must approve it but that is 
unlikely to be an obstacle because prime minister lother de 
maizieres government has a parliamentary majority 
government sources said de maiziere would insist that elections 
for the allgerman parliament be kept separate from west german 
elections even if they occur on the same day 
the separation of the elections is an important issue because 
west german law requires political parties to win at least 5 
percent of the vote to obtain parliamentary representation 
there is no such law in east germany and some east german 
parties fear they would fail to reach the threshold if forced to 
compete in a single election in both countries 
west german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said that if 
the 5 percent rule were applied in both countries but the ballots 
were tallied separately a party in west germany would need 2 
million votes for representation while in east germany only 
575000 would be needed 
there are about 40 million eligible voters in west germany and 
approximately 12 million in east germany 
immediately after the election east germany is expected to 
declare itself unified with west germany under the west german 
constitution 
on friday schaeuble and east german parliament state secretary 
guenther krause will begin talks in east berlin on a second state 
treaty to iron out the constitutional and legal aspects of final 
unification

nelson mandelas us tour gave the american 
civil rights movement a glimpse of a hero at a time when it could 
use one associates of the late rev martin luther king jr said 
the visit of mr mandela came at a time when the american 
people not just black america are hungry and thirsty for somebody 
who can lift us to another level said longtime civil rights 
activist john lewis now a congressman 
but while the heirs to kings civil rights legacy in his 
hometown of atlanta emotionally embraced the south african leader 
last week movement leaders and scholars say it would be unfair to 
expect him to rekindle the civil rights movement in this country 
its hard to me to see it having that effect simply because 
the economic and social problems within urban black america are so 
serious now and so much more serious than 1968 when king was 
slain said david j garrow a pulitzer prizewinning biographer of 
king 
mandela the 71yearold leader of the african national 
congress was jailed 27 years in a south african prison for 
plotting sabotage to overthrow the nations white minority 
government he was released in february 
the antiapartheid leader raised more than 7 million for the 
anc and was greeted by enthusiastic crowds nearly everywhere he 
went during his eightcity 11day us tour that ended saturday 
the rev joseph lowery president of the kingfounded southern 
christian leadership conference said mandelas recent visit will 
have a lasting effect 
i think mr mandelas inspiration will spill over into several 
just causes related to the struggle for justice lowery said 
it puts new life into the movement he has done what we keep 
saying we are going to do when we say we shall overcome 
lewis dga said it will take grassroots activism to reignite 
the civil rights movement but he called mandelas visit a shot 
in the arm citing the african leaders charisma and moral 
message 
some people say you dont need heroes dont need leaders i 
disagree said lewis who was jailed 40 times between 1960 and 
1966 for his civil rights activities every generation needs some 
individual some flesh and blood embodiment of a cause or an idea 
jamil abdullah alamin known in the 1960s as militant protester 
h rap brown said mandela is a legitimate champion among the 
people but charged mainstream civil rights leaders used mandela 
for their own ends 
they would love to lend themselves to the energy that 
surrounds him the aura that surrounds him they are obsessed with 
raising money and they welcome any person or figure who would allow 
them to generate income he said 
others said it is dangerous to focus on one person 
most american blacks are not looking for a leader to replace 
king said joseph windham a professor of african history at 
atlantas morehouse college 
you always have a group of people looking for a messiah a 
great leader a great image windham said but i think the 
majority of people understand they have to identify with the 
movement the liberation struggle its dangerous to focus on 
one particular individual because if something happens to them the 
movement is decapitated

fellow krahns if he does capitulate 
but woewiyu who participated in the peace talks said there

bargaining point 
the civil war has pitted the krahns and mandingos against the

near the garden where the romans arrested 
jesus jerusalems jewish mayor sat unguarded in an arab cafe to 
show fellow israelis and tourists they are safe in the citys arab 
section 
mayor teddy kolleks effort wednesday to demonstrate it was 
businessasusual in arab east jerusalem came amid the worst wave 
of political violence to hit the city since the palestinian 
uprising began in dec 1987 
i am trying to take the edge off the apprehension kollek 
said as he drank arabic coffee at a small outside table in the 
tourist cafe near the garden of gethsemane 
the 78year old kollek sitting with his back to the narrow 
street and making business calls on a portable telephone said he 
was not worried extremists might attack him 
i never have guards he said other politicians rarely go to 
east jerusalem without armed security men and the main arab 
shopping streets are heavily patrolled by police 
the cafe kollek visited was empty except for one palestinian who 
stopped to see the mayor about a problem few israelis go to east 
jerusalem because of the violence of the uprising 
two weeks ago police placed a curfew on a nearby arab 
neighborhood after two palestinians were killed by police during 
antiisraeli rioting 
curfews are rare in jerusalem which has been calmer than the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip of the 721 palestinians killed 
in clashes with israelis during the uprising seven died in 
jerusalem six of the 45 israeli victims were slain in the city 
kolleks wellpublicized campaign to dispel fear began monday in 
a cafe near the old citys damascus gate where more than a 
halfdozen jews have been stabbed in the past two years 
lately violence also has spread to jewish sections of jerusalem 
one israeli was killed and more than 14 wounded in three pipe 
bombings in the past month jews rioted in response to the stabbing 
of an 11yearold boy and persistent arab stoning of cars 
jerusalem is home to some 120000 palestinians and 354000 jews 
120000 of whom live in neighborhoods built in the eastern sector 
after it was captured in the 1967 middle east war and annexed by 
israel 
kollek mayor since 1965 enjoys considerable support from both 
communities he is seen by many arabs as a political moderate who 
does not discriminate against the citys arab minority 
we like mr kollek said khaled ansari the palestinian who 
runs the cafe where kollek set up shop wednesdayhe has done good 
things for us 
kollek visibly uncomfortable in the hot middle eastern sun 
said he would probably have to limit the hours spent in arab 
neighborhoods in his confidencebuilding campaign 
i get much more work done in my office he explained

a japanese court has ruled for the first time that 
female workers were denied promotions due to sex discrimination 
awarding 18 women a total of 640000 in lost wages 
the lawsuit which took 10 years to wend its way through the 
court system was filed by women who worked for a semigovernmental 
medical insurance fund 
this is an epochmaking ruling that will lead to making other 
corporations review their labor practices said eiko shinotsuka 
a labor economist at tokyos ochanomizu womens university 
there are many other japanese companies discriminating against 
females she said after wednesdays ruling 
in addition to the 733000 requested in the lawsuit the 
plaintiffs asked that the women be given promotions allegedly 
denied on the basis of sex the court refused saying that it could 
not direct such personnel decisions 
the women employees of the social insurance medical fee payment 
fund charged that fund agreements in 1978 to provide raises and 
promotions for only male employees violated japanese law 
women comprised about half of the funds total 6300 workers 
the tokyo district court said promoting the male employees while 
excluding their female colleagues constituted sex discrimination 
it awarded 640000 in lost wages that the women would have 
received if promoted court officials said today 
it was a long fight said yoko tsuji one of the 18 
plaintiffs im very happy if this ruling will help other women 
victimized by discrimination she told the newspaper yomiuri 
shimbun 
japans constitution forbids discrimination based on sex and 
its labor laws require equal treatment where salaries are concerned 
in another development female members of parliament on 
wednesday protested the appointment of a man as the new head of the 
womens bureau a division of the labor ministry hyakutaro 
takahashi will be the first man to occupy the post since the bureau 
was established in 1945 
although womens voices are increasingly being heard in 
government japans womens movement is small the nations first 
sexual harassment case was filed only last year but since then the 
number of such complaints has ballooned

the government ministry that helped engineer 
japans exportfueled economic boom says the global powerhouse must 
now turn inward and set its own house in order 
funding priorities once almost exclusively targeted to 
industrial growth should shift to the nations frayed 
infrastructure and frustrated consumers says the an advisory 
report approved today by the ministry of international trade and 
industry 
while short on specifics the ministrys vision for the 1990s 
addresses many of the demands for economic reform made by the 
united states in talks that led to last months agreement on ways 
to tackle the us trade deficit with japan 
these include a push for more spending at home on public works 
such as roads sewers and parks areas in which japan lags 
behind other major developed nations a summary of the report 
said 
the report also repeatedly urges that japan make life easier for 
its highpaying consumers who should have the opportunity to 
choose what to purchase and the chance to decide what price to 
pay 
it was an oblique admission that prices have been kept 
artificially high by governmentprotected home markets where the 
staple food rice costs several times more than on world markets 
the ministrys criticism seems to contradict its own annual 
white paper issued two weeks ago which concluded that the high 
trade surplus with the united states was caused by natural factors 
not closed markets 
the report also warns however that manufacturing is still 
vital to japans economy it recommends that the government nearly 
double funding of research and development to about 1 percent of 
gross national product 
kunio morikiyo director of the ministrys policy planning 
office denied at a news briefing that the push for internal reform 
was a response to the socalled structural impediments initiative 
talks with the united states 
nonetheless the report echoes policy guidelines issued in may 
by a panel of bureaucrats and lawmakers from the governing liberal 
democratic party 
those guidelines also were believed to reflect japans eagerness 
to resolve the unremitting trade dispute between the worlds two 
most powerful economies 
internal reform is a must morikiyo said if japan is to 
avert a worsening of economic friction between western countries 
particularly in the vacuum left by the disintegration of the 
communist east bloc 
it is extremely urgent that japan find solutions to these 
problems during the current decade while it still has a strong 
investment capacity the report says 
among other key recommendations of the report miti says japan 
should 
increase the housing supply by solving the the expanding 
bubble of land prices property tax reform and zoning changes 
have been proposed as solutions 
take the lead in protecting the global environment 
particularly by reducing the level of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere 
reduce working hours to 1800 a year from 2076 in 1989 
despite the difficulty caused by a tight labor market 
advance the position of women by building a social framework 
that enables men and women to cooperate and share domestic tasks 
that until now have fallen mostly on women

once again the white house and congress are at 
odds over how to protect a revered american institution 
first it was the american flag now its the american family 
congress passed legislation requiring employers to grant parents 
up to three months of unpaid leave for medical emergencies or the 
birth or adoption of a child bush vetoed the bill saying the 
measure forces businesses to provide a benefit that they should be 
free to negotiate with employees 
if our nations employers are to succeed in an increasingly 
complex and competitive global marketplace they must have the 
flexibility to meet both this challenge and the needs of their 
employees he said 
the dispute over family leave could lead to partisan bickering 
over an institution every bit as revered as the flag bush sought a 
constitutional amendment against burning the flag but congress last 
month rejected it as an infringement on freedom of speech 
in the case of the family leave bill veto override prospects 
are uncertain at best 
the house passed the family care legislation in may just before 
mothers day by a 237187 vote thats 46 votes shy of the 
twothirds majority needed to override a presidential veto 
the senate passed the measure on a voice vote on june 14 but 
according to sen christopher dodd dconn a substantive test 
vote on the issue came out 5545 in favor or a dozen votes shy of 
the needed twothirds majority 
the president is going to have this bill on his desk every 
year hes going to have to veto a family and medical leave bill 
one way or another dodd says almost angrily im going to 
serve this legislation up to him hes going to have to explain and 
explain and explain as the situation gets worse out there 
meanwhile a congressional turf fight along with a possible 
veto threatens a landmark child care measure 
among the disagreements are whether congress as dodd proposes 
would review the child care aid program every year or whether as 
the house favors the aid should become an entitlement that would 
automatically roll over every year 
bush has said he will veto any child care measure that spends 
more than 15 billion over five years both house and senate 
versions exceed bushs limit 
in some ways the strengths of the two bills are also their 
weaknesses according to some observers and participants they 
concern the needs of twoincome families and single mothers forced 
by economics into the workforce 
only one american family in 10 consists of a working father and 
a stayathome mother more than half of all mothers of infants 
work outside the home and by 1995 twothirds of all preschool 
children will have mothers working full time outside the home 
conservatives support family leave because it promotes the idea 
of a mother being home at least temporarily with her child yet 
some including the president say the bill intrudes on the right 
of businesses to set their own employee policies 
family leave has won some support from antiabortion activists 
such as rep henry hyde rill hes consistent with his 
profamily posture said donna lenhoff of the womens legal 
defense fund which supported the family leave bill its 
difficult to tell a woman to carry a child to term and then lose 
her job 
child care has run into opposition from fiscal conservatives who 
dont want to create another government entitlement program for the 
poor ideological conservatives object to the implication that the 
government favors working mothers over those who stay at home 
that both bills are in congress simultaneously also has been a 
disadvantage according to some 
child care is stalled for good reason it created two new 
entitlements at tremendous cost and it helps only a small fraction 
of the population said rep marge roukema rnj a leading 
house backer of family leave the family and medical leave bill 
is far more consistent with the family values that republicans have 
talked about over the campaign period 
family leave dodd said is a matter of human decency much 
in the way the federally mandated 40hour work week was deemed a 
matter of human decency decades ago child care he said addresses 
an obvious human need 
added lenhoff child care is what you need when everythings 
normal youre going to work and you need help caring for your 
kids family and medical leave is what you need when you cant go 
back to work

western nations are pushing forward 
with financial help for economicallystricken eastern european 
nations while stopping short of embracing similar relief for the 
soviet union 
foreign ministers of twodozen western nations agreed wednesday 
to extend to czechoslovakia yugoslavia bulgaria and east germany 
an assistance program initially set up to help poland and hungary 
they refused to include romania because of recent violent 
repression of protesters there 
no specific dollar numbers were committed in the discussions 
here the western nations previously had pledged more than 12 
billion in food economic and environmental assistance to poland 
and hungary 
this was not a pledging session said secretary of state 
james a baker iii 
the foreign ministers ducked the troublesome question of direct 
economic assistance to the kremlin however in their final 
statement they discussed the situation there and merely 
underlined their interest in positive developments toward a 
democracy and a freemarket economy 
the issue of aid to the kremlin which pits the united states 
for the most part against west germany and france was expected to 
surface at the summit of nato leaders opening today in london 
it also was likely to dominate next weeks economic talks in 
houston among president bush and the chiefs of six other leading 
industrialized nations 
in recent weeks west germany has urged its allies to quickly 
fashion a 15 billion to 20 billion aid package to support soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs beleaguered perestroika program of 
economic reforms 
we cannot expect the soviet union to resolve problems 
regarding the transition to a market economy on their own west 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher told reporters in 
brussels 
he said the kremlin badly needs financial help and advice 
it is in the common western interest to give this support to 
the soviet union because a deterioration of the situation there 
will put gorbachev off course and in danger genscher said 
but baker said the united states has some difficulties with 
the idea of giving economic aid to moscow with no strings attached 
we think that the absence of real progress toward a market 
economy in the soviet union argues against the provision of 
assistance at this time baker said at a news conference 
he also said the kremlin was spending as much as a quarter of 
its economic output on the military we have to ask ourselves the 
question why not get some of that money from those sources 
baker said 
even so he said the united states wants to see gorbachevs 
programs work 
a reformed soviet union is a more open and more stable and 
therefore more secure soviet union and thats in the best interests 
of the west in general baker said 
gorbachev has not formally asked for western help 
but the issue of western aid has become linked to efforts to win 
gorbachevs backing for immediate and full membership of a united 
germany in the 16nation north atlantic treaty organization 
the western hope is that with a massive aid program the kremlin 
leader would drop his objections west germany belongs to the nato 
military alliance but east germany is part of the sovietled 
warsaw pact 
leaders of the european community the 12nation trading bloc 
recently agreed in principle to provide assistance to gorbachev but 
rejected francogerman calls for immediate help 
the leaders asked aides to consult with the kremlin about 
proposals for shortterm loans and longer term assistance 
the foreign ministers at their meeting wednesday on aid for 
eastern europe asked to take a look at the communitys work when 
it was completed human rights 
speaking of the ministers refusal to include romania in aid 
plans baker said the actions of leaders there raise serious 
questions about the governments commitment to democratic reform 
and basic human rights 
frans andriessen the european communitys top foreign affairs 
official said the nations would like to help romania when 
conditions improve 
this is not an attempt to isolate he said the door is 
still open

the postal service footed the cost when 
hundreds of postmasters mailed letters to the us chamber of 
commerce defending a proposed increase in postal rates 
for a week the chambers washington office has been getting 100 
letters a day from postmasters and other postal employees in the 
midwest and western states the organization says 
about half the letters are in envelopes marked official 
business which carry a penalty for private use a few dozen 
contain form letters 
chamber officials object its wrong for people on the 
government payroll to be using government time and resources to 
lobby said tracey schreft of the chambers small business center 
but the postal service says the letters were official business 
and were needed to combat a chamberpublished brochure against the 
proposed new 30cent stamp 
titled cancel this stamp the brochure invites the chambers 
member businesses to battle the rate increase and join the fight 
against waste in the postal service 
the brochure contains inaccuracies and distortions intended to 
discredit the great job were doing said jim mruk a 
chicagobased postal service spokesman 
we feel the use of the penalty envelope is warranted mruk 
said this is part of the normal course of doing business we 
have no apologies for it at all 
the independent postal rate commission has until early next year 
to review the agencys rate increase plan a firstclass stamp 
would go from 25 cents to 30 cents post cards from 15 cents to 20 
cents and the cost of sending a sevenpound package would rise 
from 4 to 506 
the postal service says it does not know how much the 
postmasters letters cost because it is uncertain how many were 
sent 
mruk said there was no organized effort to lobby the chamber 
rather he said the central regions postmaster general wrote 
the chamber about the brochure and sent copies to mediumlevel 
managers who shared them with postmasters 
all the letters are from the postal services central region 
which includes colorado wyoming the dakotas minnesota iowa 
kansas nebraska wisconsin illinois indiana michigan and 
missouri 
as an employee who works closely with the community and the 
chamber of commerce i must complain strongly and bitterly against 
the article being disseminated from your office entitled cancel 
this stamp began a letter from postmaster cecelia white of ada 
kan 
the letter criticizes the brochure for alleged inaccuracies and 
for soliciting postal service horror stories from businesses 
the same letter arrived from postmasters in partridge redfield 
and other kansas communities all were in officials envelopes 
instead of bearing stamps 
in an interview white she did not think about paying for the 
letter herself 
were willing to put stamps on some things i didnt think 
they told us to put a stamp on this she said 
a letter from postmaster robert j herman said i am going to 
tell the business community of raymond ill the truth about the 
requested postage rate increase by the united states postal service 
the best postal system in the world 
last month the postal service withdrew a 21000 advertisement 
from a chamber magazine following stories critical of the rate hike 
plan

authorities in yugoslavias largest 
republic today dissolved the local legislature and government in 
its troubled southern province of kosovo the state news agency 
tanjug reported 
the move by the republic of serbia is likely to cause more 
unrest by the ethnic albanian majority in kosovo the nations 
least developed region 
the decision by all three chambers of the serbian parliament 
came in the wake of mondays declaration by 114 ethnic albanian 
deputies in kosovos provincial assembly to secede from serbia 
belgrade television said 
the document proclaimed kosovo equal in status to yugoslavias 
republics and declared that ethnic albanians the thirdlargest 
ethnic group in the country would no longer be considered a 
minority 
yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and two 
nominally autonomous provinces kosovo a province of 19 million 
90 percent of whom are ethnic albanian has progressively lost 
control of its affairs to serbia 
the decision to dissolve kosovos 188member legislature and the 
local government of premier jusuf zeinulahu was read to deputies 
during thursdays assembly session according to journalists in the 
provincial capital pristina 
delegates were informed that all elected officials in the 
regional government were suspended 
ethnic albanians seek restoration of the broader autonomy they 
enjoyed under a 1974 constitution that was amended in march 1989 
serbs who consider kosovo the cradle of their medieval kingdom 
claimed that ethnic albanians were pressuring the remaining slavs 
to move out of the province 
since the constitution was amended about 60 ethnic albanians 
have been killed in clashes with security forces 
ethnic albanians who have been demanding free elections and a 
multiparty system deny they discriminate against slavs in their 
province they say that claim has been used by serbias communist 
leader slobodan milosevic to gain popular support for his 
hardline policies 
serbias communist leadership is proposing a new state 
constitution that would effectively remove any vestige of 
selfgovernment enjoyed by its southern province the elimination 
of kosovos parliament under a new constitution would make ethnic 
albanians a small minority in the serbian parliament 
the decision to dissolve the regional parliament is an illegal 
one and the albanian people will not recognize it said ibrahim 
rugova leader of the democratic forum an ethnic albanian group 
that claims 500000 members 
serbia currently does not have any constitutional right to do 
such a thing he said adding that the forum would call on ethnic 
albanians to remain calm in the face of this provocation 
both the parliament and the government should continue to 
function normally because ethnic albanians have the majority 
he said 
serbian authorities also announced they were imposing 
unspecified extraordinary measures on pristinas radio and 
television as well as in the local telecommunications company 
tanjug reported it said the measures which appear designed to 
give serbia full control over the media will also extend to the 
albanianlanguage rilindia publishing house kosovos largest 
meanwhile results of a referendum held sunday and monday in 
serbia on whether to hold multiparty elections before adopting a 
new constitution showed 968 percent of the population voted for 
the government proposal to delay a free ballot the results of the 
vote in which some threequarters of serbias 67 million 
registered voters took part were released thursday 
opposition parties which demanded that elections be held before 
enactment of a new constitution had called on supporters to 
boycott the referendum 
yugoslavias northern republics of slovenia and croatia 
increasingly have sided with kosovo in its drive for autonomy from 
serbia 
this spring the republics held their first free elections in 45 
years for local legislatures both votes were won by centerright 
parties which trounced the communist parties that called the 
elections 
yugoslavias other three republics are scheduled to hold free 
elections later this year 
and on monday slovenias parliament proclaimed the states full 
sovereignty the declaration provides for an independent legal 
system that would take precedence over federal laws and for 
slovenian control of armed forces stationed in the republic 
slovenia the most prosperous of yugoslavias republics 
contains 2 million of the countrys 23 million population the 
republics new authorities demand that yugoslavia become a loose 
confederation of sovereign states 
but the communist government of serbia vehemently opposes 
turning yugoslavia into a confederation serbia also rejects 
westernstyle democracy for yugoslavia created in 1918

nearly 100 homeless people early today 
spent what may be their last night sleeping in a plaza outside city 
hall 
starting tonight police are under mayor art agnos orders to 
arrest homeless who sleep in public places 
it aint going to work said butch a twoandahalf year 
resident of civic center plaza where the homeless were spread out 
in sleeping bags tents or just a few blankets theyre just 
going to go somewhere else 
butch who would not give his last name moved out of the plaza 
four months ago but he said hes thinking about moving right back 
i pay rent now i pay 225 a month for what a 
roachinfested ratinfested room he said many homeless 
complain about the poor conditions of the shelters and other 
housing alternatives offered to them 
city officials defend their plan as a new approach to serving 
the homeless by offering them a way to rejoin society 
its a start agnos said this week the idea is to move 
these people out of the parks out of being homeless and into 
transitional and permanent housing 
in santa cruz homeless activists from around the state squared 
off with angry residents on independence day over the issue of 
whether freedom extends to allowing people to sleep in public parks 
about 200 homeless activists rallying outside the santa cruz 
county courthouse demanded an end to the citys camping ban 
saying people should be allowed to sleep where they can 
the activists were outnumbered by about 600 counterdemonstrators 
who said they were tired of giving santa cruzs bums and 
squatters a free ride in the seaside town about 75 miles south 
of san francisco 
critics in san francisco had accused agnos a liberal democrat 
of waffling on the homelessness issue for years 
he was torn for the last two years between a campaign promise to 
clean up the plaza and a vow to not break up the sprawling 
encampment until a viable alternative was available 
this week the city took over two comprehensive service 
shelters more than 150 people have moved into them 
but those still in the plaza and advocates of the homeless 
remain critical of the mayors plan 
this is unconscionable cruelty put on the victims of society 
for the sake of window dressing said tom osher of food not 
bombs an organization that has been feeding the homeless in the 
plaza since last july 
the net effect of the eviction notice is that it does 
absolutely nothing osher said everybody is just going to 
move 
many of the homeless who stayed at the plaza were not sure what 
they would do once the deadline arrives asked where they would go 
many shrugged their shoulders and murmured somewhere else 
on monday outreach workers began encouraging the civic centers 
homeless to report a municipal office that would give them an 
alternative to life on the streets by tuesday 82 people had 
reported to the office and 64 men were sent to a new shelter nine 
blocks from the civic center 
but homeless advocates charge that the cleanup program will 
force 215 people already staying in a shelter out on the streets to 
make way for the displaced civic center homeless the new policy 
also will break up couples and force many people into jails 
doorways or alleys they said 
whats going to happen friday night is san francisco will 
start criminalizing homelessness said josh brandon of the 
coalition on homelessness

mikhail s gorbachev acknowledged to local 
communist leaders that the kremlin had cast them adrift as it 
rapidly switched signals in a bid to quiet republics demands for 
autonomy a local official said today 
gorbachev met with more than 300 officials late wednesday after 
the soviet president had given himself and his leadership a 
twoyear deadline to improve citizens lives in the soviet union 
filip stroganov a party leader from the baltic republic of 
latvia said gorbachev had converted him from an opponent to a 
supporter during the meeting which lasted late into wednesday 
night 
i like people with character stroganov said yesterday i 
saw his character 
the latvian delegation met with reporters today as delegates to 
the 28th communist party congress broke up into sections to debate 
economic military farm regional and other issues 
reporters were allowed to attend the first three days of the 
congress but were not permitted in todays section meetings 
the official tass news agency in a brief statement reported 
there were sharp polemics on social economic and agricultural 
party policy in the sectional debates but did not provide any 
details 
stroganov said regional leaders complained that gorbachev and 
the central leadership changed their minds too often on a new 
structure to bind the soviet unions republics 
latvias neighbor lithuania already has declared independence 
the parliament of latvia and the third baltic republic estonia 
have signaled their intention to follow 
we dont have a clear position on this question stroganov 
said in the course of a year opinions in the center were 
changed three times first we were talking about a renewed 
federation then we were talking about a confederation and today 
just a little while before the congress we started talking about a 
union of states 
the lack of a precise position on this issue put us in an 
awkward situation stroganov said 
gorbachev agreed with this yesterday he added the regional 
leaders had been pressing for a meeting for more than two years 
and gorbachev also acknowledged it was a mistake to put it off for 
so long he said 
the soviet leaders council of the federation recently has begun 
meeting to try to work out a new treaty among the republics but 
the baltic republics still want to be out altogether and other 
republics as well are clamoring for more autonomy 
the latest formulation of a union of states not yet 
welldefined is intended to take those strivings into account 
stroganov also said regional party leaders demanded more freedom 
from moscow we dont need centralism we need democracy he 
said 
earlier wednesday gorbachev told journalists that the 
leadership should quit if its reform program does not show results 
in two years 
it was the first time that gorbachev had given a deadline for 
his reform program which was launched when he took power in 1985 
i think that in two years if there are no changes this 
leadership must go gorbachev said 
he did not specify who would be covered by his selfimposed 
deadline but it seemed likely it was meant for both party and 
government leaders 
most important soviet officials still hold key posts in both the 
communist party and the soviet government 
speaking confidently in a videotaped segment shown on the 
nightly tv news program vremya he denied that the kremlin 
leadership would do anything just to hold onto political power 
i will tell you before perestroika we had more power i dont 
know who had more power than the general secretary of the central 
committee if it had only been for my sake there would have been 
no need for any reforms renewal in either the party or in 
society 
the leadership has made mistakes and errors but it was 
courageous in starting his reform program he said 
in wednesdays session gorbachev heard bitter criticism of his 
program from party officials who accused the leadership of 
cowardice and indecision in an ideological battle against growing 
anticommunist sentiments 
our position today reminds of an army that is retreating in 
haste without a plan said nursultan nazarbaev party chief in 
the kazakhstan republic as he pleaded for clearer direction from 
the kremlin 
despite a second day of sharp criticism however speakers 
displayed no new ideas and no alternative to reelecting gorbachev 
to another fiveyear term as party chief

reelected former dissident playwright vaclav havel as president 
completing the political transition from communist to democratic 
rule 
he is to serve a twoyear term 
the immensely popular havel running unopposed was elected with 
the necessary threefifths majority in a nationally televised 
secret ballot a total of 234 deputies voted for him and 50 
against 
there were no abstentions sixteen deputies were absent 
i think the fact that there were 50 deputies voting against me 
is a very good significant and convincing evidence of the 
democratic character of my election i am quite rejoicing over 
that i would not feel good if i had been elected by 100 percent as 
was my precedessor havel said 
havel was to deliver his inauguration speech later in the day 
havel who on dec 29 became the countrys first noncommunist 
president in 42 years was nominated by civic forum and its slovak 
counterpart public against violence the two groups led the 
peaceful revolution that toppled the hardline communist regime in 
november 
the parliamentary session held in a medieval hall at the 
hradcany castle was opened by parliament president alexander 
dubcek whose prague spring reforms of 1968 were crushed by 
soviet tanks 
by the election of the president the revolutionary 
transition which we have been living through since november will 
be ended dubcek said 
he praised havel as a man who has proved competent as a 
politician and statesman vaclav havel playwright in the seat 
of president has gained by his work the confidence of our 
people 
he proved himself even in the times of repression of freedom 
and rights when it was not easy or convenient to show a firm stand 
of a citizen and bravery dubcek said 
the former czechoslovak leader said havel deserves great 
credit for the fact that our development even in the most extreme 
situations has not slid toward revenge political intrigues 
confrontation and intolerance 
after the ballot havel was led by dubcek and other officials up 
the redcarpeted aisle of the vladislav hall to sign the oath of 
office 
as a military band played the national anthem inside the hall 
the sound of a 20gun salute reverberated throughout the city 
after the parliamentary session havel accompanied by defense 
minister miroslav vacek attended a military parade at the castles 
third courtyard 
he was the only candidate for the office stefan kvietik who 
was nominated by the separatist slovak national party refused the 
candidacy

the cia trained guatemalan guerrillas at a 
mexican ranch owned by a drug lord convicted in the murder of us 
drug agent enrique camarena a federal report says 
but the drug enforcement administration report does not detail 
why the guerrillas were being trained nor whether the central 
intelligence agency knew who owned the ranch 
the cia denied the report details of which the los angeles 
times published today 
the whole story is nonsense agency spokesman mark mansfield 
said today we have not trained guatemalan guerrillas on that 
ranch or anywhere else 
the cia does not engage in drugrunning activities he said 
wednesday 
the report completed in february said the guatemalan 
guerrillas were trained during the early 1980s at a ranch near 
veracruz owned by rafael caro quintero and that a guerrilla clash 
there left 19 mexican police dead 
caro and two other men are serving prison terms in mexico for 
their roles in the 1985 torturemurder of camarena and his pilot in 
guadalajara four other men are on trial in los angeles over their 
alleged involvement in the slaying 
the dea report became available in los angeles on tuesday night 
after us district judge edward rafeedie ordered prosecutors to 
turn the information over to the defense the times said 
it was based on an interview two dea agents conducted in 
september with government informant laurence victor harrison 
harrison according to court documents ran a communications 
network for drug lords and their mexican law enforcement allies in 
the early and mid1980s the times said 
harrison told the dea agents that cia operations personnel once 
stayed at the home of drug trafficker ernesto fonseca carrillo 
also convicted in the camarena case 
on feb 9 harrison said the cia used as a cover the mexican 
federal security directorate at the same time members of that 
directorate were working with major drug overlords to ship 
narcotics to the united states harrison said 
sometime between 1981 and 1984 members of the mexican federal 
judicial police who went to the ranch on a separate drug 
investigation were confronted by the guerrillas harrison said 
as a result of the confrontation 19 mfjp agents were killed 
many of the bodies showed signs of torture the bodies had been 
drawn and quartered he told the dea agents

a cargo inspector at john f kennedy 
international airport spotted a cache of bombs and guns before they 
were loaded onto a plane but the weapons turned out to be fake 
officials said 
the decoys supplied by the federal aviation administration are 
used by pan american world airways to train baggage inspectors to 
detect the real thing 
the inspector was checking the cargo for flight 403 to florida 
on wednesday when he spotted suspicious items in two boxes port 
authority police evacuated the baggage room and notified the fbi 
and the police department bomb squad 
police cleared the baggage room at 645 am and it was kept 
closed until 925 am when pan am officials told police what had 
happened 
as far as we knew we had real explosive devices said port 
authority police lt louis echavarria 
the airline delayed six flights for up to 20 minutes because of 
the scare said pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon 
it was a mistake not to notify the baggage inspector that the 
items were being shipped she said but it does show that the 
screening device and the screening procedure is working

the agriculture minister resigned today in 
anticipation of a major cabinet shakeup by prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki who is under pressure to dismiss holdover communists 
from key posts 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska told reporters 
that mazowiecki intends friday to bring to a close a certain 
stage of activity by the east blocs first noncommunist 
government 
but she declined at a news conference to reveal how many other 
ministers would be ousted or what new programs mazowiecki would 
propose 
the progovernment gazeta wyborcza newspaper said today that up 
to 10 of the 24 cabinet members could be dismissed in the 
realignment 
it said mazowiecki would use the occasion to counter the 
campaign solidarity chairman lech walesa has mounted against him 
splintering the popular movement that rallied to oust the 
communists 
agriculture minister czeslaw janicki of the peasant party handed 
in his resignation during an appearance before parliament this 
morning he said he had failed to obtain special consideration for 
farmers to protect them from stringent economic reforms that have 
outraged them 
a certain stage of our activity is coming to an end now the 
prime minister will speak about it tomorrow said mrs 
niezabitowska 
she added that the polish people should be proud of the path 
of peace taken by the government in its attempt to transform 
poland into a democracy and urged poles to adopt similar peaceful 
means in political conflicts to come 
the current cabinet was installed sept 12 after 45 years of 
communist rule 
the government has been under increasing pressure in the past 
two months grappling with a major rail strike two farm protests 
that required police intervention and steady criticism from walesa 
and other elements of solidarity 
walesa has been urging mazowiecki to replace holdover 
communists hold early parliamentary and presidential elections and 
speed privatization of state enterprises 
the interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak a former communist 
still in charge of the police is considered a prime candidate for 
ouster diplomatic sources said his removal is definite 
kiszczaks department has been criticized for destroying 
evidence of its past activities and new accusations surfaced this 
week that it continued to spy on solidarity even after mazowiecki 
was named prime minister 
widely lauded in the west for its determined effort to tackle 
polands economic problems the governments popularity has 
dwindled at home 
according to a survey by the state polling service released 
tuesday just 64 in 100 poles expressed support for the government 
that compares to approval ratings of 80 percent to 90 percent in 
the fall before the government implemented its shock economic 
reform program 
the program ended subsidies and has all but halted inflation 
but poles buying power has suffered and the reaction has been 
sharp protests from hardhit sectors 
among those protesting most loudly are polands 25 million 
private farmers 
walesa is widely believed to be gearing up to run for president 
to replace former communist leader gen wojciech jaruzelski who 
parliament elected to the post as part of a political deal that 
would make it easier for the communists to surrender control 
as part of the deal mazowiecki also agreed to leave the 
powerful police and army ministries in the hands of the communists 
and to give them two other ministerial slots transportation and 
foreign trade 
however with the subsequent collapse of communist rule 
throughout eastern europe and the soviet unions acquiescence to 
the changes many poles have argued that the communist no longer 
pose a significant threat to the stability of the solidarity 
government

here is an icy thought that oddly might make a 
hot summer seem even hotter the savings and loan bailout which 
could cost taxpayers 300 billion may be just the tip of the 
iceberg 
if the tip is equal to a sum of that size the single most 
expensive governmental cost in peacetime then how massive must the 
bulk of the berg be 
conceivably in the trillions of dollars says economist ronald 
utt who points out that financial obligations of agencies 
underwritten by the federal government now total 58 trillion 
and much of that obligation is in bad shape says utt vice 
president of the us chamber foundation a former employee of the 
white house office of management and budget and a former heritage 
foundation fellow 
potentially he says these financial obligations represent a 
staggering breakdown of government and a growing number of 
critics are saying the lack of public information on the matter 
represents a communications breakdown 
most people it seems safe to say cannot imagine that other 
financial breakdowns are threatened reasoning that if that were so 
they would have heard of them but that logic breaks as throroughly 
as the communications 
the obligations utt refers to are spread among deposit insurance 
programs loan and pension guarantees direct loan programs such as 
those administered by the small business administration and debts 
of five government enterprises 
utts chilling observations are contained in a paper written for 
heritage a conservative think tank whose opinions sometimes have 
been influential in the bush and reagan administrations 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp says utt is by no 
means the only federal credit program confronted with huge losses 
the federal deposit insurance corp and federal housing 
administration lost money in 1988 and 1989 and seemed destined to 
lose again in 1990 the fha he says has seen the level of claims 
against its shrinking reserves rise nearly three times in three 
years 
further he states half of the farm loans made by the farmers 
home administration are in default and half of these defaulted 
loans have been in that condition for more than three years 
on and on it goes 
the federal government he notes stands behind nearly 500 
billion in guaranteed veterans administration and fha mortgages 
48 billion in guaranteed student loans 
and a host of other guarantees ranging from rural 
electrification to shipbuilding loans and from small business 
disaster loans to loans for building plants to convert grain to 
ethanol 
all together he estimates the contingent liability associated 
with loan and deposit guarantees totaled 35 trillion at the end 
of fiscal 1988 and other insurance programs flood insurance for 
instance add 500 billion more 
how could such massive obligations not rise to the surface and 
break more forcefully into the media how can such dangers lurk so 
near and not cause more concern 
utt doesnt have an answer to those questions but he does 
suggest that both congress and taxpayers played a role 
most lawmakers he says tried to convince americans that the 
crisis was just an isolated incident and that the vast bulk of the 
government credit programs are wellmanaged and pose little risk to 
the taxpayer 
and for their part many taxpayers have wished this to be so 
it isnt says utt who advocates passage of an omnibus credit 
solvency act to fundamentally restructure these many programs in 
order to reduce taxpayer exposure to costly program failures 
before it is too late he adds

military threat from the soviet union greece turkey west germany 
and spain later joined the alliance

against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be 
considered an attack against them all

the berlin wall has fallen the german economy has merged free 
elections have replaced most of the totalitarian leaders of eastern 
and central europe and red army troops and tanks are preparing to 
go home how can nato after four decades as a military alliance 
poised against the warsaw pact transform itself into a mostly 
political organization following the collapse of communism in 
eastern europe 
nato leaders are expected to order a review to develop a 
negotiating position for reducing shortrange nuclear weapons in 
talks with moscow the kremlin suggests that those negotiations 
begin this fall but nato insists that they take place only after 
an agreement to reduce tanks artillery and other conventional 
forces in europe 
the ministers are expected to nudge negotiators from the east 
and west to wrap up the slowmoving conventional arms talks and 
pledge to make even deeper cuts in a later round of discussions 
they also will likely discuss the strategy of forward defense 
brought into question by the prospect of a united germany 
forward defense refers to the stationing of troops to defend the 
front line during an attack the idea is to defend territory at its 
border and not give up any land to invading soldiers the border 
between east and west germany has historically been considered part 
of the front line but it is soon to be erased

a japanese professor who has built a car 
powered by highly volatile liquid hydrogen demonstrated the vehicle 
today and said it causes almost no air pollution 
industry officials said however it may take 10 years to 
produce a commercial version of the car developed by shoichi 
furuhama president of the musashi institute of technology 
the cars liquid hydrogen fuel is made from water and costs 
2280 a gallon in japan officials said 
in a test drive today the car known as the musashi 8 reached 
a speed of 82 mph test drivers at nissans oppama factory near 
tokyo said they believed the musashi 8 could reach a speed of 94 
mph 
the car does not backfire before combustion a defect that has 
slowed previous research on hydrogenfueled cars furuhama said i 
has computerrun pumps and valves that keep the liquid hydrogen at 
minus 453 degrees 
furuhama said the car creates almost no air pollution 
the engine is in a nissan fairlady z body nissan has provided 
financial support and technical assistance to furuhamas research 
team 
but the new vehicle still has many problems its developers said 
liquid hydrogen is exremely volatile and engineers are concerned 
about the dangers of explosion in a crash furuhama said the 
difficulty of obtaining liquid hydrogen has prevented scientists 
from thoroughly studying its safety 
a researcher working with furuhama said on condition of 
anonymity the car also must carry a large volume of fuel hydrogen 
cars sometimes have been jokingly referred to as cars which carry 
fuel and not passengers he said 
yasuhiko nakagawa a researcher at nissans central engineering 
laboratories said the fuel mileage is also not as high as for 
conventional vehicles

an ohio congressman met with a 
former nazi rocket scientist and sharply criticized the us 
government for trying to keep him out of the country 
rep james traficant said arthur lh rudolph a former nazi 
party member passed a lie detector test wednesday in which he 
denied having worked slave laborers to death during world war ii 
traficant said rudolph was the victim of an unfair investigation 
by the us justice departments office of special investigations 
which is responsible for hunting down former nazis living in the 
united states 
they have fared very poorly traficant a democrat said of 
the nazi hunters theyve looked for high profile cases to 
justify their existence 
rudolph a close friend and coworker of german rocket chief 
wernher von braun since 1934 was brought to the united states by 
the army after world war ii to develop the us rocket program 
eventually rudolph supervised the design and production of the 
saturn 5 rocket which took us astronauts to the moon 
but in 1984 faced with what the osi said was evidence of his 
involvement in war crimes rudolph voluntarily renounced the us 
citizenship he had been granted admitted his complicity in war 
crimes and left the country he was allowed to keep his pension 
from the national aeronautics and space administration 
he has been living in hamburg west germany but came to canada 
on sunday for what he said was a vacation with his wife and 
daughter and also to meet with traficant about returning to the 
united states 
rudolph claims to have acted as an advocate for the slave 
laborers who built v2 missiles for the nazis during the war and 
has said he helped them get extra rations whenever possible 
the us government estimates that as many as 20000 workers 
died while building v2 rockets at an underground plant in central 
germany 
with the 84yearold rudolph sitting beside him traficant said 
the scientist was coerced into renouncing his citizenship and now 
wants to return because he does not want to be remembered as a war 
criminal 
dr rudolph has decided that history and how theyll record 
his name may be more important than the hassles which hell 
undertake traficant said 
rudolph blinking constantly under the strain of camera flashes 
and television lights refused to discuss the case 
on tuesday justice department spokesman doug tillett said the 
department still considers the agreement rudolph signed in 1984 
valid 
traficant said if rudolph is guilty of war crimes he shouldnt 
be getting his nasa pension and benefits 
hes getting almost 50000 a year from the us treasury if 
hes a nazi war criminal i dont want him to get a dime 
traficant said if he is innocent i want him to be returned to 
the united states america is his home he helped put america on 
the moon 
rudolph who was detained for 8 hours upon his arrival in 
canada sunday faces an immigration hearing in toronto friday to 
determine whether he can remain in that country 
canadian jewish groups have called for rudolphs immediate 
deportation 
i think its shameful that canada has allowed rudolph to come 
in and permit canada to be a launching platform for a vile 
political attack against the us justice department and its legal 
system said sol littman canadian representative of the simon 
wiesenthal center which tracks former nazis 
us rep bill paxon a republican from buffalo ny also 
criticized traficants efforts to return rudolph to the us 
nazi war criminals should be hunted down tried convicted and 
jailed not honored and extolled as congressman traficant is doing 
for rudolph paxon said in a statement 
traficant also has defended john demjanjuk a retired cleveland 
auto worker who was convicted of nazi atrocities and is on death 
row in israel

nelson mandela is following up on a rockefeller 
foundation idea for a bank that would channel international 
investment to south africa once the apartheid system is abolished 
foundation head peter c goldmark said wednesday that mandela 
wants to have it ready to go when a representative government in 
south africa is chosen 
mandela goldmark and several officials of the african national 
congress met in london on tuesday to continue discussions and form 
a working group 
goldmark made the proposal at a june 22 meeting between the 
antiapartheid leader and business leaders in new york 
he likened it then to the marshall plan which helped 
warravaged europe 40 years ago and efforts now being made to help 
eastern european countries recover from communism 
other executives at the meeting said the idea appeared to 
generate strong interest and mandela called the proposal 
constructive and imaginative 
goldmark said in a telephone interview from his brooklyn home on 
wednesday that the hourlong followup meeting was held at 
mandelas request 
he didnt let any grass grow under his feet on this one 
goldmark said 
goldmark said he would work with two anc officials foreign 
secretary thabo mbeki and treasurer thomas nkobi to design a 
structure through which that business interest can be channeled 
other governments also will be approached as potential 
contributors he said 
they are going to lead the effort he said referring to the 
anc the rockefeller foundation would assist with the actual 
mechanics of setting up an organization 
goldmark said mandela had not ruled out creating an agency 
under the roof of an existing institution such as the world 
bank 
but he said he felt a separate bank would be an identifiable 
focused mechanism for tapping the energy and interest thats out 
there

the pilots of two container ships that 
collided last weekend disagree over the exact spot of the accident 
and claim the other was on the wrong side of the channel 
the pilot of the outbound columbus america told a coast 
guardnational transportation safety board investigating panel 
wednesday that his ship was well within the outbound section of the 
1800footwide channel into hampton roads 
at the worst i would have been 600 feet north of the buoy 
that would have still given him 1000 feet said capt richard l 
counselman jr 
on tuesday capt john a jones pilot on board the inbound 
neptune jade said the columbus america was too far north in the 
eastwest channel 
how that happened i do not know he was well out of 
position jones said 
the ships collided sunday evening in a heavy rain squall that 
limited visibility the columbus americas fuel tank was ruptured 
spilling 30000 gallons of fuel oil most of the oil ended up in 
the elizabeth river section of the harbor as the ship returned to 
port spewing oil 
each pilot was asked to draw their courses on separate maps 
jones plot showed him almost on top of a buoy marking the northern 
boundary of the channel when the accident occurred 
counselmans plot showed him on top of the buoy marking the 
south boundary of the channel 
neither ship kept a series of fixed positions on their charts as 
is the case with military ships which are required to keep exact 
records of their positions at all times said coast guard officials 
the panel was to try to sort out the discrepancies today during 
questioning of counselman 
jones has been a pilot with the virginia pilots association for 
17 years counselman has piloted for the association since 1950

five paris art museums closed their doors today to 
individual visitors after paintings were stolen from three museums 
including a renoir cut out of its frame at the louvre over a span 
of several hours 
jacques sallois director of national museums said security 
would be tightened at the citys major museums which remained 
open he refused to say what measures would be taken 
the museums closed to individuals are relatively small and focus 
on the works or the collections of a particular individual the 
eugene delacroix gustave moreau jeanjacques henner hebert and 
ennery museums 
sallois unprecedented announcement came shortly after police 
revealed that a third museum had suffered a theft during the short 
time span wednesday 
police said it was possible all three thefts were committed by 
the same person or group moving across the city center from one 
museum to another 
according to investigators the theft revealed today apparently 
was the first to occur in the series 
an 1816 work by french landscape painter paul huet was lifted 
off its hook wednesday morning at the carnavalet museum a 
historical museum in one of the oldest sections of paris 
the painting les moulins de la glaciere was estimated to 
be worth about 14500 
the other two stolen paintings were cut from their frames 
renoirs portrait of a seated woman from the louvre and ernest 
heberts portrait of monaluccia from the museum named after the 
artist 
both were small format paintings a type often chosen by thieves 
because they can be easily concealed 
portrait of a seated woman 18901895 measures 135 by 
105 inches heberts work painted about 1870 measures 14 by 12 
inches 
the theft of the renoir was discovered about 215 pm 
officials said the hebert was discovered missing from the hebert 
museum across the seine river on the left bank about an hour 
later 
all three victimized museums are run by the government 
officials gave no estimates of the value of the renoir and 
hebert independent experts suggested a possible value of 300000 
to 600000 for the renoir but said it was impossible to give a 
precise valuation and noted that renoir had done scores of 
portraits of women in his later years 
the louvres director michel laclotte said the theft of 
portrait of a seated woman appeared to be the work of an 
especially clever professional 
the canvas was very thin the cutting instrument was probably 
extremely sharp and caused so few vibrations that the electronic 
sensor did not pick them up he said 
laclotte led reporters to the spot where the portrait had been 
hanging an isolated stairwell leading to the denon gallery on 
the top floor of the pavillon de flore overlooking the seine 
head painting curator pierre rosenberg said the renior had been 
on display in the stairwell for several years due to renovations 
in other sections of the museum once a royal palace it was 
donated to the louvre in 1961 by french collector victor lion 
rosenberg said renoir was a magic name among art lovers 
which could explain the theft the first at the louvre in more 
than 10 years 
sallois said there was no evidence of negligence on the part of 
museum guards and expressed confidence in the staff

northern city of 200000 with the traditional firing of the 
chupinazo a rocket blasted from the city hall balcony that 
sets off the celebrations with a bang 
the festival of san fermin made famous by hemingway in his 1926 
novel the sun also rises is expected to double the citys 
population as thousands of revelers arrive for one of the worlds 
wildest parties 
the more daring or foolish will participate in the daily 
running of the bulls which routinely results in gorings and 
tramplings and sometimes even death 
the ritual occurs each morning of the festival when six bulls 
charge down city streets along a halfmile route to the city bull 
ring 
hundreds of people race ahead of the bulls hoping not to trip 
or get caught in some of the tight turns along the route 
most escape unscathed but not all are so lucky since the 
festival began 52 people have been gored to death according to 
city records last year seven people were seriously hurt and 198 
suffered slight injuries 
the annual festival honoring pamplonas patron saint was 
inaugurated in 1394 plagues and wars forced its cancellation 
several times but it has run continuously since 1591 
the first of the bull runnings is set for saturday morning each 
evening the six bulls that run the city streets will be killed 
during bullfights at the city bull ring

the nations farmers are moving toward the 
21st century in a financial condition much improved from a few 
years ago an agriculture department report said thursday 
the proportion of farms that are financially vulnerable today 
is half that of 1985 the report said farmland prices have 
stabilized and are beginning to rise 
but the number of farms in the united states continued to 
decline throughout the 1980s as they have almost unabated since 
1935 the report said according to the 1987 census of 
agriculture there were just more than 2 million farms down 7 
percent from 1982 when the previous census was taken 
small farms although fewer in number increased as a proportion 
of total farms midsized farms declined both in number and their 
share of the total 
the number of large farms continued to increase the report 
said this trend shows little prospect of reversing in the near 
future 
the analysis by the departments economic research service was 
based on an annual report to congress on the status of family farms 
virtually all farms in the united states are familyowned 
businesses the report said fewer than 3 percent of all farms 
are organized as corporations most of which are family held 
only 03 percent are corporations owned and operated by people 
other than a family single families own 87 percent of all farms 
and multifamily partnerships operate the remainder 
because almost all farms are owned and operated by one or more 
families we did not define family farm for this report the 
agency said 
thomas a carlin one of the authors said a snapshot of the 
farm sector shows that most us farms are small noncommercial 
and usually family owned and operated 
noncommercial units were defined as those having gross farm 
sales of less than 40000 a year 
small noncommercial farms produce a minor share of total 
us food and fiber he said they are typically located near 
more densely settle urban areas where nonfarm employment 
opportunities abound 
the small farms often operate at a loss with farm expenditures 
exceeding commodity sales government payments and other 
farmrelated income 
family wellbeing for these small farms depends primarily on 
offfarm income and their average total income in most years is 
commensurate with that of all us families he said 
most of the nations food and fiber is produced by very large 
commercial farms that are highly capitalized carlin said owners 
of such large farms typically control several million dollars of 
land machinery and other assets 
many of the largest farms produce fruits vegetables and 
horticultural specialty crops crops not covered by federal price 
and income support programs he said 
farming is the dominant occupation for families operating large 
holdings and annual income in most years is above that of the us 
average 
families with large operations do report offfarm income but 
that is typically interest rent or dividends rather than from a 
job paycheck with some exceptions most large farms are located 
away from major urban centers in areas conducive to largescale 
operations 
the number of midsized commercial farms those in between the 
extremes continues to shrink carlin said most of these farms 
produce food and feed grains that are included in federal commodity 
programs 
thus he said midsized farms get more than half of all direct 
government payments operators are usually employed fulltime on 
the farm but often someone else in the household works off the 
farm

congress is moving slowly toward an agreement 
to require doublehulled oil tankers and barges but 
environmentalists already are complaining about a possible 
exemption for smaller vessels that ply inland waterways 
house and senate conferees next week begin working out 
differences in their versions of a longawaited oil spill bill 
which would increase penalties for spills and hold shippers liable 
for environmental damage 
conferees are expected to agree that two layers of steel are the 
best barrier between crude oil and the environment but 
environmentalists say they worry that smaller barges will be 
exempt which could imperil rivers and ocean harbors particularly 
in new england where traffic is heavy and sea beds are rocky 
were concerned because the smaller barges get into 
semienclosed bodies of water ecosystems they could destroy with 
just a small spill said clifton curtis of the environmental 
group friends of the earth 
congressional staffers environmentalists and shipping industry 
lobbyists say it is clear what the final version of the legislation 
will look like they expect a requirement that new tankers and 
oceangoing barges weighing over 5000 gross tons have double hulls 
which consist of a second layer of steel and an airspace between 
the sea and the cargo older vessels would have to be either phased 
out of operation or refitted with second hulls 
at this point the double hull requirement is a foregone 
conclusion said a house staffer who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
but curtis and other environmentalists cite coast guard 
statistics that indicate a majority of spills involve barges under 
5000 gross tons in 1988 for example 68 percent of the tanker or 
barge oil pollution incidents investigated by the coast guard 
involved the smaller vessels 
statistics compiled by the lexington mass consulting firm 
temple barker amp sloane inc show that of 310 oilcarrying barges 
only 72 are in the heavier weight group that under the house bill 
would be required to have double hulls by the year 2015 
ernie corrado president of the american institute of merchant 
marine shipping said the tanker operators represented by his group 
realize that new barges either foreign or domestic will be 
required to have double hulls 
weve accepted that he said 
corrado said owners already have begun ordering new vessels with 
double hulls 
but corrados group and others argue that double hulls also 
carry risks gases trapped between the hull walls could cause an 
explosion and a breach in the outer wall could allow water in the 
cavity between the hulls capsizing the vessel 
the national academy of sciences is working on a study expected 
to detail some of the weaknesses of double hulls the senate wants 
to give the secretary of transportation authority to review that 
study along with other data to see if alternatives to double hulls 
would work as well or better 
its not simply a question of economics its a question of 
safety said joe farrell president of the american waterways 
operators a trade association representing coastal shippers 
including oil barge haulers 
the oil spill legislation has been debated in congress for 15 
years but efforts to pass it out were stepped up after the exxon 
valdez spill of march 24 1989 the super tanker ran aground on 
bligh reef in alaska spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil into 
prince william sound 
less sensational but still damaging to the environment have been 
barge spills in new york harbor and buzzards bay mass 
among other provisions the bill would create a 1 billion 
cleanup fund through a 5cent tax on each barrel of oil created in 
or imported to the united states it also would establish coast 
guard oil spill response centers along us coasts 
the doublehull provision is among the few remaining issues in 
dispute between the house and senate

an abortion clinic says it may use reggae 
musics positive vibrations to drown out the chants of protesters 
at its door 
mary litman a spokeswoman for womens health services inc of 
pittsburgh said the clinic may hire a reggae band to play during 
the next large protest by project multitude a pittsburgh 
antiabortion group 
the band would play louder than singing protesters and 
possibly drive away those who dislike reggae music ms litman 
said the blend of rock n roll and calypso is performed by such 
jamaican artists as yellowman and the late bob marley 
we are going to take the initiative and try to have some 
control over what goes on ms litman said 
in june womens health services solicited pledges from 
supporters based on the number of people who attended an 
antiabortion demonstration the clinic collected 2800 after 350 
people attended the protest or about 8 per picket ms litman 
said 
i would rather that our patients and their husbands and 
mothers and friends be able to walk into our clinic in total 
privacy ms litman said but we cannot keep the pickets away 
so we will use this to thumb our noses at them 
the pledge drives and other tactics will not deter the protests 
including one planned for september said mary irwin director of 
project multitude 
if the ku klux klan tried to make money off the number of 
blacks protesting in alabama i hope that would not discourage them 
for standing up for what is right in selma ms irwin said

weather changes caused by unusual pacific 
ocean currents may have led scientists to overestimate how much the 
earth has warmed up in recent decades according to a new study 
but says the author it may be that global warming helped cause 
those changes in the ocean 
jim angell of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration has calculated the amount of global warming 
associated with the el nino events over the last couple of decades 
subtracting the ocean effects reduces the global warming by 
onefourth between the 1960s and the 1980s according to angells 
report being published friday in geophysical research letters a 
journal published by the american geophysical union 
but he cautions against quick assumptions about which is cause 
and which effect 
it may be that part of the increase in global warming is a 
result of the strength of the el nino events in the 1980s but it 
may also be that the global warming led to more and stronger el 
ninos angell said in a telephone interview 
concern about global warming has grown in recent years with 
many scientists worried that increasing carbon dioxide and other 
gases in the atmosphere will act like a greenhouse overheating the 
planet 
scientists have estimated that the layer of air closest to the 
earth warmed by 033 degrees celsius 059 degrees fahrenheit 
between the 1960s and the 1980s 
several of the warmest years recorded occurred in the 1980s a 
time when at least two of the socalled el nino events also took 
place 
angell of noaas air resources lab in silver spring md noted 
that ocean warming in el ninos can contribute to changes in global 
temperature 
el nino events involve unusually warm water moving eastward in 
the pacific ocean they can affect weather events worldwide during 
their lifetime of a year or so the strongest el nino in at least a 
century occurred in 198283 and a milder one took place in 198788 
angell found that after subtracting the effect of the el nino 
warming from the record the air had warmed by 024 degrees celsius 
043 degrees fahrenheit 27 percent less than the original 
calculations 
in addition 1988 is no longer the warmest year on record being 
only slightly hotter than the overall average angell concluded in 
the journal article 
subtracting the effects of the el nino also cuts in half the 
annual variations in global temperature angell explained and 
makes it easier to see the cooling that results from volcanic 
eruptions 
scientists had expected the eruptions of the indonesian volcano 
agung in 1963 and mexicos el chichon in 1982 to cool the globe 
because of their smoke and ash blocking sunlight 
no cooling was apparent however which prompted angells study 
he found that the warming effect of el nino swamped the cooling 
from the volcanoes in the original record when the el nino warming 
is deleted the volcanic effects become much more obvious he 
explained 
the el nino is named with the spanish word for the christ child 
because it was first noticed by south american fishermen and 
generally occurs around christmas time

public schools should offer day care 
meals and health screening for preschool kindergarten and 
elementary school children the nations largest teachers union 
said thursday 
the board of directors of the national education association 
approved a committee report that said public schools should be the 
primary provider of such early childhood services it said they 
should be universal with low or no cost to the child and all 
children would have equal access 
with the exception of head start most day care or preschool 
programs are offered by private or nonprofit organizations head 
start provides education meals and health screening for needy 
youngsters ages 3 to 5 but officials said only a small percentage 
of eligible children are served by the program 
public schools also are an acknowledged socializing agent 
with established systems that allow for easy handling of money the 
report said 
the committee said its recommendations were prompted in part by 
changes in american families and the labor force it also cited 
changes in the demographics of poverty increases in the preschool 
population and its changing ethnic composition 
the need for education and care programs for young children is 
not being met the report said nea believes that early 
childhood programs must be available for all 3 and 4yearolds 
nea statistics showed that between 1960 and 1985 the percentage 
of traditional households mother father two schoolage children 
decreased from 60 percent to 7 percent 
it also said that more than 32 million mothers work outside the 
home and 200000 more mothers join the labor force yearly 
by 1995 it is estimated that 80 percent of children under age 6 
will have mothers working outside the home 
the number of such children is expected to increase by 9 million 
this year from 14 million in 1980 to 23 million of this increase 
55 percent will likely live in poverty and poverty is the most 
valid predictor of educational failure

have been plotting to help colombian drug kingpin carlos lehder 
escape from federal prison a prosecutor said 
assistant us attorney anthony bruce said investigators believe 
dominic taddeo was involved in planning a jailbreak attempt for 
lehder a key figure in the medellin drug cartel in the early 1980s 
investigators reached that conclusion after searching a storage 
locker rented by taddeo in allentown pa bruce said 
we found stuff in the pennsylvania locker that led us to put 
two and two together and determine there might be an attempt being 
planned to get carlos lehder out of marion he said 
lehder is serving a 140year sentence at the federal prison in 
marion ill for drug trafficking and conspiracy 
bruce would not be more specific about what was found in the 
locker 
taddeo was sentenced last week to 17 years in prison for illegal 
possession of weapons and for jumping bail on those weapons charges 
two years ago 
a federal grand jury in rochester is hearing allegations that 
taddeo was involved in three mobrelated killings in the early 
1980s taddeo 33 has never been charged in those killings 
bruce said he will recommend that taddeo serve his sentence at 
marion considered the nations highestsecurity prison 
as i understand marion you do not leave your cell unless 
youre in the company of two guards bruce said you might get 
somebody out of marion with the russian army but short of that

a former business partner of the exmodel who 
participated in a sting operation against marion barry testified 
today that she saw the mayor snort cocaine from a straw during a 
1986 party 
in another development a federal appeals court refused to order 
the admission of two black leaders as spectators at the trial 
carole bland jackson said the drug use occurred in the bathroom 
of a washington apartment after a 1986 citysponsored cruise on the 
potomac river to which barry had invited rasheeda moore 
moore and jackson worked together on project me a selfesteem 
modeling program for teenage girls that barry asked moore to set 
up 
the mayor and rasheeda were sitting on the side of the bathtub 
and cocaine was visible jackson testified i snorted 
first then rasheeda took it then the other gentleman and mayor 
barry she did not identify the other man 
jackson was the third witness in barrys drug and perjury trial 
to testify that she actually saw him use drugs moore testified 
last week that she and barry used drugs together on more than 100 
occasions convicted drug dealer charles lewis also testified that 
he and barry used drugs together 
when asked by assistant us attorney judith retchin if she was 
sure that barry had used drugs jackson responded absolutely 
positive 
jackson said she left the apartment a short time later after 
the mayor came out and made sexual advances towards me which i 
declined 
jackson also described using drugs in barrys presence on 
another occasion in 1986 she testified that while she did not see 
the mayor use cocaine then the mayor was in a bathroom where 
cocaine was present holding his nose and sitting there 
sniffing 
prosecutors introduced into evidence a videotape of a september 
1986 press conference in which barry dismissed criticism of a city 
antidrug plan that targeted drug buyers by using undercover 
officers as drug pushers 
i have no sympathy for those who are crybabies about the fact 
that we have police officers selling to those who want to buy 
drugs the tape showed barry saying we want everybody to know 
that the next drug buy may be from a police officer 
retchin said that since the tape showed barry was aware such 
undercover tactics were being used barry could not complain he had 
been improperly tricked into buying crack cocaine from an 
undercover fbi agent when he was arrested in a sting operation jan 
18 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and 
three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged 
drug use 
one of the possession charges stems from the sting operation in 
which barry was videotaped smoking crack cocaine in moores hotel 
room 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson who is presiding 
over barrys trial had refused to allow nation of islam minister 
louis farrakhan and bishop george stallings to attend the mayors 
trial on barrys courtroom passes barry appealed the decision 
the appeals court said today barrys arguments for admitting the 
two are premature and returned the case to jackson for further 
consideration 
the appeals court said jackson should rule on the matter based 
on arguments that would be filed by the two excluded black leaders 
barrys arguments for admitting farrakhan and stallings can only 
be made on appeal from his conviction if there is one the appeals 
court said 
the two were refused admission to attend the trial last week 
because jackson said their presence would be potentially 
disruptive and very likely intimidating 
barry said his constitutional right to a public trial was being 
violated 
the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain marion barry jrs 
sixth amendment claim at this time said the appeals panel 
we believe that the most appropriate course is to 
require farrakhan and stallings to present their first and 
fifth amendment claims to the district court said the 
threemember panel of appeals judges 
only barrys counsel addressed the court concerning the 
admission of farrakhan and stallings no one representing farrakhan 
and stallings presented their separate claims the panel said 
the national bar association and the national conference of 
black lawyers objected to jacksons decision to bar farrakhan and 
stallings a former roman catholic priest who broke from the church 
to lead his own congregation 
the two black lawyers organizations complained wednesday that 
the decision to bar farrakhan and stallings was unconstitutional 
and highly outrageous 
the national bar association filed a friend of the court brief 
supporting the american civil liberties union in appealing the 
ruling to the appeals court the aclu argued that farrakhan and 
stallings are entitled to view the proceedings 
jacksons lawyers argued that judges have wide discretion to 
protect order and that he is doing his best to run a fair and 
orderly trial under the most difficult circumstances

workers at a major car factory dont like what 
they have seen so far of the soviet communist party congress and 
other city residents said thursday they doubted the party could 
improve their lives 
i am not satisfied things are happening the same old way the 
way we elected delegates was new but the same old people were 
elected said viktor gushchin a worker in the eastern moscow 
machine shop of the zil car factory famous for the hulking black 
limousines favored by the party elite 
the 28th congress of the soviet communist party convened monday 
amid growing friction among members over the partys course and 
increasing despair among citizens that perestroika will make a 
difference in their lives 
party leader mikhail s gorbachev has come under heavy fire from 
orthodox communists during debates but they have displayed no new 
ideas of their own on how to alleviate the chronic economic and 
political crisis 
after the first few days i am not sure this party has a 
future these leaders must get advice if these old people stay 
then i dont know what is going to happen said sergei tkachenko 
the party leaders must change radically because if it doesnt 
then the people wont support them 
of the factorys 60000 workers 11000 belong to the communist 
party but their numbers are starting to drop as confidence in the 
party dwindles 
we have got to be able to live better we dont get paid 
enough so people are leaving the party because they are not 
satisfied said sergei grigoryevich an 18year veteran at the 
factory 
all of the workers interviewed in the machine shop during their 
break said they were disappointed that so few workers were 
delegates to the congress although the factory itself has three 
delegates to the congress workers make up just 12 percent of the 
delegates and farmers 5 percent 
the leaders dont really know workers problems and it doesnt 
bother them so that is why they just utter empty words tkachenko 
said 
throughout the city residents appeared doubtful and depressed 
by the partys failure to improve their lives 
i dont care about this congress im sick of hearing about 
it they talk talk and there are no changes they should take 
decisions to make things better so people can see it said igor 
smirnov a driver for a local cooperative 
the delegates say they are working well they should have 
something to show for their work and they dont said smirnov 
who worked as an ambulance driver before joining the budding 
cooperative movement two years ago 
the party did not win high ratings either at the cheremyushki 
market an openair bazaar of fruits vegetables and milk products 
grown on private plots 
i think the party is going to break apart who knows what will 
happen then but to tell you the truth i am not paying much 
attention to the congress said yelena lissovskaya as she ladled 
up bottles of sour cream 
the mood was sullen at a nearby state grocery story on leninsky 
prospekt a wide avenue in the southern part of the city 
nothing is going to happen theyve been at this perestroika 
for five years and look at this store some milk a bit of cheese 
nothing else nothing good is going to come out of this said 
lydia lyanova one of the cashiers in the dimly lighted shop 
im not going to talk politics with you if you want to talk 
salami or cheese ok but otherwise please get out the store 
director told a reporter he would not give his name 
im not a communist how should i know what theyre doing 
downtown anyway other parties and groups will soon be registered 
and the communist party wontt count for much anymore said sasha 
anykin as he swept a dusty boulevard with a handmade broom

jesse jackson said today he will run for one 
of the districts two shadow senator posts in the september 
primary election 
the shadow senators will be unpaid lobbyists for dc statehood 
with no official duties 
jackson a twotime contender for the democratic presidential 
nomination said on fox televisions morning news that holding the 
post would allow him to help expand democracy in the district 
of columbia 
thats what statehood is all about jackson said more 
people live here than five states we pay more taxes than 10 
states we pay more taxes per capita than 49 states and yet no 
vote on capitol hill its taxation without representation its 
not fair we deserve statehood 
city voters approved the shadow plan in a 1980 referendum 
the citys only representative in congress is a nonvoting delegate 
in the house 
jackson said election to the post would have no bearing on 
whether he decides to run for president in 1992 the two are not 
connected whatsoever he said 
jackson told reporters before attending a luncheon today at 
howard university that statehood would improve the lives of 
district residents the premise is statehood means less taxes and 
better hope he said 
jacksons political plans have been the subject of speculation 
since he moved to the nations capital last year 
in february he announced he would not run for mayor but he 
refused to rule out some other political race 
some supporters had encouraged jackson to run for the citys 
nonvoting house seat but candidates must live in the district of 
columbia for more than three years to be eligible to enter that 
race 
other candidates for the shadow posts include james foreman 
a longtime civil rights activist and harry thomas jr the son of 
city councilman harry thomas 
although voters approved the shadow plan in 1980 the city 
council twice canceled scheduled votes to fill the posts under a 
plan approved by the city council this spring district voters will 
select two shadow senators and one shadow representative to 
lobby fulltime for statehood on capitol hill

alamo says the items are worth 50 million 
any auction could be delayed for months by appeals or the 
merchandise would be returned if alamo decides to pay 79 million 
in taxes which the irs claims he owes 
such an auction would draw great interest and the agency would

of state inquiring whether therell be an auction he said

died of cancer in 1982 would be resurrected he kept her embalmed 
body on display for six months while followers prayed

previous days huge crowd 
about 400000 people celebrated july 4th on the mall with music 
food and fireworks leaving behind tons of debris on the wide 
expanse of grass that stretches from the lincoln memorial to the

soviet armor rumbled through an estonian hamlet in 
a show of military force thursday causing postponement of a 
veterans reunion that included soldiers who fought in nazi 
brigades estonian media reported 
organizers postponed plans for a reunion in the central village 
of tori on saturday and sunday after a convoy of 28 soviet armored 
vehicles and 15 loaded troop trucks passed through the estonian 
news service said 
today they arrived in tori and drove through the town fully 
armed the baltic republics official news agency said the 
estonian government and the ministry of internal affairs were not 
informed about the movement of the troops 
the estonian government strongly protests the actions taken by 
the army which can do nothing but exacerbate the already tense 
situation especially in situations such as this where the actions 
are connected to political ambitions it said 
an official of the news service said that soldiers apparently 
were in the town only briefly and then left 
the reunion planned by the heritage society a group seeking to 
promtoe awareness of estonian history was indefinitely postponed 
it added calls to the heritage societys chapter in tori went 
unanswered 
the dispute highlighted the sensitivity of world war ii 
allegiances among the baltic republics citizens an issue 
underlying estonias independence drive 
soviet soldiers entered independent estonia in 1940 under adolf 
hitlers pact with josef stalin dividing eastern europe into 
spheres of influence estonia and its baltic neighbors lithuania 
and latvia were absorbed into the soviet union 
heritage society members issued an open invitation to soldiers 
who fought for estonian independence and included those who served 
in the german army in world war ii estonian news reports and 
heritage society officials said 
the invitation also was extended to the handful of soldiers 
still alive who fought both germans and russians to establish 
estonian independence in 1918 and partisans who fought a guerrilla 
war against soviet power 
a leader of the heritage society argakas kullo said by 
telephone from the estonian capital of tallinn that about 65000 to 
70000 estonians served in german military units during world war 
ii he said most fled west with the german army when it retreated 
in 1944 
he said the society does not know how many former german army 
soldiers might still be in the republic or how many would have 
attended the gathering 
the soviet news agency tass said the reunion was to have 
included estonians who served in nazi germanys 20th ss division 
and the omakaitse punitive squad it called plans for the gathering 
an outrage 
the estonian news service quoted col gen fyodor kuzmin the 
soviet military commander in the baltics as characterizing the 
gathering as that of fascists and members of former ss 
divisions he called the meeting inadmissible 
the report quoted estonian state minister raivo vare as 
responding that the government had taken steps to prevent trouble 
he also urged the military commanders to avoid interference that 
would bring a senseless and dangerous aggravation of the 
situation the news service said 
kullo called the military move through the village of tori a 
pure provocation by the soviet military 
the chapter in tori a village of about 500 people 75 miles from 
tallinn organized the reunion months ago with the approval of the 
heritage societys leaders kullo said in a telephone interview 
soviet media previously have criticized the estonian heritage 
society for what they claim are its fascist leanings 
but kullo said soviet officials have it in for the heritage 
society because it was one of the first estonian organizations to 
raise nationalist issues in the republics drive for sovereignty 
it predated the estonian peoples front which has led the drive 
to restore the republics independence and first raised the issue 
of restoring the flag of the independent estonian republic kullo 
said 
since estonia restored its blue black and white flag many 
other soviet republics have resorted to flags they used before they 
became part of the soviet union

and raila odinga son of former vice president odinga brought to 
10 the number of people who have been seized in a twoday sweep 
an earlier report said that lawyereditor gitobu imanyara 
another opposition member also was detained today but an 
associate said imanyara called him to say that he escaped security 
forces who came to his home the associate who requested 
anonymity said imanyara had gone into hiding 
on wednesday police arrested kenyas two top opposition 
leaders who had urged the government to let them hold a public 
rally this weekend to push for multiparty democracy in kenya the 
two men kenneth matiba and charles rubia are former cabinet 
ministers who have been leading a campaign to legalize opposition 
parties this african nation of 23 million people 
the detentions follow government promises of stern action aimed 
at halting the proposed rally on saturday 
a western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the government has talked tough now it apparently has decided to 
act tough 
the american embassy in nairobi said it was following the 
situation with interest and concern 
khaminwa was detained at about noon at police headquarters while 
trying to ascertain the whereabouts of the two opposition leaders 
picked up wednesday 
another lawyer japheth shamalla who accompanied khaminwa on 
his search said he last saw khaminwa as he was being led into the 
office of area police chief gk kinoti 
later today odinga a twotime former detainee and kenyas 
longestserving political prisoner was seized at his office by 
plainclothes police said his lawyer gibson kamau kuria kuria 
also a former detainee and a prominent human rights activist said

ibrahim was seized this morning from his office at a prominent 
local law firm according to the daily nation newspaper it did not 
have further details 
the government tonight announced the detentions of matiba and 
rubia but it did not say where they were being held or whether 
they would be charged the government did not mention the other 
detentions a constitutional amendment in 1988 empowers authorities 
to hold people up to 14 days without charge 
president daniel arap moi has described those seeking to 
legalize opposition parties as traitors and subversives and has 
vowed to hunt them down like rats he claims the existence of 
about 40 tribes in kenya would invite tribalbased parties leading 
to ethnic divisions and even tribal warfare 
matiba and rubia say the oneparty system has led to widespread 
corruption and election rigging they have led a loose alliance of 
lawyers politicians and churchmen seeking change in kenya which 
has been a de facto oneparty state since the last opposition party 
was banned in 1969 
on tuesday night moi issued a warning to people planning to 
attend the weekend rally any blatant attempt to flout the law in 
respect of an illegal public meeting will be dealt with with 
the full resources for the protection of law and order which are at 
the disposal of the state moi said 
matiba and rubia sought to hold the meeting at an historic field 
a few blocks from downtown nairobi the area called kamukunji was 
used frequently before independence in 1963 by jomo kenyatta who 
led the movement against british rule and went on to become the 
east african nations first president 
although matiba and rubia have said they would not attend 
saturdays rally if they were not granted a permit there have been 
widespread rumors that many may others would gather at kamukunji 
anyway

president bush won approval from other western 
leaders today to invite mikhail s gorbachev to nato in a dramatic 
goodwill gesture toward the soviet union bush also urged them to 
declare that nuclear weapons would be used in europe only as a last 
resort but that proposal was questioned by britain 
bush said leaders of the other warsaw pact nations of eastern 
europe also should be invited to nato all of the invitations are 
for some future date not the twoday nato summit that began today 
the president made his surprise proposal to invite gorbachev as 
nato began debating steps to reshape the western alliance as a 
result of the rapidly diminishing military threat from the east 
french presidential spokesman hubert vedrine reported later that 
the allies had endorsed bushs idea 
however a british spokesman said prime minister margaret 
thatcher was cool toward the idea of declaring nuclear weapons as 
arms of last resort 
i think the trouble is we are concerned about the implications 
of last resort the official said britain is wary that the us 
declaration would remove the useful uncertainty about how the west 
would respond if the soviets staged an attack 
diplomatic sources said the proposal was intended to demonstrate 
that nato is changing to keep pace with rapid developments in east 
europe and the soviet union the warsaw pact has virtually 
collapsed since the soviets former military allies began ousting 
their longdominant communist governments last year 
vedrine said nato would invite gorbachev to come and speak in 
the name of the soviet union before the north atlantic council in 
brussels the council is the principal body of nato and meets at 
various levels ambassadors foreign ministers or on occasion 
heads of state or government it was not clear who would be 
gorbachevs audience 
diplomatic sources said the invitation probably would be aimed 
at early december when a meeting of western foreign ministers 
already is scheduled 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bushs 
proposal amounted to the allies reaching out to old adversaries 
nato foreign ministers met for four hours late today working on 
the language of the joint statement that will be issued at the 
conclusion of talks friday they were to get together again after a 
blacktie dinner with the leaders 
not long ago it would have been unthinkable for a soviet leader 
to be invited to address the north atlantic treaty organization 
which was forged in 1949 to counter potential military aggression 
from the east now however western leaders speak of the soviet 
union and east european nations more as friends than foes 
along with a series of bush proposals to revamp nato for a less 
militaristic future the summiteers were expected to debate whether 
western nations should rush cash assistance to moscow to help bail 
out the soviet unions crumbling economy on wednesday bush seemed 
to ease his conditions for western aid 
the summit however was far from harmonious 
west german chancellor helmut kohl told nato leaders they should 
make a joint declaration with warsaw pact countries that we no 
longer regard one another as adversaries 
said kohl confrontation and the cold war belong to the past 
but french president francois mitterrand said he opposed kohls 
call for a joint nonaggression declaration as does the united 
states one canadian official said the idea was losing speed 
acknowledging that she was in danger of being called cold war 
warrior british prime minister margaret thatcher cited detailed 
statistics about soviet arms production and urged nato to keep up 
its guard while reaching out to moscow and east europe 
she also expressed qualms about bushs proposal that nato 
declare it would use nuclear arms in europe only as a last 
resort mrs thatcher urged the western allies to be avoid any 
misunderstanding about their support of european security lest 
the deterrence of our weaponry is impaired 
besides recommending a last resort nuclear policy for nato 
bush has proposed the eventual scrapping of 1470 nuclear artillery 
shells and 1560 us tactical nuclear bombs deployed in west 
germany turkey and italy 
the diplomatic sources who spoke only on condition they not be 
identified said bush did not envision that gorbachev would rush to 
london to address the current 16nation nato summit which ends 
friday 
west german spokesman hans klein said it is possible that a 
highlevel nato message to soviet leaders 
separately nato spokesman robin stafford said nato secretary 
general manfred woerner had accepted an invitation from soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze to fly to moscow but that no 
date had been decided 
we are at a turning point in europes history said mrs 
thatcher as the summit got under way 
our signal from this meeting must continue to be one of 
resolve in defense resolve and unity and defense coupled with 
willingness to extend the hand of friendship to eastern europe and 
the soviet union she said 
bush looking tired after an overnight flight to london sat 
next to mrs thatcher and secretary of state james a baker iii as 
the leaders gathered around a long oval table in a chandeliered 
room of a government mansion 
mrs thatcher said she had received messages from soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and czechoslovak president vaclav 
havel within the last 24 hours she did not disclose the contents 
but said the two leaders were as interested in the results of 
this summit as we are 
kohl insisted on full nato membership for a united germany and 
said there was no reason for soviet concern 
such a development would enhance their own stability and offer 
them a new opportunity for partnership kohl said 
offering words of caution mrs thatcher said nato has 
defended peace with freedom and justice but its never threatened 
anyone the cornerstones of that sure defense must remain for we 
dont know what the future holds but its architecture may change 
in the new situation 
machine guntoting police patrolled heathrow airports vip 
lounge and sharpshooters watched from rooftops as the nato leaders 
converged for their critical meetings in lancaster house a 19th 
century mansion in central london 
the primary purpose of the meeting is to transform nato from a 
nowoutdated military machine into what essentially would be a 
political alliance 
on wednesday gorbachev oviet citizens lives in two years or 
would resign

more than 10000 east germans demanding 
better pay staged brief warning strikes thursday and prime 
minister lothar de maiziere complained about unreasonably high food 
prices 
despite the gloom pervading much of east germanys rickety 
economy economics minister gerhard pohl said that 63490 private 
companies set up business creating 150000 jobs but unemployment 
is expected to surge over the next months as east germany faces 
competition from the west 
pohl also said at a news conference that 6777 of east germanys 
8000 state companies were being privatized 
east and west germany merged their economies and social welfare 
systems on sunday in a prelude to full german unification expected 
after allgerman elections proposed for dec 2 
several thousand metalworkers struck seven plants near leipzig 
after pay talks deadlocked two days ago according to the state adn 
news agency 
the halfhour stoppages were organized by west germanys 
powerful ig metall labor union which threatened to stage more 
than just warning strikes unless negotiations resumed adn said 
the agency gave no specifics on the workers demands it also 
did not say why the negotiations collapsed 
in southwestern erfurt 9000 workers in metalworking and 
electric equipment industries rallied outside their labor unions 
headquarters as contract talks began adn said 
they demanded job security and more say in how their companies 
are run 
ig metall wants east germany to adopt the west german system of 
stipulating salary scales and job descriptions in huge collective 
contracts that bind all workers in a specific industry 
west german economics minister helmut haussmann said in 
thursdays die welt newspaper that lack of selfcontrol on the 
salary front will lead straight to unemployment 
de maiziere in an address to parliament thursday said the 
prices of some foodstuffs varied 100 percent from one east german 
region to another 
theres no way that can be justified merely by higher 
transportation costs or overheads he said 
adn reported price rises of 400 percent to 600 percent in the 
northern mecklenburg and pomerania regions and said there were long 
shopping lines in southeastern dresden 
there are cities in east germany where the average price 
levels are way above those in west germany pohl said we need 
certain guarantees that citizens wont be exploited 
in his parliamentary address de maiziere also urged nato 
reform leaders of the western alliance began meeting in london 
thursday to discuss the pacts future amid a changing europe 
nato must regard itself as an alliance of free and democratic 
nations in the most comprehensive sense and reform its structure 
and strategy the east german leader said that means saying 
goodbye to the current flexible response strategy which relies 
on forward defense and using nuclear weapons as the first party in 
a conflict

albania today reimposed some travel 
restrictions the austria press agency reported after hundreds of 
its citizens stormed foreign embassies or gathered outside them in 
an effort to flee their homeland 
the reported government move only two days after the 
restrictions were lifted came as diplomats were deadlocked over 
the fate of more than 200 albanians who have taken refuge in the 
embassies 
the austrian report apparently based on official sources in 
tirana the albanian capital said the measure was necessary 
because of the alarming situation in front of the foreign 
missions 
on tuesday a new albanian law went into effect allowing any 
adult to apply for a passport the law also said that albanians 
holding passports could apply directly to foreign embassies for 
visas 
the austria press agency said the government announced today 
that austrians could no longer apply to the embassies for visas 
the report mentioned nothing about any change in the new passport 
law 
the austrian news agency which has had a reporter in tirana for 
the last few weeks said another 15 people had asked for asylum at 
the west german embassy and at least 20 refugees were said to have 
climbed the fence of the czechoslovak embassy already sheltering 
25 people 
if the figures are correct the total of refugees now holed up 
inside foreign missions would be between 270 and 290 
witnesses in front of the west german embassy claimed a man was 
brutally beaten and dragged away by security forces but a german 
government spokesman in bonn said there were no reports of new 
disturbances outside the mission 
the asylumseekers many of whom crashed through gates or scaled 
walls to enter embassies earlier this week present one of the 
biggest challenges in 45 years to the rulers of europes poorest 
most isolated country 
albania the last hardline communist country left in eastern 
europe in recent months has expressed interest shedding its 
isolationist ways and broadening ties with other nations 
but the communist monopoly on power continues communist party 
chief ramiz alia who succeeded stalinist strongman enver hoxha 
has firmly rejected a the type of multiparty system that has taken 
hold in the rest of eastern europe 
the lifting of the travel restrictions on tuesday was part of a 
reform package adopted in may under it albanians who previously 
were not allowed to travel freely were entitled to passports a ban 
on religion was lifted and the death penalty for defectors was 
abolished 
earlier today a diplomat said by telephone that as many as 500 
albanians assembled in front of the yugoslav embassy waiting for 
travel visas another crowd of several hundred people was waiting 
outside the west german mission and a smaller group in front of the 
french embassy the diplomat said 
in geneva un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar today 
urged authorities in tirana to be consistent in allowing the 
albanians seeking refuge to leave the country 
perez de cuellar visited albania in may the first visit by a 
un secretarygeneral he helped persuade the government to allow 
six brothers and sisters to leave albania for italy 
in brussels the 12 european community nations also urged the 
albanian government to allow its citizens to leave 
they also urged albanian authorities not to remove any of the 
albanians from the embassies but to respect the inviolability of 
diplomatic missions 
the united states has no embassy in albania since the two 
countries do not have diplomatic relations 
a hungarian diplomat who was reached from budapest today said a 
man and a woman walked into the embassy compound this morning as 
we were opening the gate to let a car out the two brought the 
number of refugees inside to six 
there is a strong police presence around the embassy but no 
incidents said the hungarian diplomat who like all others 
refused to be identified 
the austrian news agency said no agreement was reached in a 
meeting between yugoslav ambassador novak pribicevic and bashki 
dino a director at the albanian foreign ministry pribicevic was 
chosen to represent other foreign diplomats in the talks 
last week a few albanians hoping to flee their country of 32 
million sought political asylum at embassies word of their success 
apparently spread and on monday their numbers swelled 
dozens of refugees were shot at by security forces as they 
clambered over walls or crashed trucks through embassy gates in a 
desperate bid for freedom diplomatic sources said 
it was not immediately known how many people were injured or 
arrested at least three people were wounded by gunfire from secret 
police agents said diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity 
between 30 and 40 refugees suffered minor injuries when their 
truck crashed through the iron gates of the west german embassy a 
spokesman in bonn said 
the embassies were scrambling to find ways to feed the refugees 
albania refused on wednesday to grant landing permission for a 
cargo plane carrying relief supplies for the west german embassy 
where 86 albanians had sought refuge said hanns schumacher a 
foreign ministry spokesman in bonn

west germany on thursday welcomed president bushs 
proposal to use nuclear weapons only as a last resort and called on 
nato to remove all nucleartipped artillery shells from europe 
west german chancellor helmut kohl who is under enormous 
domestic pressure to get rid of nuclear weapons on german soil 
also said nato and the warsaw pact should declare a formal end to 
more than four decades of the cold war in the summits final 
communique 
the hallmark of the alliances traditional political role is 
that it extends the hand of friendship and cooperation to former 
enemies who renounce confrontation and show tangible proof kohl 
said 
we are prepared to solemnly state in a joint declaration with 
the warsaw pact countries that we no longer regard one another as 
adversaries kohl told the 15 other alliance leaders 
the united states opposes such a joint declaration between nato 
and the warsaw pact 
the west germans were pleased with bushs last resort 
proposal made at the opening of the twoday summit to use nuclear 
weapons only as a last resort 
if adopted the bush proposal would represent a fundamental 
shift in natos current flexible response doctrine which is 
designed to create uncertainty about when the alliance uses nuclear 
armaments 
hans klein the west german governments spokesman agreed with 
bushs proposal the nuclear weapons were almost exclusively seen 
as a means to prevent war he said when you speak of them as a 
last resort that is a formulation that is accepted by us 
kohl also proposed eliminating nucleartipped artillery shells 
from europe bush has indicated his willingness to withdraw the 
1470 american shells most of them located in west germany 
in general west germany along with italy have sought to lessen 
the focus on nuclear weapons without abandoning them britain and 
france which have their own nuclear arsenals have been less 
willing to relax the nuclear deterrent 
since 1983 there have been massive protests in europe 
especially west germany over the installation of mediumrange 
nuclear missiles 
but the united states has withdrawn 54 of its 108 pershing 2 
missiles and 16 of its 96 cruise missiles from west germany the 
pullout is continuing 
kohl has been at the forefront of extending a helping hand to 
the soviets as west germany seeks to remove the kremlins 
objections to nato membership for a united germany 
klein underscored that view thursday again stressing the need 
to support the reform processes in the soviet union and elsewhere 
in eastern europe 
the spokesman said a discussion about soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs mounting domestic difficulties came up again and 
again during the summits first day but he declined to say what 
assessment the nato leaders had made of gorbachevs chances for 
political survival 
the soviet president the day before had said his government 
should step down if it cant turn the country around within two 
years

top pentagon officials will develop plans to 
streamline the varied financial and accounting operations for the 
armed services and defense agencies it was announced on thursday 
at present army navy air force marine corps and defense 
agency operations function independently 
deputy defense secretary donald atwood has instructed senior 
pentagon officials to develop organizational plans to consolidate 
the operations under the direction of the departments comptroller 
a pentagon statement said 
those officials who are scheduled to begin their work next 
week will submit plans to defense secretary dick cheney for 
approval within the next six months 
the consolidation comes as part of cheneys muchtouted defense 
management review an attempt to make the department more efficient 
amid the nations budget constraints 
the statement said the services and agencies have their own 
operations policies management and overhead structures develop 
and use their own accounting and finance systems and set many of 
their own priorities 
there is a great need within the department for 
standardization of financial and accounting information the 
integrated organization will enable us to use our limited 
resources with greater efficiency the statement quoted atwood as 
saying 
the new organization will encompass centers that employ 7000 
civilians and 500 military personnel 
they include 
army finance and accounting center indianapolis ind 
navy accounting and finance center crystal city va 
navy finance center cleveland ohio 
marine crops finance center kansas city mo 
air force accounting and finance center denver colo 
defense logistics agency finance center columbus ohio 
washington headquarters services finance and accounting 
operations pentagon 
those are the centers that oversee the pay going to the nations 
active reserve and retired military officers they also supervise 
the civilians who work for the department and administer payments 
to defense contractors transportation and travel payments 
accounting and reporting to the treasury department and the office 
of management and budget 
the changes will not immediately affect positions at the various 
centers but one of the objectives is to reduce cost we expect 
the work force to be smaller in the long run defense department 
spokesman bill caldwell said 
streamlining the centers into one organization will mean fewer 
jobs but positions will be pared in increments primarily 
through attrition and retraining personnel to fill positions in 
other areas where ever feasible caldwell said 
he said a savings of 150 million annually is anticipated when 
the operation is fully implemented an estimate that amounts to 
slightly less than 10 per cent of the current operational costs 
the savings estimate was derived from a study of the major 
functions that will be consolidated the official said 
although upfront costs for the consolidation could run over 
100 million they are expected to be offset in the long run the 
official said 
no decision has been made on where the new organization will be 
located

communist party leaders will consider a proposal 
to change their partys name in order to regain the peoples trust 
a spokesman said thursday 
col gen dmitri volkogonov a prominent historian proposed 
that the party change its name to something like the party of 
democratic socialism spokesman alexander lebedev said 
however the idea was unlikely to win support at the 
4657member party congress a poll by the congress sociological 
service found it reported that 80 percent of delegates favored 
keeping the name as it is and only 14 percent backed changing it 
according to the nightly news program vremya 
but volkogonov a threestar general who has written 
groundbreaking biographies of josef stalin and leon trotsky told 
the congress section on party renewal that the name change was 
inevitable 
in his volkogonovs words even if the proposal doesnt find 
support now in two or three years it will nonetheless be necessary 
to take this step lebedev reported 
the proposal came at a section meeting that was closed to 
journalists 
lebedev said volkogonov also argued that the current party name 
was a legacy from stalin the historian said communist ideals have 
turned out to be a lovely utopia whereas socialism deals with 
more immediate attainable goals 
the renaming is not a goal in itself but its needed to 
restore peoples trust lebedev quoted volkogonov as saying he 
spoke at a briefing thursday evening 
the section decided the proposal should be brought to the floor 
of the congress lebedev said without specifying when it will be 
addressed 
several eastern european communist parties have changed their 
names or even disbanded in the past year in a struggle to retain 
vestiges of their former power amid political upheaval 
the congress which began monday and is scheduled to run for 10 
days comes at a time of crisis for the soviet party it is not in 
immediate danger of losing its dominance of the political scene 
but its authority is at an extreme low members are reported 
quitting by the thousands and radical communists have talked of 
splitting off and forming a new party 
the congress meeting in the kremlins massive palace of 
congresses is technically the highest organ of the communist 
party empowered to set the party line change the leadership and 
revamp the partys entire structure 
it broke into several sections thursday after three days of 
plenary meetings at which mikhail s gorbachev the party leader 
and president underwent a barrage of criticism for flaws in his 
reforms but also received repeated votes of personal support 
lebedev reported that in other action 
many delegates urged a sweeping turnover in the partys top 
leadership perhaps by as much as 90 percent 
deputy prime minister leonid abalkin received heavy criticism 
for his speech wednesday in which he maintained that if the 
communist party does not support the countrys switch from a 
planned to a market economy it will be left on the sidelines of 
history 
gorbachev who sat in on the section on agriculture urged the 
party to talk less and do more the party has to understand that 
its monopoly is over and it has to prove its right to an 
avantgarde role with deeds he reportedly said 
several highranking officers accused the party of propagating 
a foreign policy that led to the loss of eastern europe and the 
weakening of the nations defenses others defended the countrys 
foreign policy as victorious 
earlier thursday a local communist official said gorbachev had 
acknowledged to a meeting of his colleagues that the kremlin cast 
them adrift as it rapidly switched signals in a bid to quiet 
republics demands for autonomy 
filip stroganov a party leader from the baltic republic of 
latvia said gorbachev had converted him from an opponent to a 
supporter during a meeting with more than 300 district and regional 
officials late wednesday 
i like people with character stroganov told reporters 
yesterday i saw his character 
stroganov said that regional leaders complained that gorbachev 
and the central leadership changed their minds too often on a new 
structure to bind the soviet unions republics together 
latvias neighbor lithuania already has declared independence 
the parliament of latvia and the third baltic republic estonia 
have signaled their intention to follow 
we dont have a clear position on this question stroganov 
said the lack of a precise position on this issue put us in an 
awkward situation 
gorbachev agreed with this yesterday he said the regional 
leaders had been pressing for a meeting for more than two years 
and gorbachev also acknowledged it had been a mistake to put it off 
for so long he said

rebels tightened their grip on the capital on wednesday does 
most trusted commander lt gen charles julu left liberia 
weakening the presidents already fragile position us officials 
in washington said 
meanwhile a senior rebel leader in the united states accused 
the us administration of trying to prevent rebel leader charles 
taylor from taking power and said the rebels would not halt their 
advance to permit peace talks 
in the citys eastern and western suburbs growing numbers of 
rebels battled soldiers for a fourth consecutive day the rebels 
now control all roads into monrovia 
rebel sources in ivory coast said the 800man contingent that 
attacked the capitals suburbs was reinforced by 4500 others the 
reinforcments brought up heavy armaments captured from army bases 
outside monrovia 
the rebel source said the insurgents took schiefflin the 
military camp 12 miles east of monrovia the rebels estimated doe 
still had 2000 fighting men in the capital 
for the first time since the fighting began the christian 
missionary station elwa did not broadcast thursday evening it 
broadcasts several times a day for several hours the station is on 
the outskirts of monrovia 
in monrovia government troops shot their way into stores 
warehouses and restaurants under cover of curfew and emptied the 
shelves in the early hours of thursday 
soldiers roamed the streets in stolen cars firing in the air to 
frighten people and keep them back while they looted the only 
vehicles on the streets were driven by soldiers who left dead and 
wounded civilians by the roadside 
as morning broke frightened monrovians ventured out into 
deserted streets and discovered at least 16 bodies 
a man with three bullet wounds bled for four hours in the citys 
main waterfront market despite pleas to soldiers to carry him to 
the hospital 
monrovias main john f kennedy hospital which like the rest of 
the city has been without water and power for more than a week has 
been abandoned by doctors and nurses and most of its patients 
a serious food shortage in monrovia has forced people to beg for 
rice give us food we are dying one man said 
rebel leader tom woewiyu based in the united states said the 
bush administration failed to keep a promise to force doe out if 
the rebels held off from attacking the capital 
the us has had ample opportunity to take this man out 
but for some reason they dont want to do that maybe they want 
to see a government evolve that does not have taylor involved in 
it i dont know why hes an unknown factor i suppose 
woewiyu said senior state department officials who had supported 
doe during his 10year rule were trying to intervene to help him 
again now the state department has said it questions taylors 
commitment to democracy 
doe in his heavily guarded executive mansion said tuesday he 
would resign if his safety and that of his krahn tribe were 
guaranteed but so far he has shown no sign of leaving 
in monrovia soldiers fired on fishermen in canoes off the

stricken city is on board a ship the sea star steaming among us 
navy ships off monrovia the captain reportedly feared the ship 
would be ransacked if it docked 
the sources also said a ship carrying 5000 tons of rice put in 
at the rebelheld port of buchanan the britishowned rizcup

health workers said young children and old people in buchanan 
were falling sick and risked dying of starvation last week workers 
at a nearby rubber plantation were eating pig feed after food had 
run out 
in monrovia the food shortage has forced people to forage for 
leaves and roots on patches of wasteland throughout the city

the nato allies on thursday searched for a way to 
draw east european countries including the soviet union closer to 
the western alliance without giving away military secrets 
president bush suggested at the opening session of the two day 
summit of nato leaders the establishment of liaison offices between 
nations in the sovietled warsaw pact and the alliance according 
to white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the general purpose is to find some way to give them access to 
nato in a learning capacity and hopefully one in which they would 
appreciate where were coming from he said 
a diplomatic source who demanded anonymity said bush 
emphasized that the warsaw pact officials would not sit at the 
table with us 
the novel idea is one of a number of proposals being floated by 
the united states and other countries to revamp the north atlantic 
treaty organization to respond to diminished eastwest tensions 
the allies want to make nato created in 1949 in an era of 
hostility and suspicion appear less threatening to the kremlin in 
doing so they hope to encourage soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
to drop his objections to membership in the alliance for a united 
germany 
west germany is an influential member of nato but east germany 
belongs to the sovietled warsaw pact 
the idea of creating a special diplomatic status for the east 
european countries reflects the wests uncertainty about how to 
deal with its former adversaries 
the european community the trading bloc of a dozen west 
european nations also is struggling to give the emerging 
democracies as much economic help as possible short of full 
membership 
it has come up with the idea of associate memberships 
nato too doesnt see its onetime enemies becoming new 
recruits 
were going to have to investigate ways of helping these 
countries be part of a bigger whole without necessarily having 
them become parts of the organization said a senior nato 
diplomat demanding anonymity 
we dont in any way want to give hungary poland 
czechoslovakia for example the sense that theyre being left 
out he said but at the same time we cant officially bring 
them in 
officials dont want to upset the balance of power in europe and 
leave the soviet union still a formidable military power without 
allies 
for the soviet union not only having a united germany in nato 
but having some eastern european countries in nato would be perhaps 
a bit much to swallow said the nato diplomat 
jane sharp senior researcher at the stockholm international 
peace research institute in sweden said the big problem now is 
not to exclude and isolate the russians taking east european 
countries into nato probably is not a good idea 
even hungary which intends to withdraw from the warsaw pact by 
late next year isnt rushing to join 
hungary does not want to make the european security situation 
less stable than it is today hungarian foreign minister geza 
jeszenszky said after a recent visit to nato 
even if it were possible politically for us to think about 
applying for membership in nato that would be not conducive to 
security right now he said 
but there are ways to create closer links 
i would expect nato to strengthen and thicken its ties with 
likeminded states and reforming states said a nato official 
demanding anonymity 
us officials have said hungary has quietly proposed to nato 
participating as an observer in political or nonmilitary 
committees 
fitzwater said details of bushs proposal have yet to be fleshed 
out 
but he said it could mean inviting the warsaw pact countries to 
have an observer status at nato let them set up temporary or 
permanent liaison offices or attend meetings 
no nations outside of the alliance currently have such a status 
nato officials said 
many countries including the united states and the soviet 
union have separate missions to the european community even 
though they are not members moscow opened its liaison office last 
year 
by doing so they can keep closer tabs on the communitys 
business and increase contacts with trading bloc officials the 
united states also uses its mission to voice complaints over trade 
policies 
at nato east european diplomats might be able to sit on some of 
the many conferences it holds yearly on a range of topics 
the alliance has panels on science and technology economics and 
one on the challenges of modern society 
there has been a greater trend toward openness with the east 
since 1986 military observers from warsaw pact nations have 
attended western war games 
last december soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze made 
an unprecedented visit to nato headquarters in brussels belgium 
since then the foreign ministers of poland hungary and 
czechoslovakia have stopped by east german foreign minister markus 
meckel will do so next week

the oneparty government on thursday 
broadened its crackdown on proponents of multiparty democracy 
arresting four more prominent kenyans including the son of a 
former vice president 
the wives of two detained opposition leaders pleaded with 
president daniel arap mois government to refrain from torture in 
what appeared to be the harshest crackdown since 1982 
thursdays arrests of three lawyers and of the son of a former 
vice president brought to at least 11 the number of people 
detained since wednesday by the singleparty government according 
to detainees families and other sources close to opposition 
figures 
several other prominent kenyans went into hiding thursday night 
the arrests follow months of official criticism of those calling 
for reform and come in advance of a rumored rally for multiparty 
democracy that the government has vowed to prevent 
two of those detained former cabinet ministers kenneth matiba 
and charles rubia had asked the government for permission to hold 
a meeting saturday in support of legalizing political opposition 
which has been outlawed since 1982 
their request was not granted but rumor has been widespread in 
this east african capital that crowds might nonetheless appear and 
moi has warned people against attending any meeting 
matiba and rubia were seized wednesday by plainclothes security 
agents in a press release thursday their wives edith matiba and 
hannah rubia said that our husbands arrest is intended to force 
curtailment of the multiparty debate and stop lawful and peaceful 
changes which are crucial if kenya is to avoid the well trodden 
path of so many other african states 
the women noting the unexplained slaying in february of kenyas 
foreign minister said they were extremely worried about their 
husbands lives and about ill treatment the men might receive 
we appeal to the kenyan government not to torture our 
husbands they said 
their statement reflected the heightening tensions that calls 
for political pluralism have brought to kenya a country best known 
for stability and democracy on a troubled continent 
since the beginning of the year a loose coalition emboldened by 
the changes in eastern europe has repeatedly accused the ruling 
kenya african national union party of intolerance corruption and 
electionrigging the government has flatly rejected any move 
toward multiple parties and cabinet ministers have called those 
backing such moves subversives 
moi who has ruled kenya since 1978 has repeatedly threatened 
arrests vowing to hunt down political pluralists like rats in 
a statement tuesday he said the government would use force if 
necessary to halt activities it deems subversive 
the government has talked tough now it apparently has decided 
to act tough said a western diplomat speaking on condition he 
not be identified further when asked about the recent arrests 
the american embassy in nairobi said thursday it was following 
the situation with interest and concern 
later thursday lawyer john khaminwa was detained at the 
provincial police headquarters mrs matiba and mrs rubia said 
mohamed ibrahim who is with a law firm whose members have been 
critical of the government also was detained thursday according 
to the englishlanguage newspaper daily nation 
raila odinga son of former vice president oginga odinga was 
arrested at his office said gibson kamau kuria a human rights 
lawyer the younger odinga whose father is still seen as a 
potential rival to the government despite being removed from the 
vice presidency in the 1960s has already twice been held for 
lengthy periods by mois government 
late thursday about 10 police seized gitobu iminyara a lawyer 
who edits a monthly magazine that often criticizes the government 
on human rights issues 
kuria the human rights lawyer was one of several prominant 
kenyans who went into hiding late thrusday 
five associates of matiba including his driver two bodyguards 
and two personal assistants also were detained late wednesday 
according to matibas office 
kenyan law permits police to hold people without charge for up 
to 14 days late thursday the government said it was holding matiba 
and rubia under public security statutes but made no mention of 
the other detainees matibas daughter julie said the family had 
no word on where he was being held 
kenya has been a de facto oneparty state since the last 
opposition party led by the elder odinga was banned in 1969 a 
1982 constitutional amendment declared it a oneparty state 
later that year the government arrested scores of people 
following a failed coup

a black student took the podium recently at 
a party to promote racial harmony and helped lead the audience of 
blacks and jews through a hebrew song 
last year jermaine cheeseborough was one of a dozen 
philadelphia high school students who traveled together for a month 
to africa and israel the message he brought back is that racial 
intolerance is encouraged when people from different ethnic groups 
dont come into contact with each other 
wednesday six black and six jewish high school students left 
philadelphia on for a similar trip intended to break down racial 
stereotypes 
the program known as operation understanding was set up 
six years ago by philadelphias us rep william h gray iii who 
is black and george h ross former chairman of the board of the 
american jewish committee 
the 12 students and two chaperones will spend 12 days in the 
west african nations of senegal and gambia and 12 days in israel 
they will then visit new yorks harlem and lower east side and 
mississippi before returning home 
after returning theyll give talks at high schools synagogues 
and churches 
what you are about to experience is one of the most 
breathtaking and aweinspiring experiences of your life 
cheeseborough told the youngsters tuesday night 
cheeseborough said he attended a predominantly black high school 
and until the 1989 trip had little interaction with jewish people 
now he said im awakened 
in addition to the travel there was another trip going on 
between the students i gained 11 brothers and sisters im sure 
well remain friends for the rest of our lives he said 
keith peltzman 17 one of the jewish students who left on 
wednesdays trip said there is a silent separation between 
different races at schools across the united states 
even though many schools are demographically integrated he 
said they are not socially integrated 
he said many white students let high school programs on 
africanamerican history go through one ear and out the other 
what i hope to gain is an understanding of black culture he 
said and i hope to be able to come back to my friends and tell 
them about it 
the 85000 needed to fund the program for one year was raised 
from private and public sources public and private high schools in 
philadelphia were invited to participate the schools selected 100 
applicants initially and that number was narrowed to 12 
as part of the process applicants had to write essays on their 
own and other ethnic groups 
they wanted to see how aware we were said lockie andrews 
16 of central high school ms andrews who is black was among 
those chosen for the trip this year 
murray friedman the middle atlantic states director of the 
american jewish committee said a similar program is under way in 
baltimore other cities have also expressed an interest 
at the sendoff for the students philadelphia councilman george 
burrell said that as a politician he often faces the problem of 
grown adults not communicating with each other 
high school is one of the toughest environments for race 
relations in america today he said take your understanding 
and try to find a solution to this complex problem 
eighteenyearold jolie davis a 1988 alumna said the trip had 
taught her to deal with prejudice 
davis who is jewish and just completed her freshman year at 
brandeis university said whenever she hears about prejudice 
against any racial or ethnic group it hurts me 
one of the important things i learned is that everyone has 
stereotypes she said and its important to break them down

the remnants of the berlin wall will be 
demolished by the end of this year the east german defense 
minister was quoted as saying thursday 
a west german firm has been contracted to tear down what is left 
of the 61mile barrier rainer eppelmann told the state adn news

had ousted hardline leader erich honecker lifted all travel 
restrictions for east germans in an effort to retain power 
since then the graffiticovered wall the most visible symbol 
of the cold war has been torn down in dozens of places 
all controls on the eastwest border ended when the two germanys 
merged their economies on july 1 berlins most famous border 
crossing checkpoint charlie was hoisted into history late last 
month 
the wall was built on aug 13 1961 to stem the flow of east 
germans trying to escape to the west during repressive communist

us education secretary lauro f cavazos called 
on the nations teacher colleges thursday to require all 
prospective teachers to learn a foreign language given the growing 
ethnic diversity of us students 
addressing 3051 delegates at the concluding session of the 
american federation of teachers annual convention cavazos said 
teachers had to adjust to the increased linguistic and cultural 
diversity of the student body 
colleges of education should make proficiency in a second 
language mandatory he said 
cavazos decried the fact that only 10 percent of all college 
graduates can speak a second language 
in a statement from washington dc david imig executive 
director of the american association of colleges for teacher 
education called the proposed requirement a good idea it would 
stretch the capacity of many students in education he said 
the state university of new yorkalbany is one of only a very 
small number of teacher colleges that have such a language 
requirement imig said 
at a news conference cavazos also added his support to those 
pressing for changes in curricula to reflect cultural diversity 
we have had standardized curricula that have not recognized 
the diversity of this nation he said 
aft delegates passed two resolutions dealing with cultural 
diversity 
one called upon the federal government and states to increase 
funding for bilingual education and support research and training 
in that field 
it also said districts should be free to experiment with 
different approaches to teaching foreign language students 
a second proposal called for development of new history and 
literature curricula that reflects the contributions of blacks 
hispanics americanindians and other groups 
we are not talking here of creating a segregated curricula 
one for minorities that features just minority heroes and another 
for whites that focuses on just white heroes said the 
resolution which was supported by afts leadership 
too often the resolution said texts have squeezed in minority 
contributions as sidebars peripheral to the main story this is 
not good enough

the operator of a kentucky mine where 10 
workers died in an explosion last year was fined more than 500000 
on thursday the largest penalty ever assessed by the government in 
a mine disaster 
pyro mining co said it would appeal the fine which was levied 
by the labor departments mine safety and health administration 
the penalty stemmed from 121 alleged violations of federal safety 
laws 
were just not making any comment at all beyond the fact that 
were surprised by the size of the penalty the appeal is in 
process and we will continue that said james greenlee executive 
vice president of evansville indbased costain coal inc which 
owns pyro mining 
the labor department contends pyro managers knew explosive 
methane gas was accumulating in the mine four days before the 
explosion but failed to take action 
we consider the violations in this case so flagrant and 
indicative of the companys negligence that this fine is 
warranted william j tattersall assistant labor secretary for 
mine safety said of the record fine 
before thursday the largest penalty ever assessed for a mine 
accident stemmed from a 1976 blast that killed 26 workers at the 
scotia mine near oven fork ky in that investigation the blue 
diamond coal co was assessed 266000 
a may report by the agency said 10 specific violations 
contributed to the sept 13 explosion in wheatcroft ky which was 
the nations worst mine disaster in five years 
the agency charged that managers failed to make required checks 
for the deadly gas in the hours before the explosion failed to 
keep enough clean air in the mine to clear out the methane and made 
a series of changes in air pathways that caused a methane buildup 
the day of the disaster 
federal investigators were unable to determine exactly what 
triggered the explosion 
thursdays announcement said that the company was fined 10000 
the maximum per violation for each of the 10 alleged violations 
investigators said directly contributed to the blast 
the agency also fined the company 8000 for 26 other violations 
19 involving failure to make required preshift safety 
examinations and seven that involved electrical violations 
an additional 13 violations involving electrical safety carried 
fines of 6500 each while the remaining 72 violations received 
lesser penalties the agency said 
joe holland president of united mine workers district 23 
called the fines certainly a step in the right direction 
i would like to see what they actually pay holland said 
adding that the agency frequently reduces fines after negotiations 
with companies 
the umw is trying to organize pyro workers and has strongly 
criticized pyros safety practices 
under federal law a company can contest allegations of safety 
violations and fines by requesting a hearing before an 
administrative law judge of the federal mine safety and health 
review commission an independent agency 
greenlee said the company already has begun the process of 
challenging some of the alleged safety violations and also will 
contest certain fines he declined to say which

some disgruntled soviet coal miners apparently 
will go ahead with a oneday political strike next week ignoring 
an appeal by the communist party congress state media reported 
thursday 
how many miners will join the strike is still uncertain but a 
labor union official told the tass news agency that miners in the 
kuznetsk basin in western siberia will stop work on wednesday to 
protest the communist partys slow pace of reform 
a widespread strike by the stridently anticommunist miners 
during the party congress would embarrass the kremlin leadership 
and president mikhail s gorbachev especially since the communist 
delegates asked them to stay on the job 
vyacheslav golikov chairman of the council of workers 
committees of the kuznetsk coal basin said at a news conference in 
the western siberia city of kemerovo that the miners do not want to 
damage russia but working people must be protected tass reported 
in some areas of the kuznetsk basin miners have decided to 
concentrate on repair or maintenance jobs rather than working in 
the pits tass said 
in the donetsk coal basin of the ukraine members of the council 
of strike committees also have decided to strike for one day 
although some of the rankandfile miners still are discussing it 
and a final decision will be made by the regional council on 
sunday the news agency said 
the largest strike committee in the donetsk basin donetskugol 
amalgamation is against the stoppage tass added 
a correspondent for the national evening news program 
vremya in a spot survey at the mushketovskaya pit said 
twothirds of the 75 workers on the day shift thursday supported 
the strike 
a national miners congress last month voted to strike if prime 
minister nikolai ryzhkov and his cabinet do not resign the miners 
blame ryzhkov for an unpopular economic reform plan now being 
revised that called for drastic price increases but only minor 
steps toward a market economy 
they also condemned the communist party for hindering reforms 
they also demand that the party cells be removed from the 
workplace as well as the armed forces and the kgb secret police 
golikov told tass that the crisis can be averted by the 
development of democracy and a market economy and better social 
protection of the working people 
delegates to the party congress in moscow urged miners to show 
restraint during this difficult period of time to consider 
seriously contemporary problems and to realize that the policy of 
pressure and of ultimatums can lead to disarray in the economy 
have a negative effect on perestroika and erode living standards

the top british official in northern ireland said 
thursday that efforts had failed so far to begin negotiations on 
the restoration of local government in the province 
protestant leaders in northern ireland and the irish government 
indicated that they have failed to agree on a formula for the talks 
on ending the 18year direct british rule in the province 
northern ireland secretary peter brooke the british government 
minister responsible for the province told the house of commons in 
london that contacts were continuing between the parties but he 
could not announce a date for negotiations 
press reports had raised expectations of a breakthrough in the 
socalled talks about talks that have been going on for six 
months between catholic and protestant leaders in northern ireland 
but brooke said i had hoped to be in a position by now to 
give some indication of when it might be possible to move to formal 
talks i am in fact not yet in a position to do so 
the important thing is that we have been making progress and 
will continue to seek to do so he said 
he added that in the end it is a matter for the potential 
participants and in particular for the political parties within 
northern ireland to decide if and when the conditions for carrying 
matters forward exist 
brooke did not say what issues remain to be resolved but others 
made it clear that the sticking point was when the irish government 
should become involved in the negotiations 
the irish government wants to be involved at all stages while 
the protestant parties in the north envision only a late role in 
the negotiations for dublin 
while substantial progress has been made on a number of 
important aspects a satisfactory basis which would avoid problems 
later has not been established irish prime minister charles 
haughey said in dublin 
protestant leaders blamed dublin for blocking progress toward an 
agreement on restoring local rule 
but john hume leader of the social democratic and labor party 
the largest catholic party in northern ireland said all the 
parties including ireland wanted brookes initiative to succeed 
the projected negotiations would be aimed at returning some 
power to local government on a basis acceptable to the protestant 
majority and the roman catholic minority 
selfgovernment was among the casualties of the violence that 
erupted in northern ireland in the late 1960s what began as a 
civil rights campaign by the catholic minority against economic and 
political discrimination escalated into sectarian conflict 
the british army was sent into the province in 1969 and the 
british government suspended the ulster parliament in 1972 
assuming direct rule of the province 
the angloirish agreement signed in 1985 guaranteed the irish 
government a say in northern irelands affairs as part of a process 
designed to promote peace in the province 
the agreement provoked an angry reaction from the protestant 
unionist parties which want northern ireland to remain linked with 
britain they broke off all contacts with the british government in 
protest 
it is a measure of brookes success that the unionist leaders 
are participating in talks which inevitably will involve some 
participation by dublin 
brooke has been talking with protestant and roman catholic 
leaders in northern ireland in an effort to reach an agreement on 
opening formal negotiations these contacts have not included sinn 
fein the legal political arm of the outlawed irish republican army 
the ira has been fighting to push the british out of northern 
ireland unite the province with the republic of ireland and set 
up an allireland socialist state 
since the british army was sent to northern ireland in 1969 
about 2800 people have been killed in the violence 
about 60 percent of northern irelands 15 million are 
protestant most of the remaining 40 percent are catholic

president bush will not likely support any 
proposals for western financial aid to the soviet union at next 
weeks sevennation economic summit treasury secretary nicholas 
brady said thursday 
im not clear that a new set of particulars is called for 
from the western economic powers brady told reporters during a 
meeting in his treasury department conference room 
west german chancellor helmut kohl is expected to call for 
coordinated western financial assistance for the soviet union when 
the economic summit begins monday in houston bush and kohl will be 
meeting with the leaders of britain italy france canada and 
japan to discuss trade aid and other economic issues 
moscow has not officially asked for western aid but its economy 
is in a shambles soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on 
wednesday told the 28th communist party congress he will resign 
within two years if his perestroika program for modernizing the 
soviet economy is not showing positive results by then 
brady noted that senior bush administration officials including 
michael j boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers traveled to moscow recently to provide technical economic 
assistance he said also that soviet government banking and finance 
officials had visited washington on technical matters 
aside from that tangible evidence of help and other gestures 
of good will by the president he has said that at this particular 
time aid to the soviet union is a very difficult subject in this 
country brady told reporters 
he suggested bush would be more willing to assist moscow if the 
soviets stopped supporting fidel castros marxist regime in cuba 
and if more progress were achieved in ussoviet arms control 
negotiations 
on another subject brady said he did not expect the houston 
meeting to remove key obstacles to agreement on reforming 
international rules covering farm trade 
that issue is a major source of friction between the united 
states and the european economic community which represents 12 
west european countries although the negotiations on trade reforms 
involve nearly 90 other countries too 
an eec official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
thursday that his group was not bringing any new farm trade 
proposals to the houston meeting 
brady said that bush is eager for an eventual agreement on 
reforms for agricultural and other categories of world trade but 
the president does not expect a major breakthrough in houston 
although its important to get a healthy discussion to take 
place in houston its not necessarily the case that anything 
determinative will take place there he said to portray 
houston as a turning point is mistaking the case

zoning officials on thursday unanimously 
rejected an appeal by tammy faye bakker wife of imprisoned ptl 
ministry founder jim bakker to hold church services at a building 
in a busy industrial park 
the orange county zoning board cited public safety concerns in 
upholding a staff decision to shut down services at the newest site 
of mrs bakkers new covenant ministries next door to a welding 
shop 
mrs bakker who did not attend the hearing has authority to 
operate a radiotelevision production studio at the location the 
ministry set up in orlando last year previously was housed in a 
shopping mall a hotel and a piano store 
attorneys for the american civil liberties union accused the 
zoning panel of trampling on the first amendment rights of mrs 
bakker because of her husbands conviction and imprisonment in 
the wake of ptls collapse 
its a case of guilt by association said warren keiner the 
aclus central florida chairman referring to bakkers 45year 
federal prison term for fraud 
zoning officials acted after several sunday services were held 
in the building in march 
aclu attorney jerry bornstein argued that the board would be 
prohibiting the free exercise of religion by ruling against a 
church in an industrial area because there was no law against it 
there has to be some overriding government interest against a 
house of worship he said 
board chairman gary russell agreed but said there were 
sufficient reasons against it 
that site is very intense at the throat of a heavy industrial 
park russell said adding that churchgoers could be endangered 
by truck traffic and activities such as the welding next door 
william parke a real estate broker representing property owner 
phillip jordan said he didnt think churchgoers would be in any 
danger and that services would be an adjunct to a radio and tv 
studio 
parke later told reporters that even the studio was not 
operating now because the building is being modified slightly to 
comply with firesafety regulations mrs bakker has just signed a 
new contract for a 12month lease and a 12month option to buy the 
site he said 
mrs bakker is very interested in the property because the 
owners have agreed to carry the mortgage and the bakkers would have 
a tough time getting a conventional mortgage parke said 
keiner and howard marks of the aclus legal division said the 
boards decision would be appealed to the orange county commission 
well file a lawsuit if were unsuccessful there marks said

a white extremist group that 
has claimed responsibility for five recent bombings promised more 
attacks if president fw de klerk continues with his apartheid 
reforms a newspaper reported thursday 
also thursday the african national congress accused the 
government of failing to clamp down on white extremists whose 
actions could threaten blackwhite negotiations on sharing power 
in other developments a bomb was discovered thursday at the 
offices of a black mineworkers union but it failed to detonate 
police said the independent south african press association said 
police believed the bomb at the union office in the central town of 
oberholtzer was planted by rightwingers 
the progovernment citizen newspaper said a group calling itself 
the white wolves claimed responsibility for five bombings in 
johannesburg since friday night and promised to step up its 
freedom struggle 
rightwingers are outraged at de klerks stated intention of 
ending apartheid and sharing power with the black majority they 
are demanding de klerk hold a whitesonly election and claim the 
president would lose to those who favor strict apartheid 
police brig gen vic haynes said there were more than 30 
terrorist attacks in june with extreme rightwing groups 
responsible for many incidents however no rightwing whites have 
been charged with any of the attacks 
the white wolves have claimed responsibilty for several attacks 
in the past two years police say they have not been able to 
determine if such an organization actually exists or if white 
extremists acting independently have simply adopted the name 
we are concerned that the government is not taking tough 
measures against the rightwing anc leader walter sisulu told a 
news conference 
sisulu said he would not be surprised if policemen acting 
on their own were assisting rightwing whites 
he also accused the government of failing to stop police 
violence against black activists sisulu said he expected a decline 
in such actions following talks in may between the government and 
the anc the countrys largest opposition group 
but we dont see any decline rather we see an increase 
sisulu said he cited an anc rally over the weekend where a black 
man was fatally shot in a confrontation with a policeman 
the anc said it would hold 20 rallies nationwide on saturday to 
call for peace in the eastern province of natal anc supporters and 
members of inkatha a conservative zulu organization have been 
locked in vicious faction fighting that has claimed more than 4000 
lives in four years 
in the soweto township outside johannesburg sam mabe the 
assistant editor of the blackoriented sowetan newspaper was 
killed late wednesday by two black gunmen in the soweto township 
outside johannesburg police said there was no evidence the attack 
was related to the recent bombings police said 
aggrey klaaste editor of the sowetan the countrys leading 
black daily said i am personally shattered especially for his 
young family it is a great loss to black journalism and further 
indicates how cheap life is in soweto

although two christian scientists were found 
guilty of manslaughter for withholding medical treatment from their 
son the debate continues over a key aspect of the case when 
should the government overrule religious beliefs that affect 
children 
medical experts on thursday applauded the verdict against david 
and ginger twitchell saying it would help protect children 
but a constitutional scholar said the decision reflects a 
fundamental unfairness because the twitchells thought they were 
protected by a 1971 state law that exempted spiritual healing from 
child abuse statutes 
the prosecution argued that the statute which states that 
children will not be considered neglected or abused when treated 
by spiritual means alone by an accredited practitioner did 
not exempt the twitchells from manslaughter laws 
after a twomonth trial the jury wednesday found the 
twitchells former boston residents now living in new york guilty 
of involuntary manslaughter for not seeking medical treatment for 
their son robyn 
they were found to have recklessly and wantonly caused their 
2yearold sons death by relying solely on christian science 
spiritual healing to treat his fiveday illness the boy died april 
8 1986 an autopsy showed he suffered from a bowel obstruction 
special prosecutor john kiernan said the case was not an attack 
on religion but sent the message that parents must protect their 
children steve lyons a defense attorney contends 2 million was 
spent by the suffolk county district attorneys office to prosecute 
the twitchells so that the da could put on a morality play 
the case does not end here defense attorneys thursday filed an 
appeal in suffolk superior court on behalf of the twitchells who 
were not present 
kiernan recommended probation for the couple who could have 
received up to 20 years in prison and that their other childrens 
health be monitored according to peter otoole a spokesman for 
the prosecutor 
according to lyons judge sandra hamlin said she would not 
exceed the recommendation she scheduled sentencing for friday 
lyons said the appeal was based on hamlins failure to consider 
or instruct the jury on the spiritual healing exemption and her 
allowing a mocking and sarcastic trial of christian science 
doctrine to occur 
the christian science church which has its world headquarters 
in boston has long taught that sickness and disease can be healed 
by prayer alone just as sin can be washed away by spirituality 
since 1980 there have been seven prosecutions of christian 
science parents five have been convicted one acquitted and one 
case was thrown out according to child rights activist rita swan 
a former christian scientist who actively seeks such prosecutions 
harvard law professor john mansfield a expert on church and 
state issues says recent us supreme court cases reflect a trend 
away from protecting religious beliefs as the nation moves toward a 
more secular society 
the twitchell case along with a recent supreme court case 
involving peyote use by a native american church retreats from 
former special treatment accorded a persons religious belief 
mansfield said 
they believe what they believe thats their faith theyre 
helpless in the grip of their faith he said but the recent 
cases ask why should they have preferential treatment 
physicians such as dr michael grodin a pediatrician and 
medical ethicist for boston university applauded the guilty 
verdict he said it sends a message that religious convictions do 
not exempt parents from calling a doctor when a child faces a 
serious or lifethreatening illness 
no religion is going to be allowed to be a defense against 
abuse and neglect he said the bottom line is we have to have 
standards for protecting children 
laurence tribe a constitutional law expert at harvard said the 
verdict reflects a fundamental unfairness because the 
twitchells relied on the states spiritual healing exemption when 
they made their decisions about robyns health but the jury was 
not so instructed 
the state invited the twitchells to rely on spiritual healing 
then turned around and prosecuted them without giving them the 
opportunity to put their reliance on state law before the jury 
tribe said 
tribe said he believed the states highest court would reverse 
the decision however he said the exemption should be revoked 
there should be a very clear duty on the part of all parents to 
take children to the doctor when a certain threshold is reached

their convention hotel one or more of the groups would break into 
an impromptu song in the hotel lobby 
it is a highly formalized form of music said convention 
spokesman al zemsky touching on crucial questions including 
tightened chords extended sound melody lines and 
overtones 
the competition to produce the 1990 international quartet 
champion began thursday with 51 quartets from the united states 
england and sweden participating the finals are scheduled for 
saturday night 
the society based on the modest american harmonizing of the 
latter 19th century was formed in 1938 in tulsa okla by two 
businessmen they worried that their favorite kind of music would 
be overwhelmed by movies and the phonograph 
today the society for the preservation and encouragement of 
barber shop quartet singing in america today about 36000 members

promised to do everything possible to create a happier future 
for his homeland 
thousands of people chanted long live havel as they 
celebrated the inauguration in a carnivallike atmosphere outside 
hradcany castle 
the election of havel to a twoyear presidential term culminated 
the political transition from communist to democratic rule that has 
reshaped the country in just seven months 
the twoyear term for which i was elected will roughly 
coincide with the demanding time of the new building of our state 
with a time which will culminate in the adoption of our new 
constitution said the 53yearold havel speaking to the crowd

parliament with the necessary threefifths majority in a nationally 
televised secret ballot a total of 234 deputies voted for him and 
50 against 
there were no abstentions sixteen deputies were absent 
i think the fact that there were 50 deputies voting against me 
is a very good significant and convincing evidence of the 
democratic character of my election i am quite rejoicing over 
that i would not feel good if i had been elected by 100 percent as 
was my predecessor havel said shortly after the voting 
stefan kvietik who was nominated for president earlier this 
week by the separatist slovak national party refused the candidacy 
havel who on dec 29 became the countrys first noncommunist 
president in 42 years was nominated by civic forum and its slovak 
counterpart public against violence the two groups led the 
peaceful revolution that toppled the hardline communist regime in 
november and won a convincing victory in multiparty elections held 
last month 
the parliamentary session held in a medieval hall at the 
hradcany castle was opened by parliament president alexander 
dubcek whose prague spring reforms of 1968 were crushed by 
soviet tanks 
by the election of the president the revolutionary 
transition which we have been living through since november 
will be ended dubcek said 
he praised havel as a man who has proved competent as a 
politician and statesman vaclav havel a playwright in the 
seat of president has gained by his work the confidence of our 
people 
he proved himself even in the times of repression of freedom 
and rights when it was not easy or convenient to show a firm stand 
of a citizen and bravery dubcek said 
after the ballot havel was led by dubcek and other officials up 
the redcarpeted aisle of the vladislav hall to sign the oath of 
office 
as a military band played the national anthem inside the hall 
the sound of a 20gun salute reverberated throughout the city 
after the parliamentary session havel accompanied by defense 
minister miroslav vacek attended a military parade in a castle 
courtyard 
in the courtyard an old tatra 80 the car used by 
czechoslovakias first president tomas garrigue masaryk was 
waiting havel will use the classic car for ceremonial occasions 
czechoslovak television said 
the streets and open spaces around the castle were filled with

the lawrence livermore laboratory said 
thursday that it has accounted for all but a fraction of the more 
45 million in equipment that had been reported missing 
in a statement released by the department of energys san 
francisco office officials said that as of tuesday the lab could 
account for all but two percent of the items a report by the 
general accounting office said were missing 
we have located about 98 percent of all the missing 
property said carol powell of the doe in san francisco we 
dont expect well ever achieve 100 percent 
a statement by the nuclear weapons research and development 
facility laboratory in livermore calif said that only the only 
equipment still missing had an acquisition value of about 45 
million and a current value of about 2 million 
the gao the investigative arm of congress released a report 
tuesday saying that as of midjanuary the livermore laboratory was 
missing more than 45 million worth of equipment the study said 
there were 27538 missing items ranging from typewriters to 
computers and that the missing equipment represented 16 percent of 
the livermore inventory 
livermore said the laboratory continued its inventory efforts 
after the gao study ended in january and that all but a fraction of 
the missing items have been accounted for 
carl j bannerman an assistant director of gao and the leader 
in the livermore study said the laboratory claim about finding its 
missing equipment has not been verified 
he said laboratory and doe officials were aware of concern about 
the livermore inventory as early as 1988 and that the gao started 
looking into the property management controls at the laboratory in 
may 1989 
the property controls are so inadequate that it took them a 
year to find that many of the missing items said bannerman 
powell said the livermores new inventory claims were 
investigated and proven by the doe the san francisco office she 
said conducted a random sample survey which statistically 
validated the findings 
lawrence livermore laboratory is owned by the department of 
energy and operated by the university of california at livermore 
in hearings two years ago before a subcommittee of the house 
committee on energy and commerce there were allegations that 
governmentowned equipment was being stolen from livermore to 
finance purchase of illegal drugs 
in its report the gao said that among capital equipment with an 
acquisition value of more than 5000 there were 1605 items 
missing valued at about 206 million capital equipment would 
include large items such as xray generators and oscilloscopes 
the laboratory statement said that 9965 percent of this 
equipment has now been accounted for 
the gao report said that noncapital equipment valued at more 
than 500 included 25516 missing items valued at 24 million 
livermores continuing inventory has now found 9739 percent of 
this equipment the laboratory said thursday 
in a third category which the gao described as made up of items 
attractive to theft there 407 missing items with a value of 
800000 
livermore said that it has now accounted for 9896 percent of 
this equipment 
in the report the gao said property controls at the laboratory 
are not adequate to ensure against theft unauthorized use or 
loss 
livermore director john nuckolls said in a statement that the 
laboratory is committed to full protection of government property 
and to the improvement of its accounting and inventory systems

the mitch snyder who forced a president to 
provide shelter for washingtons street people was a singleminded 
oftenabrasive advocate for the homeless 
the mitch snyder who apparently ended his life thursday in his 
room at a homeless shelter was a man who struggled with religious 
beliefs and was tormented by his abandonment of his young sons two 
decades ago 
snyder once described himself as dedicated to liberating 
people who are destitute but his confrontational style drew 
criticism sometimes from other homeless activists 
when snyder was on a hunger strike to force the white house to 
pay for shelter improvements rep e clay shaw rfla called 
him a masochist who influences government by threatening to 
starve himself 
raised in new york city snyder married young and had two sons 
but after a series of unsuccessful jobs he walked out on his 
family in 1969 and wound up in the federal prison in danbury 
conn for auto theft 
there he met the radical priests daniel and philip berrigan and 
joined their antiwar group out of prison in 1972 he moved to 
washington the following year launching his career as an activist 
with the community for creative nonviolence but cutting off all 
contact with his family 
snyder who was himself abandoned by his father when he was 9 
was apparently haunted the rest of his life by the family he failed 
to support 
his exwife ellen daly who remarried only got in touch with 
snyder again by telephone after he became famous 
i said to him on the phone mitchell forgive yourself i 
forgave you a long time ago she recalled in an interview in 
the washington post he said no thats his punishment to 
himself he said till the day i die ill never forgive myself 
 
he later visited his exwife and his sons ricky and dean both 
visited snyder at the shelter on one occasion helping serve 
thanksgiving dinner to the homeless 
snyders longtime companion carol fennelly told the post he 
would wake up at night having dreams about his deserted kids 
it would just prey on him 
two months ago fennelly was quoted as saying that she and 
snyder were planning to be married in september in a ceremony to 
be held in front of the communitys 1400bed shelter 
snyder and the community for creative nonviolence jumped to 
national prominence with his 1984 hunger strike that forced 
president reagan at the peak of his reelection campaign to 
promise a rundown federal building for a homeless shelter in 
downtown washington along with funds for renovation 
the episode was the focus of the madefortv movie samaritan 
the mitch snyder story starring martin sheen who referred to 
snyder as a saint the film scarcely mentioned snyders 
previous life in new york 
snyder drew increasingly harsh criticism in recent years for his 
abrasive style especially when he opposed the census bureaus 
effort this spring to count homeless people for the first time 
he refused to let census enumerators into his capitol hill 
shelter saying these people should be allowed to have their 
dignity and not be disturbed in the middle of the night to 
accommodate government grandstanding 
snyder recognized that he would win no popularity contests 
even among his friends 
i dont consider myself a good person he told the post i 
tend to be impatient i tend to be very short i tend to make heavy 
demands on people i dont have time or energy to give much 
oneonone and so im very hard on people around me i take much 
more than i give 
in march snyder announced that he was taking some time off to 
live in a trappist monastery in virginia 
im a religious person and from time to time its important 
to renew our relationship with god snyder told colleagues he 
said he wanted to take time for reflection to do simple work 
like baking bread 
after president bushs election in 1988 snyder proclaimed 
himself optimistic about the years to come 
i honestly believe george bush is a nicer person i believe 
ronald reagan was nice personally but his politics were 
meanspirited snyder said in a 1989 interview with the 
associated press 
listen to the music of tracy chapman of u2 they are 
harbingers of a shift in mood theres a 30year cycle the 30s 
the 60s the 90s weve just come through the me decade i 
think people have gotten sick of living only for themselves

a lone male forced a soviet airliner 
carrying 178 people to land in stockholm on thursday and 
surrendered airport police said a woman threatened to blow up 
another soviet plane unless it was diverted to turkey 
the incidents were among a rash of hijackings or attempted 
takeovers of soviet passenger planes in the past month 
the 19yearold man whose identity could not yet be disclosed 
hijacked the plane to sweden because he was unwilling to serve in 
the soviet army police spokesman henry hedenstrom said 
the hijacker told crew members he had an explosive in his 
luggage police said the hijacker who gave himself up within an 
hour after the aircraft landed handed police a brown briefcase it 
contained no explosive charge or weapon airport spokeswoman malin 
engstedt said 
also thursday a soviet newspaper reported that a woman 
traveling with her 2yearold daughter threatened to blow up a 
soviet airplane unless it was diverted to istanbul turkey 
crew members negotiated with the woman while the pilot landed 
the tupolev134 jet in the southern city of rostov late wednesday 
the official communist party newspaper pravda said 
the parcel which the woman claimed contained a bomb was found to 
be empty it said the woman a shop assistant was arrested by 
security forces at the airport 
pravda said the flight carrying 24 passengers originated in 
sochi on the black sea about 250 miles south of rostov 
authorities said no one was injured 
the flight diverted to stockholm was a domestic aeroflot 
tupolev154 it originated in leningrad and was destined for lvov 
in the ukraine according to airport authorities 
passengers and the sevenmember crew were permitted to leave the 
aircraft three hours after landing hedenstrom said 
it was the fifth hijacking of a soviet airliner to sweden or 
finland since june 9 all four previous hijackings were carried out 
singlehandedly by young men who threatened to blow up the 
aircraft but later surrendered peacefully none of the hijackers 
were armed 
this is becoming fairly routine although its always a 
disturbance to regular traffic engstedt said 
in the two previous hijackings to finland the two hijackers 
requested political asylum finland is considering one of the 
requests but has rejected the request made by hijacker oleg kozlov 
20 
kozlov went on a hunger strike and barricaded himself in his 
cell tuesday in a central helsinki prison finnish prison officials 
said they were attempting to negotiate with kozlov who has 
threatened to kill himself if guards break into the cell 
swedish police are holding two other hijack suspects one said 
he hijacked an aircraft to avoid soviet military service the other 
said he acted after a family dispute the soviet union has asked 
sweden to extradite the hijackers something the swedish pilots 
federation also advocates no decision has yet been taken by the 
swedish government

instead the military aircraft landed at a us air force base 
at mildenhall in eastern england the civil aviation authority said 
us state department officials called it nothing more than a 
minor inconvenience

homeless advocate mitch snyder who brought 
himself to the edge of death in many fasts to promote his cause 
was found hanged thursday at a homeless shelter with a note near 
his body 
police issued a statement calling the death an apparent 
suicide by hanging spokesman reginald smith said a note 
containing suicidal references was found near snyders body 
police sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
suicide note indicated snyder was despondent over problems in his 
personal life 
it was a domestic situation something to do with his 
girlfriend one source said the note indicates there were 
problems there 
the sources said a second note was found in snyders room one 
written during the spring 
it was along the same lines as the note found thursday one 
police source said it talked about this possibility sort of 
outlined what he might do 
we are greatly saddened by our loss said carol fennelly 
snyders companion of 15 years and his partner in running the 
shelter fennelly said last spring that the couple planned to marry 
in september 
fennelly did not return telephone calls for comment on the note 
public health commissioner george hamilton said an autopsy would 
be done thursday night to determine the cause of death 
snyder 46 was one of the nations bestknown advocates for the 
homeless he was a model for a movie dramatizing his 1984 hunger 
strike for federal funds to house the homeless 
what a shock what a loss said dc city councilwoman 
nadine winter what a loss to people all over the united states 
robert hayes chairman of the coalition for the homeless in new 
york and founder of the national coalition for the homeless called 
snyder a great ally 
mitch was driven he was no moderate on anything hayes 
said he created almost singlehandedly a movement its just a 
great loss 
snyder who had beaten the federal government in numerous 
confrontations over the years lost a battle with the city 
government on june 26 when a city law guaranteeing overnight 
shelter to everyone was scaled back because of budget pressures 
i think thats what did it i really do said bill draughn 
a shelter resident it was a slap in his face 
but winter said snyder was not especially despondent after the 
vote he was tough she said we had talked about where we go 
from here 
shelter resident george gilchrist said snyder was under pressure 
from drug problems that had developed in the past year at the 
1400bed shelter a gray threestory building several blocks from 
the us capitol 
the man tried as best he could to help us out he said of 
snyder its hard to stop something like crack 
rep henry gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee which handles legislation on homeless issues said 
snyders zeal sometimes led him to extreme despondency at the 
seeming futility of the street peoples struggle 
mitch snyder was a rare blend of a man of action and an almost 
ethereal being said gonzalez 
he was an untiring advocate for those least able to speak for 
themselves said mayor marion barry in a statement released by 
his office 
fennelly said the community for creative nonviolence which 
runs the huge shelter was in mourning 
but she said that we are more committed now than ever to 
continue our struggle to advocate for homeless human beings and to 
continue our fight for overnight shelter and affordable housing 
snyders abrasive manner and extreme tactics including 
frequent dramatic hunger strikes and a sleepout on grates outside 
the capitol won him allies ranging from politicians to hollywood 
stars among them was martin sheen who played him in the 
madefortv movie samaritan the mitch snyder story 
but his confrontational personality and approach also made him a 
controversial figure even within his own organization 
one source close to ccnv speaking on condition of anonymity 
said there has been a lot of dissension within the group lately 
snyder was criticized last spring by other homeless advocates 
for trying to thwart the census bureaus attempt to count homeless 
people for the first time 
snyder refused to let census enumerators into the ccnv shelter 
saying these people should be allowed to have their dignity and 
not be disturbed in the middle of the night to accommodate 
government grandstanding 
snyder announced in march that he was taking some time off to 
live in a trappist monastery in virginia 
im a religious person and from time to time its important 
to renew our relationship with god snyder told ccnv members he 
said he wanted to take time for reflection to do simple work 
like baking bread 
snyder grew up in new york city and remembered cruising up the 
bowery as a boy his father ordering the car windows tightly closed 
to keep out the bums 
he married and had two sons working as a washing machine 
salesman vacuum cleaner salesman and job counselor before quitting 
and walking out on his family in 1969 
he wound up in federal prison on an autotheft charge while 
serving time at danbury conn he got to know the radical priests 
daniel and philip berrigan who were in prison for destroying draft 
records 
after leaving prison snyder joined an antiwar group in new 
york he moved to washington in 1973 where he found that 
homelessness became the domestic counterpart to what was 
happening in southeast asia 
snyder said in a 1989 interview with the associated press that 
the most important influences in his life were three uplifting 
hollywood films mr smith goes to washington its a 
wonderful life and a christmas carol 
they taught me the lessons of my life that good will always 
overcome evil and that the most insignificant person can make a 
difference provided what hes doing is right

economic aid from western leaders in a letter to british prime 
minister margaret thatcher at the nato summit british sources said 
thursday 
the twopage letter appeared to contain the first direct 
reference from the soviet leader for western aid to help rescue his 
beleaguered economic reform program 
british sources speaking on condition of anonymity told the 
associated press that gorbachev made no mention of figures 
but he said he was looking for positive conclusions on the 
security structure of the new europe at the twoday nato summit in 
london which opened thursday and on aid from a summit next week 
in houston texas of the worlds top seven industrialized nations 
the message was essentially that he hoped that the summits 
would come up with the results that would support the reform 
program said the british source 
mrs thatcher announced at the summit opening thursday morning 
that she had received letters from gorbachev and from president 
vaclav havel of czechoslovakia within the previous 24 hours she 
gave no details but said both leaders were as interested in the 
result of this summit as we are here

with the decision by european community leaders meeting in dublin 
ireland late last month to agree in principle to aid the soviet 
union 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois 
mitterrand tried in dublin to persuade the other leaders of the 
12nation trading bloc to give an immediate 15 billion in aid to 
moscow 
mrs thatcher played a leading role in getting that proposal 
rejected on ground the money would be wasted unless the community 
had a clear idea of soviet needs instead the community leaders 
agreed to order an investigation into the best ways of helping 
gorbachev they will consider the matter again in the fall 
britain france west germany and italy the four european 
community leaders who will be at the houston summit also plan to 
raise the aid issue there with the leaders of the united states

authorities in yugoslavias largest 
republic thursday dissolved the local legislature and government in 
kosovo the troubled southern province it administers sources and 
the media said 
authorities from the republic of serbia also took measures 
apparently designed to give the republic full control over kosovos 
media 
several leading ethnic albanian officials and journalists were 
removed from their jobs at kosovos radio television and the 
albanianlanguage rilindia publishing house which publishes a 
daily newspaper 
witnesses said serbias police entered downtown television 
radio and rilindia premises in the provincial capital of pristina 
arresting an unspecified number of ethnic albanian employees 
the state tanjug news agency reported that tv and radio later 
went off the air 
the serbian moves could trigger fresh unrest by the ethnic 
albanian majority in kosovo the nations least developed region 
and the scene of sporadic violence over the past two years 
the decision to disolve kosovos legislature and government was 
approved unanimously by all three chambers of serbias parliament 
it came in the wake of a declaration monday by 114 ethnic albanian 
deputies in kosovos provincial assembly to secede from serbia 
belgrade television said 
in the document kosovo proclaimed the province of 19 million 
equal to yugoslavias six republics and stated that ethnic 
albanians the thirdlargest ethnic group in the country would no 
longer be considered a national minority 
yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and two 
nominally autonomous provinces kosovo which is 90 percent ethnic 
albanian has progressively lost control of its affairs to serbia 
kosovos assembly has for a long time acted against the 
interests of the people of serbia belgrade radio quoted a 
serbian parliamentary statement that explained the new legislation 
as saying 
the decision to disband kosovos 188member legislature and 
local government headed by premier jusuf zeinulahu was read 
during thursdays assembly session said sources in the provincial 
capital of pristina 
the serbian law stipulated that all elected and other officials 
in the provincial government were suspended any legislation passed 
by the kosovo assembly after thursday will be considered illegal 
the tv report said 
serbias parliament also urged federal authorities to replace 
riza sapunxhiu an ethnic albanian who represents kosovo in 
yugoslavias eightmember collective presidency and has supported 
appeals for autonomy 
about 60 ethnic albanians have died in clashes with security 
forces since march 1989 when in a constitutional amendment serbia 
severely limited the wideranging autonomy kosovo enjoyed under the 
1974 charter 
pristina however was reported calm following the serbian 
action no members of the security forces were visible on city 
streets 
a delegation of deputies left pristina for belgrade to meet with 
stipe suvar a member of the federal presidency in an apparent 
effort to secure federal support in their showdown with serbian 
authorities the tv report said 
serbs who consider kosovo the cradle of their medieval kingdom 
have alleged that ethnic albanians were pressuring the remaining 
slavs to move out of the province 
ethnic albanians who want free elections and a multiparty 
system deny this and say the issue has been used by the republics 
communist leader slobodan milosevic to gain popular support for his 
hardline policies 
serbias communist leadership has proposed adopting a new state 
constitution that would effectively remove any vestiges of 
selfgovernment currently enjoyed by its southern province 
the elimination of kosovos parliament under a new constitution 
would make ethnic albanians a small minority in the serbian 
legislature 
the decision to dissolve the regional parliament is an illegal 
one and the albanian people will not recognize it said ibrahim 
rugova leader of the democratic forum an ethnic albanian 
organization that claims a membership of over 500000 
serbia currently does not have any constitutional right to do 
such a thing he said adding that the forum would urge ethnic 
albanians to remain calm in the face of this provocation

the ship that caused the nations worst oil 
spill when it ran aground in alaskan waters last year will be 
returned to service later this summer officials said thursday 
repair work on the exxon valdez is nearing completion and exxon 
shipping co president gus elmer is expected friday to announce 
plans for returning the supertanker to service 
a coast guard inspector however said the ship is scheduled to 
start a twoweek trial run july 20 to test its systems and obtain 
certification as a seaworthy vessel 
the ship spilled almost 11 million gallons of crude oil when it 
struck a reef in alaskas prince william sound on march 24 1989 
sullying hundreds of miles of coastline and killing scores of birds 
and animals 
former exxon shipping co president frank iarossi has 
acknowledged at least implicitly that the ships association with 
the environmental disaster may make it unwelcome in alaskan ports 
he said last summer that the tanker might be renamed and possibly 
put to work somewhere besides the pacific ocean 
since then however exxon officials have kept secret where the 
vessel will sail once it is repaired and whether it will bear the 
valdez name 
exxon spokeswoman janet cool said elmer would answer those 
questions friday she said the ship would return to service this 
summer but probably not this month 
i dont think it will be sailing before august she said 
fred hallett a spokesman for national steel and shipbuilding 
co where the ship was built in 1986 said the 30 million repair 
job on the tanker is nearly complete 
the ships ready shes going smoothly hallett said 
were finishing the painting on it right now and were doing some 
work in the machinery room 
the 987footlong ship will be floated out of the dry dock later 
this month for a trial run to determine if nassco will need to make 
any refinements hallett said 
lt bill uberti a coast guard inspector said nassco is 
scheduled to flood its dry dock july 20 and take the valdez out for 
two weeks of trial runs uberti said he will be aboard the ship 
part of that time to certify it as seaworthy 
theyll test all the systems out and well ride her a couple 
of days and that will be it uberti said 
if theres a problem theyll have to fix it before it can go 
out into service but i dont anticipate any problems he said 
the only damage to the ship was structurally and thats all been 
fixed 
repairs on the valdez began last august after the 30000ton 
ship was maneuvered into a graving dock which had less than two 
feet of clearance on each side 
the tanker was placed on supports and hydraulic shorings while 
workers tore out the mangled steel of the singlehulled ship and 
replaced it with 3000 tons of new inchthick steel 
a couple of boulders that lodged in the tanker when it ran 
aground were removed and after being examined by parties in the 
spill litigation were released to exxon the company sent the 
rocks one of which was the size of small car to a construction 
site where they were ground up 
exxon officials declined to retrofit the ship with a double hull 
because it was not feasible from an engineering standpoint exxon 
spokeswoman carrie chasin said in march 
but hallett said a double hull could have been put on the ship 
during the repair work 
its feasible to put a double hull he said the question 
is the cost and the time 
in january exxon shipping co paid a 1000 fine to settle a 
pollution claim by the coast guard the dispute arose from a pair 
of slicks and the spillage of about 356 gallons of oil as the ship 
awaited clearance to enter san diego bay

president bush and western allies are offering 
soothing reassurances and considering a massive financial bailout 
to brace mikhail s gorbachev against an uncertain future its a 
big gamble on a soviet leader who gives himself only two more years 
to succeed or fail 
gorbachev dramatically raised the stakes for himself and the 
west when he imposed a deadline for fixing his countrys economic 
and political problems 
i think that in two years if there are no changes this 
leadership must go gorbachev declared wednesday 
british sources said late thursday gorbachev had appealed for 
western economic aid in a twopage letter to prime minister 
margaret thatcher the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the request was not specific but expressed his hopes for 
positive conclusions at both the nato summit and the economic 
summit in houston next week which would enhance european security 
and bolster his economic reform program 
gorbachev needs a shot of western cash for a variety of reasons 
including a balanceofpayments deficit topping 2 billion half 
of that owed to west german companies and creditors and to put a 
greater variety of foodstuffs and consumer items in soviet stores 
at a time of rising domestic tensions 
for bush and his colleagues gorbachevs message was clear if 
youre going to help do it now later might be too late 
western leaders are fully aware that any successor to gorbachev 
might not be as tolerant of democratic and economic changes in the 
soviet union and east europe as he has been 
gorbachev made his statement as leaders of 16 western nations 
were gathering here for a nato summit money for moscow was not on 
the official agenda for the talks and there probably wont be any 
decision on it here a decision is more likely when leaders of the 
worlds seven richest nations meet in houston next week for the 
annual economic summit of industrial powers 
however financial aid for the soviet union was sure to be an 
underlying issue as nato chiefs met behind closed doors in london 
west germany and france are urging the west to come up with 15 
billion or more for moscow bush has been cool to the idea but 
appears to be softening his objections at the least us 
officials say the president will not stand in the way of a western 
european package of assistance 
publicly nato chiefs went out of their way to persuade 
gorbachev and his conservative critics that moscow has nothing to 
fear from the west as the sovietled warsaw pact teeters on 
collapse 
confrontation and the cold war belong to the past declared 
west german chancellor helmut kohl 
echoing earlier proposals by bush kohl said nato and the warsaw 
pact should agree on a joint statement that we no longer regard 
one another as adversaries and that they renounce the use force 
french president francois mitterrand advocated a solemn 
declaration renouncing aggression or first use of force 
bush took the extraordinary step of urging nato to throw open 
its doors for a visit from gorbachev reaching out to the leader of 
the wests longtime adversary gorbachev and other officials of the 
warsaw pact would be invited to address a nato meeting probably in 
december 
there was no negative response to the proposal said dutch 
prime minister ruud lubbers 
one major purpose of the london meeting is to ease soviet 
concerns about the thundering drive to german unification the 
kremlin is looking for reassurances that the new germanys armed 
forces would be limited in some way 
as a result kohl and west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher were working on a plan for negotiations to deal with the 
issue promptly 
the bush administration has resisted west german efforts to put 
the german military issue ahead of a treaty now in the works to 
reduce us and soviet troops only but us diplomatic sources 
said the treaty is likely to have a footnote calling for 
negotiations on german forces promptly after the ussoviet troop 
issue is wrapped up 
early in his administration bush struck a cautious approach 
toward gorbachev unsure how far the united states should go in 
backing him after months of deliberation bush finally decided 
that gorbachev was the wests best hope for promoting democracy and 
economic reforms 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater commenting on 
gorbachevs newly prescribed deadline said we hope he can be 
successful in less than two years 
so far that wish for success has not translated into us bucks 
for moscow

a business partner of exmodel rasheeda moore 
testified thursday that she shared cocaine with marion barry at a 
1986 party and she was absolutely positive the mayor snorted 
the drug through a straw 
carole bland jackson was the third witness in barrys drug and 
perjury trial who has claimed to have seen barry using drugs 
jackson said she moore and barry and another man used cocaine 
powder in the bathroom of a washington apartment after a 
citysponsored cruise on the potomac river 
the mayor and rasheeda were sitting on the side of the bathtub 
and cocaine was visible jackson said i snorted first 
then rasheeda took it then the other gentleman and mayor barry 
jackson said she later left after the mayor came out and made 
sexual advances towards me which i declined 
moore who cooperated in the government sting against barry 
testified last week that she and barry used drugs together more 
than 100 times convicted drug dealer charles lewis has also 
testified he used drugs with the mayor 
meanwhile a federal appeals court refused on thursday to order 
that two black leaders be allowed to attend the barry trial judge 
thomas penfield jackson barred nation of islam leader louis 
farrakhan and an excommunicated priest last week saying their 
presence could be disruptive and very likely intimidating 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and 
three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged 
drug use 
assistant us attorney judith retchin asked carole jackson if 
she was sure the mayor has used cocaine after the 1986 river cruise 
absolutely positive said jackson 
jackson also said she used drugs in barrys presence on another 
occasion in 1986 but that she did not see barry snorting cocaine 
then she said barry was then in a bathroom where cocaine was 
present holding his hand to his nose and sitting there 
sniffing 
the witness and moore worked together on project me a modeling 
program barry asked moore to set up to teach selfesteem to teenage 
girls moore testified the 180000 project won speedy approval 
because the mayor told me it would 
an fbi evidence technician also testified that she removed a 
small white piece of rocklike substance from the sport coat 
barry was wearing the night he was arrested at a washington hotel 
moore has testified that just moments before federal agents 
burst into the hotel room and arrested the mayor he had placed a 
small pellet of crack cocaine in his jacket 
dr thomas lynch who conducts cocaine tests for the fbi 
testified that a crack cocaine pipe barry was videotaped smoking 
from contained a lot of cocaine 
prosecutors also showed jurors a videotape of a september 1986 
press conference in which barry seen on the tape of his jan 18 
arrest calling the operation a setup defending the use of 
undercover stings 
i have no sympathy for those who are crybabies about the fact 
that we have police officers selling to those who want to buy 
drugs barry told reporters in 1986 we want everybody to know 
that the next drug buy may be from a police officer 
retchin said the statements showed barry knew such tactics were 
used so barry cannot complain he was improperly tricked into 
buying crack cocaine from an undercover fbi agent when he was 
arrested 
judge jackson meantime set a hearing for friday on arguments 
by farrakhan and bishop george augustus stallings that they be 
allowed to attend the trial at barrys invitation 
the appeals court rejected barrys arguments that barring 
farrakhan and bishop george augustus stallings a breakaway roman 
catholic priest from the courtroom denied him a fair and public 
trial the court said barry could only make that claim on appeal if 
he is convicted and it sent the matter back to judge jackson for 
further consideration 
the judge refused farrakhan and stallings admission last week 
after the threeterm mayor appeared in public with them as they 
condemned the prosecution of barry who is black as 
raciallymotivated

regulators on thursday sought a record 24 
million from the former chairman of a large california thrift 
institution accused of squandering deposits on luxury condominiums 
trips to europe and a gun collection 
the office of thrift supervision said it was seeking 19 million 
in restitution and 5 million in penalties from thomas spiegel the 
former chairman of columbia savings and loan association in beverly 
hills calif 
spiegel a close associate of former drexel burnham lambert junk 
bond chief michael milken built the institution into one of the 
nations largest thrifts it had the industrys largest portfolio 
of highyield highrisk junk bonds valued at 37 billion at the 
end of 1989 
spiegel denied the charges and accused the agency of conducting 
a politicallymotivated trial by press release 
meanwhile edward harshfield columbias current chief 
executive said in a statement that the institutions current 
management cooperated with the thrift office and said the 
allegations do not reflect on current management or the institution 
as a whole 
columbia is still operating but analysts predict junk bond 
losses will eventually force government seizure 
the 19 million in restitution if recovered would go to the 
thrift while the 5 million penalty would go to the us treasury 
regulators ordered spiegel to establish an escrow account or 
provide other security guaranteeing payment if their allegations 
are upheld 
they are seeking return of 29 million for an unauthorized 
bonus 463000 for improper personal expenses 64 million for 
corporate aircraft and a luxury hangar 11 million for luxury 
condominiums in resort areas 57 million for loans to a friend 
and the use of luxury cars and 24 million for unauthorized 
payments to a charitable foundation spiegel controlled 
the personal expenses include 7000 spent on tickets for a 
michael jackson concert 2000 on a winetasting course for 
spiegel and his wife and 55000 for a gun collection that 
included uzi submachine guns the thrift office said 
it said columbia lost 57 million on 28 million in loans to 
luxury auto dealer howard schneider who allowed spiegel to use 
several of his cars it also said spiegel used the thrifts 
condominiums in jackson hole wyo indian wells calif and park 
city utah and that milkens brother lowell frequently used the 
jackson hole condo 
the corporate jets and hangar were built in a partnership with 
michael milken who often used the aircraft for his personal use 
regulators said 
thrift office director timothy ryan who took office three 
months ago vowing to crack down on sampl fraud said it was the 
biggest restitution case yet brought by his 11monthold agency 
this is a landmark action in more than sheer magnitude 
he said it exemplifies just how seriously we intend to pursue 
violations of fiduciary responsibility to protect the taxpayer 
spiegel who stepped down in december issued a statement 
complaining that the thrift office had refused to meet with his 
attorneys or give him a fair chance to respond to the allegations 
in a panic for purely political reasons the thrift office 
is seeking scapegoats to divert public attention from its gross 
incompetence the statement said 
no charges were announced against milken but the thrift office 
said it would continue to investigate links between his junk bond 
operation and columbia and other thrifts

a dozen belly dancers marched in protest 
thursday in the southern town of ashdod charging that local rabbis 
were skirting the law in an effort to put a halt to the dancers 
undulations 
the dancers say the rabbis prevented by a supreme court ruling 
from banning their performances as immoral have resorted to 
threats against owners of clubs and catering halls if the women are 
hired 
one belly dancer who calls herself edna and the snakes said 
she lost a contract two weeks ago because the owner of one hall was 
intimidated by ashdods chief rabbis 
he said the rabbinate was like a mafia and that they would 
find some way to take away his kashrut license if i performed 
there she said in a telephone interview 
a kashrut license certifies that food served in an establishment 
is kosher that is it conforms to jewish dietary law the 
certification is considered crucial as most observant jews will 
not eat in nonkosher establishments 
in israel belly dancing is a popular form of entertainment for 
special occasions but it has become part of the battleground 
between israels secular majority and a religious minority which 
wants the jewish state to observe strict orthodox law 
in the past rabbis routinely threatened to take certificates 
away from establishments where belly dancers performed saying they 
violated religious notions of modesty said lawyer neta goldman of 
the association for civil rights in israel 
but in late may she obtained a court ruling prohibiting rabbis 
from withholding certificates for offences unrelated to food 
rabbis now get around the court ruling by threatening to cancel 
kosher certificates on trumpedup charges that food is not prepared 
according to dietary law complained lea davish who runs a middle 
eastern dance school 
michael cohen the owner of the mitzpor entertainment hall in 
the northern town of tiberias said he prohibited belly dancing in 
his hall after rabbis made it clear to him he stood to lose 
business if he refused 
there was an unspoken understanding he said they would 
send more business to us if we stopped the belly dancing and it 
paid off i tell you 
ashdods chief rabbi yosef shinen met with a delegation of belly 
dancers in his office thursday morning but could not be reached 
for comment later 
in ashdod passersby reacted enthusiastically to the belly 
dancers protest 
if the rabbis dont want to see the dancing they dont have 
to come said sarit avraan 23

a federal judge on thursday rejected a 
legal foundations request that he bar the environmental group 
earth first from holding its annual meeting in a national forest 
in montana next week 
several hundred members of the organization are expected to 
begin arriving this weekend for the weeklong round river rendezvous 
at the beaverhead national forest in southwestern montana 
us district judge charles lovell rejected arguments by the 
denverbased mountain states legal foundation and 77 other groups 
that want to prevent the gathering including ranchers loggers 
miners and offroad vehicle users 
we are incredibly disappointed william perry pendley the 
foundations president and chief legal officer said in a telephone 
interview 
we believe the court must take a group like earth first at 
its word as to the reason it exists and what it will do to achieve 
its objectives pendley said what earth first has said is it 
will use violence and terrorism to achieve its objectives to drive 
people off the public lands of the west 
in oral arguments before lovell on tuesday pendley said the 
forest service should not allow earth first in the forest because 
the organization allegedly advocates sabotage of developers of the 
nations wildlands 
treespiking and the other acts of sabotage allegedly 
attributed to earth first are serious crimes which ought always to 
be vigorously prosecuted lovell said in his decision 
speculation that these crimes might be committed by this group at 
this time and in this area is insufficient to justify setting 
aside the permit 
lovell said the forest service had a rational and reasonable 
basis for issuing the permit and conducted an adequate 
environmental review 
pendley said he still believes the forest service put blinders 
on when it refused to consider potential impacts of the gathering 
beyond the 30acre site for which it has a permit 
a planned logging operation is only two miles from the meeting 
site and easily accessible for anyone who wanted to spike trees 
pendley said 
beaverhead spokesman jack de golia said forest officials were 
pleased with lovells decision and would have law enforcement 
officers in the area during the meeting 
we wont be in their camp he said our main purpose is 
to keep track of things and make sure trouble doesnt come to the 
camp or leave the camp and travel other places 
pendley told the judge on tuesday that earth first encourages 
treespiking the spiking of motorcycle trails harassment of 
survey crews destruction of logging equipment and other acts of 
sabotage 
assistant us attorney bernie hubley representing the forest 
service disagreed 
the history of earth first has been one of civil disobedience 
away from the forest he said this group does not have a 
documented history of doing these types of activities in the 
forest

shaded by the civic center plazas olive 
trees jack howard lay on a bed piled with heavy blankets while a 
2monthold kitten nuzzled her chin 
the 30yearold homeless woman expects to be in the same spot 
when police begin an expected crackdown on people living in the 
government center 
ive lived in civic center 8 months i lost my home in the 
october earthquake she said im not moving unless they give 
us some alternative campsite 
for now she cant go to the two socalled multiservice shelters 
that the city took over this week because theyre for men only 
and she refuses to move into one of the older shelters or a 
former hotel the city is offering women 
im safer in this park than in one of those hot line 
rooms howard said referring to the onetime hotel rooms the 
city has available 
she explained that occupants often are bothered by crack dealers 
and rats 
the city takeover of the multiservice shelters coincides with 
the mayors order for police to begin arresting people sleeping or 
keeping belongings at the civic center the centers combine shelter 
with such services as drug and alcohol treatment and job counseling 
but homeless advocates criticized the citys plan saying the 
110 new beds the city has made available wont accommodate the up 
to 350 homeless who sleep in the park 
howard said she is one of about 50 who intend to remain camped 
at the civic center despite an expected wave of arrests sometime 
friday 
others who said they dont want to face jail lined up for 
vouchers handed out thursday morning many complained there were 
not enough tickets to go around 
deputy mayor myra snyder said thursday that all of the civic 
centers homeless will have access to the vouchers which admit 
homeless people to a center that in turn refers them to a shelter 
or hotel room 
snyder said some people have to wait because the workers were 
only handing out 50 at a time in order to keep an accurate count 
i prefer not to sleep out here i prefer to go to the 
shelter said greg hayes 35 who has been living on and off in 
civic center since his release from san quentin prison in december 
hayes who served 54 months for a armed robbery picked up a 
voucher he said hes stayed away from existing shelters because of 
the dirt and violence and hopes the new shelter will be cleaner 
youre better off sleeping out here than some of those 
shelters he said this is the first opportunity to get into 
something decent 
advocates for the homeless charge that the mayors new policy 
will force 215 people already staying in one of the two shelters 
out on the streets to make way for the displaced civic center 
homeless they said it also will break up couples and force many 
people into jails doorways or alleys 
in protest the coalition on homelessness plans to bring in 
homeless people from other areas to the civic center to overwhelm 
the new shelters said the groups josh brandon 
the citys plan unfairly targets the civic center homeless 
while others throughout the city desire shelter as well brandon 
said 
we simply want to give people who want to get off the streets 
the opportunity to get off the streets he said

a natural substance called transforming growth 
factor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells 
following a heart attack according to a study published in the 
journal science 
in a study at the jefferson medical college in philadelphia a 
group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50 
percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth 
factor beta than did rats that did not receive the tgf beta 
tgf beta is a growth factor that opposes some of the bad guys 
following a heart attack said dr allan m lefer a professor at 
jefferson 
lefer said his research team simulated heart attacks in 24 rats 
by partially blocking key arteries in their hearts 
in 12 of the rats the researchers injected a placebo in the 
other 12 they injected transforming growth factor beta 
for those who received the tgf beta said lefer the damage 
from the attack was much less severe there was about 50 percent 
less injury with tgf beta than without it 
the extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the 
amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue following an attack 
hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted as in a heart 
attack tend to lose creatine kinase said lefer thus by 
measuring for the loss of this substance researchers could 
determine the amount of heart damage 
lefer said the tgf beta seems to block the action of other 
substances such as tumor necrosis factor that can cause blood 
vessels to narrow following a heart attack narrowed blood vessels 
carry less oxygenrich blood to cells and this causes additional 
injury following a heart attack 
tgf beta is normally present in heart cells but the study 
published in science said that it is missing from rat heart cells 
damaged by a simulated heart attack 
though tgf beta is produced naturally in the body lefer said 
his research team used a substance produced artificially by 
genentech a california biotechnology firm 
lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies with 
tgf beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attack 
victims with the substance is at least a year away 
jefferson medical college where the study was done is part of 
thomas jefferson university in philadelphia 
science which published the study is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

the boundary between kentucky and illinois 
is the lowwater mark on the illinois side of the ohio river 
right where it was when kentucky became a state in 1792 a us 
supreme court mediator has ruled 
the exact boundary is of more than mapmaking interest illinois 
fishermen have long complained of having to buy kentucky licenses 
to fish from their own shore it also could affect certain property 
tax payments 
the problem is that the river no longer follows that 1792 
lowwater mark and no one is exactly sure where it was 
therefore special master matthew j jasen said the boundary 
should be determined by agreement of the two states or a joint 
survey if no agreement can be reached jasen said he would decide 
his recommendation will be considered by the supreme court at its 
fall term that begins in october 
his recommendation issued last week and released thursday by 
the kentucky attorney generals office is the latest chapter in a 
decadelong fourstate legal dispute over the location of 
kentuckys northern boundary 
the ruling from jasen a retired new york court of appeals judge 
appointed by the supreme court to hear the case four years ago is 
what illinois officials had sought and parallels earlier rulings in 
the ohio and indiana cases 
the 1792 border definition was fine until 1909 when dams raised 
the water level 
kentucky claimed it should control the river up to the new 
lowwater mark while illinois indiana and ohio said the 1792 
boundary should still hold even though the shoreline had moved 
beyond it 
in a hearing in january kentucky officials argued that illinois 
has done little to exert its claim on the river for example while 
kentucky law enforcement officers routinely patrol the river 
illinois makes no such effort they said

yet another foreign invader has ignored the 
border and taken up residence in the great lakes 
a tubenosed goby a 3inchlong fish from the black sea region 
of the soviet union was recently found on an intake screen at the 
detroit edison cos belle river plant on the st clair river 
but the goby doesnt appear threatening unlike a host of other 
invaders including the water pipeclogging zebra mussel the 
troutkilling sea lamprey and the beachbefouling alewife 
like other nonnative critters the goby probably got to the 
great lakes by hitching a ride on ocean freighters which take on 
water and any small freeswimming animals that happen to be in 
the way for ballast when the ship reaches port on the great 
lakes to take on cargo the ballast gets dumped 
threatening or no the goby isnt welcome 
biologists dont like to see foreign species end up in our 
bodies of water said dave jude the university of michigan

charge filed against us rep helen bentley by a process server 
who said the congresswoman choked him after he handed her a 
subpoena

district judge mike loney there wasnt enough evidence to prove the 
complaint by john burns 41 against the 66yearold legislator 
bentley rmd didnt appear in court but issued a statement 
afterwards 
i have said all along that i never assaulted mr burns or 
touched him and the contention that i slammed this 230pound man 
against a wall and strangled him is preposterous said the 
5foot2 bentley 
burns said bentley shoved the subpoena in his face when he 
walked out of her office june 1 and demanded he take it back when 
he turned to face her she choked him he said 
the subpoena ordered bentley to be available to appear as a 
defense witness in the murder trial of a man accused of killing his 
wife the victims son and sister work in bentleys office 
after learning the decision to drop the charge burns left the 
courtroom abruptly he returned after his lawyer stanley kantor

a 17yearold palestinian girl shot in the head 
in a clash with israeli troops a year ago died of her wounds 
thursday an arab suspected of cooperating with israeli authorities 
was discovered dead 
the teenager identified as wafaa khamis alian died at ein 
shams hospital in cairo egypt hospital officials said arab 
reporters in the occupied gaza strip said the girl was shot in the 
head during a clash with israeli soldiers in june 1989 
she was treated at israels tel hashomer hospital and at shifa 
hospital in gaza before being taken to cairo by relatives they 
said 
in the occupied west bank meanwhile the body of a palestinian 
was found before dawn thursday near the amari refugee camp arab 
reporters said the man identified as feras hasouneh 22 was known 
as a proisraeli collaborator and was kidnapped from his house in

an army official on thursday used the 
reunion of a band of veterans defeated during the first major us 
battle in korea as the backdrop for an appeal to congress to 
exercise caution in armed forces cuts 
we must not sacrifice the american soldier on the altar of 
political expediency gen carl e vuono army chief of staff 
said in remarks at a reunion of task force smith the first us 
combat unit in korea 
precipitous cuts of more than 35000 active component soldiers 
in any single year will fracture the combat capability that may 
be required to defend our nations vital interests he said 
named for its commander ltcol charles bradford smith task 
force smith was hastily stitched together from infantry and 
artillery units after north korea struck across the 38th parallel 
early on june 25 1950 
on the morning of july 5 with north korean troops already in 
the south korean capital of seoul task force smith was dug in on a 
ridge commanding a highway and railway line about 22 miles south of 
seoul 
as the sun rose the officers and enlisted men of task force 
smith found themselves looking down on a mileslong column of north 
korean trucks jammed with infantry and the first of 33 sovietmade 
t34 tanks 
the unit had been issued exactly six highexplosive antitank or 
heat rounds capable of piercing the armor of that type of tank 
but the soldiers soon made a number of unpleasant discoveries 
they found that many of their weapons either didnt work or were 
too light to do the job that radios had corroded batteries and 
could not be used to call in artillery support and no arrangements 
had been made for the resupply of ammunition that began to run out 
by early afternoon 
they also found that there was no medical evacuation system and 
30 or so of the most seriously wounded had to be left behind when 
the order came to withdraw in addition they had been issued no 
maps of the area and the officers had only the vaguest idea of 
where they were 
the amy now blames the handicaps under on the rapid 
demobilization of the armed forces after world war ii and on the 
austere budgets that left units under manned and poorly equipped 
and soldiers inadequately trained 
the united states army the victor in the greatest land 
campaigns of this century only five years before was an empty 
force vuono said 
he said the army realizes that as the cold war thaws and the 
demands for cost reductions to deal with the budget deficit become 
more insistent the army must become smaller 
but he said care should be taken that as the army shrinks it 
retains quality and capability

the head of the national education 
association on thursday called for a 22 billion program that 
would offer an intensive session to prepare elementary students in 
need of extra attention 
keith geiger proposed operation jump start during the opening 
session of the neas annual meeting explaining that the program 
would be an allout fullalert effort to give every elementary 
child who needs it an educational booster shot 
about onethird of the nations 26 million elementary students 
would be involved he said 
in his first address as president to the unions policymaking 
body of about 8100 delegates geiger asked the federal government 
to provide half of the estimated 22 billion needed for operation 
jump start states and local school districts would pick up the 
rest of the tab 
at a news conference geiger said those identified for operation 
jump start would be given a head start on the school year in 
classes limited to 15 students the teachers would be those the 
students will have during the regular school year geiger said 
we would release this educational surge in an intense twoweek 
period before regular classes in the fall of 1991 a little over a 
year away he said 
the focus would be on readiness on a highenergy jolt for 
the millions of children for whom more personal relationships with 
teachers greater confidence in the school environment and closer 
relationships between school staff and families could make the 
difference between future success and failure 
geiger also pointed to a position recently adopted by the neas 
board of directors that public schools should become the primary 
provider of preschool education 
the arguments for this preschool position go beyond the 
childs own development geiger explained every major trend 
points to public school being the center of the community in the 
years ahead 
in a key vote late thursday the delegates gave a qualified 
endorsement of alternative routes for certifying teachers 
the national education association remains committed to 
ensuring that there is a fully licensed qualified teacher in every 
classroom but recognizes that there may be more than one way to 
prepare such teachers said the nea policy statement 
alternative or nontraditional certification for teachers is a 
controversial issue among educators but has gained in popularity 
with predictions of future teacher shortages 
the nea document signals the first official attempt by the union 
to show some support for the concept although it takes a middle 
ground between outright opposition to alternative certification and 
those who feel any college graduate can teach school 
in the past nea officials have complained that inadequately 
trained teachers are allowed in the classroom when normal channels 
to teacher preparation are bypassed 
nontraditional routes to licensure allow midcareer 
professionals from other fields to become teachers it differs from 
emergency licensure because it does not bypass training in teaching 
methods and other quality control measures 
as the 2 millionmember nea the nations largest teachers 
union geared up for its fourday convention the 744000member 
american federation of teachers wrapped up its fourday annual 
gathering in boston thursday 
education secretary lauro cavazos was the final key speaker at 
the aft meeting he proposed that teacher colleges require all new 
teachers to be proficient in a second language 
cavazos also said he fully supported multicultural curricula 
because of the growing diversity of classrooms across the nation 
such an approach gives students early and frequent exposure to many 
cultures to build an appreciation of peoples differences he said

natos foreign ministers agreed early friday on a 
draft communique inviting the warsaw pact to sign a mutual 
nonaggression agreement with the west diplomatic sources said 
the tentative proposal is basically stating that various 
countries who sign it are no longer adversaries and should refrain 
from threat or use of force one source said 
the 20paragraph communique to be presented to the nato heads 
of state for final approval later in the day also included an 
invitation as proposed by president bush for soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev and other warsaw pact leaders to address a 
nato gathering in brussels later in the year officials said 
the sources who discussed the draft nato summit communique on 
condition they not be identified said it also calls for the 
establishment of diplomatic liaison between the military 
alliances and proposes the eventual elimination nuclear artillery 
shells in the region by reciprocal arrangement 
on another major point the document would certify bushs 
proposed shift in longstanding nato strategy regarding the possible 
use of any 
nuclear weapons in the face of superior conventional forces the 
communique would describe them as weapons of last resort but 
still would make clear that use of them was not ruled out a point 
insisted upon by british prime minister margaret thatcher 
dutch foreing minister hans van den broek confirmed we have 
reached agreement on a communique as the ministers left lancaster 
house we are 99 percent agreed he said 
it was bush who pushed thursday for the declaration that natos 
use of nuclear weapons would be a highly unlikely last resort and 
for inviting warsaw pact leaders to meet directly with their nato 
counterparts 
bushs eyecatching proposals reflected recognition by the 
41yearold alliance of the easing of eastwest tensions in europe 
and the unraveling of the sovietled warsaw pact 
we are reaching out to old adversaries to emphasize natos 
defensive character and desire to cooperate with adversaries 
said marlin fitzwater the presidents spokesman 
french presidential spokesman hubert vedrine said the invitation 
to gorbachev which also would be extended to other sovietbloc 
leaders was readily approved 
diplomatic sources said gorbachev would be invited to address a 
session of the north atlantic council at natos headquarters in 
brusels belgium in december a senior us official said bush and 
the other western government leaders almost certainly would attend 
if gorbachev accepted 
georgy shakhnazarov a personal aide to gorbachev said earlier 
thursday the soviet leader was prepared to accept any such 
invitation shakhnazarov was interviewed on the us public 
broadcasting systems mcneilllehrer newshour 
for a while bushs proposal for revising europess nuclear 
flexible response strategy enounctered some resistance mrs 
thatcher the most reluctant of the allied leaders to lower the 
wests guard questioned abandoning the threat to launch a nuclear 
attack promptly to stop a red army assault on western europe 
the proposal does not leave ambiguity absolutely clear 
complained a british spokesman commenting only on condition of 
anonymity 
he referred to the fact that a commitment to use nuclear weapons 
only as a last resort could remove some of the uncertainty 
confronting a potential aggressor about possible retaliation 
but after a fourhour meeting of the 16 foreign ministers a 
british spokesman withdrew his governments objections 
he said the communique to be adopted at the end of the summit 
meeting on friday would reserve the use of nuclear weapons as a 
last resort and he said that no one will be left in any 
doubt that nuclear weapons might be used 
mrs thatcher herself suggested that in the midst of warmer 
feelings for the soviet union she was in danger of being called 
cold war warrior 
fitzwater told reporters that the debate is real the 
discussion is real as nato embarks on a new approach 
but overall he said we will show that nato has a new 
dimension of cooperation with the soviet union 
in that vein french president francois mitterrand proposed a 
solemn declaration renouncing aggression or first use of force 
he told the allies he was not in favor of anything that would 
artificially perpetuate bloctobloc relations when this no longer 
reflects the reality 
bush appearing tired after an overnight flight from the united 
states steered clear of reporters aboard air force one and at the 
ceremonies that preceded the summit session he flew to england 
from pease air force base nh after a long workandplay weekend 
at kennebunkport maine 
in london the leaders gathered around a long oval table in a 
chandeliered room of lancaster house a government mansion 
mitterrand was late 
the weather was chilly and it rained intermittently and the 
traditional family protrait of the 16 leaders was moved indoors 
west german government spokesman hans klein said gorbachevs 
mounting domestic difficulties came up again and again during 
the summits first day 
but a us official said there was no discussion in thursdays 
session of direct aid to the soviet union an idea pushed by west 
german chancellor helmut kohl 
bush too is easing toward supporting a western aid package to 
assist gorbachevs restructuring program and to smooth the way for 
german unification by mollifying the soviets 
in the private talks the 16 nato leaders also were considering 
permitting east european countries to participate in some 
nonmilitary nato deliberations 
fitzwater said bush suggested the establishment of liaison 
offices between nations in the sovietled warsaw pact and the 
alliance 
the general purpose is to find some way to give them access to 
nato in a learning capacity and hopefully one in which they would 
appreciate where were coming from he said 
bushs startling proposal to invite gorbachev to address the 
north atlantic council in brussels where nato has its 
headquarters would extend as well to the leaders of the six 
other warsaw pact members 
natos main function always has been to confront the soviet 
union and its east european satellites with massive military might 
including a threat to launch a nuclear attack in order to drive 
back any invasion by the red army 
but gorbachev has pledged to withdraw tens of thousands of 
troops and tanks from eastern and central europe and a treaty now 
being negotiated by nato and the warsaw pact would reduce us and 
soviet forces further 
bush called for this twoday nato summit in may to help reshape 
the western alliance as a result of the rapidly diminishing 
military threat from the east despite british reluctance the 
allies were expected to endorse bushs idea 
diplomatic sources declining to be identified said the bush 
proposal was intended to demonstrate that nato is changing its 
focus to keep pace with events in the east three warsaw pact 
countries hungary czechoslovakia and poland have abandoned the 
communist system gorbachev meanwhile is in the midst of a 
struggle in the 28th communist party congress in moscow to gain 
endorsement of his experimentation with freemarket concepts 
if nato adopts the change in strategic doctrine proposed by bush 
there still would be us nuclear weapons in western europe but 
cuts in soviet troops in eastern and central europe and a 
reluctance by the warsaw pact allies to support a soviet invasion 
make their use highly unlikely us officials said 
bush also is ready to consider scrapping the 1470 us 
nucleartipped artillery shells now based mostly in west germany 
and reducing or eliminating an arsenal of 1560 nuclear bombs 
deployed in seven nato countries

actor gene hackman who soon will be 
appearing in a film called narrow margin may have avoided a 
heart attack by a similar measure when he checked into a hospital 
an artery leading to his heart had narrowed dangerously and 
doctors had to reinflate it with a balloon catheter the 
cardiologist who treated him said at a news conference thursday 
we think we got him just in the nick of time said dr 
herbert semler 
hackman 60 had just finished filming a movie in europe called 
dinosaur and was vacationing on the oregon coast when he began 
suffering chest pain he came to portland and the pain expanded to 
include his arm 
he was admitted tuesday to st vincent hospital amp medical center 
we did a coronary angiogram and found narrowing in one of his 
arteries semler said it was in a very excellent area that we 
could easily reach with a balloon catheter and we dilated it 
semler said that if hackman hadnt entered the hospital when he 
did the artery would have completely shut down and he would have 
possibly had a heart attack 
the doctor said hackman was feeling fine and would be released 
friday at the latest 
he feels much relieved semler said the pain is gone he 
is up and around and ready to make another movie 
i spoke to gene he sounded pretty good hackmans 
publicist dick guttman said in los angeles 
hackman thought the chest pain was only indigestion but felt it 
was a good idea to have it checked guttman said 
semler said the rest of hackmans coronary arteries look good 
and the actor can return to an active life the doctor said he is 
recommending a program of exercise and improved diet however 
he said hackman is not overweight doesnt smoke and has no 
history of medical problems 
thats the interesting part we see this in otherwise healthy 
people he said the narrowing comes on as a natural process 
like gray hair it could happen to anyone 
the son of a journeyman pressman hackman is a former truck 
driver and soda jerk who didnt pursue acting until he was in his 
30s his most acclaimed role so far was as the roughandtumble 
narcotics cop popeye doyle in 1971s the french connection

after 44 years a memorial plaque has been 
placed on the site were dozens of jews were killed in a 1946 
pogrom but incidents of antisemitic vandalism marred the tribute 
to the victims a newspaper reported thursday 
the plaque was defaced last week and tombstones in the jewish 
cemetery were defiled tuesday night the gazeta wyborcza newspaper 
reported the newspaper said a performance by an israeli group and 
a discussion meeting by local journalists were disrupted 
on wednesday local residents and municipal authorities attended 
an official ceremony to formally unveil the plaque in this central 
polish city 
rain is failing it is god crying said zygmunt nissenbaum 
chairman of the jewish philanthropic nissenbaum fund during the 
ceremony 
on july 4 1946 rioting poles attacked a building sheltering 
jews who had survived the holocaust and were traveling to 
palestine they killed 42 people and injured scores more 
the attack came as the city was swept by an antijewish 
hysteria fueled by false rumors that jews had abducted a christian 
child 
the sovietbacked communists later blamed the pogrom on 
nationalists loyal to the polish government in exile in london 
while others called the pogrom a communist police provocation 
nine people were convicted and executed for their roles in the 
pogrom but shortly after their trial the communist authorities 
banned publication of documents about the attack and it became a 
socalled blank spot in polish history 
the memorial plaque with an inscription in polish yiddish and 
english is embedded in the wall of the house on planty street 
where the slayings took place 
during the unveiling ceremony a letter was read from solidarity 
leader lech walesa who was instrumental in erecting the plaque and 
keeping alive the issue of the pogrom in overwhelmingly catholic 
poland 
recalling previous attempts to honor the victims nissenbaum 
recalled that he was surrounded by armed police when he went to the 
local jewish cemetery in 1986 he said he was told not to take up 
the kielce issue gazeta wyborcza said 
in 1987 nissenbaum said he was allowed to place a tombstone 
honoring the pogrom victims in the cemetery 
last year a solidarityled government took power in poland 
ending more than 40 years of communist rule the new government has 
condemned antisemitism reestablished diplomatic relations with 
israel and fostered efforts to honor the thousandyear jewish 
tradition in poland 
before world war ii poland was home to more than 3 million jews 
most of whom later died in the nazi holocaust only a few 
thousand jews remain in poland most of the holocaust survivors 
either emigrated or fled the country after antisemitic campaigns 
orchestrated by communist authorities

hail tore the nose cone off an eastern 
airlines jetliner thursday forcing the pilot to make an emergency 
landing at philadelphia international airport soon after it left 
newark nj 
there were no injuries eastern airlines spokesman robin matell 
said in miami 
flight 161 a dc9 bound for atlanta with 42 passengers and a 
crew of five landed in philadelphia at 350 pm matell said 
the pilot was climbing out of newark at between 10000 and 
15000 feet there was heavy storm activity and apparently the nose 
was blown off he said there was very heavy hail and wind and 
thunderstorms in the area 
its a fiberglass dome and that was shattered by the hail 
said matell to the best of our knowledge there was no structural 
damage to the plane 
the pilot flew by the airport tower to allow a visual inspection 
of the landing gear then landed said dan korzeniowski the 
airports deputy director of aviation 
it was a very safe and normal landing he said 
an airport employee said some passengers said they noticed a 
rattling noise during the flight but other than that nothing out 
of the ordinary 
the passengers were put on another eastern flight to atlanta 
korzeniowski said the nose cone of an aircraft is part metal 
but mainly fiberglass because the radar and other instrument 
systems are kept there 
there were some pockmarks along the edges of the wings and the 
tail but other than that there was minimum damage to the 
aircraft itself korzeniowski said 
matell said the incident was being investigated by eastern the 
federal aviation administration and the national transportation

an informant claims the central intelligence 
agency trained guatemalan guerrillas at a ranch owned by mexican 
drug lord rafael caro quintero according to a drug enforcement 
administration report 
the allegation made in an interview with the dea was denied 
thursday by a cia spokesman in washington dc 
the whole story is nonsense spokesman mark mansfield said 
we have not trained guatemalan guerrillas on that ranch or 
anywhere else 
caro is serving a prison term in mexico for the murder of us 
dea agent enrique camarena at caros home in 1985 
the dea report surfaced this week in the us district court 
trial of four other men allegedly involved in camarenas torture 
and murder 
judge edward rafeedie ordered prosecutors to give the report to 
defense attorneys the associated press obtained a copy although 
the informants name and other identifying information was blacked 
out 
the los angeles times on thursday identified the informant as 
laurence victor harrison the newspaper said harrison ran a 
communications network for traffickers and cohorts in mexican law 
enforcement in the 1980s 
the ranch purportedly used to train guerrillas is in veracruz 
mexico the bodies of camarena and his pilot were found on a ranch 
near guadalajara 
the informant told the dea on feb 9 that the cia used mexicos 
federal security directorate dfs as a cover for the guerrilla 
camp 
representatives of the dfs which was the front for the 
training camp were in fact acting in consort with major drug 
overlords to ensure a flow of narcotics through mexico into the 
united states harrison said 
sometime between 1981 and 1984 members of the mexican federal 
judicial police who went to the ranch on a separate drug 
investigation were confronted by the guerrillas the report says 
as a result of the confrontation 19 mfjp agents were killed 
many of the bodies showed signs of torture the bodies had been 
drawn and quartered the informant said 
not contained in the dea report are any specific statements as 
to whether the cia knew who owned the veracruz ranch why 
guatemalans were being trained there or if any marijuana was being 
cultivated there 
the informant also told the dea in a sept 11 1989 interview 
that cia personnel once stayed at the home of mexican drug 
trafficker ernesto fonseca carrillo who was convicted and 
imprisoned in mexico in the camarena case 
harrison testified in the camarena case that he lived at 
fonsecas house in 1983 and 1984 while installing radio systems he 
carried an interior ministry credential which he used while serving 
as a guard on fonsecas drug convoys 
harrison also has testified that he decided in september to 
become a government witness 
in testimony harrison has said he audited classes at the 
university of california berkeley in the late 1960s went to 
mexico for the first time in 1968 during a student rebellion there 
and settled there in 1971 
he has denied ever working for a us government agency

the main opposition social democrat 
party on thursday criticized the government for its proposal to 
hold separate east german and west german elections to an 
allgerman parliament 
opposition leader oskar lafontaine accused chancellor helmut 
kohls christian democratic union of manipulating to gain an 
advantage with undemocratic decisions 
he said separate elections would give kohls party an unfair 
advantage in the elections 
the social democrat chairman hansjochen vogel said he was 
considering filing a complaint with the supreme court in karlsruhe 
vogel questioned the legality of parliaments in two nations 
being elected for one nation that does not yet exist 
west german law requires that political parties capture a 
minimum 5 percent of the total vote to be represented in 
parliament east germany has no such rule 
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has proposed that east 
germany and west germany abide by the 5 percent hurdle in sameday 
elections for an allgerman parliament but he said the vote should 
be tallied separately in each country 
that would give small east german parties a chance to compete by 
reducing the number of votes needed for representation 
the social democrats said thursday the intention of the plan is 
to benefit kohls party by dividing the vote in east germany they 
have demanded the votes are tallied throughout a united germany 
reinhold kopp lafontaines chief of staff told reporters 
thursday in bonn the oppositioncontrolled upper house of 
parliament would introduce legislation to ensure one united vote 
the basic law of election equality is not up for disposal 
kopp said lafontaine is kohls chief rival for chancellor in the 
expected december allgerman elections 
he said agreement on allgerman elections might be legally 
impossible if east germany did not first declare itself merged 
politically with west germany 
under the governments proposal east germany would declare 
itself merged with west germany under the west german constitution 
following the elections 
the east german cabinet on wednesday set dec 2 as the date for 
allgerman elections de maiziere who was strongly backed by kohl 
and won east germanys first free elections march 18 also supports 
the election plan sources in east berlin said

a raging wildfire thursday forced 
residents of a small town to abandon their homes burned a coast 
guard station and other buildings and blocked the alaska highway 
the main road into the state 
the fire is out of control were throwing everything at it we 
have tankers bulldozers people and it isnt working said 
state forester bob dick 
he could give no estimate of the fires size except to say it 
was substantilly larger than the 14000 acres it had consumed 
by thursday morning 
the blaze was among 159 raging across some 172500 acres of 
alaska the biggest fire covered about 30000 acres near beaver 
about 110 miles north of fairbanks but authorities said no 
structures were threatened there 
gov steve cowper declared a statewide state of emergency and 
called on the alaska national guard to help fight the fires 
sirens sounded through tok a town of some 900 people about 175 
miles southeast of fairbanks and emergency personnel went door to 
door telling residents to leave their homes and go to the community 
school in town 
flames were within a mile of houses near the tok airport and on 
the southeast edge of town authorities said 
the fire was burning the coast guards loran station tok which 
provides electronic radio signals to help guide aviators and 
mariners coast guard volunteers flew to the station earlier in the 
day from kodiak to try to clear a fire line around the building 
a weigh station along a nearby highway and an abandoned house 
outside town also were burning authorities said 
the tok and tanacross airports near the community were closed 
the glenn highway was closed thursday morning from about one 
mile south of tok to about seven miles south and the alaska 
highway was closed between the tok airport and the tanana river 
crossing about 10 miles east of town 
flames are crowning over the tok airport swelling up over 
trees and rolling real fast said a dispatcher at the alaska 
state police office in tok the sky is black and the whole area 
is completely choked in 
crews cut a fire line linking the highways and tried to conduct 
a controlled burn but the fire jumped the fire break said sue 
mitchell a spokeswoman for the federal bureau of land management 
dick jackson the fairbanks north star boroughs emergency 
services director was in tok to help with the evacuation plan red 
cross officials were en route to the town thursday evening from 
fairbanks the road to fairbanks remained open 
weve had a couple hundred tourists come in so far today 
theres a lot of smoke in the area and theyre wondering whats 
going on said loretta goneau a clerk at the visitors 
information center in tok 
whats bothering us the most is breathing theres burnt 
spruce needles falling out of the air resident mellie 
terwilliger said you can see but you go around with your lights 
on 
some residents wore masks to filter out smoke 
gov cowper flew over the area thursday afternoon its 
potentially a very dangerous situation he said 
he credited state agencies work but said there were 
insufficient forces to fight the numerous blazes 
from the air you could see the fire spread the governor 
said we had to get upwind of it before we could actaully see it 
the fires are that massive 
most of the fires were blamed on heat low humidity and a rash 
of lightning strikes the fire danger was extremely high in much of 
alaska mitchell said temperatures approached 90 degrees 
throughout much of the interior wednesday 
the heat dries out alaskas forests and gives rise to late 
afternoon thunderstorms and wind gusts mitchell said 
on the kenai peninsula however drizzle and temperatures in the 
40s and 50s helped firefighters curb a series of blazes that broke 
out near ninilchik 
thats the only good news said mitchell we like that 
kind of weather

medical experts on thursday applauded the verdict against david

but a constitutional scholar said the decision reflects a 
fundamental unfairness because the twitchells thought they were 
protected by a 1971 state law that exempted spiritual healing from 
child abuse statutes 
the prosecution argued that the statute which states that 
children will not be considered neglected or abused when treated 
by spiritual means alone by an accredited practitioner did 
not exempt the twitchells from manslaughter laws

thats the trouble with catchy phrases 
theyre catchy 
so when george bush said yes or at least maybe to new taxes 
everybody in america already knew that he had said no 1000 times 
and said it in a catchy way read my lips no new taxes 
bush is not the first president to break a campaign promise but 
he was so downright unequivocal that his aboutface will go down as 
part of the history of the bush presidency 
he put himself among the giants of promisebreakers 
woodrow wilson who ran for reelection in 1916 on the slogan 
he kept us out of war and five months later asked congress for 
a declaration of war 
franklin d roosevelt who running against herbert hoover in 
1932 accused hoover of running up a deficit so great that it 
makes us catch our breath fdr of course became a deficit king 
in office 
fdr again who in the 1940 campaign said pretty 
unequivocally i have said this before but ill say it again and 
again and again your boys are not going to be sent into any 
foreign wars a year later american boys were being sent into 
foreign wars 
john f kennedy who said in campaigning that it would take a 
mere stroke of the presidential pen to end racial 
discrimination in federally assisted housing once in office he 
took 18 months to issue a timid executive order covering very 
little of the countrys housing 
lyndon b johnson who even as his administration was making 
plans to escalate in vietnam told voters we dont want our 
american boys to do the fighting for asian boys and we dont 
want to get tied down to a land war in asia shortly thereafter 
he sent the first of 500000 american boys into an asian land war 
ronald reagan he promised he would never deal with terrorists 
then came the irancontra affair in which he sought to swap arms 
for hostages 
what most presidents say when they feel compelled to splatter a 
campaign promise is what bush said circumstances changed 
few blamed fdr for asking for a declaration of war after pearl 
harbor few held his deficits against him when they saw the bread 
lines shortening and so when bush says the deficit is getting 
bigger than hed ever imagined big enough to threaten prosperity 
he is betting that people will go along 
they probably will if the rest of the bargain is kept if he 
keeps the economy perking 
bruce buchanan a university of texas political scientist says 
whether the public forgives politicians for broken promises depends 
not so much on the breaking as on the consequences 
it may well be that hell escape punishment and other 
republicans will feel the pain says buchanan by time the 1992 
election rolls around there may be no consequences for mr bush 
on this subject a professor has written a book he is jeff 
fishel professor of government at american university and his 
book is presidents amp promises he tries to quantify broken 
promises 
he studied the campaign promises of five recent presidents 
kennedy johnson richard nixon jimmy carter and reagan and 
compared them to proposals actually advanced when the candidates 
became president 
he puts the presidents proposals in seven categories the first 
two of which are fully comparable to campaign promises and 
partially comparable 
if one adds the percentages it turns out that kennedy tried to 
make good on more of his promises than any of the five reagan 
scored lowest 
but all batted over 500 
sixtyseven percent of kennedys proposals were made in 
fulfillment of his campaign promises for johnson it is 63 
percent nixon 60 percent carter 65 percent reagan 53 percent 
fishel tracked 133 promises by kennedy 63 by johnson 153 by 
nixon 186 by carter and 108 by reagan 
he calls his methods crude very broad indicators that do 
not and cannot fully address the complexities of candidate pledge 
or presidential fulfillment but conclusive enough to find the 
results commendable 
he concludes it is remarkable that once elected every 
president from kennedy through reagan has demonstrated 
considerable good faith seeking through legislation or executive 
order to follow through on a majority of his campaign pledges 
evidently he harbors low expectations for that matter so does 
the public in a gallup poll published at the end of may 74 
percent of the participants said bush would not be able to keep his 
nonewtaxes pledge they read his lips but maybe theyd read 
history too

indonesia plans to spend 18 months 
celebrating its rich and diverse culture in the united states to 
promote trade tourism and investment 
the main aim of the festival is to acquaint the general 
american public with indonesia in all its aspects but especially 
its culture said mochtar kusumaatmadja who initiated the 
project he is a former cabinet minister in charge of foreign 
affairs and a graduate of yale university law school 
some people call it a coming out party he said 
although the worlds fifth most populous nation with more than 
175 million people 13677 islands 450 languages and the largest 
islamic community on earth indonesia sometimes seems invisible 
officials tell of americans who confuse it with india or indochina 
on the other hand many indonesians shun publicity some would 
be pleased if the world would just leave them alone 
geography has something to do with this no external enemy 
threatens and there is a true remoteness to be felt in parts of 
borneo the islands beyond bali and highland sumatra 
language and culture also play a part much of indonesias 
literary tradition is oral and rooted in specific islands it 
doesnt travel well or translate easily 
the yayasan nusantara jaya great archipelago foundation which 
mochtar heads planned the massive promotion because there is less 
awareness of the country among americans than in asia or europe 
also the united states is indonesias second largest trading 
partner after japan and a potential source of tourists 
americans have run out of countries to discover indonesia is 
one of the countries they see as a last frontier mochtar said 
jakarta has scheduled visit indonesia year 1991 as a major 
tourism campaign 
his foundation is private and the more than 6 million it 
raised for the festival came from donors such as major oil 
companies and the rockefeller foundation and ford foundation 
officials said the last time jakarta tried to penetrate the 
american market through a prolonged effort was with an elegant 
pavillion at the 1964 new york worlds fair 
another catalyst for the festival was the successful 18month 
celebration of india which drew much attention in 1985 ted tannen 
who designed the indian show is doing the same for indonesia 
five years in preparation the festival of indonesia 199091 
comprises exhibitions live performances movies and tv programs in 
13 cities the official opening is scheduled sept 16 at the 
kennedy center for performing arts in washington 
preliminaries include a showing of classical sculpture from the 
8th through the 15th century which opened july 1 at washingtons 
national gallery of art pieces from indonesias museums and 
archaeological services are supplemented by items loaned by 
european and us collections 
this will fall during the summer when there are thousands of 
people visiting the city so we dont want to miss the chance to 
promote the upcoming festival said operations manager rahmad 
adenan 
indonesias artistic styles range from the primitive carvings of 
new guinea and other islands to the finely crafted gold work of 
sumatra and java much of the folk art has never been seen in the 
west except in a few museums 
four exhibits are the core of the festival acting as 
centerpieces to scores of ancillary events they are the 
sculpture of indonesia the court arts of indonesia beyond 
the java sea and modern indonesian art three generations of 
tradition and change 19451990 
affiliated programs include exhibitions of traditional puppetry 
classical manuscripts and textiles 
museums presenting the core exhibitions include the national 
gallery and the smithsonian institution in washington new yorks 
metropolitan museum of art houstons museum of fine arts the 
dallas museum of art los angeles natural history museum and san 
franciscos asian arts museum

our business climate is better than paradise former finance 
minister hh tarzi said in an interview i myself would like to 
be an afghan businessman 
before the war afghanistan was dirt poor its per capita gross 
national products 115 was among the worlds lowest twelve years 
of war and the failed communist experiment has made the country 
even poorer 
afghanistan has no heavy industry and its natural gas wells have 
been capped for more than a year its only exports are traditional 
carpets dried fruit and karakul the curly fleeced skin of newborn 
lambs 
the name of the game in afghanistan is reexport which usually 
means smuggling to pakistan iran and india 
aryobis firm saraj trading co operates from a mudbrick 
courtyard off an alley in kabul he estimates that 1 billion worth 
of goods are smuggled to pakistan india and iran each year 
during the 1980s reexport to the soviet union hovered around 
400 million a year said aryobi who got into the importexport 
business by selling japanese tvs to soviet soldiers the soviet 
trade dropped to about 50 million when the soviet army left in 
february 1989 after more than nine years in afghanistan 
smuggling profits dont stay long in afghanistan aryobi uses 
deutschebank in frankfurt and fariq his trucker has accounts with 
chase manhattan in new york 
afghan businessmen can make a success of smuggling because the 
economies of pakistan iran and india remain generally closed to 
the outside world 
ever since pakistan and india won independence from britain in 
1947 they have tried to protect local industry by imposing huge 
tariffs on imported goods 
customs duties are 150 percent for tires and can reach 200 
percent for television sets iranian tariffs also are high 
some countries like japan make things better others like 
china make them cheaper enter the smuggling afghans 
afghanistan always has been a marketplace centuries before 
christ traders crisscrossed its mountains on their way to the 
middle east and asia silk routes to china passed through 
afghanistan and chinese curios still turn up in the dusty junk 
shops of kabuls chicken street 
before the civil war an estimated 50 percent of afghanistans 
imports were reexported now with the collapse of the economy 
the chamber of commerce says about 95 percent of imports are 
shipped out again 
the business centers on the aging warehouses along the muddy 
kabul river 
trucks heavy with goods inch out of dusty alleys and bounce over 
potholed streets boys prod tires with pressure guages drivers 
with full black beards and wildly colored turbans check their 
ak47s firing rounds into the air 
a year after the soviet army arrived in december 1979 aryobi 
abandoned his livestock business for importexport a chance 
meeting with a japanese businessmen brought him his first shipment 
of television sets 
since 1980 aryobi says about 500000 tvs have moved through 
his riverside warehouses to neighboring pakistan and some have gone 
on to india he also reexports 100000 pairs of tires a year 
usually indian tires to pakistan and japanese to india 
aryobi 35 does not flaunt his wealth but 43yearold fariq is 
nouveau riche his shirt unbuttoned barrel chest draped in golden 
chains fingers laden with rings of lapis lazuli 
when fariq replaced the tooth with gold last year he didnt use 
a painkiller i wanted to feel my wealth he said flashing a 
newly metallic smile 
in 1983 aryobis profits became a political liability the 
communist regime of babrak karmal imprisoned him for price 
gouging and he spent nearly three years in solitary confinement 
the governments attitude toward business began to change after 
1986 when the soviets installed najibullah who uses only one 
name as president 
under a policy called national reconciliation najibullah 
returned to the traditional afghan way of solving problems 
merchants tribes and local militias were given autonomy as long as 
they pledged loyalty to the government 
afghanistans central bank recognized the bustling currency 
market in kabuls old city state monopolies on sugar and food 
transport ended and some staterun firms were sold to private 
investors 
the biggest boon came when the staterun afghan cart company 
began to encourage smuggling by selling merchants licenses to 
import goods including televisions and other electronic items 
we needed the money explained tarzi the former finance 
minister more than 15 percent of government revenues now come from 
sales of such licenses 
a recent aryobi deal illustrates the intricacies of afghan 
reexport 
in early february a pakistani trader wanted to smuggle indian 
tires from afghanistan to pakistan 
he went to peshawar pakistan and deposited 50 percent of the 
purchase price with a currency dealer a refugee from afghanistan 
the currency dealer sent a telex to his uncle in kabuls currency 
market authorizing him to pay aryobi the funds 
aryobi who doesnt like to keep money in kabul transferred a 
portion to his bank in west germany through afghan money dealers in 
dubai he got in touch with fariq and within a week drivers were 
hauling indian tires east to pakistan 
on the way the trucks passed through hostile territory 
controlled by afghan rebels truckers paid off the guerrillas who 
operated ad hoc toll booths along the way 
the tires arrived at the frontier at night and were smuggled 
into a warehouse the next morning a string of pickup trucks moved 
them to pakistans biggest city karachi where they were sold the 
pakistani trader then paid the balance in peshawar 
we always work like this aryobi said fingering copies of 
the telex traffic its pure trust thats the moslem way

shigeyuki hashimoto says just watching the 
pace of modern japanese life makes him tired but he has a rare 
perspective hashimoto spent 45 years as a guerrilla fighter in the 
malaysian jungle 
he was working in malaya when world war ii ended and joined 
guerrillas of the malaya communist party 
i always missed japan and always wanted to come back but to 
do so would require a surrender hashimoto said in an interview 
japanese people in my generation were taught that surrender was 
more disgraceful than death 
hashimoto 71 and 79yearold kiyoaki tanaka emerged from 
jungle sanctuaries on the malaysiathailand border in january when 
the communist guerrillas ended one of the worlds longest 
insurgencies 
belief in the shame of surrender made fierce fighters of 
japanese soldiers and motivated a few to hold out on remote islands 
long after the war ended the last member of the japanese imperial 
army to surrender was lt hiroo onoda who gave up in the 
philippines in 1974 
hashimoto and tanaka were not in the wartime army but were 
working for a japanese ironworks in malaya when the war ended they 
joined the guerrillas fighting british colonial troops first and 
after malaysian independence in 1957 the noncommunist government 
japan invaded malaya and other southeast asian countries 
during the pacific war claiming it would free the region from the 
colonization of european countries and the united states but 
history has proven that what japan really did in the region was not 
better than what other invaders had done hashimoto said in an 
inverview 
after japan surrendered i thought about what i could do 
for malayas independence and decided to help the communist forces 
which were also fighting for independence he said 
japan may have surrendered but we were still fighting a war 
against britain i was never a communist but we fought for a 
common goal they also accepted us very warmly 
hashimoto said he was one of seven japanese civilians and about 
14 soldiers who joined the guerrillas in 1945 and that only he and 
tanaka survived 
he would not give details about the many years in the tropical 
jungle but said life there was quite comfortable because it was 
never cold and there was plenty of food 
we ate almost everything including the meat of elephants 
tigers monkeys and wild pigs he said 
since his return to japan hashimoto has lived with his younger 
brother noriyuki in a twobedroom apartment in chiba just east 
of tokyo he is not eligible for a veterans pension but said a 
small welfare payment was enough for his modest needs 
he said he rises before dawn as he did in the jungle and goes 
for a walk around the town then spends the day reading and 
watching television 
beginning in 1970 the guerrillas had shortwave radio and 
hashimoto learned of his homelands postwar redevelopment i knew 
japan had fully recuperated from the destruction of the war and had 
become a major economic power he said 
even so the modern scene amazed him 
i never saw that many people and cars in my life he said 
it got me tired just by looking at them people in the street 
were also walking very fast 
of japans proper role in the world he said we should always 
think in terms of whats good for the rest of the world as well as 
whats good for japan 
one country should never cause troubles in other countries for 
the sake of its own gains in that sense it was wrong for japan to 
expand to the southeast asia in the way it did and start the 
pacific war against the united states 
freedom he said is a beautiful thing but my feeling is that 
some people are taking the spirit of freedom wrongly and thinking 
they are free to do anything i think it is important for us to 
know that real freedom should not cause troubles for others 
hashimoto said he would spend his remaining days visiting 
relatives of fallen comrades 
i am too old to start something new but i want to go around 
japan to meet families of my colleagues and tell them how they were 
doing in the jungle he said

time was when buying a can of beans was as 
easy as pie 
you had to consider whether the beans would be tasty and 
nutritious and wouldnt have too much salt 
its not that simple any more now a savvy consumer considers 
whether he should be buying his beans in biodegradable containers 
and beyond that the social policies of the company that cans the 
beans 
does it hire and promote women trade with south africa also 
manufacture cigarettes pollute recycle test its products on 
animals 
some investors also are raising questions like that they want 
to know whether the companies they support do more than merely make 
a profit they want their investment dollars to have a social 
conscience 
that process of looking into corporate policies has been given a 
lot of names green consumerism economic democracy 
corporate responsibility or empowerment opponents might 
call it supermarket socialism 
we call it casting an economic vote said leslie gottlieb 
representative of the council on economic priorities a 21yearold 
nonprofit research organization and a proponent 
in the 90s people have a need to be empowered she said 
they want to know the policies behind the companies they support 
and invest in we no longer want to be guided only by advertising 
slogan 
last year the council published a booklet shopping for a 
better world a quick amp easy guide to socially responsible 
supermarket shopping which rates companies and products on 10 
criteria 
the council took a chance and initially published 100000 
copies the booklet is now in a mass market paperback published by 
ballantine total sales have exceeded 699000 
growth has been rapid too in investment funds that buy stocks 
only in firms that meet social responsibility criteria 
the socially responsible investment funds of calvert group 
of the washington suburb of bethesda md favor firms that avoid 
south africa northern ireland nuclear power weapons of mass 
destruction and animal testing have progressive records on equal 
opportunity and promotion of women into the corporate boardroom 
make safe non polluting and recyclable products and use 
alternative fuel sources 
it turns out that of the top 1000 publicly traded companies 
60 percent pass our criteria said steve schueth calvert vice 
president for socially responsible investing 
john schultz president of the social investment forum a 
minneapolisbased trade association said the amount of money put 
in such screened investments went from 40 billion in 1984 to 
500 billion this year 
schueth said the phenomena goes back to the 1920s when church 
groups steered their investment money away from stocks in tobacco 
alcohol or gambling firms socially responsible investing is 
much further advanced in europe where it is pushed by the 
green environmental movement 
in america it is growing but it is still minuscule because 
99 percent of all decisions are made on other grounds said 
sociologist amitai etzioni of george washington university who has 
kept an eye on the phenomenon 
it is still so small that statistics cannot put a handle on 
it he said i dont know if it is oneeight of 1 percent or 
oneeighth of oneeighth of 1 percent 
it is essential to note that we are only talking about what 
business does at the margins etzioni added no one in his 
right mind thinks that business should dedicate itself solely to 
doing good 
still theres a philosophical argument against subjecting 
business decisions to a socially responsibility test 
nobel prizewinning economist milton friedman a wellknown 
conservative makes a distinction between how people spend and 
invest their own money and other peoples money 
with their own money they can do what they like he said but 
if they spend or invest on behalf of others it is irresponsible to 
make the decision on criteria not specified by the moneys owner 
usually to maximize profits or get the best buy 
i doubt very much that much of the endowment of harvard 
university to take one example was contributed by people who 
intended that harvard should sacrifice income for some supposedly 
superior purpose said friedman 
harvard may disagree the university announced recently that it 
has weeded tobacco stocks from its endowments portfolios 
argued friedman the fundamental principle is very simple 
responsibility is individual and not social the very concept of 
social responsibility is a snare and a delusion 
as for whether the movement is a growing and permanent one that 
depends 
said schultz if you make the decision that a corporate 
relationship to society is important it is very difficult to 
unmake the decision 
he said it was the kids at the school lunch counter who 
compelled the nations major tuna canners to stop buying tuna that 
had been caught by methods that also kill dolphins as adults he 
said those kids will continue to press for business decisions made 
with a social conscience 
said friedman if society continues moving in a socialist 
direction then it will be a permanent part of the landscape if we 
should move in the opposite direction then it will not be a 
permanent part 
so theres no telling if it will ever be easier to buy a can of 
beans

dramatically larger crops have brought 
television and motorbikes to oncepoor villages and turned a nation 
with chronic food shortages into the worlds thirdranking rice 
exporter 
nature has been kind the past two years but the engine for 
growth has been the communist partys retreat from the disaster of 
collective agriculture and adoption of freemarket policies that 
gave farmers incentives 
vietnams rice boom may be the biggest success story of the 
economic reforms many communistruled countries adopted in recent 
years industry and other sectors of the vietnamese economy have 
fared poorly 
truong cong tin deputy director of the government institute of 
agricultural science of south vietnam said agriculture appears 
able to lift vietnams overall economic development about 80 
percent of the 65 million vietnamese work on the land 
aid officials said the progress in traditionally impoverished 
villages of the north may help reduce the huge flow boat people 
out of the country 
in 1988 the north imported 300000 tons of rice and appealed 
for emergency foreign aid for provinces where millions of people 
were hungry because of devastating typhoons officials said some 
farmers had to eat their rice seed stocks 
now the north feeds itself for the first time in decades and 
last year even exported about 40000 tons of rice said tran bach 
ngoc an official of the state rice export company vinafood the 
south produced the rest of the record 14 million tons of rice 
exported 
officials said vietnam had exported about 600000 tons of rice 
in the first half of 1990 and the years total might surpass 1989 
they said improvements such as replacing antiquated milling 
machines could make vietnam a threat to thailand and the united 
states the leading exporters 
before we worked in the fields very regularly sometimes 
eight hours a day but we didnt work very hard said le minh re 
51 of da ton village on the outskirts of hanoi the national 
capital in the north 
we did not get the amount of rice equal to the effort now if 
we work hard we will have more rice and can use it for our own 
needs now even some city people rush here to rent out land from 
the cooperative to farm 
re is starting a lucrative silkworm industry and building a 
house for his son 
brick houses have replaced most thatched huts in da ton and a 
new school was built last year farmers who once took their goods 
to market on bicycles use japanesemade motorcycles one of every 
five families has television 
some bought blackandwhite tvs and now theyve changed to 
color said the head of the cooperative le van bui during the 
interview he was distracted occasionally by the latemorning soap 
opera 
bui and other officials identified the key reform as communist 
party resolution 10 adopted in april 1988 after several years of 
poor production 
resolution 10 gave farmers longterm leases on the land 
encourageing them to enrich it it also reduced the role of the 
cooperative so farmers would do most of the work individually not 
as part of unmotivated work groups 
today cooperatives like the one at da ton are involved in 
helping farmers get supplies and technical aid not in actual 
production 
improving a system introduced in 1981 authorities also 
increased the amount of the crop farmers could sell on the free 
market and low prices paid by the state were brought into line 
with the free market 
greater state investment and technical improvements increased 
production particularly in the mekong delta of the south where 
one of the worlds great rivers nourishes verdant ricelands 
last year the government provided irrigation for about 250000 
acres of rice paddies that had depended on rain said tin of the 
research institute 
he said that allowed two good crops a year instead of one and 
with the addition of fertilizer the farms switched to highyield 
varieties that produce two or three times as much grain 
to boost production further he said the government must 
increase support to farmers and attract foreign investment in 
agriculture 
an immediate problem is a fertilizer shortage that western 
businessmen said was hurting production 
the soviet union has supplied 90 percent of vietnams needs 
under a barter contract that expires this year but says future 
economic deals must be based on commercial merit not the 
fraternal socialism of the past 
frictions could increase in the global rice trade vietnam 
whose major customers include china india and african countries 
has penetrated traditional thai markets with prices 30 to 40 a 
ton lower than thailands after thailand complained the 
vietnamese agreed to raise their prices

you can look at it as a problem to be solved 
which is probably why it hasnt been or you can view it as an 
opportunity it is health care and how it can be made affordable 
americans havent dealt well with the issue in the past they 
have even tried to ignore it but it wont be ignored they have 
attempted to make it somebodys elses responsibility but by its 
nature it is very personal 
the issue seldom has been faced headon 
individuals attempt to pass responsibility to insurers 
government and business government fears the responsiblity and so 
does business and the two have bucked the issue back and forth for 
decades 
none has managed to keep the costs down not the individual 
not the insurer not the government not the provider and so 
those costs rise every year at a rate that exceeds the consumer 
price index 
last year health care costs jumped 85 percent nearly double 
the general rate of inflation you can look back 20 years or so 
and month by month the story is almost always the same the rise in 
health care costs leads the list 
in a sense the issue on the critical list for decades now 
is becoming grave it is eating up the gross national product it 
accounts for 12 percent now and seems headed for 15 percent maybe 
by the year 2000 
us per capita spending on health care is double that of 
germany or france last year says consultant foster higgins amp co 
the bill for employersponsored medical plans jumped 20 percent to 
2600 per employee 
the future holds this a growing bill for aids and a population 
that not only is growing older but living longer by the turn of 
the century about 13 percent of the american population will be 
over age 65 
the picture just described is gloomy almost always it has been 
portrayed that way and there has been a very unamerican tendency 
to be routed by the facts and it must be conceded even to lie 
down in defeat 
gradually however more american business people are viewing 
the situation as one ripe for innovative approaches where such a 
challenge exists they reason there must be opportunity too 
here are some of the ways 
hospital management companies these were the first businesses 
to accept the challenge and some have demonstrated they can 
provide good health care and make a profit 
now some see the gravity of the health care situation as 
offering a new opportunity especially in acute care facilities 
health education programs they are becoming more vital to 
corporate plans putting the emphasis on prevention the cost of 
prevention business now recognizes is a small fraction of the 
cost of correction 
incentive programs such as that developed at mount vernon 
ny hospital by dr douglas ratner to encourage better living 
habits and thus avoid costly treatments when health deteriorates 
his program wealth from health offers cash benefits to workers 
who take responsibility for maintaining their health through 
sensible living styles the program is now under consideration by 
corporations 
freestanding surgery centers they specialize in surgical 
procedures rather than treating a full range of medical problems 
limited in scope they are proving to be efficient medically and 
financially 
rehabilitation centers why maintain patients in fully equipped 
hospitals when they dont need such services companies 
specializing in rehabilitation have shown they can help patients 
and make a business profit doing so 
home health care some of the fastest growing young companies 
are in this field in a sense they bring the hospital a very 
stripped down version right to the patients home

in auto racing a scuff means a tire thats 
been around the track a couple of times thats got a few bumps and 
bruises a new tire is too slick drivers say and needs a lap or 
two to scuff it in 
in acting there are scuffs as well one might be defined as a 
straighttalking academy award winner who wants directors to leave 
him alone will turn down a part if the moneys not right and has 
little use for the old hollywood movies 
someone perhaps like robert duvall 
some actors like to talk a lot and i dont particularly like 
to talk a lot duvall says leaning forward coming down hard on 
the word like 
you just go out and do it sometimes you should film 
rehearsals theres something in rehearsals thats lost in film 
duvall will tell you he didnt care about auto racing before 
making days of thunder and doesnt care about it now he also 
didnt spend much time talking to star tom cruise though he 
respects the young actor and would have preferred a less 
elaborate production one that didnt have 15 chiefs putting in 
their opinions 
but the actor did enjoy hanging out with race car builders while 
doing location work in the carolinas part of the research that 
went into his role as crew chief and mentor to cruise a flashy 
hottempered driver 
when the guy comes with the blueprints from detroit these 
guys dont need blueprints duvall said in an interview at his 
apartment on manhattans upper west side they just do it off the 
top of their heads theyre sleepers in a way there are some 
pretty bright guys out there and sometimes you count them out 
guys like that are offthecuff guys an awful lot of 
knowledge is given off the cuff these guys are a reservoir of 
information 
duvall has always prided himself on being that kind of actor 
getting inside his characters without worrying about motivation or 
the method or any other fancy technique 
in days of thunder he plays harry hogge a tightlipped 
kind of guy a philosopher tucked under a race cap muttering wisdom 
about brakes and tires talking like a man whos answering 
questions asked long ago 
check out duvalls apartment and youll think a lot about 
history the outside is unimpressive a modestlooking brownstone 
notable only for a long gray awning its the kind of building you 
walk right by 
but inside the ceilings are over 20 feet high and the walls 
are covered with tapestries books and country music tapes the 
building dates back to the turn of the century and the great tenor 
enrico caruso once lived in his apartment 
on the mantelpiece sits the oscar he won as country singer mac 
sledge in tender mercies family pictures are propped up on the 
piano and sketches of tango dancers the profession of duvalls 
fiancee hang throughout 
by the time the shade had reached the river augustus would 
have mellowed larry mcmurtry wrote in the novel lonesome 
dove describing the extexas ranger played by duvall last year 
in the acclaimed television adaptation 
its early evening and duvall dressed in a striped polo shirt 
and slacks mellows as he talks about his long career all else is 
quiet except for an antique french clock that chimes gently in the 
background 
way back when i was in college recalls duvall born in 
1931 there was a wonderful man named frank parker who had been 
a dancer in world war i we did a fulllength mime play and i 
played a harlequin clown i really liked that 
then i played an older guy in all my sons and at one point 
i had this emotional moment where this emotion was pouring out 
parker said at that moment he didnt think acting can be carried 
any further than that and this guy was a very critical guy so i 
thought at that moment at least this is what i wanted to do 
he appeared on stage in new york in the late 1950s and broke 
into film in 1962 as boo radley in to kill a mockingbird hes 
since played scuffs in uniform the great santini apocalypse 
now scuffs in cowboy hats tender mercies true grit 
and scuffs in suits the godfather network 
duvall won the best actor oscar in 1983 for tender mercies 
hes received academy award nominations for best actor in 1980 for 
the great santini and for best supporting actor in 1972 for 
the godfather and apocalypse now in 1979 he considered 
appearing in the godfather iii scheduled for release in 
november but said he couldnt agree on salary 
ive lost projects i really liked and then 24 hours later 
he said pausing marking off the time with two quick 
handslaps ive forgotten all about itsometimes just the will to 
do it is the hardest part i lose something so what no big deal 
its an unromantic view similar to the thinking of playwright 
horton foote who won oscars for the screenplays of tender 
mercies and to kill a mockingbird and wrote the upcoming 
duvall film convicts 
my first memory was of stories about the past foote once 
observed a past that according to the storytellers was 
superior to the life then being lived 
it didnt take me long however to understand that the 
present was all we had for the past was gone and nothing could be 
done about it 
you go to old movies duvall said and you see crappy 
acting except for a handful like spencer tracy gone with the 
wind is a travesty thats one of the worst movies i ever saw in 
my life i can go see a student film better than that one 
ive got a quarter of my career left and i got a lot of stuff 
i want to do when i was doing colors in 1988 with sean penn 
someone asked me how i do it all these years keep it fresh well 
if you dont overwork have some hobbies you can do it and stay 
hungry even if youre not really hungry

three centuries on the battle 
of the boyne still counts as a current event in northern ireland 
every 12th of july finds hundreds of flute and drum bands out on 
the streets of villages and towns rattling windows with thunderous 
lambeg drums and tootling stirring ditties that cast the battle of 
the boyne as a protestant triumph over a roman catholic despot 
stern men in dark suits and bowler hats black umbrellas tightly 
furled march in the orange sashes of the loyal orange institution 
banners salute king william iii king billy the victor at the 
river boyne 
your fourth of july your declaration of independence is seen 
by americans as the point in history where they secured their 
freedom secured their liberty as individuals from an oppressive 
tyrannical power said ronnie hanna general manager of the 
ulster society we would see 12th of july in similar terms 
if you were an englishman you might say this is a kind of 
bizarre continuation of a religious controversy said atq 
stewart a professor of history at queens university in belfast 
in fact stewart said it is about a problem that exists now 
that problem which underlies 21 years of violence and nearly 
2800 deaths is a population divided between 1 million protestants 
loyal to british rule and 600000 roman catholics who identify with 
ireland 
the parades combine history and current events as they have 
every year since 1985 orangemen will reaffirm their opposition to 
the angloirish agreement which gave the irish government a say in 
the provinces affairs 
the 12th is a public holiday in northern ireland but not a 
mandatory one it is a protestant holiday honoring a protestant 
king 
the sash my father wore one of the most popular of the 
orange marching songs says the winners at the boyne fought to 
maintain our unity religion laws and freedom 
an exhibition at the ulster museum however stresses that the 
battle was an episode in a larger european struggle against king 
louis xiv of france 
none of the kings in conflict cared particularly about ireland 
and the irish says a panel at the exhibit james came to 
ireland solely to recover his english throne william solely to 
defeat james 
james ii a convert to roman catholicism was removed from the 
english throne in the glorious revolution of 1688 his daughter 
mary and soninlaw william of orange were invited to rule 
with backing from louis xiv james tried to make a comeback 
through ireland 
on july 1 july 12 on the modern calendar william commanded 
dutchmen danes french huguenots english germans and northern 
irish protestants the forces james led were from france germany 
england and ireland 
james made his stand at the boyne the last physical obstacle 
between williams army and dublin william had superior numbers and 
proved to be the superior tactician 
inevitably it was all far more complicated than the 
traditional symbols even to the point that there were people from 
the same families on different sides said william maguire 
curator of the ulster museum exhibition 
indeed pope innocent xi sided not with the catholic louis but 
with king william the protestant kings men wore sprigs of green 
a color now always identified with ireland and opposed to the 
orange 
what often strikes me as a historian is that everybody knows 
today that whats happening is immensely complicated and everyday 
life is immensely complicated and yet you are somehow expecting a 
simple version of the past and are content with it as if the past 
never was real life maguire said 
james fled ireland after the battle although his forces were 
not finally defeated until the battle at aughrim in western ireland 
in 1691 
the irish attached a rude name to james called him james the 
s maguire said thats his popular irish title and james 
went off blaming the irish for letting him down quite unjustly 
the orangemen with their banners showing king billy astride a 
pawing white horse often have cast the battle on religious lines 
the old marching song protestant boys recalls when james 
half a bigot and more of a knave with masses and frenchmen the 
land would enslave 
catholic nationalists and protestant unionists agree on what 
william represents in the 1920s irish rebels attacked the statue 
of william in dublin even to the extent of trucking it to a 
junkyard and lopping off its head 
the boyne valley is in ireland halfway between dublin and the 
border with northern ireland the orange orders hopes for a big 
300th anniversary ceremony on the battlefield were dropped because 
of strenuous opposition 
although the songs sometimes give the impression the orange 
order fought at the boyne it was founded in 1795 after a skirmish 
between protestants and catholics in county armagh 
in his book the narrow ground stewart notes that orange 
parades were blamed for half a dozen riots in belfast between 1813 
and 1914 
it was a protestant parade that led to street battles in 
londonderry in 1969 that drew the british army into northern 
ireland and revived the irish republican armys armed campaign 
against british rule 
the provocation alleged by catholics may arise simply from the 
fact that orangeism is a symbol of something intensely hated or 
from the display of party colors and playing of party tunes or 
from that most menacing of sounds even to protestant ears the 
thunder of orange drums stewart wrote 
for unionists history is a 17th century drama of peril 
resistance and triumph the threat came in 1641 when the irish 
rebelled and murdered protestant colonists resistance in 1688 
when the apprentice boys slammed the gates of derry against james 
victory in 1690 
you have to remember that 1641 was within living memory for 
most people in the 1690s hanna said this is why people rushed 
to londonderry in 1688 1689 because they thought it was a rerun 
of 1641 
it has often been said that we have a siege mentality said 
george patton executive officer of the orange orders grand lodge 
in belfast 
im not sure whether its a mental state or an actual thing 
weve been under attack almost continuously were still under 
siege to a degree today its the ira murdering our people 
patton said the three orange lodges will be out marching early 
in his village of scarva population 400 then travel to tandragee 
for the district parade with 18 other lodges then join a 
countywide parade 
on the 13th scarva is overrun with 50000 people or more for 
the annual sham fight a halfhour battle of the boyne with 
wooden swords 
the orange order has about 100000 members including most of 
northern irelands leading protestant politicians and is a potent 
force in the province 
its due to the orange order largely that the battle of the 
boyne has been singled as being the crucial thing maguire said 
the battle of aughrim was a far greater battle far more 
decisive far more bloody but of course from a public relations 
point of view it was far less interesting there were no kings 
there

frank godfrey thinks the battle of the 
boyne is part of irelands common heritage north and south 
michael bell says the battle symbolizes everything thats rotten 
in ireland 
bells view prevailed when people living near the mouth of the 
river boyne contemplated the prospect of thousands of members of 
the loyal orange institution coming to commemorate the battle 
it would lead to possible injury confrontation and loss of 
life said bell the local member of parliament he estimates 
security would have cost 500000 irish pounds 800000 
we didnt have anything to celebrate he said we lost the 
battle if people wanted to celebrate something that is effectively 
a symbol of the divisions in our country i didnt think we should 
be part of that 
my answer to that is that we didnt lose the battle of the 
boyne we lost nothing in fact said godfrey a member of the 
local council who lives outside drogheda in a thatched farm house 
identified in big painted letters as boyne cottage 
the battle of the boyne was fought between two foreign 
monarchs king william of orange a dutchman and king james ii an 
englishman he said the battle could have been anywhere in 
europe and it was fortunate that it was here its part and 
parcel now of our history and our common heritage 
george patton executive officer of the orange orders grand 
lodge in belfast said landowners at the battle site asked as much 
as 50000 pounds 80000 to rent a field for the day and the 
order couldnt buy adequate insurance 
oh there was a lot of hostility toward it yes he said 
there were statements made by elected representatives and if i 
had said a similar thing about nationalists or catholics in 
belfast i would be in the crumlin road prison for incitement to 
hatred 
an unscientific telephone survey by the drogheda independent 
found most of those responding opposed to an orange celebration 
editor paul murphy said but added if i had to judge it i would 
say the people of drogheda are largely indifferent 
murphy said there had been more controversy over the opening of 
irish cements new shale quarry near godfreys cottage in donore 
local opponents of the quarry have the vocal support of northern 
ireland protestants who resent the desecration of the battlefield 
unlike britain ireland issued a postage stamp commemorating the 
battle droghedas civic fathers loaned their mace and sword given 
to the town by william iii to the ulster museum in belfast for its 
exhibition 
the irish government declares its door open to northern 
irelands protestants but godfrey said when they came knocking 
and said they want to come down and have a religious service on the 
site of the battle of the boyne the government practically 
ignored the plea 
bell said thirty thousand orangemen we need that like we 
need a hole in the head

there will be many tunes at 
12th of july parades in northern ireland but one likely to be 
heard everywhere is the sash my father wore 
although the orange order was founded nearly a century after the 
battle of the boyne the song connects its traditional orange sash 
with the victory of king william iii in 1690 and the battles at 
derry aughrim and enniskillen 
 
sure im an ulster orangeman from erins isle i came 
to see my british brethren all of honor and of fame 
and to tell them of my forefathers who fought in days of yore 
that i might have the right to wear the sash my father wore 
 
chorus 
it is old but it is beautiful and its colors they are fine 
it was worn at derry aughrim enniskillen and the boyne 
my father wore it as a youth in bygone days of yore 
and on the twelfth i love to wear the sash my father wore 
 
for those brave men who crossed the boyne have not fought or 
died in vain 
our unity religion laws and freedom to maintain 
if the call should come well follow the drum and cross that 
river once more 
that tomorrows ulsterman may wear the sash my father wore 
 
chorus 
 
and when some day across the sea to antrims shore you come 
well welcome you in royal style to the sound of flute and drum 
and ulsters hills shall echo still from rathlin to dromore 
as we sing again the loyal strain of the sash my father wore 
 
chorus

an alliance of private armies 
apparently financed by drug traffickers has taken over this 
tropical town and much of central colombia 
after driving out leftist guerrillas the vigilantes also 
evicted beggars and prostitutes and opened dozens of schools 
welcome to puerto boyaca the antisubversive capital of 
colombia says a sign at the towns entrance 
the private armies have become a dreaded part of colombias 
violent society and the government says they have turned into 
rightwing death squads 
ranchers organized them with the armys blessing about 10 
years ago to fight guerrillas who were extorting money as a 
revolution tax 
if the money was not paid guerrillas would kidnap ranchers 
burn down their buildings and rustle their cattle 
drug traffickers got into the act when the ranchers ran short of 
money and weapons says a report by colombias secret police that 
was seen by the associated press 
death squads began roaming the region and the army has been 
either unable or unwilling to stop massacres of peasants 
vigilantes surrounded houses of suspected leftists called the 
inhabitants out and shot then down in segovia a central colombian 
town with a leftist mayor gunmen drove through the streets and 
shot 43 people to death 
cocaine barons were glad to help the vigilante operation because 
leftist guerrillas had kidnapped several members of their families 
for ransom and the traffickers had bought hundreds of thousands of 
acres in the region as investments 
with the guerrillas gone the private armies have offered to lay 
down their arms if a deal can be struck with the government 
at the end of june interior minister horacio serpa said the 
government was willing to take action leading to conditional 
amnesty for such minor offenses as illegal posession of weapons 
but not for murder 
ivan duque spokesman for the armed groups said serpas 
statement was vague and does not offer any guarantee to farmers 
and ranchers that they will be protected against guerrillas 
a prominent human rights activist said of the ranchers they 
have set up a mini fascist state right in the middle of colombia 
he asked that his name be withheld because of a recent attempt on 
his life 
puerto boyaca is a rough town of dirt streets lined with 
concrete buildings hardlooking men in cowboy boots and panama 
hats hang out at the pool hall some wearing mirrored sunglasses 
open shirts and gold chains 
parked outside are ford broncos and chevy blazers status 
symbols of underlings in the cocaine traffic 
the town is about midway on the magdalena river which runs 
almost the length of colombia and empties into the caribbean the 
private armies control the magdalena medio a surrounding region 
that covers much of central colombia 
in the past decade tens of thousands of colombians have been 
killed by drug traffickers leftist guerrillas and rightwing 
paramilitary groups 
the selfdefense groups managed to create this climate of 
peace you see here in puerto boyaca duque said the vigilante 
spokesman recently was elected an alternate federal senator 
peace does reign in the town but critics say thats because all 
opposition has been silenced 
local politics and the press are controlled by the association 
of cattle ranchers and farmers of magdalena medio known by its 
spanish acronym acdegam 
members say the association provides vital services neglected by 
the central government it runs 33 schools and a pharmacy and even 
offers classes in dance and painting 
the building acdegam occupies is painted pink plastic flowers 
adorn the halls and desks 
human rights groups say the organization is a front for death 
squads 
paramilitary groups from magdalena medio have ordered the 
massacre of many innocent peasants said the activist who spoke 
with an ap reporter 
duque and the mayor of puerto boyaca gustavo londono described 
allegations of atrocities as a plot by leftistss to discredit 
honest ranchers and farmers 
we are not drug traffickers murderers or robbers londono 
said 
people who live in magdalena medio were subjected first to 
extortion kidnappings and murder by leftist rebels then to the 
rightwing vigilantes who replaced them 
how can anyone speak out against whats going on here said 
a 23yearold woman sitting with her baby in puerto boyacas park 
they control everything 
according to the police report the economic crisis 
confronting the selfdefense groups was resolved through an 
alliance with drug trafficking in 1985 
in return for money the private armies helped process and 
smuggle cocaine and killed opponents of drug trafficking it said 
no one including the government denies that elements of the 
colombian army initially armed and trained vigilante groups 
it was the government which created them by decree armed 
them and trained them but when convenient the government washes 
its hands of everything duque said 
the report by the secret police implicated the armed groups in a 
1988 massacre of 20 peasants in northern colombia and other 
atrocities it said they were involved in many of the 1000 murders 
since 1985 of members of the leftwing patriotic union party 
magdalena medios private armies have close ties to armed 
rightwing groups elsewhere in colombia the report said 
the government has accused henry perez reputed leader of the 
private armies and luis rubio former mayor of puerto boyaca of 
ordering massacres of peasants 
both are at large a judge who issued arrest warrants for them 
has been murdered 
duque who leads peace negotiations with the government said 
the private armies are fed up with violence and want to emulate 
guerrilla groups that have laid down their arms or are in the 
process of doing so 
the greatest danger in colombia is being alive he said

perched high in a redwood tree his head 
fixed squarely in the riflesight of a policeman below earth 
first activist dan johnson watched as a logger climbed toward him 
then a strange thing happened the logger stopped a few feet 
below johnson and the two began to talk about trees and jobs and 
spotted owls 
of course i saw a lot of holes in his arguments but he 
probably saw a lot in mine too johnson recalled we had a 
really good talk up there in the tree 
talking its new ground for earth first whose militant 
approach to defending nature has angered authorities and 
embarrassed mainstream environmentalists for 10 years 
earth first has put on a kinder gentler face for redwood 
summer its campaign to halt logging in californias last 
unprotected groves of ancient redwoods pounding spikes into trees 
to make logging hazardous is out climbing trees and refusing to 
leave when lumberjacks arrive is in 
as earth firsters nationwide gather for a campout starting 
monday at montanas beaverhead national forest organizers from 
california see the nonviolent approach as a way of widening their 
groups appeal 
they hope to attract activists from around the nation and 
convince local timber workers that earth first targets corporate 
bosses not the rankandfile 
but the change is more than just tactical stung by fbi 
investigations death threats and a car bombing in may that injured 
two activists many earth firsters are running scared of the 
violence stirred up by their own burnthebulldozers brand of 
rhetoric 
any softening is relative of course earth first still ranks 
as perhaps the nations most extreme environmental group with a 
famous contempt for authority and a prickly adherence to its credo 
no compromise in the defense of mother earth 
the groups founding in 1980 was inspired by the late edward 
abbeys novel the monkey wrench gang which romanticized 
environmentalists who destroyed billboards and bulldozers while 
plotting to blow up arizonas glen canyon dam 
in 1981 earth first activists draped a 300foot banner 
painted to resemble a crack over the dam in 1983 cofounder dave 
foreman was dragged 100 yards by an oregon loggers truck when he 
lay down in front of it 
more recently earth firsters have chained themselves to 
treecrushing machines in texas blocked logging roads in 
washington and occupied roadbuilding equipment in arizona this 
summer in northern california more than 50 have been arrested for 
sitting in trees blockading sawmills and picketing government 
offices to protest the cutting of oldgrowth redwoods 
such acts of civil disobedience are the public side of earth 
first but police believe the group is more destructive when 
nobodys looking 
last year in arizona an 18month fbi investigation ended with 
the arrests of three earth first activists who allegedly cut 
through the leg of an electric transmission tower the fbi claimed 
they were practicing for an assault against nuclear facilities in 
california and colorado 
foreman also was arrested on charges that he helped plan the 
scheme all four have denied the charges foreman faces trial in 
september 
earth first leaders insist the group does not condone property 
destruction 
its not earth firsters who monkeywrench its individuals 
said darryl cherney one of the two activists injured may 24 in 
oakland when a pipe bomb exploded in the back seat of their car 
cherney 33 suffered a cut over one eye judi bari 40 suffered a 
broken pelvis and is still hospitalized 
immediately after the explosion authorities portrayed cherney 
and bari as inept bombmakers transporting the device for some 
terrorist purpose but charges have yet to be filed against the 
pair and they insist they were victims not perpetrators of the 
blast 
cherney said he and bari had received more than 30 death threats 
since announcing plans for redwood summer in march one letter 
from the stompers claimed to be from disgruntled timber 
workers it warned if you want to be a martyr we will be happy 
to oblige 
authorities said they are investigating all angles we havent 
ruled out the possibility that they might have been targets of the 
device rather than transporters said fbi spokesman duke diedrich 
but earth first doesnt trust the fbi 
foreman claims the bureau wants to discredit earth first he has 
obtained fbi wiretap transcripts in which an undercover agent tells 
other agents that foremans arrest would send a message to 
radical environmentalists thats all were really doing the 
agent said then noticed his microphone was on and added we 
dont need that on tape hoo boy 
the fbi probe compounds problems earth first has brought on 
itself 
once just a handful of selfdescribed rednecks for 
wilderness the group now claims about 5000 activists in dozens 
of chapters nationwide 
there are no membership requirements no central control and 
sometimes it seems as if theres no control at all 
redwood summer organizers have recruited protestors from around 
the nation the result has been an ideological stew of hippies 
anarchists and pagans to name a few all marching under the earth 
first banner 
we used to be a small autonomous group said mickey dulas 
a california earth firster since 1987 now there are people 
arriving every day we dont know their tolerance for violence we 
dont know if theyre narcs 
one previously highprofile california activist is in hiding 
reportedly fearful of death threats and fbi infiltrators and 
foreman wont attend this weeks national gathering i think the 
law enforcement agencies are going to disrupt things he said 
paranoia has infected the movement 
unfortunately along with our many battles for wilderness we 
must now also wage a battle of selfpreservation editor john 
davis wrote in the latest issue of the earth first journal the 
groups newsletter 
but davis is confident the cause will prevail earth first 
has prospered through the years he wrote largely because we 
are too disorganized to squelch

loggers miners and ranchers burned by 
monkeywrenching ecowarriors no longer have to suffer 
silently they can call 1303testify 
the hot line the letters stand for tell of environmental 
sabotage and terrorism interfering with freedom is run by the 
mountain states legal foundation a conservative law firm that 
believes the news media have glamorized the bulldozerburning 
treespiking exploits of radical environmentalists such as the 
earth first group 
they all treat these people as some modernday robin hoods 
whose concern is not the poor of the forest but the trees and i 
think thats a terrible disservice to the american people said 
foundation president william perry pendley 
pendleys mission to rally those who believe in multiple use of 
the nations public lands and galvanize public opinion against 
environmentalists who would lock up those lands for wildlife 
the denverbased legal foundation carries on work begun in 1978 
by its first chief legal officer james watt who later rose to the 
top of environmentalist hatelists as president reagans interior 
secretary 
watt no longer is with the foundation but its work continues 
funded by individuals timber and ranching groups and corporations 
pendley said he favors a thriving environment with lush forests 
sparkling streams and fresh air but he also values the logging 
mining and grazing that help feed clothe and shelter americans 
our belief is we can protect the environment and still 
have respect for property rights and still have an economic 
system pendley said 
that message is no easy sell he said it must compete with the 
cuddly critters inevitably featured on posters urging people to 
protect wildlife 
being an environmentalist is a feelgood thing it doesnt ask 
you to make any hard decisions whatsoever it just says feel good 
care like animals he said 
what can i put up on posters cut trees produce 
income graze cattle mine for ore its not feelgood 
instead pendley hits the road he regales sympathetic industry 
groups and trade associations with horror stories gleaned from 
newspapers and from the several calls that come in each month to 
the hot line 
he tells of 18inch spikes driven into trees to spoil them for 
logging of cattle killed on public land of tiny spikes scattered 
on the ground to puncture trailbike tires 
records of the hot line calls are filed away eventually 
pendleys group hopes to collect enough evidence to file a suit 
against the environmentalists 
i frankly think that a lot of these people a lot of the 
environmental terrorists are just thugs that get off on violence 
that enjoy vandalism that enjoy sabotage pendley said and 
they say hey were doing this for the environment so its ok 
 
pendley has little chance of swaying unrepentant earth first 
activists who call his hot line with news of what they consider 
real vandalism federally approved timber sales drilling and road 
projects 
but he hopes for better luck in appealing to the public 
we have the working men and women of this country who believe 
in what we believe in he said when they are put at risk in a 
situation when they are threatened with the loss of their 
livelihoods and futures then they become energized and activated

its not grades and social 
events that preoccupy science students at ho chi minh university 
but crumbling buildings primitive equipment tattered books and 
crowded dorms 
in a decrepit building that wasnt new in french colonial days a 
half century ago a stairway reeked with the stench of a toilet 
in the physics lab students used equipment that belonged in a 
museum the newest book in the dusty chemistry library was 
published in 1974 
students said those who had to live on campus were packed seven 
or eight to rooms about 14 feet square that had one table a single 
light bulb and only intermittent electricity 
medical students said they didnt get enough to eat thats 
why we are so skinny said tran thanh cuong 27 
for the past two years vietnamese students have been 
increasingly vocal in demanding better conditions and even got the 
marxist curriculum revised 
sources said the authorities have yielded in hopes of avoiding 
the kind of student protests that challenged the chinese regime 
last year helped bring down communist governments in eastern 
europe and cause street battles with police in south korea 
although the leadership may fear it students in vietnam dont 
appear ready to demonstrate for democracy vietnamese and western 
sources say there have been no major demonstrations since the war 
ended in april 1975 
no students have been detained for political activity but any 
who advocated overthrowing the communist party would be arrested 
said do van chung head of the education ministrys department of 
student enrollment and management 
im sure some students think they can follow the example of 
the chinese students but we havent seen it openly expressed he 
said 
a westerner said he heard many people question communist rule 
during his year at a vietnamese university but never a student 
i ask them and they say here we are concentrating on money 
for food the westerner said speaking on condition of anonymity 
chung said students are the central issue in all the 
universities and colleges and teachers must meet them often to 
hear complaints he said this was part of the governments 
3yearold reform program not a reaction to events abroad 
last year the government doubled the stipend given each 
student which still equals less than 6 a month and said 
admission to universities would depend on examinations not family 
connections the first privately financed university thang long 
has opened in hanoi the capital 
in 1988 several hundred students in ho chi minh universitys 
economics school got the more dogmatic marxist tenets deleted from 
the curriculum and study of free markets included 
they made their demand in a rare teachin said nguyen cong khe 
an editor of the weekly review of youth magazine which joined 
other publications in supporting the students 
most of the complaining is in ho chi minh city formerly saigon 
capital of south vietnam but grumblings also have increased in the 
north which has been under communist authority since 1954 
hanoi universitys rector nguyen an said the school responded 
to complaints last year by renovating the cafeteria and 
dormitories but the students are far from satisfied their 
demands are always increasing 
chung said 165 students at hanois transportation college 
boycotted a meal last year to protest bad rice he said the 
government ordered the rice replaced criticized the rector and 
fired the cafeteria manager 
many students interviewed said they feared unemployment after 
graduation and chung said the government was reducing the number of 
student places in the universities because of the bleak job 
situation 
vietnam with a population of 65 million has only about 120000 
fulltime students at its 98 colleges and universities 
a western source said vietnamese students unlike those in 
china had little sense of collective interest and no tradition of 
protest most are from the conservative countryside and few 
vietnamese have studied in the west since 1975 
clearly there are anger and frustration of the kind that in 
burma in 1988 turned scattered fights and economic protests into a 
nationwide uprising against the government 
several weeks ago some vietnamese and cambodian students at ho 
chi minh university were injured in a fight over the theft of a 
motorbike 
late in 1989 a group of students vandalized the ky hoa 
amusement park in ho chi minh city after a drunken quarrel with a 
guard there said nguyen thi ngoc phuong a teacher at the 
university 
in another incident last year university students beat up two 
security men after arguing over a bicycle collision and authorities 
jailed the men briefly to placate the students ms phuong said 
in both cases she said the students shouted for more 
democracy but meant the freedom to do as they pleased

the pamphlet had been buried in a time 
capsule for more than a century its authors long dead and by the 
time it reached sherelyn ogden the words within had been lost to 
the ravages of acid and time 
i unwrapped it and it was a little heap of crumbs just a 
heap of crumbs she said there was just no way of telling what 
anything was 
ogden is a document preservationist but this pamphlet printed 
on the acidic paper that came into vogue after the industrial 
revolution was beyond preservation it was a casualty of the war 
being waged to halt the disintegration of our nations history 
before it all turns to dust 
its very urgent said merrily smith a preservationist at 
the library of congress almost all of the books that were 
produced after 1850 had a lot of acid in them theres huge numbers 
of brittle material 
and if the movement towards embrittlement cant be stopped 
then were looking at a tremendous loss of scholarship she said 
the problem dates to the middle of the 18th century when demand 
for paper exploded manufacturers abandoned the traditional cotton 
and linen rags from which they made paper for cheaper more 
available wood pulp 
to keep ink from spreading over this lowquality paper the 
manufacturers added aluminum sulphate and alumrosin chemicals 
that cause paper to become increasingly acidic and brittle over 
time 
while europe also is affected the situation is considered 
critical in the united states due to the relative youth of the 
nations paper record 
today an estimated 77 million books in american research 
libraries are dying the new york public library has said 70 
percent of the books printed in this century will be unusable by 
the year 2000 
some 325 million volumes in the library of congress alone are 
considered too brittle to be subjected to normal handling smith 
said 
staff members at the northeast document conservation center the 
nations largest are working to preserve some of the best of 
americas past in addition to classic volumes of writing the 
center has rescued original drawings by frank lloyd wright 
benedict arnolds oath of loyalty to the united states and john f 
kennedys fourthgrade report card 
the pace at the northeast center in andover does not seem 
frantic staff members sit on high stools under warm and bright 
lights their heads bent as they touch cracked and stained pages 
some wearing white aprons poke at paper floating in the large 
shallow baths that take up much of the room 
on a recent day the book bindery was still but for the small 
gestures of a single staff member peering at shreds of paper some 
no bigger than a fingernail strewn about a large easel 
ann russell the centers executive director agrees that the 
task of stalling the erosion of millions of books is no less than 
an emergency every day is another book too brittle to be read an 
ineradicable stain on an ansel adams original print a piece of 
history gone 
some of the kinds of materials we work on like nitrate 
photographic negatives some of our clients are monitoring their 
collections and every month they can say how many more of them have 
faded russell said theyre just watching their images 
disappear 
the cost of the conservation war will be dear in part because 
of its laborintensive nature 
at the center workers peel away damaging adhesives remove the 
books from their bindings and wash paper in a buffer solution they 
add new backings of japanese paper which is strong translucent 
and acidfree they touch up photographs and rebind books in 
leather with tones painstakingly matched to the original they keep 
a written record of all that they do 
in one case the patient was a huge map of europe used in the 
field by general john j pershing in world war i with 1200 tiny 
pins to mark troop movements and color codes signifying each units 
strength 
staff members picked off the pins recorded their locations and 
the colors underneath treated the map and returned each pin to its 
spot the project commissioned by the west point museum took two 
months 
the committee for preservation and access reported a typical 
large university research library would spend 240 million over 20 
years to maintain and microfilm its holdings books can sometimes 
cost 1000 and up to salvage said ogden 
the massachusetts town of marblehead paid 150000 for the 
center to preserve handpainted wallpaper hanging in a historic 
mansion 
in addition to having their collections restored book by book 
institutions also may use mass deacidification processes which 
employ chemical solvents and do not involve taking apart the book 
these methods are much cheaper averaging between 5 and 10 a 
volume smith said 
libraries also are putting parts of their collections on 
microfilm which can cost about 50 per volume smith said 
a concerted effort to identify the nations most complete 
collections and microfilm them is under way led by the national 
endowment for the humanities russell said 
hope for the future however experts agree lies not only in a 
mad scramble to hold on to whats been written todays books must 
be printed on acidfree or alkaline paper preservationists say 
paper manufacturers are beginning to listen russell said 
its finally starting to happen at this point theyve really 
heard the message she said every major manufacturer has at 
least one alkaline mill and now they have some stake in promoting 
this as a product 
the change comes none too soon the advance of brittle books is 
outpacing the preservationists they say 
in the library of congress which spends millions on 
preservation workers transfer between 11000 and 13000 volumes on 
microfilm per year smith said meanwhile about 70000 of the 
librarys volumes move into brittle status annually she said 
its not for lack of interest or for lack of money she 
said its just that theres lots of money to be spent on this i 
would say its a race against time and were losing

private citizens frustrated by the pace of 
prosecution in the 325 billion savings and loan mess could 
themselves sue alleged defrauders and pocket damages under a plan 
sponsors want to add to the senates omnibus crime bill 
the socalled bounty hunter plan is drawing fire from the 
justice department which says it might end up snarling criminal 
investigations already under way 
but sponsors say it could prove to be precisely what is needed 
to prod the cleanup into high gear 
the united states has just experienced the greatest financial 
theft in our history carried out by thousands of people and the 
wheels of justice grind with agonizing slowness said sen paul 
simon dill 
the general accounting office estimates that the savings and 
loan bailout will cost taxpayers between 325 and 500 billion 
depending on inflation interest rates and other economic 
conditions 
the bounty hunter plan is the last unresolved point in the 
wideranging crime package which is set for a vote on wednesday 
chief provisions of the package call for curbs on nine 
semiautomatic assault weapons plus capital punishment for 30 
federal crimes ranging from presidential assassination to espionage 
some senate liberals are disgruntled about the death penalty 
provisions and conservatives are ill at ease with any restrictions 
on the right to bear arms 
always anxious to show crimefighting zeal in an election year 
though senators are expected to whisk the package through without 
difficulty once the savings and loan dispute is wrapped up 
the bill then goes to the house where the judiciary committee 
already is at work on a distinctively different anticrime 
blueprint 
the bounty hunter plan is cosponsored by simon and sen 
william v roth jr rdel sen john heinz rpa has urged 
something similar 
endorsed by consumer advocate ralph nader the plan would cover 
savings and loan fraud under the false claims act which allows 
individuals to file fraud suits and pocket a portion of the damages 
as a reward 
of course those filing suit would have to have inside knowledge 
of specific savings and loan fraud and before setting off on their 
own they would first have to give federal prosecutors a chance to 
act on the problem 
critics at the justice department however say the false claims 
act is unconstitutional and ought to be junked 
the department prevailed on senators two weeks ago to postpone 
action on the plan it argued that federal agents on the trail of 
sampl swindlers were liable to get sidetracked into endless reviews 
of individual claims under the measure 
it also said the plan might spawn a quagmire of conflicting 
court cases and ultimately torpedo efforts to put sampl crooks behind 
bars 
by postponing action on the proposal the senate gave sponsors 
additional time for their sales pitch 
theres a game plan however in case talks fizzle if that 
happens lawmakers intend to go ahead and vote on the crime package 
and bring the savings and loan provisions to the floor later as a 
separate bill 
the senate already has done the hard work on the crime bill 
maintaining its curbs on semiautomatic assault weapons despite a 
fierce lobbying campaign by the usually influential national rifle 
association 
in other capitol hill action this week congressional budget 
negotiators plan to meet with white house counterparts in search of 
an agreement to cut the federal budget deficit by 50 billion in 
the fiscal year starting oct 1 
agreement has been elusive after nearly two months of talks but 
the bargaining intensified after president bush eased his position 
against taxes on june 26 saying he now believes they must be 
included in any budget pact 
participants say they hope a package of higher taxes and 
spending cuts can be agreed to before congress leaves for its 
august recess 
the senate armed services committee has scheduled closed 
sessions much of the week to craft a defense authorization bill for 
the next fiscal year 
controversial issues on the agenda include the bush 
administrations planned purchase of 75 b2 stealth bombers at more 
than 815 million each spending on the strategic defense 
initiative and the fate of the v22 osprey tiltrotor aircraft 
complicating the issue is uncertainty over the size of the total 
budget president bush has proposed 307 billion in military 
spending but lawmakers have balked at that amount 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services panel has 
said that the committee will fashion two bills one to his budget 
range of 289 billion to 291 billion and another to the senate 
budget committee total of 286 billion

when leaders of the worlds seven richest 
industrial nations gather here for their 16th annual economic 
summit the talks are likely to focus on soviet aid global trade 
disputes and environmental degradation 
here are sketches of the leaders and their priorities for the 
summit 
 
united states 
president bush has proclaimed ending the stalemate on global 
free trade talks as his no 1 priority for the summit but to 
achieve that goal he needs to reach a compromise with the 
europeans who are resisting americas call for a 10year phaseout 
of costly farm subsidies perhaps as a bargaining ploy bush 
intends to show the world leaders a good time in his adopted 
hometown kicking things off with a rodeo barbecue and country 
music extravaganza sunday night bush has been riding high in the 
public opinion polls but he has been jolted by the adverse reaction 
to his turnaround on the question of tax increases 
 
japan 
prime minister toshiki kaifu was considered a stopgap head of 
government when he assumed the leadership role in august 1989 after 
two predecessors resigned in quick succession yet he led his 
conservative liberal democratic party to a strong victory in 
february elections and now stands strong in the polls he has made 
easing trade tensions with the united states a high priority and 
has forged a close working relationship with bush kaifu will push 
for ending economic sanctions imposed on china following the 
prodemocracy crackdown but kaifus bid to unfreeze 52 billion 
worth of development loans is opposed by other summit countries 
 
west germany 
west german chancellor helmut kohl is steering his country to 
unification with east germany and has made no secret of his desires 
to be the first chancellor of a unified germany to win soviet 
support for speedy unification kohl is pushing for an economic aid 
package for the soviet union while denying that they are trying to 
buy off the soviets west german leaders concede that they need 
soviet agreement on various aspects of unification such as the 
disposition of the 380000 soviet troops in east germany 
 
britain 
british prime minister margaret thatcher is the dean of 
summiteers having celebrated her 11th year in office in may but 
high inflation and an unpopular new tax have left her conservative 
party trailing in the polls thatcher must call an election by june 
1992 and for the first time since she came to power polls now show 
that a narrow majority of britons think she will be defeated her 
main aims at the summit will include arguing against any 
largescale handouts to the soviet union 
 
france 
president francois mitterrands popularity ratings have dropped 
sharply in recent months but he still has five years to go in his 
second sevenyear term and thus isnt considered in severe 
difficulty mitterrand is expected to join germany in pushing for a 
soviet aid package mitterrand long a champion of greater aid to 
the developing world will push for more extensive efforts to trim 
the 13 trillion third world debt burden 
 
canada 
prime minister brian mulroney comes to houston with a satchelful 
of political problems he has just lost his battle for ratification 
of a constitutional amendment giving quebec distinct status and his 
popularity rating is at the lowest point for any canadian prime 
minister in history he is expected to use the economic meeting to 
reassure canadas foreign partners that the country is not falling 
apart and canada remains a safe place for foreign investors 
mulroney also seeks a commitment for more resources to fight global 
pollution 
 
italy 
premier giulio andreotti a virtual fixture in italian 
government for 40 years heads to the summit with the perennial 
problem facing italys coalition cabinets bickering among the 
partners the christian democrat sixtime premier has headed this 
coalition since july 1989 italy plans to push for cancelling the 
debt owed to governments by the worlds poorest countries he will 
also voice support for the soviet aid proposal and urge a crackdown 
on auto emissions as a way of protecting the environment

the first visit to this predominantly 
roman catholic nation by pope john paul ii will symbolize the end 
of a conflict between church and state 
john paul on his sixth tour of africa in september will be 
greeted in burundi by president pierre buyoya an army major who 
seized power in a coup prompted by his predecessors crackdown on 
catholics 
between 1985 and 1987 col jeanbaptiste bagaza expelled most 
foreign missionaries detained local priests including one who 
died in prison and prohibited church services during the week 
bagaza a member of the ruling minority tutsi tribe accused the 
church of sowing the seeds of revolution among the majority hutus 
some churches were banned including jehovahs witnesses and 
seventhday adventists and several catholic organizations were 
proscribed 
by early 1987 religious education had been halted prayer 
meetings in villages were forbidden and all church councils had 
been dissolved 
discontent spread among burundis 6 million people twothirds 
of whom are catholics 
buyoya took advantage of the angry mood to overthrow bagaza on 
sept 3 1987 
he has encouraged the return of foreign missionaries sought the 
advice of church leaders in unifying the country and lobbied 
vigorously for the papal visit 
the popes arrival will signal the end of an ugly chapter in 
our history and the catholic church can only profit from that 
said the rev adrien ntabona secretarygeneral of the catholic 
bishops conference 
residents of this scruffy capital on the shores of lake 
tanganyika are benefiting from the popes pilgrimage two months 
before he arrives 
bulldozers and graders are repairing main roads and potholed 
streets government buildings are being given a facelift and 
homeowners are promised handsome rewards for renting rooms to 
catholics from out of town 
several of burundis 204 catholic priests advised buyoyas 
military government on the unity charter he announced in may 
ntabona said the significance of the popes visit is that it 
comes at a time when our church is being renewed and revitalized 
the church is today socially better organized than any other group 
including political parties and it is in a strong position to 
influence unity between the two peoples 
with government support priests are broadcasting sermons 
explaining what unity will mean to hutus and tutsis 
most hutus and tutsis want peace ntabona said only a few 
extremists want conflict the church can help the moderates

the streetwalkers hollow eyes gave her away 
she needed a fix behind her on the empty street a van approached 
and she glanced over maybe she could turn a quick trick 
the driver of the white dodge had a different idea he wanted to 
test her blood for aids and ask a few questions and he offered a 
bag of condoms and 10 three times the amount she might make for 
a sexual favor 
but more he offered to open a rare line of communication with a 
world ravaged by aids 
i really need your help said vanessa 37 as she stepped 
into the van she nestled into the comfortable back seat and 
stretched out her thin arm 
the inchlong track marks along its length told her tale they 
also indicated a more than oneintwo chance she was infected with 
hiv the aids virus 
vanessa is one of 1600 streetwalkers a new york doctor joyce 
wallace has tested and counseled about aids ms wallaces van and 
a crew of six roam new yorks redlight districts 
she has found that in the nations largest city a third of all 
streetwalkers are infected with aids equally important she found 
most were infected by dirty needles or drugusing boyfriends not 
by their clients 
and in a separate study she found scant evidence streetwalkers 
are passing the virus to clients 
a national study by the us centers for disease control reached 
similar conclusions the incidence of aids infection among 
prostitutes ranged from zero in southern nevada to almost 50 
percent in northern new jersey 
in the open back of ms wallaces van driver john reid gently 
asked vanessa about her sex and drug habits while karen heagarty 
took a blood sample they listened to her story 
its like fighting a war down here said vanessa dressed in 
a tight skirt and white halter blouse before i end up dead i 
want to get out of this 
ms wallace has heard this tale many times over the past eight 
years in 1982 with a boyfriend in tow for protection she began 
combing the 11th avenue stroll in manhattan to test street 
women and question them about their sex and drug practices 
in 1988 ansell inc which manufactures lifestyle condoms 
donated a 15000 van last year with a 140000 grant from the 
cdc and the state department of health ms wallace and her staff 
began cruising areas prostitutes were known to frequent 
the van is ready for war armed with boxes of condoms needles 
and pamphlets on safe sex ms wallaces team does battle three 
times a week 
besides the 10 and a clear plastic bag of condoms streetwalkers 
are given they get an additional 20 if they stop by ms wallaces 
greenwich village office to pick up their test results 
these are throwaway women ms wallace said their contact 
with the establishment is only occasional its a judge a police 
officer who wants to move them off a street corner a school that 
failed them 
data from this year has not yet been tabulated but from the 950 
women tested last year ms wallace drew a startling profile 
homeless 45 percent 
drug users all but 48 
mothers 88 percent the children of 90 percent lived in foster 
care or with relatives 
high school dropouts 50 percent 
black 49 percent hispanic 27 percent 
hiv infected 33 percent 
the high incidence of poverty and drug addiction brings added 
risk of aids infection for both the woman and her client former 
prostitutes said 
many streetwalkers today are amateurs not the professional 
women of previous years said a former prostitute of eight years 
and drug user of 10 who asked to be identified only as joellen 
they run down the price because they are basically keeping a 
drug habit they dont take the time to screen their partners and 
they often dont use condoms said joellen of prostitutes of new 
york a support group 
women are working longer to make the same money joellen said 
the price of a trick is 3 for streetwalkers in some neighborhoods 
prostitutes who work out of brothels or hotels earn more 
streetwalkers used to earn up to 40 for a trick joellen said 
despite the potential risk of aids the clientele hasnt 
changed she said drawing a profile of the average john in new 
york as either an awkward collegeage man or a suburban daddy 
johns are just as resistant to using condoms as they ever 
were joellen said beverly a 27yearold streetwalker said 
some men will pay more for sex without condoms 
the men somehow think they are immune to aids joellen said 
on the whole the johns are not yet being infected with aids 
although the risk is there 
ms wallace has tested the blood of 500 men who say they have 
had contact with prostitutes since 1978 and has found only three 
who apparently were infected by it each of the three had had more 
than 600 encounters with hookers and had never used condoms 
about half the streetwalkers said they used condoms with clients 
at least some of the time most did not use them with husbands or 
boyfriends 
most streetwalkers were infected by their intravenous drugusing 
boyfriends or through their own drug use ms wallace said at 
least 58 percent of the women who injected drugs were infected with 
aids 
ms wallace is raising money for the citys first dropin center 
specifically for prostitutes a place to get medical treatment eat 
a hot meal take showers and be counseled 
back on the street vanessa stepped from the van clutching 
condoms information about drug rehabilitation programs with 
waiting lists a mile long and a number to call for her test 
result 
i want to start over but theres not much chance for me she 
said where do i begin

marie steinwachs admits she of all 
people should have known better 
steinwachs assistant director of the household hazardous waste 
project at southwest missouri state university was washing dishes 
recently when she decided to add a dash of bleach to the water a 
flu had struck her household and she wanted a little extra 
germkilling punch 
but soon after adding the bleach steinwachs felt her throat 
tighten and her eyes water 
i grabbed the bottle of dishwashing liquid and sure enough 
the label said do not mix with chlorine bleach she said 
american homes are filled with products that can cause serious 
injury or death if used or disposed of improperly 
with an estimated 27000 household products containing hazardous 
materials available in stores even experts like steinwachs make 
mistakes that put health and the environment at risk 
informing adults and children about the dangers of everyday 
products from aerosol sprays to wood preservatives and suggesting 
safer alternatives is the mission of the household hazardous waste 
project 
founded in 1987 the statefunded program is gaining attention 
for its education efforts in an era of increased health and 
environmental awareness it recently received one of 21 renew 
america awards from the national environmental awards council a 
coalition of environmental advocacy groups president bush honored 
project founder and director sondra goodman and other winners at 
the white house 
perhaps the waste projects biggest claim to fame is a 178page 
booklet printed on recycled paper of course 
the booklet spells out which products can endanger health and 
pollute the environment recommends safer alternatives and advises 
how to safely use store and dispose of hazardous products 
about 7000 copies of the guide to hazardous products around 
the home have been distributed in the united states canada 
europe and japan goodman said 
goodman an agronomist by training said the waste project grew 
out of a curiosity about the possible dangers posed by cleansers 
and chemicals she used in her home 
i began to research the issue and i was really surprised by 
some of the health aspects of these everyday products she said 
i thought this cant be right 
for example goodman said she had no idea the mothballs she 
placed in her closet were classified as a pesticide and could 
spread poisonous vapors 
nor did she know that tossing a wornout button watch 
battery into the trash could put humans and wildlife at risk such 
batteries can leak or explode injuring trash haulers and the 
lead mercury and other metals they contain can seep into the soil 
in landfills and pollute ground water 
once i became aware of the dangers many household products 
pose i changed my buying and usage habits to make my home more 
safe she said 
she also helped start the waste project with input from a 
variety of community health groups and a grant from an agency of 
the missouri department of natural resources 
goodman and her fivemember staff operate on a 115000 annual 
budget they lend their expertise to cities civic groups and 
businesses around the state project members also help set up or 
direct consumers to recycling outlets for waste oil transmission 
fluid automotive batteries paint and button batteries in 
addition they answer thousands of calls about the use storage and 
disposal of such wastes

here is some advice from the guide to hazardous products 
around the home 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
read the label make sure it is the product you want to buy and 
that youre comfortable with the ingredients 
buy the least hazardous product let the signal words serve as a 
guide with pesticides danger means highly toxic warning 
means moderately toxic and caution means slightly toxic 
with household products poison means highly toxic 
danger means extremely flammable or corrosive or highly toxic 
warning or caution means less toxic buying products 
labeled nontoxic may be a way of identifying a safer product 
however be aware that the word nontoxic is an advertising word 
and has no federal regulatory definition 
avoid aerosol products aerosol disperses the substance in tiny 
droplets that can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and absorbed 
into the bloodstream in addition aerosol cans may become 
explosive when heated 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
read labels carefully before using hazardous products 
use the proper safety equipment when working with hazardous 
chemicals 
leave products in the original containers with the label that 
clearly identifies the contents never put hazardous products in 
food or beverage containers 
do not mix products unless directed to do so by label 
directions this can cause explosive or poisonous chemical 
reactions even different brands of the same product can contain 
incompatible ingredients 
use only whats needed for a job twice as much doesnt mean 
twice the results follow label directions 
if pregnant avoid toxic chemical exposure many toxic products 
have not been tested for their effects on fetuses 
avoid wearing soft contact lenses when working with solvents and 
pesticides they can absorb vapors from the air and hold the 
chemical near your eyes

a new test can detect downs syndrome in fetuses 
in one day rather than the standard three weeks a company says 
the procedure should not replace standard testing yet but in 
the future it may provide faster and cheaper results for expectant 
couples said stephen turner of oncor inc 
the company based in gaithersburg md said its testing system 
can detect abnormal numbers of certain chromosomes in fetal cells 
that are extracted from the womb using standard procedures 
downs syndrome is a form of mental retardation caused by having 
three copies rather than two of chromosome no 21 it occurs in 
about one in every 800 births 
oncor said its testing system can also detect diseasecausing 
abnormal numbers of copies of chromosomes 13 18 x and y but it 
cannot detect other chromosomal abnormalities or defects in 
specific genes turner said 
oncor which develops genetic tests started selling the downs 
syndrome portion of the system in june 
traditional chromosome testing takes about three weeks because 
once cells are extracted from the womb they must be grown in the 
laboratory and treated before their chd chromosome analysis it can indicate 
highrisk samples for 
priority testing and confirm cases that were difficult to diagnose 
turner said 
in the future he said he believes the test will be used by 
itself to allow a oneday answer to people and eliminate the 
anxiety they have now in waiting three weeks it should also cut 
the cost of testing he said 
dr charles epstein chairman of the national down syndrome 
societys science advisory board said the new test could be useful 
if further research shows it to be accurate 
people who seek chromosome testing are under tremendous 
emotional stress and would like to get the answers more quickly 
he said 
aubrey milunsky of the boston university school of medicine said 
he believes the tests accuracy will prove acceptable and that it 
could promote chromosome testing for women younger than 35 
insurance companies generally will not pay for testing in such 
women because they run less risk of chromosomal abnormalities than 
older women do most laboratories charge 600 to 800 for the 
standard analysis milunsky said 
the new test should be far less expensive so more younger women 
could afford it he said insurance companies might eventually 
cover it he said 
if a test result is negative a woman could be assured with a 
high degree of certainty that her fetus is free of the 
abnormalities the test seeks he said a positive result should be 
confirmed by standard analysis he said

hawaiian folklore tells of the movements of the 
volcano goddess pele from one island to another without knowing 
it the tellers of these tales were chronicling the scientific 
process that formed the hawaiian archipelago 
legend has it that pele was being chased from island to island 
by her sister and nemesis na maka o kahai goddess of the sea in 
reality the chase was the formation of the islands part of a 
900mile string of volcanoes that have been active on the pacific 
plate for 70 million years 
these volcanic islands were formed after passing over a hot 
spot in the earths mantle that remains in a fixed location under 
the plate said reggie okamura who has studied volcanoes at the 
us geological surveys hawaiian volcano observatory for 32 years 
this hot spot remelts the portion of the rock passing over it 
creating magma the intense heat forces the magma to rise through 
the crust the new magma builds on the previous eruptions in a 
layered fashion to form massive undersea mountains whose tips 
eventually rise above sea level and become islands he said these 
are known as shield volcanoes because of their gently sloping 
contours 
the process thats happening now pretty much is what happened 
earlier to form the other islands okamura said 
the pacific plate is moving northwesterly at a rate of about 
four inches a year okamura said each island beginning with 
kauai and niihau and followed by oahu molokai lanai and maui and 
hawaii were active volcanoes at one time 
a large portion of hawaii island the youngest in the chain 
currently sits over the hot spot it is the islands location that 
presently accounts for the volcanic activity at kilauea which has 
been in continuous eruption since 1983 about 160 acres of new land 
have been created as a result okamura said 
three of hawaii islands five volcanoes have been active in the 
last 200 years the other two which already have passed over the 
hot spot have been dormant for 3000 and 6000 years respectively 
scientists say a new seamount is forming southeast of hawaii 
island and is about 600 feet below the surface when it breaks sea 
level thousands of years from now loihi will be the newest 
hawaiian island okamura said 
the process that forms hawaiis volcanoes is different from the 
one that forms volcanoes on the continental united states such as 
mount st helens which blew its top off in a spectacular eruption 
in 1980 
the cascade range that includes mount st helens was formed by 
the subduction of the juan de fuca plate with the north american 
continental plate as the juan de fuca plate is pushed deeper into 
the earth the friction melts the rock to form highly pressurized 
magma that can be released with explosive force okamura said 
while lava from hawaiis volcanoes sometimes shoots hundreds of 
feet into the air its unlikely enough pressure could be built up 
to cause such a violent eruption as the one at mount st helens he 
said 
magma called lava only after it reaches the surface moves 
through the islands volcanoes via a series of tubes and vents the 
tubes are formed when the crust over a lava flow cools thickens 
and stops moving the rest of the lava continues to pass under it 
the tubes and vents are created by a system of dykes and sills 
most of these are found in fractured areas of the volcano known as 
rift zones lava also can flow over the volcanos crater or 
caldera okamura said 
there are two kinds of lava pahoehoe and aa identical in 
chemical composition pahoehoe lava is black and smooth and 
swiftmoving aa lava is rougher more fragmented and 
slowermoving most lava erupts as pahoehoe with some changing to 
aa as its temperature and gas content decrease the lava mainly is 
composed of silica iron magnesium calcium potassium sodium and 
other minerals okamura said

people increase their risk of colon and 
rectal cancer when they eat a lot of saturated fat and dont 
exercise according to a study of chinese residents of north 
america and china 
this is a message everyone needs to hear not just the 
chinese said stanford university epidemiologist alice s 
whittemore chief author of the study the findings are to be 
published in the journal of the national cancer institute this 
month 
we began the project because we noticed that the rate of 
colorectal cancer is four to five times higher among 
chineseamericans than among chinese in china said anna 
wuwilliams a coauthor at the university of southern california 
she said the rate of colorectal cancer among chinese men in los 
angeles county and san francisco was close to rate of white men in 
those areas so the researchers set out to find out what changed 
after the move to the united states 
wuwilliams said the study found about a fivefold increase in 
risk of colorectal cancer associated with a sedentary lifestyle and 
a diet with more than 20 grams about twothirds of an ounce of 
saturated fat a day for men in north america 
the risk of colorectal cancer is increased only about 20 percent 
among sedentary people who eat a lowfat diet she added 
the university said the researchers interviewed 905 colorectal 
cancer patients and 2488 healthy people all were chinese about 
half of each group lived in china and half in north america the 
researchers compared patterns of diet and activity 
after lung cancer colorectal cancer is the second leading cause 
of cancer death in the united states with an estimated 110000 new 
cases of colon cancer and 45000 new cases of rectal cancer this 
year according to the american cancer society the group said 
annual us deaths total 60900 from colon cancer and 7600 from 
rectum cancer 
the cancer group said previously identified factors that raise 
the risk of colorectal cancer include inflammatory bowel disease 
and a personal or family history of cancer or polyps in the colon 
or rectum it listed a highfat lowfiber diet as a suspected risk 
factor

it all started with a letter 
he wrote her because hed heard they had something in common 
they talked some on the phone and eventually met 
pretty quickly we decided we were right for each other he 
said 
what melissa mery and peter bennett had in common was the 
inherited incurable lifethreatening disease called cystic 
fibrosis 
what kept them together and led to their recent marriage has 
less to do with disease than with the contagiously positive 
attitude they share 
their marriage is a remarkable thing said nemr s eid 
merys physician and codirector of the cf clinic at kosair 
childrens hospital 
the reason its remarkable is that cf has been considered to 
be fatal and is very scary to people but here we have two 
youngsters with the disease deciding to face life together with 
enthusiasm and courage and stamina 
each understands the others symptoms why they cough a lot and 
easily get short of breath 
and they could skip the part about why they must take pills at 
mealtimes or go through painful and timeconsuming physical therapy 
several times a day or sleep with oxygen tubes in their noses 
at 24 bennett can describe how his disease has affected him 
with a mix of emotional insight and medical knowledge the day 
before his wedding he polished off the thesis for his masters 
degree in mechanical engineering hes waiting for word on a job 
mery 20 is softerspoken she has contributed stories about 
her experiences to local and national publications and shes now 
plotting what will be their masterpiece she says a joint 
autobiography 
bennett and mery already have lived well beyond the age anyone 
thought possible at the time they were diagnosed he at 6 months 
she at 3 years because of advances in both treatment and 
understanding of the disease half of all people with cf now live 
beyond age 21 
when they considered marriage they thought about problems they 
might face with employers medical bills and most of all 
watching the one you love repeatedly battle disease 
each time one of us has been sick weve been looking at how 
we support each other says bennett if melissas in the 
hospital for example is it going to bring me down if im doing 
bad will it bring her down 
what they found is the reverse he says we look at the 
positive things

improve your personal finances by paying higher 
taxes 
outlandish as it may sound thats the idea bandied about by 
many financial analysts these days so far sophisticated investors 
on wall street seem to be buying it 
of course only a short time has passed since president bushs 
reversal late last month of his long and outspoken stand against 
tax increases 
assuming that he and congress now will agree on a plan aimed at 
raising revenues of the federal government it remains to be seen 
what specific form the tax measures might take 
still people in the investment world long noted for 
freemarket preferences and distaste of anything that smacks of 
bigger government have so far behaved as though they are pleased 
to see what has happened 
indeed the news was greeted by a rise in both stock and bond 
prices as interest rates fell 
that reaction goes against a lot of traditional thinking about 
economics and finance 
how well would an economy already struggling with tight credit 
conditions and weak consumer spending bear the added burden of a 
tax increase what havoc might a recession wreak on the investment 
markets at a time when the stock market has only recently hit 
record highs 
most economists concede that those are legitimate and worrisome 
questions for the moment however they say investors seem to be 
betting that such perils will be averted 
the optimistic case rests on two main expectations that a tax 
increase would help break a persistent logjam in washington and 
reduce the federal budget deficit and that interest rates would 
drop as a result probably with a push from the federal reserve 
from that individuals and family money managers might reap such 
prospective benefits as lower mortgage rates and support for the 
slumping real estate market bond prices would rise taking with 
them the net asset values of the publics large holdings of income 
mutual funds 
progress on the deficit furthermore would bring relief on what 
john connolly an analyst at the wall street firm of dean witter 
reynolds inc calls the no 1 economic problem of the united 
states the failure of domestic savings to satisfy our investment 
needs 
dependence on foreign capital to fill the gap has helped drive 
us interest rates to persistently high levels in comparison with 
the inflation rate connolly says 
the governments borrowing to cover its deficit has diverted 
capital that could be contributing to prosperity and growth in the 
private economy 
much of this argument is general and theoretical it provides no 
specifics on how savers and investors can make their paychecks and 
savings stretch further 
some also might protest that lower interest rates could actually 
cause savers more pain than gain in the short run by reducing the 
dollar returns available on investments like moneymarket mutual 
funds and bank certificates of deposit 
but anything that provides longterm influences for lower 
interest rates and higher stock prices would logically stand to 
help the budgets of a great many households 
eventually a more prosperous economy and a government on 
sounder financial footing might put pressure on politicians to 
lower taxes once again 
that at least is the kind of reasoning that has governed the 
response of large investors so far 
if their optimism should falter it stands to reason that they 
will serve notice of their change of heart in the financial 
marketplace the announcement would come in the form of a drop 
in the stock market and a rise in interest rates

when the opening bell rang and traders at the 
minneapolis grain exchange started shouting and gesturing wildly 
eight agriculture officials from the soviet union appeared both 
amused and confused 
the soviet delegation toured the grain exchange tuesday to learn 
more about buying and selling in a free market economy 
its not just me the majority of us do not understand said 
victor shtepo a deputy of the supreme soviet 
under an agreement signed last month by president bush and 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the soviet union will buy at 
least 10 million metric tons of wheat each year over the next five 
years 
we would hope that by that time the soviet union will have a 
very active cash and futures market that may link with the 
minneapolis market and we could trade spring wheat around the 
world said james lindau president of the grain exchange 
lindau said the minneapolis grain exchange represents a 
significant model of what might develop in the soviet union 
during the tour the soviet visitors were able to see firsthand 
the grading of grain to determine its price and to observe the 
furious activity of transactions in the trading pit 
the soviet officials questioned lindau about the workings of the 
market system asking how prices are determined how much money the 
traders make and how information is relayed to other parts of the 
world 
the delegation also watched a slide presentation about the grain 
exchange and the trading process 
because of similar climates in minnesota and parts of the soviet 
union a type of wheat known as hard red spring wheat is a 
productive crop in both places lindau said he said minnesotans 
are in a good position to help soviet farmers increase their 
knowledge and technology 
we know the difficulty in trying to grow crops in the northern 
climate where weather is probably our worst enemy he said 
the soviet visitors said they were happy with the tour 
whether we want to our not weve got to move to a free 
market said boris palagnyuk a supreme soviet deputy were 
very happy that this was included in our programs

the dollar rose against the japanese yen on 
speculative buying today while share prices on the tokyo stock 
exchange fell on profittaking market analysts said 
the dollar closed at 15100 yen up 070 yen from wednesdays 
close of 15030 yen it opened at 15065 yen and ranged between 
15055 yen and 15115 yen 
buying by life insurance companies gave the dollar upward 
momentum throughout the day dealers said it fluctuated as the 
life insurers sold to take profits but remained above wednesdays 
levels because of demand from overseas investors they said 
the life insurers are buying as a purely speculative hedge 
said kaneo ogino of goldman sachs in japan the market was moving 
quickly 
he said the dollar seemed to be testing a ceiling of 15115 yen 
the us currency had been mainly declining since june 25 when 
it closed at 15562 yen 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues fell 9425 points or 029 percent to 3235167 yen the 
index gained 3132 points on wednesday 
an estimated 430 million firstsection shares changed hands in 
thin trading 
stock prices gained momentum late in the morning as indexlinked 
buying nudged the market out of its early doldrums traders said 
buying has been sustained recently by dealers and institutional 
investors anxious to support the market before new issues resume 
friday traders said 
there was strong institutional support for the last few days 
but today the institutions wanted to take profits said 
christopher leighton sales manager at schroders securities 
new share sales were suspended in january when the tokyo market 
began a 3monthlong nosedive in which the nikkei shed onequarter 
of its value 
the resumption of equity issues is seen here as one sign that 
the market is back to normal although some dealers said they 
questioned the amount of support available for more shares 
its difficult enough to interest people in what stocks are 
available now leighton said 
in bond dealings the price of benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds fell to 8686 points as of 4 pm 3 am 
edt from wednesdays close of 8711 points the yield stood at

here is an icy thought that oddly might make a 
hot summer seem even hotter the savings and loan bailout which 
could cost taxpayers 300 billion may be just the tip of the 
iceberg 
if the tip is equal to a sum of that size the single most 
expensive governmental cost in peacetime then how massive must the 
bulk of the berg be 
conceivably in the trillions of dollars says economist ronald 
utt who points out that financial obligations of agencies 
underwritten by the federal government now total 58 trillion 
and much of that obligation is in bad shape says utt vice 
president of the us chamber foundation a former employee of the 
white house office of management and budget and a former heritage 
foundation fellow 
potentially he says these financial obligations represent a 
staggering breakdown of government and a growing number of 
critics are saying the lack of public information on the matter 
represents a communications breakdown 
most people it seems safe to say cannot imagine that other 
financial breakdowns are threatened reasoning that if that were so 
they would have heard of them but that logic breaks as throroughly 
as the communications 
the obligations utt refers to are spread among deposit insurance 
programs loan and pension guarantees direct loan programs such as 
those administered by the small business administration and debts 
of five government enterprises 
utts chilling observations are contained in a paper written for 
heritage a conservative think tank whose opinions sometimes have 
been influential in the bush and reagan administrations 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp says utt is by no 
means the only federal credit program confronted with huge losses 
the federal deposit insurance corp and federal housing 
administration lost money in 1988 and 1989 and seemed destined to 
lose again in 1990 the fha he says has seen the level of claims 
against its shrinking reserves rise nearly three times in three 
years 
further he states half of the farm loans made by the farmers 
home administration are in default and half of these defaulted 
loans have been in that condition for more than three years 
on and on it goes 
the federal government he notes stands behind nearly 500 
billion in guaranteed veterans administration and fha mortgages 
48 billion in guaranteed student loans 
and a host of other guarantees ranging from rural 
electrification to shipbuilding loans and from small business 
disaster loans to loans for building plants to convert grain to 
ethanol 
all together he estimates the contingent liability associated 
with loan and deposit guarantees totaled 35 trillion at the end 
of fiscal 1988 and other insurance programs flood insurance for 
instance add 500 billion more 
how could such massive obligations not rise to the surface and 
break more forcefully into the media how can such dangers lurk so 
near and not cause more concern 
utt doesnt have an answer to those questions but he does 
suggest that both congress and taxpayers played a role 
most lawmakers he says tried to convince americans that the 
crisis was just an isolated incident and that the vast bulk of the 
government credit programs are wellmanaged and pose little risk to 
the taxpayer 
and for their part many taxpayers have wished this to be so 
it isnt says utt who advocates passage of an omnibus credit 
solvency act to fundamentally restructure these many programs in 
order to reduce taxpayer exposure to costly program failures 
before it is too late he adds

corn and soybean futures prices dropped sharply 
in early trading this morning on the chicago board of trade after 
the national weather service issued a rainy weather forecast for 
the midwest 
wheat and oat futures also fell 
the contract for march delivery of corn plunged the permitted 
daily limit of 10 cents a bushel within the first halfhour of 
trading largely in reaction to a sixto10day outlook issued 
wednesday by the weather service 
the forecast was for abovenormal rainfall over most of the 
midwest during the latter half of next week 
some private forecasters continue to predict an extended period 
of hot dry weather in the southern corn belt but the fears of 
widespread crop stress that boosted corn and soybean prices earlier 
this week are fading said walter spilka a grains analyst with 
smith barney harris upham amp co 
the bottom line is probably that those traders who were buying 
in anticipation of a weather event now are selling in anticipation 
of a nonevent he said 
in early trading wheat futures were 3 cents to 3 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in july at 320 a bushel corn was 
3 cents to 9 cents lower with july at 287 a bushel oats were 5 
cents to 5 cents lower with july at 135 a bushel soybeans were 
17 cents to 21 cents lower with july at 630 a bushel 
livestock futures were narrowly mixed in early trading on the 
chicago mercantile exchange pork bellies were down sharply 
live cattle were 03 cent lower to 13 cent higher with august 
at 7290 cents a pound feeder cattle were 30 cent lower to 50 
cent higher with august at 8365 cents a pound live hogs were 35 
cent lower to 08 cent higher with july at 6175 cents a pound

author peter jenkins likes to tell the 
story about how he walked across the country and picked middle 
tennessee for his home 
then came the day he heard general motors corp had decided to 
build its biggest automobile plant a mile from his 150acre farm 
neither he nor many tennesseans are sure the impact from the 
investment which is costing gm at least 3 billion is totally 
welcome in the rolling hills and horse country now facing 
pressures ranging from overcrowded schools to new sources of 
pollution 
i look out my window at night and i see this red glow they 
keep the lights on there jenkins said in an interview 
gms saturn corp plant nearly complete is expected to begin 
sending cars to dealers nationwide any week now but life in tiny 
spring hill has long since changed 
the solitude of spring hill population 1094 was shattered 
first by news media publicizing the bucolic charm of the area one 
of several gm was considering as the home for what it hoped would 
be the car of the future 
then came the speculators who drove up the price of real estate 
after gms july 30 1985 announcement that it had determined 
spring hill was the ideal location 
the companys first new nameplate since 1917 the compact will 
compete primarily with the honda civic and toyota corolla and cost 
10000 to 12000 will be built here by a combination of 
tennesseans and transplants from other gm factories many of whom 
were laid off in earlier costcutting drives 
for many tennesseeans there is irony in gms migration to their 
state decades ago during the depression and warboom years the 
migration mainly went the other way as tennesseeans moved north 
seeking jobs in detroit 
tennessee politicians were elated when gm announced it would 
build a plant and hire 6000 employees to produce a car line called 
saturn that number has since been halved but the financial impact 
on the local economy has nonetheless been farreaching 
for example in maury county where the plant is based 200 
million has been spent for goods services salaries and taxes gm 
provided 125 million for a new spring hill city hall 
at the same time the impact of such a major new employer has 
strained government services especially public education maury 
county school officials are building a new elementary school and 
need about 30 new teachers to deal with 800 additional students 
an 8 percent increase in 1991 enrollment 
the new elementary school we believe should relieve 
overcrowding in the elementary grades maury county school 
superintendent jerry battles said however we expect a 
continuing enrollment pressure at our middle school and high 
school 
in addition the influx of nontennesseeans has created greater 
pressure to accomodate people from diverse cultural and ethnic 
backgrounds which center largely along the differences between 
southerners and northerners 
a lot of the automotive plants up north are in the downtown 
area so those people may be urbanites and accustomed to a faster 
pace of life than the people who live in the smaller towns in 
middle tennessee said dan cornfield a sociology professor at 
vanderbilt university 
there seems to be schisms between northerners whove moved 
down and southerners whove lived here they dont always share the 
same lifestyles so you may get a segregation of people not in 
terms of race 
almost half of the transplanted saturn workers have settled in 
maury county which includes spring hill and columbia the county 
seat the maury county chamber of commerce has estimated 
about a third moved north of spring hill in williamson county 
an affluent bedroom community next to nashville 
for transplants and natives alike the biggest drawback to gms 
arrival has been housing prices which have multiplied and made it 
difficult for many families to find affordable places to live 
the cost of land came back down from the high but its still 
higher than it was on announcement day said bill chaffin an 
official of the maury county chamber of commerce 
we have crowded streets that fall under the heading of i 
guess youd say a problem weve had a lot of interesting new 
people move in which is not a problem weve had our anxieties of 
growth 
that kind of anxiety is the last thing author jenkins expected 
when hed finished walk across america 
i think that for those of us who live in middle tennessee 
not just spring hill when you have a corporation as strong and as 
mighty as general motors we have to make sure we protect the 
lifestyle we love the pace of life and the quality of southern 
lifestyle which i chose over any other lifestyle 
we need to be vigilant and people tend to lose that sense of 
vigilance before its too late he said 
end adv for monday july 9

some offshore oil workers were returning to 
work on the fifth day of a strike over wages and norwegian 
petroleum production was up to half the normal level the national 
news agency ntb reported thursday 
phillips petroleum co of norway said workers called off their 
walkout at the ekofisk fields a key junction for pipeline 
deliveries of natural gas to europe production from some other 
norwegian north sea fields is routed through ekofisk to britain and 
west germany 
in theory production from all seven ekofisk area fields can 
begin on thursday within 12 to 16 hours said sander 
bullgjertsen of phillips ekofisk produced 220000 barrels a day 
of crude in april 
about 4000 workers went on strike sunday when the norwegian 
federation of oil workers and the norwegian confederation of 
business and industry failed to reach agreement on demands for wage 
increases and protection of jobs from automation 
the government invoked compulsory arbitration making the strike 
illegal on monday officials said they acted to protect the 
national economy 
phillips meanwhile dismissed several workers sent layoff 
warnings to 161 people and flew in alternate crews 
about 1000 oil workers initially defied the government order 
and appeals from the norwegian federation of oil workers union to 
return to work but the strike gradually lost support during the 
week 
workers were reported on the job at fields besides ekofisk 
thursday and the national oil industry association said there is 
now a certain hope of the strike ending at additional fields

lending by the world bank the biggest source 
of aid to the third world has declined in the past 12 months for 
the first time since 1985 the bank reported today the decrease 
was due partly to a reduction in loans to china after tanks rolled 
into tiananmen square last year 
figures for the banks year which runs from july 1 to june 30 
were made public by moeen a qureshi a pakistani who is the banks 
senior vice president for operations 
new loans for the year just ended came to 207 billion that 
was 600 million less than the 213 billion of the year before 
loans to china dropped by more than 700 million falling to 590 
million from 13 billion in the year before the suppression of the 
democracy movement 
just after the chinese government moved its military forces 
against demonstrators bank president barber conable withdrew 780 
million worth of loans for china from consideration 
then president bush asked the bank to halt lending to china 
later there was international agreement that new loans should be 
limited to basic human needs 
the past year also brought a large drop in world bank lending to 
india where loans fell to 19 billion from 3 billion the year 
before but bank officials said that was a coincidence and not the 
result of policy 
mexico displaced india as the biggest borrower taking 26 
billion compared with 22 billion in the previous year 
lending by the bank had been rising steadily and is expected to 
increase again in the next 12 months 
the bank is now playing a much bigger role in what used to be 
considered the second world european countries that have been 
under communist rule 
we have initiated lending to poland for a total of some 780 
million this fiscal year and have continued our programs in 
hungary qureshi said at a news conference last week 
we are preparing support programs for bulgaria and 
czechoslovakia both of which are expected to become bank members 
in the coming year and are ready to resume our activities in 
romania 
the late communist dictator nicolae ceausescu paid off almost 
all romanias debts but the country has remained among the banks 
151 member countries 
the soviet union has never belonged treasury secretary nicholas 
f brady spoke recently of creating some tie between the soviets 
the bank and its sister organization the international monetary 
fund 
the soviets will be a member of the new european bank for 
reconstruction and development but for three years it will be able 
to borrow only as much as it contributes in the form of paidin 
capital

to dallas 
in a motion filed with the us bankruptcy court in brownsville 
attorneys for security pacific business credit inc accuse 
dallasbased greyhound of forumshopping in filing for 
protection from creditors in brownsville 
the filing of these proceedings in brownsville exemplifies 
the use of the venue statue as a tactical weapon to unfairly 
disadvantage creditors in this proceeding the filing said 
it notes that most of the expected witnesses either live or work 
in the dallas area or can travel there with ease and that the 
companys records are in dallas as are attorneys for most of the 
parties 
it also says few of the companys debtors are in the brownsville 
area 
greyhound sought chapter 11 protection on june 4 citing costs 
associated with a violent strike by bus drivers greyhounds eagle 
bus manufacturing co inc subsidiary is located in brownsville 
greyhound spokeswoman liz dunn said the company would oppose the 
move 
no hearing on the request has been set

joel vazquez never thought independence in 
namibia would make any difference to his life as an oceanroving 
commercial spanish fisherman he soon found himself beached like a 
trawler at low tide 
when the new southern african nation was established in april 
it ordered the spanish fleet one of the western worlds largest 
to vacate the rich waters off the namibian coast the move idled 
vazquezs ur elza and 34 other trawlers along with 1500 crew 
members 
a fisherman with a true calling for the sea doesnt know what 
to do when he faces life on land said vazquez 36 the fishing 
crisis could spell an end to his 13 years at sea 
the ships forced from namibia are part of the 175vessel 
deepsea fleet that forms the heart of the spanish fishing 
industry it directly employs 5000 people and indirectly employs 
an additional 45000 canners marketers shipbuilders and suppliers 
ninety percent of the fleet is based in the jagged estuary of 
vigo of northeast spain the most important fishing port of the 
12nation european community 
industry officials say much more of the fleet will be forced to 
drop anchor indefinitely because other countries besides namibia 
have moved to evict foreign fleets from heavily fished breeding 
grounds 
argentina began shutting out spanish trawlers last year and the 
united states and canada banned them from territorial waters in the 
early 1980s morocco has restricted foreign fishing off the saharan 
banks and britain is limiting access to waters off the falkland 
islands in the south atlantic 
spains commercial fishermen partly blame prime minister felipe 
gonzalez for failing to challenge the increased protectionism the 
government says thats part of the price for spains membership in 
the ec which has given it less control over guarding the overseas 
interests of many spanish businesses 
the result has been a growing economic depression for 
vigobased ship owners and all related sectors said gloria sio 
editor of the industry magazine industrias pesqueras 
sio said the presence of the idled ships in vigo harbor 
underscores what she called the administrations failure to control 
public financing for new ships while fishing grounds kept 
diminishing 
right now there are at least 40 ships too many for the places 
available to fish sio said 
statistics compiled by the ministry of agricultures fishing 
division show how the industry has become less productive and the 
country more reliant on imports 
in 1987 for example the deepsea fleets catch totaled nearly 
635000 tons vs about 553000 tons last year frozenfish imports 
have nearly tripled since 1984 to roughly 28000 tons while 
exports have declined by more than 28 percent to roughly 25000 
tons 
for now the ministry has approved a plan to pay idled fisherman 
their average monthly wage of about 600 with a stipend to cover 
social security payments 
the namibian government says part of the reason for the eviction 
order to the spanish ships was to assess the productivity of 
domestic breeding grounds that produce hake an important food fish 
but the namibians have said a study will take at least four 
months and they wont open negotiations on a new accord with the 
spanish until afterward 
our future is totally uncertain said jose fuertes managing 
director of spains hake fishing ship owners assocation 
the administration has had plenty of time to see namibian 
independence coming and to reach a bilateral accord to permit 
spanish fishing but it was just incompetent he said 
unions and shipowners are outraged that spain and the ec are not 
fiercely defending the spanish fleets right to fish overseas 
on may 31 5000 people marched through vigo as the citizens 
movement to save the fleet with backing by politicians 
fishermens unions shipowners associations and chambers of 
commerce gonzalezs socialist party and the socialist general 
workers union were absent 
serafin sa spokesman for the communist fishermans union 
claimed ec fishing commissioner manuel marin a spanish socialist 
has been inept in defending the interests of spanish fishermen 
against those of lowcost fishing nations such as the soviet union 
romania and poland and in foreign fishing banks especially those 
off canada 
the great irony is that while spanish ships are being forced 
out of foreign hake and cod banks from canada to argentina these 
countries are using basically protectionist measures in turn to 
dominate our own ec markets he said

the nations big three automakers said thursday 
that latejune sales of north americanmade vehicles rose 71 
percent compared with last year stoked by strong truck sales 
for the first six months of the year big three car and truck 
sales were 63 percent behind last year the sixmonth period 
provides a better picture of the companies sales than the 10day 
periods 
this years sales rate for domestic vehicles overall has been 
meandering below last years rate recent economic reports have 
shown slow growth in the economy coupled with slightly weakened 
consumer confidence 
those factors along with automakers offering reduced incentive 
packages compared with last years have combined to depress car 
and truck sales overall 
but strong sales of trucks by general motors corp and ford 
motor co bucked that trend in late june chrysler corps truck 
sales lagged behind last years pace 
the big three said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate 
of 39716 during the june 2130 period this year compared with a 
rate of 37084 during the same time last year 
car sales were up 37 percent and truck sales rose a hefty 128 
percent in late june 
for the first half of the year big three car sales were off 98 
percent and truck sales were down 16 percent compared with the 
first six months of last year together cars and trucks made by 
the three companies were selling at an average daily rate of 33025 
through june of this year compared with the 35260 daily vehicle 
sales average last year 
gm was the only one of the big three to report gains in 
latejune sales of cars and trucks the nations largest automaker 
said its car sales during the period rose 129 percent and truck 
sales increased 299 percent for a combined 178 percent increase 
for the first half of 1990 gms cars and trucks were selling at a 
rate 35 percent lower than last year 
ford reported its combined car and truck sales for late june 
were up 27 percent from last years rate a 47 percent decline in 
car sales was offset by a 141 percent increase in truck sales 
mainly because of the new explorer sportutility vehicle during 
the first six months of this year fords car and truck sales were 
down 78 percent 
chrysler which has been struggling all year with sagging sales 
reported an 11 percent decline in its vehicle sales in late june 
with car sales falling 108 percent and truck sales dropping 113 
percent so far this year chryslers car and truck sales rate is 
13 percent lower than last year

it looks like something that should be 
piloted by little green men from mars but sikorsky aircrafts 
newest flying machine doesnt need anyone in the cockpit 
extraterrestrial or otherwise 
after four years of secret research the helicopter pioneer has 
unveiled the cypher its entry in the race to develop a pilotless 
aircraft 
the cypher looks like two large ceiling fans bolted together to 
form the spokes of a fiberglass doughnut its 5 feet in diameter 
and weighs about 300 pounds light enough to be carried by two 
people 
a mockup sits inside a storage building at sikorskys 
headquarters in stratford conn awaiting wind tunnel tests 
sikorsky a division of united technologies corp wont start 
production until it receives orders for the cypher 
but company executives predict the aircraft known in the 
industry as an unmanned aerial vehicle or uav will be a big hit 
with military and civilian customers for reconnaissance missions 
searchandrescues flyovers of forest fires and surveillance of 
illicit drug operations 
you can just use your imagination and think about mount st 
helens or chernobyl anywhere you want to get in without risking 
life said william tuttle a sikorsky spokesman 
the american military has used remotecontrol airplanes for 
years mostly as decoys to draw enemy fire away from planes with 
pilots aboard but pentagon strategists have decided they need a 
more versatile helicopterlike aircraft that can take off and land 
vertically and maneuver in inaccessible areas 
if custer had one of these uavs he might have won at little 
big horn said ray coleman of the pentagons joint office for 
unmanned aerial vehicles 
the office was established in 1988 to look at the most promising 
vehicles it invested a modest 160000 in research on the cypher 
last year although congress has prohibited the office from 
spending money on actual production 
work on the cypher began in 1986 when sikorsky was awarded an 
eightmonth study contract by the pentagons defense advanced 
research projects agency the company refused to discuss the actual 
cost of cypher because of the intense competition for government 
contracts 
the cypher uses technology developed by sikorsky nearly two 
decades ago for its xh59a helicopter which used a coaxial rotor 
or double rotary blade to operate 
the double blades rotate in opposite directions giving the 
craft greater stability especially on takeoffs and landings the 
blades rotate within a fiberglass tube where the cyphers fuel and 
payload are stored 
the cypher is controlled by a computer programmed before 
takeoff but its flight pattern can be altered after takeoff if 
necessary said james cycon sikorskys chief engineer for the 
cypher project 
sikorsky engineers say theyre particularly proud of containing 
the blades within a tube because the innovation makes the cypher 
safer for people on the ground during takeoffs or landings the 
blades of competitors under development are exposed like a 
helicopters 
cycon said the cypher is designed to hover 800010000 feet in 
the air for about four hours it can carry a 150pound payload 
such as a surveillance camera 
the cypher can be launched vertically from a small area like 
the deck of a patrol boat sikorsky also is studying the 
possibility of launching cypher from black hawk helicopters which 
it makes for the army 
sikorsky first flew a radiocontrolled 5footdiameter version 
of the cypher in the summer of 1988 in west palm beach fla to 
prove it could actually fly using the coaxial rotor technology 
cycon said 
that vehicle has since been retired and is on display at 
sikorsky headquarters 
during the design work for cypher cycon kept a sign on his wall 
that said time to make the doughnuts and says his children 
are still kidded about having a father who makes flying saucers 
cyphers success would allow sikorsky to expand into new markets 
in the face of defense cuts the company has already been forced to 
lay off about 300 of its 12000 workers because of lower military 
demand 
but sikorsky faces stiff competition in the field of pilotless 
flight a number of domestic and foreign companies are vying for 
defense contracts and are further along in developing their 
products coleman said 
the pentagon already has a contract with canadair to conduct a 
sixmonth test of that firms cl227 or peanut he said the 
british company ml aviation has developed a pilotless vehicle 
called the sprite which resembles a flying barbecue grill 
the unmanned air vehicle market is expected to grow 
dramatically in the next 10 years said mark bobbi of forecast 
international an independent market research firm specializing in 
aerospace and defense but i dont think the cypher will help 
sikorsky much in the next five years 
sikorsky recently submitted information about the cypher to the 
army in hopes the army will decide to order some vehicles so 
production can begin 
larry dickerson another forecast international analyst who is 
watching the uav industry said sikorskys success will depend on 
how it markets the cypher 
its very new and looks different but the military is pretty 
conservativeminded about new and different things he said

grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply 
thursday on the chicago board of trade led by steep losses in the 
corn market after the national weather service predicted wetter 
weather for the midwest 
several contracts for delivery of newcrop corn plunged the 
permitted daily limit of 10 cents a bushel largely in reaction to 
a sixto10day outlook issued wednesday by the weather service 
the forecast was for normal temperatures and abovenormal 
rainfall over most of the corn belt during the latter half of next 
week 
some private forecasters continue to predict an extended period 
of hot dry weather in the southern corn belt 
but analysts said the national weather service forecasts 
typically take precedence over private forecasts in influencing the 
market 
when the national weather service comes out with that kind of 
news it kind of sets the tone for everybody said michael 
gazall a research analyst with refco corp 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents to 5 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in july at 318 a bushel corn was 4 
cents to 10 cents lower with july at 285 a bushel oats were 4 
cents to 5 cents lower with july at 135 a bushel soybeans were 
7 cents to 23 cents lower with july at 629 a bushel

helpwanted advertising registered a lackluster 
performance in may indicating a cautious attitude among many 
employers around the nation the conference board reported friday 
the seasonally adjusted helpwanted advertising index compiled 
from a survey of ad volume in 51 newspapers across the country 
registered 137 in may down 2 points from april and 15 points below 
the yearago level the board said 
the word cautious best describes the labor market right 
now said conference board economist ken goldstein there is a 
definite softness in demand consumers government and some 
elements of business investment appear quite sluggish 
most regions of the country particularly new england and the 
middle atlantic states registered declines in helpwanted ads 
and goldstein noted that the drops show no sign of ending soon 
but many southern states as well as parts of texas and oklahoma 
registered gains 
goldstein said exportdriven economic growth is expected to 
boost labor markets in the west later this year and then sweep 
eastward 
ad volume has proven to be sensitive to labor market conditions 
and helps gauge changes in the local regional and national supply 
of jobs

strong sales of north americanmade light trucks 
and japanese cars assembled in the united states pushed the 
latejune vehicle sales rate 119 percent higher than last year 
automakers said thursday 
however sales for the entire month with imported cars and 
trucks included were 19 percent behind last years pace car and 
truck sales for the first six months of this year were 43 percent 
lower than last year 
the 10 major us car and truck makers reported they sold 
vehicles at an average daily rate of 46293 during the june 2130 
period this year compared with a rate of 41372 during the same 
period last year 
car sales by general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler 
corp rose 37 percent while sales of usmade japanese cars 
increased 623 percent the big three commanded 807 percent of the 
market during the period 
truck sales by gm ford and chrysler rose 127 percent over last 
year 
economist tom webb of the national automobile dealers 
association in mclean va said the latejune numbers dont 
necessarily reflect a change in the sluggish trend of the us auto 
market this year 
he said the assessment could change if the next two or three 
sales periods unexpectedly maintain the pace set in late june 
webb said he was surprised at the vigor in the latejune truck 
sales figures for gm and ford 
the strength you see in the truck model is the apv minivans 
for general motors and the explorer sportutility vehicle for 
ford he said gms light truck sales during the period rose 299 
percent and fords increased 141 percent chryslers fell 108 
percent 
june ended strong for gm with car and truck sales up said 
jb fitzpatrick gms marketing and product planning staff vice 
president our lower inventory position should provide for a 
smooth transition into the 1991 model year 
gm was the only one of the big three to post a gain in latejune 
sales of its domestically made cars increasing 129 percent over 
last year based on doubledigit increases in sales from its two 
largest divisions chevrolet and pontiac 
fords car sales dropped 47 percent during the period and 
chrysler which has been struggling with sluggish car sales for 
months reported an 113 percent decline in latejune sales 
among the japanese transplants only nissan motor co ltds 
usmade cars showed a decrease in late june falling 199 percent 
the auto industry has been plagued recently by a sluggish us 
economy and reports of sagging consumer confidence automakers use 
incentives to spark sales and reduce inventories of unsold new 
vehicles but lately theyve been shying away from wholesale use of 
the enticements 
incentives whether cash rebates or lowinterest loan offers 
carve into companies profits and can create price confusion in the 
market consequently the programs offered now cover fewer vehicles 
than programs last year and generally offer consumers lower rebates 
and less attractive financing deals 
also inventories are estimated to be in the 60sellingday 
range considered a good level for this time of year each of the 
big three recently announced modest price increases

the largest telemarketing fraud ever 
uncovered by visa and mastercard recruited small businesses to 
launder credit card charges the companies contend in a 
multimilliondollar lawsuit unsealed thursday 
federal criminal investigations also are under way in the case 
described as a chain of operations conducting business nationwide 
from bases in florida texas arizona california and other states 
the suit says the scam began with postcards telling consumers 
they had won free cars watches or 5000 prizes when they phoned 
they reached boiler rooms and were pressured to buy water 
purifiers security systems travel packages and vitamins it says 
the defendants claimed that winners identities were verified 
through their credit card numbers the defendants also implied that 
visa and mastercard sponsored the giveaways the suit says 
the suit also alleges the telemarketers misrepresented goods 
failed to deliver them and sent multiple bills for the same product 
defendants scheme undermines a cornerstone of the charge card 
system that member financial institutions be able to evaluate the 
honesty integrity and credit worthiness of those from whom they 
accept charge card deposits visa and mastercard said in the suit 
in los angeles federal court 
the suit seeks unspecified millions of dollars in actual damages 
and 10 million in punitive damages alleging racketeering fraud 
trademark infringement and interfering with contractual 
relationships 
its the largest single telemarketing operation that visa and 
mastercard ever came across said visa spokesman david brancoli 
he estimated such schemes cost the companies up to 200 million 
per year federal trade commission officials believe consumers have 
lost 1 billion a year to telemarketing fraud for the past five 
years 
a central aim of the suit is to stop boiler room operators from 
using third parties to process sales drafts banks usually wont 
set up visa and mastercard accounts for telephone sales operations 
because too many customers refuse to pay leaving the banks holding 
the bag the suit says 
the suit alleges that some defendants were brokers who 
advertised in newspapers like the los angeles times for businesses 
to launder sales drafts for a fee typically 6 percent of sales 
counting broker fees telemarketers may pay 20 percent or more 
of the gross sales to have their drafts deposited said daniel h 
bookin a san francisco attorney for visa and mastercard 
that compares to 2 percent to 3 percent at legitimate businesses 
with merchant accounts at banks 
if these guys couldnt launder theyd be out of business 
bookin said 
visa and mastercard persuaded us district judge edward 
rafeedie last week to issue a temporary restraining order barring 
the telemarketers from using third parties to process credit card 
drafts a hearing on a permanent injunction is set for july 16 
the postal service and the secret service are conducting 
criminal probes according to the suit and one of the defendants 
lorraine g doty 
this thing is much bigger than what is laid out in this 
lawsuit ms doty said in a telephone interview from florida 
ms doty said she and another defendant lillian whitman had 
shut down their boiler room operation in clearwater fla after 
learning that using third parties to process sales drafts violated 
credit card agreements with banks she declined further comment 
saying she hadnt talked to a lawyer 
a central defendant is donald gaines of clearwater who the 
complaint accuses of running boiler rooms and through a phoenix 
business acting as a broker for small businesses willing to 
launder charges 
reached at another business in overland kan gaines declined 
comment saying he had not seen the lawsuit 
altogether the suit names 10 individuals and 11 companies as 
defendants 
we have documented 4 million in losses but were sure the 
total is far larger bookin said 
processing of thirdparty sales drafts is outlawed in only three 
states california florida and wisconsin there is no federal law 
against it although abuses can be prosecuted under other federal 
statutes such as mail fraud and wire fraud 
mastercard and visa have joint programs to warn businesses that 
laundering is banned by their agreements with banks and to detect 
the practice they also are jointly lobbying to have such 
laundering made a federal crime

rite aid corp charged along with its 
president with trying to bribe a state pharmacy board member was 
singled out and badgered by ohio regulators the companys attorney 
charged before a jury thursday 
attorney george moscarino contended the ohio state board of 
pharmacy had a vendetta against rite aid and launched a flawed 
investigation into the bribery claim he said the panel had become 
angry over rite aids questioning of certain drugstore rules 
there was a pharmacy board blitz of only the rite aid 
stores moscarino said in opening statements in cuyahoga county 
common pleas court the evidence will show they were peeved at 
rite aid 
an indictment unsealed in august charged rite aid and president 
martin l grass 36 with trying to bribe melvin wilczynski a 
voting member of the pharmacy board the indictment included a 
charge against grass of possession of a criminal tool an aircraft 
he used to fly to cleveland for the alleged deal 
prosecutors say grass on april 27 1989 gave wilczynski a check 
for 33000 with the stipulation that he step down from the board 
prosecutors say the company was trying to pack the board whose 
members are appointed by the governor with members to its liking 
rite aid based in shiremanstown pa and one of the nations 
biggest drugstore chains has denied the charges saying the 
corporate check was a legal buyout of wilczynskis consulting 
contract with a troubled chain that rite aid acquired 
assistant cuyahoga county prosecutor william caine said thursday 
that wilczynski a licensed pharmacist and still a member of the 
board was surprised to learn that rite aid planned to buy out his 
contract with lane drug co a peoples drug store inc division 
rite aid acquired last year 
caine said wilczynski was summoned to rite aid offices in toledo 
and told by grass that the company wanted him to resign from the 
pharmacy board when wilczynski told grass he wanted to remain 
caine said grass response was youre out in left field 
i think its very telling in this whole transaction that as 
mr grass sat there in this small room he couldnt look mel 
wilczynski in the eye caine said 
prosecutors said they will show a videotape made secretly with 
wilczynskis cooperation showing grass handing wilczynski a check 
and copies of resignation letters for him to sign 
the videotape was made at a hotel near clevelands airport 
prosecutors said 
the government said it seized the undated variouslyworded 
resignation letters to gov richard celeste among other documents 
during grass arrest in the hotel room

corn and soybean futures prices wilted thursday on the chicago 
board of trade after the national weather service issued a rainy 
forecast for the midwest 
wheat and oat futures also fell but not as steeply as corn and 
beans which are grown mainly in the midwest and would benefit from 
additional moisture 
on other commodity markets most oil futures fell copper 
futures advanced precious metals were lower and livestock and 
meat futures were mixed 
corn futures settled 4 cents to 10 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 286 a bushel soybeans were 7 
cents to 23 cents lower with july at 628 a bushel wheat was 1 
cents to 5 cents lower with july at 318 a bushel oats were 4 
cents to 5 cents lower with july at 135 a bushel 
most contracts for delivery of newcrop corn plunged the 
permitted daily limit of 10 cents a bushel largely in reaction to 
a sixto10day outlook issued wednesday by the weather service 
the forecast was for normal temperatures and abovenormal 
rainfall over most of the corn belt during the the latter half of 
next week 
the losses wiped out gains that had mounted over the past week 
in reaction to predictions mostly by private meteorologists that 
a pattern of unusually warm dry air was setting up in the corn 
belt 
some private forecasters continued to predict an extended period 
of hot dry weather in the mississippi delta region where some 
soybeans are grown 
theres enough conflict out there to satisfy the bulls and the 
bears said michael gazall a research analyst with the 
commodities brokerage refco inc 
but when the national weather service comes out with this kind 
of news it kind of sets the tone for everybody he said 
walter spilka grain analyst with smith barney harris upham amp 
co said the forecast provided an opportunity for profittaking 
the bottom line is probably that those traders who were buying 
in anticipation of a weather event now are selling in anticipation 
of a nonevent he said 
oil futures finished mostly lower on the new york mercantile 
exchange in the first trading day since tuesdays bearish petroleum 
stocks report from the american petroleum institute the markets 
were closed wednesday for independence day 
the api report showed an unexpected 429000barrel increase last 
week in us crude oil stocks traders had expected crude stocks to 
fall by about 1 million barrels

cents higher with august at 1650 a barrel heating oil was 08 
cent to 23 cent lower with august at 4833 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 114 cents lower to 10 cent higher with 
august at 5495 cents a gallon 
copper futures rose strongly on new yorks commodity exchange as 
troubles mounted at copper mines in various locations 
prices spurted higher early in the session following news of an 
explosion at a chilean copper co mine in chile that was expected 
to decrease production by 20000 metric tons this year 
meanwhile a strike at asarco incs ray copper mine in arizona 
stretched into its fifth day thursday and unionized miners in peru 
opened a threeday national assembly to discuss a possible strike 
against peruvian mining companies 
copper futures settled 19 cents to 295 cents higher with july 
at 1171 a pound

giving back some of the moderate gains posted over the past five 
sessions

36330 a troy ounce silver futures were 5 cents to 61 cents 
lower with july at 4869 a troy ounce

world bank president barber conable on 
thursday urged the united states and other creditor nations to 
reduce debts owed them by poland and other middle income 
countries 
the bank the worlds biggest source of aid to developing 
nations considers the middle income countries as ranging from 
bolivia where the average citizen earns about 570 a year to a 
country like greece where the average annual income is 4800 
polands per capita income is about 2750 a year 
polands debt situation must be dealt with in some way 
conable said noting that poland is nearly 45 billion in debt 
clearly the debt service would make it very difficult for 
poland to resume growth and to make the necessary investments for 
getting a functioning economy with moving parts he said 
debt service refers to payments of interest and principal 
most polish debt is owed to governments with west germany and 
france the biggest creditors about 3 billion is owed to the us 
governments exportimport bank and commodity credit corp 
the world bank has lent poland 780 million in the past 12 
months conable said that was done on the assumption that some 
international settlement would be made on the remainder of polands 
official debt 
he said the debt burden makes it difficult for such countries to 
lure the investment they need to raise standards of living their 
own earnings go to keep up with the debt and foreign investors are 
wary as long as the burden exists 
he noted that president bush last week suggested that help with 
official debt be given in latin america 
clearly there are middle income countries elsewhere and other 
creditors besides the united states which must addresses this 
issue he said 
we hope it will be discussed at houston and it will be 
constructive if something could be worked out 
bush and leaders of six other major industrial countries hold 
their annual economic summit in houston beginning monday 
conable mentioned eastern european countries north africa 
nigeria and the ivory coast as candidates for help he pointed out 
that there already has been considerable reduction of official debt 
for the poorest countries especially in africa and that a plan 
pressed by treasury secretary nicholas f brady deals with debts to 
commercial banks 
the world bank estimates that of 1039 trillion worth of 
longterm debt owed by third world countries 517 billion comes 
from official sources that includes tens of billions owed to the 
world bank itself which conable did not discuss 
he suggested that government creditors might offer help of the 
same kind they have given the poorest countries these toronto 
terms named after the city where creditor governments agreed on 
them include reduction in total debt reduction of interest 
payments and a long stretchouts of repayments

federal regulators on thursday ordered 
president bushs son neil to appear at a public hearing to 
explain why as a savings and loan officer he approved loans to a 
business partner 
administrative charges of conflict of interest against the 
presidents son will be taken up at the september hearing 
regulators said 
the loans to business partner bill l walters and purchases of 
property from him totaled more than 100 million according to the 
treasury departments office of thrift supervision 
at the time of the transactions the younger bush was a director 
of silverado banking savings and loan association in denver 
bush in a reply denied that he had violated his duty as a 
director he denied a number of specific charges and said in 
response to others that he lacks sufficient present knowledge or 
information to form a belief as to the allegations 
the administrative charges filed in february and bushs reply a 
month later both were made public for the first time thursday under 
a new thrift office policy the house banking committee released a 
preliminary draft of the charges in june 
an administrative law judge is scheduled to hear the bush case 
sept 25 in denver before making a recommendation to thrift office 
director timothy ryan 
james nesland an attorney for the younger bush said a public 
hearing could be exploited for political purposes but expressed 
confidence that the judge would render a fair opinion 
i think its unfortunate if it creates a political sideshow or 
a media sideshow but im still confident the administrative law 
judge will decide the case on its merits he said 
separately the thrift office announced it was seeking a record 
24 million in restitution and civil penalties from the former 
chairman of columbia savings and loan association of beverly hills 
calif 
the office alleged that thomas spiegel spent millions of the 
thrifts eposits on limousines corporate jets luxury condominiums 
in resort areas trips to europe for himself 7000 in tickets to 
a michael jackson concert and a 55000 gun collection including 
uzi submachine guns 
spiegel a close associate of former drexel burnham junk bond 
chief michael milken built columbia into one of the nations 
largest thrifts and the industrys biggest holder of junk bonds 
with 37 billion at the end of 1989 
columbia is still operating but analysts predict it eventually 
will be seized by the government spiegel stepped down in december 
edward harshfield columbias current chief executive said in a 
statement that the institutions current management cooperated with 
the thrift office and said the allegations do not reflect on 
current management or the institution as a whole 
spiegel meanwhile denied the charges and accused the agency of 
waging a politicallymotivated trial by press release 
bush served on the board of silverado from august 1985 to august 
1988 it collapsed in december 1988 at an estimated cost to 
taxpayers of 1 billion he has denied any wrongdoing 
the charges said bush as a director of silverado voted to 
approve loans totaling 45 million to walters an investor in and 
lender to bushs oil exploration company jnb exploration co he 
also voted to approve silverados purchase of 584 million in 
properties from walters the document said 
the thrift office also said bush inadequately disclosed his ties 
to kenneth good a developer who defaulted on loans to silverado 
ryan will decide after reviewing the administrative hearing on 
the case whether or not to issue a ceaseanddesist order against 
bush prohibiting him from violating regulations in the future 
the agency is not seeking any more serious penalties such as 
financial restitution or banning bush from working for a bank or 
sampl 
from now on the agency generally will release charges and 
conduct hearings in public for the officers of thrifts already 
closed or seized by the government in order to avoid the danger of 
depositor runs proceedings against open sampls generally will 
continue to be conducted in private ryan told a news conference 
the public has a major stake in the cleanup of the thrift 
industry and as a general rule i believe it is reasonable to make 
enforcement proceedings open when dealing with government 
controlled thrifts ryan said 
he said he offered treasury department officials a chance to 
offer advice on the policy but they declined 
the documents on three other unrelated cases also were released

national intergroup inc said thursday it 
would appeal a delaware judges ruling that shareholders must be 
allowed to vote on changes in the companys antitakeover 
provisions 
national intergroup amended its poison pill strategy in january 
diluting the voting power and market value of its shares for 
investors who own more than 10 percent of the company the 
threshold had stood at 20 percent 
vice chancellor maurice hartnett of delawares chancery court on 
tuesday said national intergroup acted improperly and called the 10 
percent limit extremely low 
hartnett said national intergroups board must present the 
changes to the stockholders at its july 25 meeting in pittsburgh 
the ruling is a boost to centaur partners a new york 
partnership that owns 1653 percent of national intergroup and 
walker street another partnership that owns 84 percent of the 
company 
centaur partners which earlier this year tried unsuccessfully 
to gain control of national intergroups board and walker street 
had brought the court action against the company 
national intergroup issued a statement saying they would appeal 
the decision the company said lowering the threshold was a 
necessary and appropriate response to the threat to shareholders 
posed by centaurs acquisition program 
national intergroup formerly the majority owner of national 
steel corp has announced the sale of most of its metals and other 
businesses leaving behind its drug distribution company last 
month national intergroup announced it would change its name to 
foxmeyer corp the name of its drug company and move to dallas
