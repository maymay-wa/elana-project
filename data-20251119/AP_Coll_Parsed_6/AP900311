striking teachers voted saturday on a 
proposal to return to their classrooms so that negotiators can try 
again to settle a pay dispute that led to their 3dayold walkout 
voting teachers appeared to favor the proposal said kayetta 
meadows president of the larger of two unions representing the 
striking teachers 
but late saturday meadows accused gov gaston caperton of 
reneging on an alleged promise to call a special legislative 
session to address teacher pay and she said we have no choice 
but to continue a statewide strike 
caperton said friday he would recommend that county school 
boards refrain from docking teachers pay and benefits for the days 
they missed so far if they return to work monday 
teachers from the 16000member west virginia education 
association and the 3000member west virginia federation of 
teachers began voting on the proposal saturday and voting was 
scheduled to continue in some counties sunday 
union officials refused to release results saturday 
the federation leadership recommended that members vote for the 
plan calling it a fair and honorable way to end this strike 
but the federation said teachers in some counties voted not to 
accept it 
meadows said association members overwhelmingly voted to return 
to work on condition there was no loss of pay or benefits 
negotiations would resume immediately and the special legislative 
session was called 
but caperton said later in the day there would be no special 
session and meadows declared we are at an impasse 
caperton spokesman gc morse called meadows announcement 
very regrettable 
we did not commit ourselves or close the door to a special 
session he said this is ludicrous 
the strike began wednesday after a 5 percent pay raise proposal 
by the governor and legislative leaders collapsed 
the wvea says the average west virginia teacher salary of 
21904 ranks the state 49th in the nation ahead of mississippi

rules including the election of delegates to a party congress by 
the rank and file previously party leaders approved the 
delegates who in turn confirmed the leaders in a system that 
preserved the status quo

return to its session to nominate its candidate for president after 
the congress passes the appropriate constitutional amendments

palestinian and a resident of east jerusalem to be represented in 
the initial cairo talks

palestinains who worked or had second homes in jerusalem to be 
included in the palestinian negotiating team along with 
palestinians who had been deported for antiisraeli activities 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc objected saying this would give 
symbolic concessions to palestinian demands that israel relinquish

lithuania on sunday became the first 
soviet republic to elect a noncommunistpresident the move was the 
latest in the baltic republics drive to secede from the soviet 
union 
lithuanian lawmakers chose vytautas landsbergis by a wide margin 
over algirdas brazauskas in the election for the presidency 
officially known as the chairmanship of the presidium of the 
lithuanian supreme soviet 
landsbergis a professor of music is the leader of the sajudis 
grassroots movement that has spearheaded lithuanias independence 
drive 
brazauskas had already begun talks on secession with the 
kremlin but sajudis felt it would not be fitting to have a 
communist president since the communists lost their majority in the 
legislature 
brazauskas also advocated a more gradual approach to secession 
whereas landsbergis wants independence proclaimed immediately 
landsbergis victory came after deputies grilled him on how he 
would oversee lithuanias transition to independence 
the vote on secession was expected later sunday and deputies 
said there was little doubt the motion to resurrect lithuanias 
1918 declaration of statehood would pass 
deputies applauded as results were announced showing landsbergis 
had won the lithuanian presidency he received 91 votes with 42 
against brazauskas got 38 votes with 95 against 
earlier this month sajudisbacked candidates won a twothirds 
majority in the first contested elections to lithuanias 141seat 
supreme soviet leaving the communists in the minority 
a vote later sunday to restore lithuanias indepedence would 
present soviet president mikhail s gorbachev with his greatest 
crisis in five years in power lithuania like the other 
independenceminded baltic states of latvia and estonia was 
forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 while under red army 
occupation the parliament will be asked to reaffirm an act first 
passed on feb 16 1918 declaring the state independent 
lawmakers already have declared illegal lithuanias 
incorporation into the soviet union in 1940 under a secret 
nazisoviet pact 
lawmakers also will be asked to restore the 1938 constitution 
that was swept away by josef stalins kremlin in favor of a 
sovietstyle law 
gorbachev and other soviet officials have indicated the kremlin 
may grudgingly accept lithuanian secession at a steep price 
specifically gorbachev suggested a bill of 34 billion in hard 
currency in compensation for factories and other infrastructure 
built during a halfcentury of soviet rule lithuanians replied 
that their bill to the soviet union for decades of repression would 
be higher

a panel of washington insiders armed with 
topsecret security clearances is conducting a major unannounced 
review of the nations espionage laws in a search for better ways 
to catch and convict spies 
recruited from the private sector by the leaders of the senate 
intelligence committee the panel members have visited the cia 
fbi pentagon and national security agency among others over the 
last nine months 
cia director william webster fbi director william sessions and 
attorney general dick thornburgh all have met with members of the 
group according to executive branch sources 
fbi and cia spokesmen confirm their agencies have offered 
information and suggestions but wont describe them a justice 
source says the department has yet to offer either formal or 
informal advice 
the panel which includes former white house cia state and 
justice officials and a politically connected baseball team owner 
is working for sens david boren dokla and william cohen 
rmaine chairman and vice chairman respectively of the 
intelligence committee 
many of the panel members already had security clearances from 
service in past administrations but sources who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity said others received new or updated 
clearances especially for this project 
we had to get some fingerprints an intelligence community 
source said 
cohen said in an interview last week that he and boren were 
motivated by the decade of the spy and a long series of 
counterintelligence failures like whitworth the walkers ed 
howard clyde lee conrad a string of people who have sold or 
been suspected of selling highly classified information costing us 
billions of dollars in technology that has been compromised not to 
mention some of our human intelligence compromised 
we want to enhance security measures without turning into a 
stalinist paranoid state cohen added 
senate sources said the panel has no chairman but executive 
branch officials said borens friend eli jacobs who owns the 
baltimore orioles baseball team has usually taken the lead 
jacobs a venture capitalist served on an arms control advisory 
group in the reagan administration still sits on defense 
department advisory committees and may once have worked for army 
counterintelligence he declined to be interviewed 
the others have far more washington experience they are former 
deputy cia director and national security agency chief bobby ray 
inman former cia director richard helms former carter white house 
counsel lloyd cutler former reagan white house counsel arthur b 
culvahouse jr former ambassador and senior state department 
official seymour weiss former xerox executive ambassador and 
middle east negotiator sol linowitz and former deputy secretary of 
state warren christopher 
columbia university law professor harold edgar an expert on the 
application of espionage statutes to leaked government information 
is helping write proposals in legislative language 
in interviews cohen and inman said greed has emerged as the 
most common motivation for spies over the last decade ideology 
they said had declined among spies even before it came unraveled 
in the communist world during the last year 
to counter that one source said the fbi has mentioned its 
longstanding desire to be able to examine tax and consumer credit 
records in intelligence investigations before theres full evidence 
of a crime authority it now has only for bank records 
if a guy goes from a vega to a jaguar in a years time 
somethings wrong cohen said 
inman refused to discuss the work of the panel but said he 
personally has begun thinking about how to use data that are now 
unavailable to counterintelligence officials he suggested that a 
computer could be given a list of people with access to secrets and 
the irs could then tell you if there was any significant change 
either a bankruptcy or a large gain but he warned against 
opening tax records merely for fishing expeditions 
inman also said polygraph tests might be shortened to focus 
narrowly on contacts with foreign agents and then administered 
randomly among those with the most sensitive jobs hes also 
weighing the idea of bounties for family members who report 
turncoat relatives 
but this is early thinking cohen said legislative proposals are 
still about two months away 
however boren and cohen already have stolen an arrow from the 
executive quiver by turning first to prominent private citizens for 
advice a standard weapon of presidents to marshal political 
support in advance 
cohen is frank to admit that its always resisted from the 
executive branch whenever we start talking about changes so you 
have to have backup 
in the government each spy arrest is at once a success for 
those who caught the traitor a failure for those who were fooled 
in the first place so too the borencohen advisers have divided 
the intelligence community 
at the most cynical one intelligence official pointed out that 
the leadership of the senate committee rotates regularly and said 
this is an effort to produce a legislative monument to the tenure 
of boren and cohen 
another executive branch official citing the record string of 
spy convictions in the 1980s said our big counterintelligence 
problem is not new legislation but new values in society so people 
wont be so willing to sell out their country 
but an intelligence community official praised the panel for 
tackling tough questions and he added when you consider who 
they are and the demands on their time im impressed by the amount 
of time they put in 
further the philosophical range on the panel is broad if 
they can come up with some consensus maybe we can get some problems 
looked at seriously without arousing civil liberties concerns

resign before the next election according to polls published 
sunday in three newspapers 
the surveys appeared in the sunday times of london the 
independent on sunday and the mail on sunday they were the latest 
signs of growing discontent with mrs thatcher and her threeterm 
government 
the sunday times said it questioned 100 conservative members of 
parliament and that 10 said mrs thatcher should resign now 
eighteen believe she should step down just before the next 
election which must be held by mid1992 
the newspaper said 59 lawmakers responded that mrs thatcher 
should remain in office until after the election the remaining 13 
believe it is up to her to decide when to leave politics 
of the 650 members in the house of commons 374 belong to the 
governing conservative party all three newspapers said they 
questioned lawmakers from all factions of the party 
the polls capped a week of national protests against a new 
system of taxation under which each adult in a local district must 
pay the same amount for municipal services the new community 
charge does not take into account a persons income and 
community charges vary widely depending on the level of services 
offered in a local district 
the protests turned violent at times and sent jitters through 
the financial community the result was a 2cent drop in the value 
of the british pound and lower share prices on the london stock 
exchange 
opposition to the tax along with rising inflation and 15 
percent mortgage interest rates has helped put the opposition 
labor party as much as 19 points ahead of the conservatives in 
recent opinion polls 
the independent said mrs thatchers grip on the party 
leadership had weakened substantially since december when only 10 
percent of lawmakers voted against her in the annual leadership 
review 
mrs thatcher defeated littleknown legislator sir anthony meyer 
31433 in the vote 
the independent said that of the 171 conservative lawmakers it 
sampled 41 want mrs thatcher to resign before the next election 
it said 13 felt that maybe she should step down but 113 want 
her to stay four did not respond 
the mail on sunday approached 146 lawmakers and said 116 
replied of those 45 said mrs thatcher should consider stepping 
down before the next election and 71 said she should not 
all three surveys found that former defense secretary michael 
heseltine was the favorite to replace mrs thatcher 
the mail on sunday also reported that some lawmakers planned to 
ask heseltine to campaign for the party leadership 
heseltine denied the report he repeated predictions that mrs 
thatcher will lead the party to victory in the next election

an army of federal workers is about to try to 
make thousands of nearly invisible people part of america 
the occasion is the first census of the homeless 
often in sight if not always seen these people do not exist 
for purposes of federal aid and representation unless they can be 
counted 
how many are there where do they live what kind of help to 
they need 
to many of the homeless though being counted seems likely to 
make little difference in their lives 
i dont see nothing i stand to lose or gain said spencer 
cox a homeless new yorker its just useless whats the point 
a homeless man in stamford conn echoed coxs view what 
good would it do to cooperate said the man who would identify 
himself only as bob 
estimates of the number of homeless nationwide have ranged from 
250000 to 3 million in recent years 
counting them a task some consider impossible will be 
attempted on the night of march 2021 less than two weeks before 
the census bureaus official counting day for the rest of the 
nation 
its the first time weve gone out in the street to count 
people said cynthia m taeuber who is directing the effort 
advocates for the homeless local governments and other 
organizations have been enlisted to help and most are cooperating 
she said 
in some cases that assistance is being given grudgingly 
however since the groups have concerns about whether there will be 
a complete and accurate count 
the bush people are not into taking care of people who need 
help said karl kirman contacted at the columbus house shelter 
in new haven conn and they dont want to know why we need 
help but kirman said he would answer the census questions anyway 
simone baxter 29 of hartford conn who said she has been 
homeless for four months believes it is important to be counted 
i dont think the government realizes how many homeless people 
there are she said 
william barrios who lives in a shelter for veterans in new 
york said people in shelters will be cooperative they get a 
census every night when they check in he said 
the homeless people on the streets theyre not going to 
cooperate theyre druggies and alcoholics looking for their next 
fix barrios added 
in washington mitch snyder of the center for creative 
nonviolence is urging the homeless to snub the census bureau 
you cant count all the people in the streets experience 
quickly teaches the homeless that to be identified as such is to 
risk harassment and abuse snyder said 
in detroit toylce cheatham is worried about talking to 
government officials even though the census bureau promises to 
keep the answers secret 
theyll tell you its confidential but you can get cut off if 
you say the wrong thing said the 24yearold cheatham who was 
staying at the salvation armys booth center 
and she wasnt convinced that getting the homeless counted would 
result in more shelters or other aid anyway thats what theyre 
been going to do but theyre been saying that for umpteen years 
in chicago officials of the pacific garden mission said they 
will aid censustakers whether theyre aware of it or not 
theyre being counted said boyd sylvester assistant 
superintendent of the mission 
i think its a great idea said breon lucas 26 the 
government can help people who dont have a job find a place to 
work and give them something to eat at night 
another chicagoan anthony kunevich 60 was skeptical they 
think about the army and give them raises they dont think about 
the poor people the homeless 
because of problems in finding all the homeless and concerns 
about worker safety taeuber admits that she expects the tally to 
be conservative 
a decade ago census takers went to shelters but did not try and 
count people living in alleys under bridges and in parks and 
similar locations 
in the end it wont announce any specific number of homeless 
since officials decline to try to define that term instead the 
bureau simply will report that its special count found so many 
people in shelters so many in missions so many in flophouses so 
many walking or sleeping on the streets and so forth 
beginning at 6 pm march 20 census workers will visit public 
and private emergency shelters hotels and motels used to shelter 
the homeless and other hotels costing less than 12 per night this 
effort is expected to last until about midnight covering a period 
when people are generally settled for the night 
then from 2 am to 4 am census workers will travel the 
streets checking places not intended for habitation but where 
homeless people may be found 
security can be a problem for workers taking to streets and 
shelters in the middle of the night and they will be dispatched in 
groups of two or three they have been told to leave any area where 
problems develop taeuber said 
because of safety questions she explained the decision was 
made not to enter abandoned buildings even though people may be 
sleeping in them 
and she added sleeping persons will not be awakened to 
answer questions instead enumerators will estimate as best 
they can the persons age sex and race 
the same goes she said for persons who are not in a state of 
mind to answer questions or who refuse 
we will attempt to ask all persons in shelters and all persons 
living on streets the basic questions she said but our main 
effort will be just to get a person counted 
people living in shelters for abused women in tents at 
commercial campgrounds seeking temporary shelter in local jails 
and other such institutions will be counted in the regular census 
on april 1

the pentagon should establish an acquisition 
corps in each of the services to handle its purchases of more than 
100 billion in weapons each year a house subcommittee said sunday 
the words procurement disaster comes to our lips far too 
often rep nicholas mavroules chairman of armed services 
subcommittee on investigations said in unveiling draft legislation 
to change the militarys buying practices 
the bill envisions an acquisition corps consisting of both 
military and civilian personnel overseen by the under secretary of 
defense for acquisition commonly known as the pentagons 
procurement czar 
it also proposes the creation of a defense acquisition 
management university to conduct research and train a professional 
procurement corps 
the subcommittee said it had found that half of the people who 
work in pentagon contracting lack a college education 
we are dissatisfied with the current acquisition system and 
committed to developing a more professional acquisition 
workforce said rep larry j hopkins of kentucky the ranking 
republican on the panel 
mavroules dmass rejected as a nonstarter recent 
suggestions that a new acquisition agency separate from the 
military services be created 
talk of such radical changes simply stymies efforts to achieve 
real change he said

university of texas student mark kilroy vanished early march 14 
1989 while out bar hopping with three friends in this border city 
after a monthlong search his mutilated corpse was found buried at 
a ranch

farm a drugsmuggling cult allegedly performed the ritual slayings 
seeking magical protection from the law and rival smugglers 
heres what those involved have to say a year later 
helen and james kilroy of santa fe texas say some good has 
come from the death of their 21yearold son they have been 
warning other young people about the evils of drugs through 
speaking engagements and the mark kilroy foundation 
they also are writing a book the parents said they havent read 
the books already published including one titled hell ranch 
but have heard they sensationalized the killing 
in our book we intend to tell the true story and exactly what 
all went on how we felt about it all said james kilroy 
bill huddleston a texas aampm junior who accompanied kilroy to 
matamoros called a news conference wednesday to urge college 
students who go out drinking to stay together and check up on each 
other i feel like i owe it to mark to get the message out to

law he said the defendants in this case are presumed responsible 
but have the opportunity to prove themselves innocent 
perez said the greatest punishment any single defendant in the 
case could receive would be 40 years in prison the penalty for 
homicide the worst crime alleged one of the seven a caretaker at 
the ranch is charged only with covering up the crime 
alex perez sheriff in brownsville just across the rio grande 
says the gruesome crime still haunts him in my life ive seen a 
lot of it but this was the one that got me not to sleeping at 
night he said 
experts concluded that the cult practiced a perverted form of 
the afrocuban religion palo mayombe in which believers use human 
bones but dont normally kill people to get them police said

chase untermeyer says that being george bushs 
chief talent scout is rather like painting the golden gate 
bridge 
once you finish the job you have to start in at the other end 
and start painting it again says the 44yearold white house 
personnel director and bush protege 
from a crowded office in the west wing of the white house 
untermeyer and his staff assemble resumes and sort out the winners 
from the alsorans in the quest for presidential appointments 
with white house chief of staff john sununu the affable 
houstonraised and harvardtrained untermeyer makes the final 
recommendations to bush on 3500 jobs untermayer and his staff 
also ride herd on cabinet and agency heads in filling more than 
2000 other political posts 
untermeyer once a political reporter said in a recent 
interview that its sort of a rule of thumb in this business 
that every time you make an appointment you earn nine enemies and 
one ingrate 
there also has been some criticism of the speed with which the 
white house has filled appointments last september democrats on 
capitol hill accused bush of operating a swisscheese 
govermnent riddled with highlevel vacancies 
untermeyer defends the administrations performance saying that 
background checks are timeconsuming and that the criticism would 
have been far worse if we had slamdunked people into jobs 
i personally dont mind being the target of a bad news story 
or two in 1989 if we are spared in 1990 and thereafter a series of 
news stories about some cretin or boob or otherwise incompetent 
individual who was named to office by george bush he told the 
heritage foundation last year 
you can bet that the folks writing those stories would not 
say on the other hand the white house in 1989 acted with 
admirable speed in putting this fine citizen into office said 
untermeyer 
in the interview untermeyer said the opposition turned up the 
heat on the pace of appointments essentially because we had 
denied the democrats the socalled sleaze issue 
practically none of our nominees has come under any 
controversy whereas that happened all the time under president 
reagan 
however several bush nominees to major posts were defeated or 
forced to withdraw including john tower as defense secretary and 
william lucas as the justice departments civil rights chief 
in addition fred bush the chief fundraiser for the 1988 bush 
campaign but no relation to the president was rejected as 
ambassador to luxembourg after coming under scrutiny for contracts 
he had received from reagans department of housing and urban 
development 
untermeyer served as a navy officer during the vietnam war 
after a stint with the houston chronicle he entered politics and 
served two terms in the texas house of representatives he became 
executive assistant to thenvice president bush at the outset of 
the reagan administration 
later he spent five years in the pentagon as a deputy and then 
assistant secretary of the navy for manpower and reserves 
responsible for recruiting training health and other matters for 
the navys 600000 sailors and 200000 marines 
untermeyer who said he longs to leave personnel work and 
return to a policy rule has stayed off the social circuit 
partly to avoid being buttonholed by job seekers 
he routinely logs 12 to 14hour days customarily getting by on 
four or five hours of sleep a night 
at his desk on a recent sunday afternoon untermeyer 
acknowledged that 1989 had its grim points but it had its 
upside too i also met the woman that im now engaged to marry 
he and diana c kendrick 27 executive assistant to c boyden 
gray the white house counsel plan an october wedding 
it was a white house romance you might say that we met on a 
sunday working on paperwork which is exactly whats happening 
now

the theme at the metropolitan opera was the past 
and golden anniversary nostalgia but the accent was on youth and 
the future 
in place of its usual saturday matinee opera the met threw a 
gala concert featuring some of its shining and rising stars in 
arias duets trios even a quintet 
the occasion was the 50th year of continuous met radio 
broadcasts sponsored by texaco and the concert was heard by the 
faithful audience of millions that tunes in each week during the 
season 
what they heard were mostly familiar operatic excerpts made 
special by some exceptional young american singers 
chief among those was dawn upshaw the soprano who has been 
staking a claim to many of the roles identified with kathleen 
battle miss upshaw was radiant in an aria from stravinskys rarely 
heard masterpiece the rakes progress 
another highlight was a pair of performances by baritone thomas 
hampson he rattled off a dazzling rendition of largo al 
factotum from rossinis il barbiere di siviglia and later 
showed potential for heavier roles as he joined soprano carol 
vaness in the act two duet from verdis la traviata 
miss vaness was good in that but she was downright awesome a 
short while in the tricky come scoglio the firstact 
showstopper from mozarts cosi fan tutte runs trills leaps 
all were letterperfect 
others who made favorable impressions included recent debutantes 
delores ziegler in the composers aria from strauss ariadne auf 
naxos and ashley putnam whose ringing high cs stood out in the 
final trio from gounods faust there she was joined by 
francisco araiza and samuel ramey 
ramey who also sounded splendid in an aria from verdis 
ernani was one of the few superstars on hand for the 
afternoon bass james morris chimed in with a thoughtfully sung 
aria from verdis don carlos and tenor neil shicoff sobbed his 
way affectingly through the thirdact aria from puccinis 
tosca the great german bass kurl moll was sort of wasted in a 
brief scene from wagners der fliegende hollaender 
the most entertaining number of the day was the quintet from 
rossinis il barbiere nicely sung and acted by miss ziegler 
araiza gino quilico renato capecchi and ferruccio furlanetto 
the concert opened with artistic director james levine 
conducting the overture to mozarts le nozze di figaro the 
first opera ever broadcast by texaco in 1940 
original plans called for marilyn horne to appear but she did 
not another mezzo mainstay of the company tatiana troyanos 
withdrew at the last minute because of illness 
but in the end maybe the shortage of familiar star power was 
all to the good it threw the emphasis on the emerging generation 
of singers on whom those saturday afternoon broadcasts will depend 
for years to come

the italian communist party the largest 
in the west voted sunday to embark on a new course that is 
expected to lead to a change in its name and the dropping of the 
hammerandsickle symbol 
party leader achille occhetto was reelected at the 
extraordinary congress and will preside over the changes the next 
party congress which may not be convened for a year is expected 
to approve the details of the communists new line 
occhetto had campaigned hard for relaunching the italian 
communist party which is the secondbiggest political grouping in 
italy it has an estimated 14 million members 
after the collapse of communism in eastern europe occhetto 
argued that italys communists could not ignore the march of 
history 
a new political formation could reverse the decline in party 
membership and the steady slip in electoral strength he said 
if the new party moves closer to the mainstream of european 
socialism occhetto has argued it could help unite italys 
political left and forge a viable alternative to the christian 
democrats 
the christian democrats and their allies have dominated every 
italian government since the end of world war ii 
occhetto supports the communist party becoming a new grouping of 
leftist forces representing the workers the poor the weak and the 
disenfranchised his motion to eventually change the partys name 
and symbol was supported by 726 delegates in balloting sunday that 
represented 67 percent of the ballots 
a motion to reject major reforms received just 37 votes or 3 
percent 
central committee members elected sunday morning met for the 
first time and reelected occhetto as party secretary the vote was 
213 in favor and 23 against with 71 abstaining and five blank 
ballots 
the communists nearly came to power in 1976 when they won 34 
percent of the vote but they dropped to about 27 percent in the 
last parliamentary elections in 1987 
for many communists in bologna occhettos proposals seemed to 
be merely a formal recognition of how the party has already changed 
the party has long proclaimed its independence from moscow 
supporting western parliamentary democracy and even italys 
membership in nato it has seen itself as a critic of international 
communism it condemned the soviet interventions in czechoslovakia 
in 1968 and afghanistan in 1979 and the bloody chinese crackdown 
on prodemocracy demonstrators last year 
still old guard communists rebelled against occhettos 
proposal they favored reform but fought against changes that would 
mean a new name or elimination of the party symbols 
the differences appeared to vanish saturday when after making 
an impassioned plea for unity in his final address a tearful 
occhetto was embraced on the platform by pietro ingrao another 
respected old lion of the party 
now occhetto must design the shape and politics of the new 
party he has pledged that the partys new identity will be chosen 
through a free and open debate and then presented to the next party 
congress

gen augusto pinochet is giving up the 
presidency but not his control of the 60000man army the muscle 
in his long authoritarian rule 
if anything he plans to keep flexing it 
i was ready and always will be to take on the enemies of 
liberty and of democracy pinochet said in his farewell speech to 
the nation delivered in dress military uniform friday night 
a 10yearold constitution written by his government gives the 
armed forces a powerful role as watchdogs over institutional order 
in speech after speech before stepping down he promised to wield 
that authority 
from his new army commanders office which is directly across 
santiagos main boulevard from the presidential palace he will be 
able to literally keep watch over the new leadership 
pinochets constitution also bars any new president from 
replacing him as commander for eight more years twice the term of 
new president patricio aylwin who took office sunday 
after winning election in december aylwin asked pinochet to 
retire from the army when the change in government took place the 
general refused 
aylwin contends that pinochet has come to represent hate and 
division among chileans and that his presence in any position of 
power is an obstacle to national reconciliation pinochet told 
aylwin that with him at the armys lead chiles political 
transition is more secure 
on sunday aylwin said of pinochet i hope he will limit 
himself to the functions of a chief commander and will not try to 
interfere with the political progress of the state 
but pinochet frequently has indicated that he sees himself as 
much more than just a military functionary he has said that on 
matters of importance he will not answer to the minister of 
defense but deal only directly with aylwin 
the ranks of the army by far the most powerful military branch 
are believed to be solidly behind pinochet traditionally a 
welldisciplined force it has receieved unprecendented benefits 
during his rule these include higher pay healthy pension 
programs good housing and more and better weapons and training 
during his final weeks in power pinochet pushed through 
legislation that trimmed aylwins authority and made the military 
virtually autonomous 
one law which has the weight of a constitutional amendment 
bars the new government from cutting defense spending it also 
gives the armed forces the power to conduct any business including 
weapons purchases and sales without presidential approval 
the militarys main concern at the moment is preventing trials 
of officers for human rights violations that occurred after 
pinochet seized power in a bloody 1973 coup 
leftist parties and human rights activists are demanding 
vigorous prosecution but pinochet has declared he wont stand for 
it 
unlike many latin american countries where the end of military 
rule was hastened by economic bungling and social upheaval chiles 
armed forces are returning to the barracks intensely proud of their 
administration they leave a stable productive ecomony with one of 
latin americas lowest inflation rates 
on more than one occasion pinochet has predicted that chile 
some day will miss his lawandorder government 
he also has cited the case of cincinnatus a roman military 
ruler who after retiring to till the soil was called back because 
of growing disorder

texas giant has taken on hercules but 
the title of worlds tallest wooden roller coaster may wind up 
being settled in the courts instead of on the tracks 
the texas giant ride had barely completed its test runs before 
it drew threats of a lawsuit from an allentown pa amusement park 
that claims it has the tallest wooden roller coaster 
whether the new attraction at six flags over texas or the 
hercules at dorney park amp wildwater kingdom has the right to the 
title is a bit confusing there is no certifying agency and no 
universally correct way to measure a roller coaster 
texas giant has the highest first hill at 143 feet six flags 
officials measure the ride from the loading station to the top of 
the first hill or lift hercules sports a lift of only 100 feet 
but the allentown park says the correct way to size up a roller 
coaster is by the length of its vertical drop hercules riders wind 
up 157 feet lower than the height to which they are towed the 
texas giants vertical drop is 137 feet 
dorney park spokesman harry schmerling said the park plans to 
protest the texas giants claim as being false and to defend 
hercules reputation as being no 1 he said attorneys representing 
his park are continuing to actively study the legal aspects of 
the roller coaster tussle 
its a major difference between being the worlds tallest 
wooden roller coaster and not being the worlds tallest wooden 
roller coaster schmerling said 
the arlington convention and visitors bureau already is 
circulating materials promoting the new attraction in the 
dallasfort worth area as being the worlds tallest sandy laplant 
said her agency wont change those materials unless ordered to do 
so by six flags management 
at any rate the new roller coaster is an eyeopener or an 
eyecloser for those who find their courage quickly waning as the 
cars creep toward the summit 
randy geisler president of the american coaster enthusiasts 
club in st paul minn hasnt taken sides but he does plan to 
take a spot in line his group plans to hold its annual convention 
in arlington in june and more than 400 members are ready to test 
the texas giant tallest or not

mixup faces a separate lawsuit by a couple alleging it threw away 
the sperm of a man about to undergo treatment for testicular 
cancer according to a published report 
idant laboratories was sued by gasper and catherine mastrobuoni 
last year after the sperm was thrown out because of a billing 
mixup the daily news reported in its sunday editions 
i was devastated when i found out they destroyed my husbands 
sperm mrs mastrobuoni told the news it was our only chance 
for having a child 
idant is accused in another lawsuit filed last week of providing 
the wrong semen to a white woman who later bore a black child the 
womans husband also white had his sperm stored before undergoing 
chemotherapy for cancer 
idant has denied fault in that case 
the news said it was unable to reach company officials for 
comment on the mastrobuoni claim a call placed by the associated 
press to idants answering service saturday night wasnt returned 
when matrobuonis cancer was discovered a veterans 
administration hospital referred him to idant the news said he 
agreed to pay the bank 200 and it stored some of his semen in 
january 1985 before he started radiation treatment 
when the couple didnt hear from idant they called and learned 
the husbands sperm had been discarded because the lab had only 
received a 20 payment from the veterans administration 
by that time mastrobuoni had started his radiation treatment 
we never received any type of billing mrs mastrobuoni told 
the news the newspaper said it could not reach veterans 
administration officials for comment 
mastrobuonis cancer has been cured but an attorney for the 
couple joseph filardi said its very unlikely his sperm count 
is high enough to effectuate conception he added that radiation 
treatments also adversely affected the sperm

a federal grand jury is wrapping up an 
investigation of a former state prosecutors alleged drug use in a 
case raising questions about a previous investigation by the state 
attorney general 
richard guida was a deputy attorney general until 1986 when he 
resigned after a radio reporters allegations that he was a heavy 
cocaine user 
thenattorney general leroy s zimmerman found no evidence of 
any wrongdoing but guida said staying on the job while fighting 
what he called rumors would burden the department 
the fbi and federal officials have been on the case since at 
least last may and the grand jury has been hearing secret 
testimony from a string of guidas acquaintances and former 
girlfriends for at least seven months insiders say the jury could 
wrap up its probe within a month 
a recently obtained federal court document says last august 
acting us attorney james west told the court the probe involves 
allegations of possession and use of controlled substances by 
guida while a prosecutor 
guida denied the allegations said he never used cocaine and as 
recently as last month said he was not aware of any investigation 
the court document said guida was told he was a target of the probe 
last may 
guida was a highly regarded prosecutor whose role in winning 
convictions in a highly publicized murder won him a consulting job 
in a television miniseries about the case called echoes in the 
darkness the show portrayed him as a hardnosed prosecutor 
sources familiar with the investigation including a grand jury 
witness say it includes allegations that guida provided cocaine to 
friends and that other officials may have tried to cover up his 
problems 
the witness brenda snell would not discuss specifics of her 
grand jury appearance but in a recent interview the 
selfdescribed former drug dealer and recovering addict said she 
told the fbi she sold cocaine to guida three times and purchased 
small quantities of the drug from him twice 
in 1985 she alleged she sold a pound of cocaine to guida for 
17000 she claimed guida gave her the money in 100 and 20 bills 
in a paper bag at a snack shop in the building housing the attorney 
generals office 
at the time guida was chief of the prosecutions section 
supervising lawyers whose work included drug cases 
ms snells attorney don bailey was present during the fbi 
interviews and confirmed she provided the details to investigators 
guida said he doesnt know the woman and called her allegations 
absolute lies 
an fbi spokesman would not comment 
other sources including lawyers representing grand jury 
witnesses said the fbi became interested in guida while 
investigating drug dealer jack alan hull 
hull 33 of hershey was convicted in state court last year of 
cocaine and marijuana possession subsequently pleaded guilty to 
federal charges of cocaine distribution and appeared before the 
grand jury earlier this year 
in a sentencing memorandum signed by assistant us attorney 
gordon zubrod the government said hull was providing information 
about his former drug contacts 
most of jack hulls clients were wellheeled professionals in 
the dauphin county area zubrod wrote his list included 
attorneys physicians stockbrokers and businessmen 
guida was hulls attorney until hull pleaded guilty and decided 
to cooperate guida said he couldnt afford me any more 
hull is in protective custody at a state prison and could not be 
interviewed but whptv quoting a source reported that hull 
alleges he was getting protection from guida in the attorney 
generals office 
guida denied that allegation too sources who asked not to be 
named because of the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings 
said federal officials obtained records from the attorney generals 
office relating to guidas tenure and the 1986 internal probe 
zimmerman now a lawyer in private practice said when guida 
left that the investigation by his office cleared the deputy in a 
recent interview he recharacterized the outcome as finding no 
evidence to support prosecution 
west who worked for zimmerman and with guida before moving to 
the federal system took himself off the case because of a 
potential conflict of interest still ms snells attorney bailey 
asked us sen arlen specter rpa to withdraw wests nomination 
as us attorney 
bailey a democratic former state auditor general long at odds 
with west politically alleged that west and the fbi were covering 
up for guida 
specter asked fbi director william s sessions to investigate 
baileys allegations as part of a background check on west the 
check apparently turned up no incriminating information about west 
his file was sent to president bush in january clearing the way 
for his nomination

two radical iranian newspapers on sunday 
accused the united states of trying to undermine president hashemi 
rafsanjani by insinuating he wants to mend relations with 
washington 
the persianlanguage jomhuri islami also attacked certain 
local mass media for their statements on western hostages in 
lebanon 
the newspaper did not elaborate but it appeared to be referring 
to the englishlanguage newspaper tehran times that newspaper 
recently called for the release of the 18 westerners held by 
proiranian factions 
jomhuri islami is aligned with the radical faction in tehran 
that opposes rafsanjanis efforts to improve relations with western 
countries any contact with the united states is anathema to the 
radicals 
the newspaper referred to the recent revelation that president 
bush had spoken on the phone with a man who claimed to be 
rafsanjani but really wasnt 
washington wants to insinuate that efforts are being made 
behind the curtain for establishment of ties between iran and the 
united states the newspaper wrote 
the more the united states makes such endeavors the less it 
will gain it said washington has not only failed to evaluate 
the islamic republic but has confirmed in fact that the islamic 
republic enjoys a sound and unshakable policy toward the united 
states 
a parliament deputy called for an investigation sunday into the 
phone hoax 
mohammad qomi deputy from veramin said rafsanjani should look 
into the matter because it is unlikely anyone from iran would have 
tried such a hoax 
rafsanjani told a news conference last week he believed the 
hostage problem was nearing a solution but he repeated denials of 
any direct talks on the issue between iran and the united states 
iran denies any connection with the kidnappings it has said 
however it would use its influence on the hostages behalf if the 
united states fulfills certain conditions such as freeing billions 
of dollars in frozen iranian assets 
the writings of certain local mass media in connection with 
the hostages should be more carefully taken into consideration 
wrote jomhuri islami it is naive to see no link between these 
writings and the plans sketched by the white house and arrogance 
media 
arrogance is a term used by iran to refer to the united 
states 
the newspaper added such evidence unveils certain suspicious 
efforts that are made to undermine the administration of president 
rafsanjani 
another radical tehran newspaper abrar made similar comments 
sunday it wrote washington may intend to create doubt among the 
forces loyal to the islamic revolution by insinuating the idea that 
the existence of relations between tehran and washington is not too 
far from reality 
the westerners held in lebanon are eight americans four 
britons two west germans two swiss an irishman and an italian 
the longest held is terry a anderson 42 chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985

howard rollins costar of nbcs in the 
heat of the night admits he was addicted to drugs and alcohol 
but firmly denies tabloid newspaper reports that he has aids 
the actor who portrays detective virgil tibbs said his 
addictions drove him to consider suicide just three days before 
christmas 
an inner voice he said was telling him just go ahead and 
kill me im sick of it ill never straighten out my life ill 
never have the career i want how can i talk about a career when i 
cant even stop using drugs why cant i just take a gun to my head 
and be out of this misery 
he said he took his last drug on dec 28 then he packed up his 
drug paraphernalia and stomped it to pieces i have a thing 
inside a needing or craving that i am constantly dealing with 
he said in an interview published in the march 17 issue of tv guide 
magazine 
rollins said he was only an occasional user when he landed the 
tibbs role in 1987 but was hopelessly addicted within six months 
during the first season he was arrested in baton rouge la on 
charges of cocaine possession and drunken driving that led to him 
twice entering rehabilitation centers but both times he failed to 
stop using drugs 
toward the end of the shows second season he began to miss 
work i got too tired and it was too much to be able to keep that 
front up everyone knew i was high he said 
in november he was hospitalized after suffering chest pains and 
was told he had developed an enlarged heart chamber because of his 
drug use that news led him to enter the drug clinic at atlantas 
anchor hospital 
while there his file photographs were sold to the tabloids 
they apparently paid people to take my dietary files then paid 
someone to tell them what i said in confidence in therapy 
sessions he said 
he said he told the therapy group its really hell having to 
live in a world where you have to deal with diseases like aids or 
you have to deal with racism 
that remark he said was twisted around to make it seem as if 
he had the disease asked in the interview if he had tested 
positive for the virus that is responsible for aids rollins said 
no no no

its not quite shooting fish in a barrel 
but a dedicated angler who stocked his backyard swimming pool with 
fish for the winter says it guarantees that the big ones nearly 
always are biting 
there are days i can go out there and catch fish over and 
over said lamar collins a 49yearold contractor most of 
them know what my baits are and where i bought them 
later this month the bass crappie and bluegill go back to the 
tennessee river and flint creek where they were caught with rod 
and reel and people again will swim the pool 
there are about 50 fish in the pool maybe more feeding time is 
every two weeks when collins puts about 10 to 12 dozen minnows in 
the pool he said 
collins began his backyard fishing hole last year by pumping 
down his pool letting it refill with rain water then stocking it 
when cool weather started around oct 1 
i hardly miss a day picking up a rod either for practice 
throwing or to see if theyre biting he said 
if he plans to fish the river collins said trying his luck in 
the pool can be a good indicator of how the fish will be biting 
you can observe from the water depth as to where you need to 
fish in the river he said if theyre in the shallow end of 
the pool theyll probably be feeding in shallow water wherever you 
fish

brash and sometimes bumbling criminals 
have staged a rash of bank robberies in ohios capital city and its 
suburbs 
the columbus area with a population of about 12 million has 
had 42 bank robberies this year more than chicago detroit 
pittsburgh and cleveland combined 
why are there so many bank robberies frankly right now we 
dont have a clue said fbi agent douglass ogden if we knew 
that wed stop them 
authorities suspect many of the robbers are downandout drug 
addicts looking for quick cash 
that theory was borne out with the arrest friday of a man who 
admitted to robbing eight banks since feb 7 claiming he used the 
money to support a 900aday crack habit 
the man named jesse james dalton jr although authorities 
say he is no relation to the outlaw jesse james or the dalton 
brothers confessed to the robberies after being shown photos taken 
by bank cameras 
a man who robbed a bank tuesday lost his fake beard and looked 
directly at the bank camera before fleeing police said 
these are not real sophisticates said capt frank phillips 
head of the police detective bureau theyre not getting much 
during the robbery and most of them arent getting away either 
ogden said the robberies have involved small amounts generally 
no more than 1000 he would not release specific figures 
there have been 21 arrests in the 42 robberies all of the 
defendants are awaiting trial 
one man was arrested while counting his booty in his getaway 
vehicle a city bus march 5 after he allegedly robbed the same 
bank one branch for the third time in a week police charged him in 
six bank heists 
ed billman vice president of banc one corp which owns bank 
one said security has been increased at the branch he said more 
plainclothes security guards would be stationed at his banks and 
that police have agreed to stop in periodically 
i think theres a combination of bravery and stupidity at work 
here said phillips i mean most of these people are walking 
into the banks with no gun and in most cases no disguise and 
theyre looking right at the camera this isnt bonnie and clyde 
were dealing with 
but authorities arent taking the trend lightly 
on march 2 five banks were hit prompting mayor dana rinehart 
to call for more bank security and more fbi presence 
so far nobody has been hurt these people come into the bank 
get the money and leave rinehart said but sooner or later 
somebody will get hurt this will all end when one of these 
robbers gets shot with a 45 in the chest its a heck of a way to 
terminate the problem but it sure gets the word out 
ogden said the fbi police and bank security officials have met 
to determine the best way to stop the robberies he would not give 
details but he indicated security would be increased inside and 
outside bank branches in franklin county which includes columbus 
he also hopes to increase his number of agents he would not say 
how many agents are assigned to the columbus office which oversees 
12 counties 
ogden said his office is quite overwhelmed by the robberies 
in columbus this year last year bank robberies were down 50 
percent from 1988 when 98 were reported a record for the columbus 
area 
fbi figures show that chicago has had 10 bank robberies so far 
this year detroit had nine pittsburgh four and metropolitan 
cleveland three los angeles in contrast has had 110 
these things go in cycles said ogden 
he pointed out that the columbus freeway system makes for easy 
getaways two interstates cut through the city in each direction 
and both connect with an outerbelt 
banks are fighting back by giving informants rewards of up to 
2000 and providing tellers with dye packs cannisters of paint 
that can be programmed to explode marking the loot 
i know of one teller who stuffed a dye pack down a robbers 
shirt theres some guy out there with a real red chest right now 
it shouldnt be too hard to find him billman said

cuba is bracing itself for the possibility of a 
us invasion and for sharp cutbacks in its foreign trade as a 
result of the upheavals in the soviet union and eastern europe 
at the same time president fidel castro is as determined as 
ever to stay on the socialist path despite the trend elsewhere 
toward freemarket economies 
throughout havana signs remind citizens of that determination 
socialism come what may said a large banner in an auditorium 
where castro spoke last week 
the development of a strong defense to guard against a us 
invasion has been a high priority for years and even more so 
lately 
a young cuban who recently completed three years of military 
service told a visiting american the other day that he spent 
virtually the entire time digging tunnels along the north coast for 
hiding soldiers tanks and planes and for sheltering hospitals 
i was a pick and shovel man he said looking down at his 
hands and recalling the harsh labor 
for the past decade cuba has devised a strategy whereby in the 
event of aggression the entire population would be mobilized in 
defense castro said in a speech wednesday that efforts are being 
made to ensure maximum military selfsufficiency 
if the united states imposes an air and naval blockade steps 
have been taken to guarantee that all the bullets all the 
rifles the mines the grenades all the arms necessary are 
available to fight the enemy he said any invading force he said 
would spill a river of blood 
castro said cuba is manufacturing much of its own weaponry these 
days utilizing iron imported from angola it is one of the 
countrys few remaining allies 
castro ridiculed the united states for its habit of deposing 
unfriendly leaders in small countries and then declaring a 
colossal victory 
as a rule in their military adventures the tears begin when 
the remains of the soldiers begin to arrive when the coffins 
begin to arrive he said 
and those we can supply in great quantity if they invade 
cuba he added industrial quantities we can supply so they 
wont get bored and wont stop crying a single day 
castro also warned of the possibility of a peacetime crisis 
special measures would be required he said if problems in the 
soviet union lead to a cutoff of oil supplies to cuba the supplies 
average 12 million tons annually 
what would happen if suddenly we dont have the 12 million 
he asked if there are only four we have to know that 
in case of this all construction of schools day care centers 
health centers and housing would stop the president said bus 
service in havana could be reduced from 30000 trips a day to 
10000 on the farm mules would have to replace tractors 
the anticommunist upheavals in eastern europe have cast doubt 
on cubas future trade and political relations with that region 
castro heaped ridicule on the four warsaw pact members 
hungary poland czechoslovakia and bulgaria which either 
cosponsored or supported a us proposal in the un human rights 
commission last week calling attention to alleged rights abuses in 
cuba the proposal was approved 1712 
the shifting political allegiances of the east europeans could 
mean a cutback in cubas trade with those nations but castro 
almost seemed to welcome that possibility 
in exchange for cuban citrus fruits nickel and other products 
the east europeans often provided junk in return he said 
as an example he said hungarian buses get six kilometers 
four miles per gallon fill the city with smoke and poison 
everybody 
soon he added were going to free ourselves from all that 
with the help of higherquality buses made in cuba

and wall street 
born on the fourth of july stones account of the patriot 
soldier ron kovic whose attitudes about war are shattered in 
vietnam took more than 10 years to make 
platoon the acclaimed vietnam film that stone also 
directed similarly was a hard sell 
he said some film projects like born on the fourth of july 
can be improved when they have a long time to percolate he was 
quick to point out too that simply winning prizes and producing 
boxoffice hits does not make movie making a cake walk

taken the guilds top honor twice in their careers stone also won 
for platoon other dual winners include joseph mankiewicz 
george stevens david lean robert wise francis ford coppola and 
milos forman 
stone who becomes the oddson favorite to win the oscar for 
best director said he plans to make a third film about vietnam in 
the next several years he declined to say what the film will focus 
on saying only that it will not concern combat but another 
aspect of war 
stone currently is working on a movie about the musical group 
the doors 
in the 42 years the guild has been handing out the awards only 
three of its picks failed to win the oscar 
in addition to stone those nominated by the guild for best 
director of a feature film were woody allen for crimes and 
misdemeanors rob reiner for when harry met sally phil

vice adm jm boorda a sailor since he ran 
away to join the navy at age 16 tends to use a salty phrase or two 
when he thinks of what grammrudman budgetcutters may do to his 
beloved service 
as congress and the white house remain locked in a test of 
political wills over major military personnel cuts boorda can see 
only one result his people will lose 
there are two trains running together the administration and 
democrats and my sailors are sitting in the middle boorda 
told a house panel last week 
he says the seaman on patrol in the mediterranean or the army 
soldier who landed in panama are too busy to know what the office 
of management and budget is or who sits on the house or senate 
armed services committees known on capitol hill as omb hasc or 
sasc 
all they know is they got screwed by the people in 
washington boorda said 
boorda a handful of service personnel and even the joint chiefs 
have been making the rounds in congress appearing before house and 
senate committees to try to avert major personnel cuts 
the battle is over the pentagons request to transfer 935 
million from weapons accounts to military personnel to avoid the 
impact of the grammrudman budgetcutting law 
without the authority to shift funds the defense department 
says it will have to lay off tens of thousands of men and women in 
the military freeze promotions and put transfers on hold 
president bush had the option last august to exempt military 
personnel from the law as the reagan administration had done in 
previous years 
instead white house budget director richard darman and the 
administration decided not to exclude personnel assuming that four 
committees house and senate armed services and house and senate 
defense appropriations would later allow them to shift the funds 
so far the gamble has failed 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee declined to bring up the request before his panel 
telling the pentagon he didnt want to play their shell game 
putting weapons before people was their decision and now 
theyre stuck with it aspin said 
the house chairman has the backing of the democratic leadership 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said last week that 
congress cant allow the administration to shift funds on military 
accounts when it cant be done on domestic accounts 
the administration is responsible for this decision not 
congress foley said 
although house democrats are standing firm the fight continues 
the senate armed services committee voted last week to grant the 
pentagon part of the authority to transfer funds allowing 795 
million of the 935 million requested 
but sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services panel 
accused the pentagon of making a conscious decision to exploit a 
loophole in the budgetcutting law 
i want to make it clear that we voted on the side of the men 
and women in the military who were put at risk by the 
administrations decision not to use its authority to exempt the 
military personnel accounts nunn said friday 
christopher jehn the pentagons assistant secretary of defense 
for force management and personnel told a senate subcommittee that 
the department did not ask bush to exempt personnel because there 
wouldnt have been enough money to train them 
the tradeoff was whether we should protect personnel accounts 
and wind up with what amounted to an imbalanced budget jehn said

these are tough times for nbcs venerable 
today show the program that invented the morning tv format 
last week it lost in the ratings to abcs good morning 
america for the ninth consecutive week and it lost the february 
sweeps to abc for the first time since november 1985 
is the sun going down on today is this a new dawn for abcs 
good morning america will cbs this morning emerge from the 
twilight of third place has success spoiled bryant gumbel 
today ratings began declining with cohost jane pauleys 
poised and public departure from the show after 13 years her 
replacement nbc newswoman deborah norville apparently reminds 
some women of their leastfavorite college roommate 
the today show has experienced a serious decline about 15 
percent on average since deborah norville took over said david 
marans head of media research for the j walter thompson 
advertising conglomerate 
there was a clear reaction to the change in casting he 
said we could see no other reason for the needle really moving 
cbs morning efforts generally have run a distant third in 
ratings almost since the network began competing with today in 
1954 predecessors of cbs this morning changed personnel sets 
and style so often that a loyal viewer was someone who occasionally 
tuned in just to see who or what was still there 
the current cbs editions latest attempt at innovation in 
february was to cashier harry smiths coanchor kathleen 
sullivan in favor of exabc newswoman paula zahn and a barely 
discernible improvement in ratings 
abc keeping the same cast before its cameras won the no 1 
spot without significantly increasing its ratings 
it takes a long time to develop a team said jack reilly 
executive producer of good morning america it takes an even 
longer time for the audience to accept it 
reilly noted that historically today has led in household 
ratings but abcs show has been more popular among advertisers 
most desirable target groups women aged 18 to 49 and men and 
women aged 25 to 54 
nbc officials insist that theyre not worried about the numbers 
we knew there was going to be a drop in the ratings for the 
today show said nbc research chief bob niles the good news 
is that we were pretty good about forecasting it the bad news is 
we didnt want to see those numbers 
niles said a similar ratings dip occurred after gumbel replaced 
tom brokaw as cohost in january 1982 for the next two years abc 
beat today like a gong one week in august 1983 today 
finished third for the first time 
overall since january today has lagged an average 
sixtenths of a rating point behind good morning america for a 
loss of about 600000 viewers niles said 
niles said the decline has not prompted nbc to conduct any 
immediate audience research to discover just what the problem is 
abcs reilly said everyone forgets that the pressure that 
brought on all these problems over there there was that we were 
beating them 
and he noted it took today five years to climb back to no 
1 after gumbel joined the show 
gumbel presaged the current troubles with a memo criticizing 
weatherman willard scott and other today personalities 
the memo to thenproducer marty ryan savaged scotts cornball 
act and the timeliness of movie maven gene shalits reviews it 
also faulted consumer reporters david horowitz and betty furness 
and medical reporter dr art ulene 
only pauley escaped gumbels wrath ryan was succeeded by tom 
capra a longtime news producer who was moving from california to 
new york on friday and could not be interviewed for this story 
gumbel who declined to be interviewed will be questioned by 
barbara walters on abcs 2020 friday in what should be a 
benchmark among interviews of network anchors by other anchors 
walters made her own reputation on today which began jan 
14 1952 under the late dave garroway 
while today is losing viewers with the latest cast change 
theres a hitch for the network competitors 
theyre going elsewhere marans said for the past eight 
weeks there hasnt been a significant increase in abc or cbs 
viewership 
so where are they going analysts suggest theyre tuning in to 
increasingly sophisticated local tv morning shows or disappearing 
into the cable box 
abcs reilly said the vanishing viewer has been a problem for 
the networks for five years there is no one alternative that 
comes near the networks but collectively there are so many 
options out there that people use them

israel is entitled to and may demand 
reparations for the holocaust from a united germany the israeli 
ambassador to west germany said in an interview released sunday 
i cant rule out that israel will demand reparations at some 
point benjamin navon a holocaust survivor told the 
masscirculation daily bild in an interview to be published monday 
a 1950s reparations agreement with west germany spells out 
explicitly that we are entitled to do so in the case of german 
unity the ambassador said the interview was released in advance 
of publication to other media 
west germany has paid 44 billion in reparations to israel and 
jewish holocaust survivors around the world under the agreement by 
the end of this decade payments are expected to reach 555 
billion 
but east germany for years refused to accept moral 
responsibility for the holocaust or pay reparations the former 
communist leaders argued that they themselves were persecuted by 
the nazis and therefore could not be held accountable for the 
genocide in which 6 million jews perished 
after the hardline leadership was toppled by a popular 
rebellion in the fall the new government announced that all german 
people share responsibility for the terrible crimes against the 
jewish people 
also last month israel and east germany held preliminary talks 
about establishing diplomatic ties israel has said it would only 
establish relations if east germany accepted moral responsibility 
for the holocaust and paid reparations 
israeli officials have said privately that considering east 
germanys crumbling economy they would be willing to settle for 
token payments 
navon said in the bild interview that east germany was morally 
obligated to pay reparations 
east germany also was part of the former third reich but has 
always refused to deal with its nazi past he said 
asked about israels views on german unity he said we have 
faith in the german democracy we are convinced that a united 
germany will nurture positive and friendly relations with my 
country and my people 
however navon pointed out that many israelis were concerned 
about the rapid move toward german unification you have to 
understand tens of thousands of israelis carry the death camp 
number on their arm they have suffered terribly 
after world war ii israel served as a refuge for tens of 
thousands of holocaust survivors 
when israeli foreign minister moshe arens embraced the idea of a 
unified democratic germany his statement caused an uproar in 
israel

the stalemate in the afghanistan war is 
unraveling the political consensus that has characterized us 
policy toward the embattled nation for the past 10 years 
when the soviets withdrew their troops from afghanistan cia 
analysts predicted that in a matter of months the mujahedeen rebels 
would topple the sovietinstalled government and march triumphantly 
to the presidential palace in kabul 
a year later the fighting is at a stalemate and congress 
until recently solidly behind the administrations policy with 
covert allocations that reportedly hit 600 million annually is 
starting to rebel 
the administration should not expect the automatic and routine 
continuation of a program that wasnt challenged for a decade 
said rep stephen solarz dny chairman of the house 
subcommittee on asia who convened a hearing last week on 
afghanistan 
at a hearing on the direction of us support for the 
mujahedeen solarz and rep lee hamilton of indiana the no 2 
democrat on the house foreign affairs committee repeatedly 
questioned the need to keep the afghanistan program secret and 
argued for public debate of us policy 
the state department and the cia meanwhile appear engaged in a 
turf battle over policy toward the rebels 
us afghan policy began to unravel soon after the soviets 
completed the pullout of their troops in february 1989 a period 
that coincided with the transition from the reagan to the bush 
administrations 
in the time it took the new administration to settle in a 
vacuum formed which the cia was happy to fill with the personnel it 
already had in place said barnett r rubin an expert on 
afghanistan who testified at solarzs hearing 
subsequently the state department began to weigh in but many of 
the operational decisions such as which rebel factions should get 
how many weapons are still in the cias hands said rubin who is a 
research fellow at the congressionally endowed institute of peace 
he said there are extremely divergent views within the 
government about the situation in afghanistan and where us 
interests lie 
what disturbs me most about the american role in all this is 
the degree to which the united states has become involved in what 
are essentially internal afghan affairs said robert peck who 
until last june was the administrations chief specialist on 
afghanistan 
with the soviet enemy gone and afghan factions vying for 
political ascendancy the logic of the afghan situation argues 
that we should be disengaging rather than plunging in more 
deeply he said in congressional testimony 
for 10 years the united states secretly trained and armed the 
mujahedeen rebels so they could defeat the soviet troops who 
invaded afghanistan in 1979 
saudi arabia was a major contributor to the effort and the 
pakistani secret service was put in charge of distributing the 
american weapons to the array of rebel factions headquartered in 
pakistan 
the murky situation in which the pakistani secret service is 
reportedly exploiting divisions among the rebel leaders and playing 
the groups off against each other was not helped by the march 6 
coup attempt against president najib 
at least 56 people died and 200 others were injured in the 
revolt by soldiers loyal to the renegade defense minister gen 
shah nawaz tanai tanai was supported by gulbuddin hekmatyar a 
fundamentalist guerrilla leader who until last year was among the 
rebel commanders in the usbacked mujahedeen coalition 
in recent months it has become increasingly clear that najibs 
government with massive infusions of soviet weaponry to the tune 
of more than 300 million a month was far more durable even 
without help from soviet troops than the cia predicted 
the mujahedeen hampered by internal divisions and by its 
orientation primarily as a guerrilla force has been unable to 
wrest control of afghanistans cities from government troops 
and the administration has been forced to rethink its moves 
the objective is still the same us officials say getting 
rid of the sovietinstalled najib but the focus is shifting from 
doing so by military might to achieving that goal through a 
political settlement 
a military solution could be protracted said one official 
who asked not to be named we want to try and shape events toward 
a political solution 
later this month state department officials will meet with 
their soviet counterparts to discuss najibs future the kremlin is 
willing to support najibs eventual ouster but insists he remain in 
charge of a transitional government us officials say the united 
states insist he must go 
the united states is directing its sights toward the convening 
of a council of all afghan opposition groups this summer a forum 
known as a shura which would elect representatives to 
negotiate a transition to elected government experts outside 
government are skeptical the shura will take place 
unfortunately putting afghanistan back together again is 
likely to take a long time even if we knew how to do it peck 
said if there is one learn we should have drawn from our role 
in afghanistan it is that afghans are not easily programmed they 
do not hold the advice of outsiders in particularly high esteem 
instead of negotiating with the soviets about najib the united 
states should agree with the kremlin for both sides to stop arming 
the combatants peck said conservatives in congress argue 
vehemently against such a move saying it would give the najib 
government with its large stocks of weapons an unfair advantage 
over the mujahedeen

president patricio aylwin is a veteran 
and savvy politican who broke with gen augusto pinochet and helped 
lead the movement that voted the rightwing leader out of office 
aylwin a 71yearold lawyer who took office sunday often says 
he lacks a leaders personality in fact the tall and lanky 
politician with sloping posture and a plaintive voice is fond of 
saying he is not presidential 
but his long career in politics belies that selfportrait 
he has been president of the senate seven times president of 
his centrist christian democratic party and in the 1960s he 
presided over the un general assembly during that time he became 
known as a persuasive negotiator who believes in compromise but who 
also can stick to his principles when pushed 
aylwin is the son of a supreme court chief justice he was born 
nov 26 1918 in san bernardo then a rural community just south 
of santiago and now a bustling suburb 
as a law student aylwin joined the thenbudding socialist 
movement in chile soon afterward however he turned to the 
christian democrats partly because of his strong belief in roman 
catholicism 
in the party which is chiles largest he gained a reputation 
as a conservative and an enemy of the left he never accepted the 
label rightist however calling himself a centrist 
he explains that in latin america leftists have often said 
that social changes are legitimate and they must be carried out 
even if to do so it is necessary to break the law 
ive always rejected that because i think that breaking the 
law brings more aggravation than progress to the poor he said in 
an interview shortly before his landslide election victory in 
december the law is the protection of the weak against the 
powerful 
he also severely criticizes the right saying it is selfish 
and thinks only of protecting its economic interests 
aylwin initially supported the bloody 1973 military coup in 
which pinochet seized power and toppled an elected leftist 
government during a period of economic and political turmoil like 
many chileans he believed the armed forces would quickly return to 
the barracks after establishing order 
he became disillusioned when it became evident pinochet had no 
plans to surrender power and instead was wielding it harshly to 
repress dissent 
aylwin gradually joined the ranks of the goverments outspoken 
critics 
when pinochet called an october 1988 referendum on a proposal to 
extend his rule to 1997 aylwin emerged as leader of a broad 
coalition of centrist and leftist groups that successfully 
campaigned for the generals defeat 
to nobodys surprise he won nomination as the coalitions 
presidential candidate in dec 14 elections winning 55 percent of 
the vote his nearest challenger a former pinochet finance 
minister won just 29 percent 
during his campaign aywin promised to respect human rights and 
civil liberties and to increase spending on social programs but he 
said he plans no major changes in the countrys fairly successful 
freemarket economic program 
his election he said indicated the publics strong desire to 
recover the right to decide by themselves and their dignity 
aylwin and his wife leonor oyarzun have three adult sons and 
two daughters

antigovernment demonstrators marched 
sunday through the capital and in timisoara the cradle of the 
december revolution protesting what they said was the continued 
prevalence of communists and the dreaded securitate 
down with iliescu chanted demonstrators in timisoara 
referring to interim president ion iliescu a former communist who 
ran afoul of deposed dictator nicolae ceausescu 
iliescu led the national salvation front that took power during 
the chaos of the revolution and now heads the multiparty council of 
national unity the council is the makeshift parliament that 
succeeded the front 
the crowd estimated at up to 15000 by ion micu an editor at 
radio timisoara also called for the resignation of interior 
minister gen mihai chitac 
chitac has been accused of direct involvement in the violent 
suppression of the december demonstrations in timisoara in which 
scores were shot by forces loyal to ceausescu the violence in 
timisoara about 250 miles west of bucharest sparked the 
revolution that swept the country and finally toppled ceausescu 
dec 22 
ceausescu and his wife elena were executed on christmas day 
supporters say chitac contributed to the success of the 
revolution by siding with the timisoara demonstrators against the 
securitate ceausescus security force 
several hundred people also demonstrated in the northeastern 
city of iasi for the exposure of securitate members and the removal 
of former communists from state bodies the national news agency 
rompres reported 
the front confiscated the revolution read one sign carried 
in the bucharest protest which was attended by about 1000 
the front dominated by former communists who ran afoul of 
ceausescu has since been forced to share power until may 20 
elections 
this government came to power illegally said bucharest 
demonstrator george vijan standing in front of the provisional 
government headquarters in victory square they did not come from 
the revolutionary people 
they represent a group of communists from the 1950s who are 
guilty of crimes against the people he said 
iliescu said that there is no more securitate said 
demonstrator marin tileau a 44yearold hospital worker but the 
securitate is still functioning in policemens clothes 
the securitate was officially disbanded after the revolution 
and its personnel were transferred from interior ministry to 
defense ministry control some officers have gone on trial 
last month the defense ministry published a breakdown on the 
makeup of the securitate and said the new security organization 
being set up would not use repression or intimidation 
it is a common antigovernment theme here that the interim 
government wants to maintain some totalitarian aspects of the 
ceausescu leadership 
opposition parties in the council of national unity are trying 
to get the election postponed until autumn on the grounds that the 
front now has an unfair advantage because of its domination of 
romanian politics since taking power in the revolution 
all three demonstrations were peaceful and no arrests were 
reported

five people were reported 
killed in factional fighting in black townships and a black 
newspaper sunday said antiapartheid groups should not be demanding 
an end to police emergency powers 
the leaders of black townships said the restrictive measures 
introduced in 1986 should not be lifted amid the wave of violence 
that has claimed about 200 lives during the past month 
for once many of us are beginning to question the logic of 
calling for the lifting of the state of emergency when we are still 
senselessly killing each other like animals city press said in a 
sunday editorial 
a black policeman was among those killed in factional fighting 
and clashes with police over the past 24 hours the violence in 
all four provinces included 13 attacks on police vehicles or 
homes pretoria police said 
police used birdshot tear gas rubber bullets and a revolver 
against crowds of blacks armed with stones and petrol bombs police 
said in a daily report they said 16 people were injured and 20 
were arrested 
residents of townships near johannesburg and in natal province 
have asked the army to bring in reinforcements to stop the 
factional fighting 
but removal of troops from black townships has been a standing 
demand of antiapartheid groups since the state of emergency was 
declared june 12 1986 to put down antigovernment protests and 
blackonblack clashes 
police reinforcements were sent to kathlehong a black township 
12 miles east of johannesburg government radio reported in a 
march on friday residents appealed for police to stop the violence 
in which 23 people have died and scores were injured over the past 
week 
township mayor tau molotsi said the clashes began as a dispute 
between rival taxi companies he said dozens of people sought 
refuge at the local police station and hospital and parents have 
sent their children away 
the emergency regulations allow police to detain suspects for up 
to six months without charge ban protests and bar journalists and 
the general public from protests and areas of unrest 
law and order minister adriaan vlok told parliament friday the 
government was prepared to use its extensive powers under the 
3yearold state of emergency to quell violence 
most of the recent clashes occurred in south africas 10 tribal 
homelands whereas fighting in the mid1980s occurred mostly in 
urban townships 
four of the homelands are independent republics although they 
are not recognized by any other country they were established in 
the 1960s as national states where the 28million black majority 
could exercise political rights and own land

blacks of south african citizenship and the homeland leaders have 
been criticized by the african national congress as collaborators 
with the white minority government

venda on saturday legalized the african national congress the pan 
africanist congress the communist party and other organizations 
south african president pw botha legalized the groups in 
february and the xhosa republics of ciskei and transkei recently

the arrests of two brothers in 
connection with the slayings of their wealthy parents had a 
familiar ring to police prosecutors and some readers of the 
popular press 
it brought back memories of ricky kyle and the billionaire boys 
club two of the more notorious cases in southern california 
involving murdered parents but district attorneys spokeswoman 
sandi gibbons cited two others friday 
in what became known as the ninja or yom kippur case 
stewart woodman was convicted of paying hit men to kill his elderly 
parents on the jewish holiday in 1985 to collect 500000 in 
insurance he faces a possible death sentence his brother neil 
goes on trial in the case in april 
jeffrey percell goes to trial april 6 charged with the slaying 
of his 61yearold parents who were bound gagged and shot in the 
head the november 1988 slaying was the first in years in sleepy 
prosperous sierra madre 
but it is the billionaire boys and ricky kyle cases most brought 
to mind by the arrests of lyle and erik menendez for investigation 
of murdering their father hollywood executive jose menendez and 
their mother kitty a former beauty queen 
lyle mendendez 22 was arrested thursday in the august 
slayings in which the couple were found shot to death in their 5 
million mansion his 19yearold brother surrendered to authorities 
sunday 
henry harrison ricky kyle jr was sentenced in june 1987 to 
five years in prison for killing his father texas millionaire 
henry harrison kyle sr 
the elder kyle was in many ways similar to the elder menendez 
both were aggressive hardnosed businessmen 
menendez a selfmade multimillionaire had fled the castro 
regime in cuba to become a top executive with rca hertz and 
finally the head of live entertainment a bigtime video outfit 
affiliated with the company that makes the rambo pictures 
kyle had built a 100 million empire that included apartments 
restaurants dairy farms a bank and a tv studio before heading to 
hollywood in 1983 after buying four star productions 
prosecutors alleged ricky kyle killed his father because he 
feared he would be cut out of his will after the father called him 
a cocaineusing liar and thief 
he claimed he was searching for a prowler in the darkened dining 
room of the familys belair mansion when he mistook his father for 
the intruder and shot him to death 
kyle described his father as an abusive terror after a first 
trial ended in a mistrial a second jury convicted him of 
involuntary manslaughter 
the billionaire boys club was a nickname adopted by a group of 
scions of some of southern californias wealthiest families who 
used their inheritances to bankroll risky investments 
they were accused of a number of scams and murder plots 
including the 1984 death of hedayat eslaminia a onetime close 
associate of the shah of iran 
eslaminia suffocated apparently accidentally after he was 
abducted from his belmont condominium and stuffed inside a steamer 
trunk for transport to beverly hills 
eslaminias son reza and another billionaire boys club 
member arben dosti were convicted of murder and kidnapping for 
extortion and conspiracy in the plot to kidnap the elder eslaminia 
for his money and then kill him they were sentenced to life in 
prison without parole 
the club leader joe hunt was sentenced in july 1987 to life in 
prison without parole in the slaying of ronald levin levin who 
had conned hunt in a commodities investing deal vanished in summer 
1984 his body was never found

the executive director of the state 
democratic party resigned one day after calling republican gov 
carroll campbell a fascist 
hap connors said he resigned saturday to take the heat off 
the states senior democrats lt gov nick theodore and former 
gov dick riley 
its unfair to put them in this spot connors said 
state republicans called saturday for theodore and riley to 
denounce connors comment a message left at theodores home was 
not returned and rileys home telephone number is unlisted 
a campbell spokesman tucker eskew said he hoped the 
resignation would close the book on a very unfortunate chapter in 
south carolina politics 
connors comment came after a state representative and four 
county officials announced they were leaving the democratic party 
for the gop 
ill call him a fascist connors said of campbell 
he also criticized his opposite number in the state republican 
party i think tony denny if he were a youth in the 1940s hed 
be wearing a brown shirt a reference to fascist uniform styles 
in november connors said democratic party members were shunning 
democratic state sen theo mitchells run for governor not because 
mitchell is black but because of mitchells 1982 indictment for 
food stamp fraud 
party chairman frank holleman in announcing connors 
resignation said the mitchell comments as well as those on 
campbell and denny were occasions when connors made statements 
that did not represent the views of the democratic party 
holleman also wrote campbell and denny to apologize for the 
remarks 
connors said he was unsure what he would do now but hoped to 
do something a little more creative

the second of two sons charged with 
killing their millionaire parents at the familys mansion here 
quietly surrendered sunday to waiting police at los angeles 
international airport 
erik menendez 19 had arranged through his attorney to turn 
himself over to detectives said beverly hills police lt bob 
curtis he had been playing in a tennis tournament in israel 
it was a very lowkey thing said curtis they met him at 
the airport and arrested him for the murder of his parents i 
dont even know how many people noticed what was going on 
menendez and his brother lyle are heirs to the 14 million 
estate of jose menendez 45 an executive of a hollywood video 
distribution company live entertainment inc 
menendez and his wife mary louise kitty menendez 44 were 
shot to death aug 20 in their 5 million mansion the sons 
reported finding the bodies on returning from a night on the town 
lyle menendez 22 was arrested thursday and held without bail 
pending a monday arraignment 
erik menendez arrested about 1 am was booked and taken to 
los angeles county jail where he was held without bail 
it was a voluntary surrender immediately upon being made 
aware of the allegations against him he made arrangements said 
robert l shapiro menendezs attorney 
his reaction to the murder charges is demonstrated by the fact 
that he has voluntarily come back to this country shapiro said 
it shows tremendous character and strength to immediately face 
these allegations 
curtis said police didnt try to have menendez extradited from 
israel 
shapiro said he wasnt present at the airport when his client 
was arrested but had kept officers informed of the progress of the 
flights especially when there were delays in europe 
curtis said he was uncertain whether court paperwork could be 
done in time for erik to be arraigned with his brother monday 
criminal complaints were filed against both brothers last week 
in beverly hills municipal court charging them each with two 
counts of homicide 
curtis said the arrest of the two brothers ends the search for 
suspects in the case but added the usual caution we certainly 
arent closed to the possibility there are others 
police have said two killers committed the crime then picked up 
ejected shell casings from the 12gauge shotguns they used before 
fleeing the scene 
the los angeles times reported saturday that a friend found a 
spent 12gauge casing in one of lyles jackets and it was held as 
evidence 
police who served search warrants at a psychologists office 
thursday also obtained tape recordings apparently of counseling 
sessions which likely will be the subject of a court hearing for 
their admissibility

the bush administration urged the soviet union 
on sunday to respect the will of the citizens of lithuania 
following the unanimous vote by the new lithuanian parliament to 
secede from the ussr 
the white house in a statement released shortly after the 
dramatic vote in vilnius called upon mikhail gorbachevs 
government to undertake immediate constructive negotiations 
with the government of the breakaway baltic republic 
the united states said it also expects the government of 
lithuania to consider the rights of its minority population 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater in a written statement 
said 
the united states has never recognized the forcible 
incorporation of the independent states of estonia latvia or 
lithuania into the ussr we have consistently supported the 
baltic peoples inalienable right to peaceful selfdetermination 
the new parliament has declared its intention to restore 
lithuanian independence the united states would urge the soviet 
government to respect the will of the citizens of lithuania as 
expressed through their freely elected representatives and expects 
the government of lithuania to consider the rights of its minority 
population 
fitzwater added the united states believes it is in the 
mutual interest of lithuania the soviet union and all csce 
countries to resolve this issue peacefully we call upon the soviet 
government to address its concerns and interests through immediate 
constructive negotiations with the government of lithuania we hope 
that all parties will continue to avoid any initiation or 
encouragement of violence 
the csce is the 35nation conference on security and cooperation 
in europe also known as the helsinki process it includes all the 
nations of europe except albania and also the united states and 
canada 
the helsinki process which produced paneuropean agreements on 
arms control and human rights is now being looked to for helping 
shape the new europe in the wake of the dramatic shifts toward 
democracy in the east bloc states 
the united states has never accepted the soviet unions 
annexation of lithuania and the other two baltic states the three 
states were forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
russia had ruled lithuania in the 19th century but lithuania 
had gained independence following world war ii 
gorbachev the soviet president and communist party chairman 
had urged the lithuanians not to secede warning that it could 
undermine his efforts to bring political and economic reforms to 
the entire soviet union 
a lithuanian diplomat said sunday that western governments are 
likely to wait to recognize lithuanias declaration of independence 
until its leaders resolve disputes with moscow and establish 
control over their country 
stasys lozoraitis charge d affaires in washington for 
lithuania said us officials had told him beforehand they want 
to see the government take over effective control before formally 
recognizing it 
all western powers are inclined to wait the lithuanian 
diplomat said but he predicted recognition could come after one 
month or two 
bush like other american presidents before him had reiterated 
the us refusal to recognize the soviet unions annexation of the 
baltic states 
in an annual proclamation last june 14 declaring baltic 
freedom day bush said 
since their forcible annexation by the soviet union in 1940 
the people of lithuania latvia and estonia have suffered political 
oppression religious persecution and repression of their national 
consciousness their cultural heritage has been denigrated and 
suppressed and russification has threatened their survival as 
distinct ethnic groups 
however half a century of repression has not broken the 
spirit of the baltic peoples today their longing and hopes for 
liberty remain strong bush said in the proclamation the 
future looks brighter today than at any other time in the baltic 
states postwar experience

president mikhail s gorbachev sunday told 
communists to prepare to fight for political leadership in a 
multiparty system and proposed rules that would increase autonomy 
of local party bodies but fall short of key demands by reformers 
he spoke to the partys policymaking central committee as it 
met in the kremlin on the fifth anniversary of gorbachevs 1985 
accession to power it was also the eve of a special session of the 
soviet parliament that was expected to elect gorbachev to a vastly 
more powerful national presidency 
in vilnius the capital of lithuania lawmakers sunday night 
declared the baltic republic independent from the soviet union but 
there was no initial reaction to that bold move in staterun news 
reports of the central committee meeting at the kremlin 
gorbachev who serves both as president and communist party 
general secretary asked the committee sunday to formally propose 
that the parliament the soviet congress of peoples deputies 
revoke the partys legal monopoly on power fixed in article 6 of 
the constitution 
at a meeting late last month the party leadership agreed in 
principle to that step it would legalize a multiparty system 
throughout the soviet union and force communists to compete for 
office in contested elections 
the committee approved a proposal for the congress on article 6 
as well as on another constitutional provision that awards the 
komsomol young communist league official trade unions and other 
sanctioned organizations a special role in managing state and 
public affairs the official tass news agency reported 
gorbachev proposed the party schedule a national congress for 
july 2 he is expected to use the meeting to further transform the 
party and weed out opponents of his campaign for perestroika 
or economic and social restructuring 
of course the fight for political leadership in the framework 
of democratic procedures of election campaigns will now become one 
of the basic functions of the cpsu communist party of the soviet 
union gorbachev told the central committee in remarks later 
distributed by tass 
the 248 party leaders that soviet television said attended the 
closeddoor meeting were given drafts of new party rules gorbachev 
said the rules would guarantee grassroots party organizations the 
right to take independent approaches to problems and decide whom 
they should admit as members they could also keep up to 50 percent 
of the party dues paid by members 
but gorbachev did not embrace demands by some communist 
reformers for abolishing city and regional party committees they 
customarily dominate local government authorities and grassroots 
party organizations alike 
gorbachev said the fate of communist parties in eastern europe 
showed the danger that arises when party organizations in cities 
and regions are dissolved 
significantly the soviet leader also failed to endorse 
mandatory election by rankandfile communists of delegates to the 
july party congress which reformers say is necessary to prevent 
local party barons from imposing their slates 
gorbachev stressed that the party should be a union of 
likeminded communists he thus ruled out the possibility that 
factions would finally be admitted in party ranks in contrast to 
the practice laid down by soviet founder vladimir i lenin 
likewise the new rules would permit the creation of a 
federalized party with independent organizations in the soviet 
republics as some party reformers wanted gorbachev said 
but he said the republiclevel parties would be granted real 
autonomy by the rules and a new party program that will be 
submitted to the july congress for adoption 
radicals and reformers inside and outside the communist party 
say that even if it is put on the same legal footing with other 
groups the party will retain its dominant role in soviet life it 
does so through groups of communists organized in government 
agencies farms army units police precincts and virtually every 
other institution 
gorbachev repeated it was necessary for the july congress to 
endorse a new role for the party that would get it out of running 
daytoday soviet affairs but he said party organizations based at 
the workplace would remain 
he also staked out a special position in society for the 
communist party even if its legal status is altered as the 
ruling party politically responsible before the people and one 
that will not engage in trivial parliamentary games 
according to the interfax news agency of staterun radio moscow 
the central committee will reconvene later in the week to nominate 
its candidate for the new presidency presumbly gorbachev after 
the congress of peoples deputies passes the constitutional 
amendments creating the post

the lithuanian parliament voted sunday 
to break away from the soviet union and restore the independence 
the baltic republic lost when it was forcibly annexed by the 
kremlin 50 years ago 
legislators joined hands raised them over their heads and 
chanted lietuva lietuva or lithuania after they voted to 
proclaim their homeland independent once more the vote was 1240 
with six deputies abstaining 
the move was not immediately recognized or sanctioned by moscow 
and legislators acknowledged that full independence would only be 
won after long difficult negotiations with the kremlin 
the lawmakers also declared that the kgb and police now must 
take their orders from vilnius not moscow 
outside the parliament hall a small crowd broke into wild 
cheers over the declaration of independence earlier the crowd 
ripped down a metal soviet crest from the outside door of the 
legislative building and carted it away some stamped on it 
thats the end of the soviet regime said a jubilant deputy 
looking on 
expressing the will of the people the supreme council of the 
republic of lithuania decrees and solemnly declares the restoration 
of the exercise of the sovereign powers of the lithuanian state 
which were annulled by foreign force in 1940 said the 
legislative decree 
and from this moment lithuania again becomes a sovereign 
state it said 
for soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the vote represented 
perhaps his biggest crisis yet on his fifth anniversary as soviet 
leader and the eve of a national parliamentary session 
the outgoing president of the lithuanian parliament communist 
party chief algirdas brazauskas said before the vote that approval 
of secession could have a contagious effect on other republics 
the would only add to gorbachevs troubles which already 
include rumblings for independence elsewhere and serious economic 
problems and ethnic strife in many areas of the nation 
leaders of the proindependence sajudis political movement that 
dominates the new lithuanian legislature acknowledged that full 
independence would have to be won in long difficult negotiations 
we have to sit down at the table said the republics new 
president vytautas landsbergis were not going to be beating 
our fists but we have to start settling accounts 
landsbergis the chairman of sajudis earlier sunday was the 
first noncommunist to be elected president of a soviet republic 
the bearded 57yearold music professor easily defeated brazauskas 
at a news conference after the close of sundays session 
landsbergis said talks with moscow will start when the soviet 
government adopts an appropriate decision on that issue 
lithuanians rushed to hold their session this weekend to 
establish their claim to independence before the national 
parliamentary session which is expected to expand gorbachevs 
powers to include declaring a state of emergency in a republic and 
suspending its parliament 
however landsbergis told reporters perhaps the election of 
mikhail s gorbachev to the post of president of the soviet union 
would make this problem easier and bring the date of the talks 
nearer 
gorbachev has told lithuania that it will cost the republic 34 
billion to pay for the factories and other infrastructure built 
during a halfcentury of soviet rule lithuanians say their bill 
for decades of soviet repression will be even higher 
but gorbachev and other soviet officials have indicated the 
kremlin may grudgingly accept lithuanian secession 
tass the official news agency said the session temporarily 
recognized independent lithuanias 1938 constitution as the supreme 
law of the land instead of the soviet constitution 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
the united states will urge the soviet goverment to respect the 
will of the citizens of lithuania 
the united states has never recognized the forcible 
incorporation of the independent states of estonia latvia or 
lithuania into the ussr we have consistently supported the 
baltic peoples inalienable right to peaceful selfdetermination 
fitzwater said 
the lithuania supreme soviet also changed the republics name 
from the lithuanian soviet socialist republic to the republic of 
lithuania and dropped its soviet emblem 
the deputies stood applauded and then broke into cheers as a 
plain beige drape descended to cover a gold banner behind 
landsbergis depicting a lithuanian crest that included a soviet 
hammer sickle and star 
they stood again as a former political prisoner in a traditional 
embroidered shirt presented the new crest a white knight on a dark 
shield 
deputy rolandas paulauskas a sajudis editor from kaunas said 
the declaration of independence would not change anything 
immediately but as a political act it gives a push to 
negotiations 
he noted that soviet defense minister dmitri t yazov had 
reportedly told lithuanians he would not be willing to talk about 
concessions concerning withdrawal of the soviet army until after 
such a political gesture 
justus paleckis ideology secretary of lithuanian communist 
party said lithuania was assured of getting independence but 
real independence will only be achieved in some years 
sajudisbacked candidates had won a twothirds majority in the 
first contested elections to the baltic republics 141seat 
legislature several of the seats were not filled but 
proindependence activists decided not to wait for a full slate of 
deputies to be present before they called the legislature into 
session 
sajudis leaders decided it would be unfitting to reelect 
brazauskas now that his communists were in the minority said 
sajudis activist haroldas subachius 
landsbergis received 91 votes for the presidency with 42 
against brazauskas got 38 votes with 95 against 
brazauskas led lithuanian communists into splitting off from the 
soviet party in december and joining the drive for restoration of 
the independence that the irelandsized state enjoyed between the 
world wars 
but he favored a more gradual approach to breaking relations 
with moscow 
lithuania like the other independenceminded baltic states of 
latvia and estonia was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 
1940 while under red army occupation 
on friday the georgian parliament passed a resolution 
condemning the republics annexation to the soviet union mirroring 
moves already made in the baltics

an inmate killed when he tried to leave 
the state prison with the garbage was a victim of a policy that 
requires trucks to drive over refuse once it reaches the dump a 
spokesman said sunday 
obviously we dont want inmates to escape said nevada 
state prison spokesman glen whorton anybody who hides himself in 
the trash is running that kind of risk its one way to protect the 
public 
whorton said the purpose of the policy is to disable 
escapees and discourage other inmates from escaping that way 
the body of willis walton 26 was discovered at the dump 
sunday he apparently was crushed to death by the truck 
authorities said 
whorton said it also was possible that waltons death may have 
been caused by a bulldozer that subsequently moved the garbage and 
covered it with dirt 
walton was serving a 19year sentence for burglary and 
possession of a controlled substance he entered the prison in 
september 1987

israels cabinet again failed to decide on a 
response to us peace proposals sunday and prime minister yitzhak 
shamir blamed the united states for upsetting peace efforts with 
recent comments about the status of jerusalem 
an angry vice premier shimon peres left the nearly threehour 
session of the 12member inner cabinet after shamir refused to call 
a vote and announced that a few more days of debate were needed 
peres head of the centerleft labor party said he would seek a 
free hand from his party to break up the coalition governmment 
shamir leader of the rightwing likud bloc indicated he was 
open to compromise and said he would fight any effort to bring down 
the government 
after nearly six months of dicussing us proposals perez said 
he viewed the lack of a decision as a rejection 
what happened in the cabinet today no doubt put an end to 
the possibility of conducting the peace process and put an end 
to the reason behind the national unity government peres said 
after the session 
his actions made it almost impossible for the 15monthold 
coalition government to continue without deciding soon whether to 
accept ussponsored peace talks with palestinians 
prominent palestinians also expressed exasperation at israeli 
leaders who for the second week in a row failed to come to a 
decision on whether to start a peace dialogue 
faisal husseini a prominent palestinian who has been mentioned 
as a possible negotiator said when they decide yes or no we 
would have something to talk about but a government that cannot 
decide anything is just blocking the way 
after caucusing with labor cabinet ministers peres announced he 
would ask the partys 1300member central committee monday to 
empower the 39 labor members of parliament to take the necessary 
steps 
the wording indicated peres was seeking a flexible mandate that 
would give him room to coordinate a joint policy with likud or vote 
in favor of a noconfidence motion that would bring down the 
government 
defense minister yitzhak rabin a labor leader who has favored 
keeping the coalition together said the burden was now on likud to 
come up with an acceptable solution 
he noted he had proposed a compromise which involved giving 
washington a positive answer and then hammering out an agreed 
laborlikud position on outstanding issues 
now it is likuds turn he said the way i see it is the 
peace process is stuck 
speaking on israeli television shamir chastised peres for 
seeking a hasty decision 
whats the hurry to break up the unity government which we 
have built with such efforts so what if the discussion takes 
another day or week will the world turn over 
shamir added that he would try to block any labor attempt to 
form a narrow government 
i shall try to convince parliament members and their parties 
not to help labor in achieving this goal but to vote against them 
if they try to bring down the government he said 
secretary of state james a baker iiis proposals for an 
israelipalestinian meeting are meant to further israels proposal 
for palestinian elections as a step toward peace the israeli plan 
was accepted in may 
shamir saved his harshest criticism for recent us policy 
statements by president bush and other officials opposing the 
settlement of jews in the arab sector of east jerusalem which 
israel annexed in 1967 
i hear the voices coming today from washington on the issue of 
jerusalem things that enrage every jew in israel and i have to 
react i have to consider it said shamir 
shamir also said the bush administration was trying to involve 
the palestine liberation organization in negotiations israel views 
the plo as a terror organization 
i think the americans did not act correctly or properly in 
their entire course of action related to the peace process he 
said 
aides said the us statements were behind shamirs insistence 
that more debate and coordination with labor is neccessary 
baker has made several proposals designed to get palestinian and 
israelis to talks in cairo these include a suggestion that east 
jerusalem residents and exiled palestinians be allowed into 
negotiations 
labor accepted the us ideas but shamir remains opposed he 
says participation of east jerusalem residents would signal an 
israeli willingness to discuss yielding control over the arab 
sector which the plo wants as the capital of a palestinian state 
he also opposes having palestinians who were deported from the 
territories sitting in on the talks he says this would implicitly 
recognize the right of 3 million palestinian refugees to return to 
homes that are now part of israel

gov gaston caperton and the states 
largest teachers union prepared for a monday showdown the union 
refused to end its strike and caperton warned that teachers who 
stay off the job can be dismissed 
state school superintendent hank marockie called the 55 county 
school superintendents to charleston on sunday to detail what he 
said is their duty to punish teachers who continue the walkout 
marockie said he would wait to see how many teachers return to work 
monday before deciding what action to recommend 
teachers are employed by county school boards and it is up to 
the county school superintendents to take any action against 
striking teachers including suspension or firing 
the laws pretty clear said caperton referring to a state 
attorney generals ruling that the strike is illegal county 
superintendents will follow those rules and make it strict and the 
consequences are pretty bad 
meanwhile the leaders of the two main teacher unions requested 
a meeting with caperton wvea president kayetta meadows said 
communications between the governors staff and her group have been 
distorted leading to confusion about what has been offered by 
both sides 
i think its time that we as leaders set aside our differences 
and sit down and talk about the issues before this thing gets out 
of hand said bob brown executive director of the west virginia 
federation of teachers 
gubernatorial spokesman gc morse was out of his office and 
unavailable for comment on the request 
late saturday the 16000member west virginia education 
association accused the governor of backing off a promise to call a 
special legislative session to discuss pay if teachers returned to 
work union officials sent word to county associations sunday that 
the walkout was still on 
caperton said the unions contention that he promised to call a 
special session was a total lie 
the strike began wednesday and by friday had spread to 40 of the 
states 55 counties classes were canceled in 24 counties and 
sharply curtailed in the rest 
teachers voted overwhelmingly saturday to return to work under 
several conditions including that the governor call a special 
session within 30 days 
the essence of the problem is the ballot that we sent out was 
very clear in stating will you go back if the governor agrees to 
all of the following and he didnt union executive director 
dennis giordano said sunday 
gubernatorial spokesman gc morse said caperton would not agree 
to a special session under the threat of a continued strike but 
would consider one once the teachers returned 
attorney general roger tompkins ruled last week that the strike 
was illegal and said any teachers who walk off the job can be 
suspended fired barred from teaching for a year and charged with 
misdemeanors 
caperton on friday recommended that striking teachers lose no 
pay or benefits if they returned to work monday but he said that 
offer wont be repeated if the strike continues 
the west virginia federation of teachers with 3000 members 
recommended saturday that teachers end their strike but said the 
decision was up to teachers in each county 
the average west virginia teacher salary of 21904 ranks the 
state 49th in the nation the association says teachers received a 
5 percent raise from that figure in february but objected when the 
governor provided no money in his 199091 budget for a further 
raise

journalists relatives and government leaders 
appealed sunday to iraq to grant clemency to a londonbased 
journalist sentenced to death on espionage charges and to a british 
woman ordered imprisoned for 15 years 
a delegation of european economic community ambassadors went to 
the foreign ministry in baghdad to make a humanitarian appeal 
on behalf of farzad bazoft and daphne parish the eec said in a 
statement 
british ambassador harold walker said he made a separate trip to 
the ministry to deliver a personal appeal from prime minister 
margaret thatcher to iraqi president saddam hussein 
a foreign office spokesman said britain would also be talking 
with its allies in the next few days to see what support they 
will give us in pressuring the iraqis 
king hussein of jordan who met with mrs thatcher on sunday 
volunteered to see what he could do to help according to 
government sources quoted by press association the british 
domestic news agency hussein is believed to have good relations 
with the iraqi president 
bazoft 31 was arrested in september and charged with spying 
for foreign powers after making an unauthorized trip to a military 
complex where a huge explosion had been reported he was in iraq on 
an assignment for the the observer a london newspaper 
mrs parish 52 a senior nursing administrator for an irishrun 
hospital in baghdad was accused of helping bazoft by driving him 
to the aliskandaria military complex south of baghdad she was 
sentenced to 15 years in prison 
under iraqi law no court appeal is allowed against the 
sentences they were imposed by a revolutionary court saturday 
after a closed trial 
there was no indication when bazoft might be executed 
observer editor donald trelford said he delivered a letter to 
the iraqi embassy on sunday calling on ambassador dr azmi 
alsalihi to urge hussein to commute the sentences 
trelford said he had a heated exchange with the embassys 
secondranking official whom he identified as zuhir ibrahim 
he said that farzad had taken soil samples from the military 
site and was therefore not acting properly i argued i had heard 
nothing to suggest he had acted in any way other than as a 
journalist said trelford 
reports in london said as many as 700 people were killed in an 
explosion at the complex the iraqis later said 19 people were 
killed in a fuel depot blast 
about 50 of bazofts friends and colleagues gathered outside the 
iraqi embassy as did michelle de vries the 21yearold daughter 
of mrs parish 
only two weeks ago i got a letter from the iraqis saying the 
trial would be fair which it has obviously not been miss de 
vries said 
trelford said he stressed the innocence of both bazoft and mrs 
parish and requested that a representative of the newspaper be 
allowed to visit bazoft 
farzad has no immediate family so his colleagues at the 
observer are his family and we are asking to see him as members of 
a family should be allowed to trelford said 
bazoft is an iranian exile who has lived in britain since 1975 
and travels on british documents 
the british ambassador said in a british broadcasting corp 
radio interview the iraqi foreign ministry assured him mrs 
thatchers appeal would be passed on as a matter of urgency 
he said the eec delegation consisting of the ambassadors of 
ireland france and italy and acting on behalf of all 12 member 
nations was told the same thing

gen augusto pinochet surrendered the 
government to elected president patricio aylwin on sunday ending 
16 years of military rule and completing south americas 
transition to civilian government 
however pinochet remains chief of the 60000member army 
despite a request from aylwin that he give up that powerful post 
street celebrations of the partial return of democracy touched 
off scattered disturbances in downtown santiago bands of leftist 
youths blocked streets with burning debris and clashed with police 
more than 20 people were reported injured 
to thunderous applause and cheers aylwin put on the red white 
and blue presidential sash in the inaugural ceremony in valparaiso 
a seaport city 70 miles northwest of santiago 
chile returns to democracy without violence without blood 
without hate he later told supporters in santiago chile 
returns by the road of peace 
aylwins first official act was to pardon all political 
prisoners under the pinochet regime 
pinochet shook the new presidents hand at the inauguration and 
then quickly left the hall where his entrance brought competing 
chants of pinochet pinochet and murderer murderer from 
the galleries 
upon the 74yearold army generals arrival for the ceremony a 
group of protesters tossed tomatoes stones and other objects at 
pinochets opentop limosine and shouted insults 
the car surrounded by military bodyguards momentarily sped up 
it bumped into a soldier on horseback but no injuries were 
reported 
a military band saluted pinochet as he left the ceremony held 
in a halffinished congressional palace being built to house an 
elected senate and house of deputies which also assumed power 
sunday under pinochet a military junta had acted as the 
legislature 
aylwin a 71yearold centrist politician won elections in 
december a christian democrat he is backed by a coalition of 17 
centrist and leftist parties 
he has vowed to restore respect for human rights and civil 
liberties and put more emphasis on social services for the poor 
but he plans no major changes in pinochets largely successful 
freemarket economic program 
sunday evening aylwin stood on the balcony of the presidential 
palace in santiago and urged chileans to put aside differences and 
unite behind democracy 
hundreds of thousands of jubilant chileans lined the route into 
santiago from valparaiso to cheer aylwins motorcade they packed 
the square in front of the presidential palace waving banners and 
chanting antipinochet slogans 
just before aylwin spoke some celebrants broke through a police 
line beside the palace and police scattered them with tear gas 
firstaid workers at a nearby hotel treated three people 
overwhelmed by the gas and one man who was bleeding from the head 
according to witnesses 
as evening approached people clashed with police up and down 
the capitals main boulevard authorities used tear gas and water 
cannons 
several people were seen bleeding or otherwise hurt and local 
radio stations reported about 20 people injured police hauled off 
some protesters but a police spokesman said he had no total for 
arrests 
pinochet was obliged to call the election when voters in a 1988 
referendum rejected an extension of his rule to 1997 
a clause in the 1980 constitution written by pinochets 
administration bars any new president from replacing him as army 
commander before 1998 aylwins term ends in 1994 
pinochet seized power in a bloody 1973 coup ending a long 
democratic tradition in chile he toppled the elected government of 
president salvador allende an avowed marxist during a period of 
economic and social turmoil 
the general began his last morning as president by receiving 
vice president dan quayle at his home in eastern santiago for a 
30minute private meeting 
pinochet supporters outside booed and jeered quayle gringo 
understand chile isnt for sale some chanted others held up 
signs saying go home 
pinochet has bitterly criticized the united states for 
supporting the push for democracy in chile and for cutting off 
weapons sales to chile in 1976 because of systematic human rights 
violations 
the arms embargo was proposed by sen edward m kennedy 
dmass who came to chile with quayle and attended the 
inauguration the embargo remains in effect 
this is the dawn of a new era quayle said in valparaiso 
democracy is here we hope it is here to stay 
im proud of what the chilean people have done kennedy said 
chile is the last in a series of south american countries to 
restore elected civilian rule in the last decade ending the 
dominance of authoritarian military leaders 
also in chile for the inauguration was joyce horman the widow 
of charles horman he was an american freelance journalist whose 
arrest and slaying during the 1973 coup inspired the movie 
missing 
according to the family and testimony collected by human rights 
groups horman was among many suspected dissidents held and 
executed at santiagos national stadium the military government 
has denied the allegations 
mrs horman of new york was invited by the new government and 
was expected to attend several events surrounding the inauguration 
in his first act as president aylwin decreed a pardon for all 
prisoners of conscience jailed by the pinochet government 
about 450 people are imprisoned for politically related crimes 
although most are charged in connection with guerrilla activity 
aylwin has said he opposes freeing anyone guilty of blood crimes 
and it was not immediately clear whom the pardon would affect 
as the change in government was taking place many foreign heads 
of state were arriving having delayed their visits until 
pinochets rule was formally ended they included presidents carlos 
andres perez of venezuela daniel ortega of nicaragua alan garcia 
of peru and prime ministers felipe gonzalez of spain and giulio 
andreotii of italy 
in santiago thousands of pinochet supporters lined a twomile 
stretch to bid him farewell before he attended a final military 
mass and flew off to the valparaiso ceremony 
you will return many chanted some wept openly the crowds 
repeatedly surged through police lines trying to touch the general 
who was in an open car 
the crowd grabbed and punched reporters accompanying pinochet 
who repeatedly has accused the press of unfairly attacking his rule 
and exaggerating human rights abuses 
in santiago small bombs were tossed from moving taxis at or 
near the homes of three military officers police said only minor 
damage was reported and no one claimed responsibility for the 
attacks 
leftist extremist groups have operated in chile for years but 
it is widely speculated that many of the attacks attributed to them 
are carried out by rightwing organizations trying to dramatize the 
leftist threat

vice president dan quayle after 
receiving an unfriendly welcome from supporters of gen augusto 
pinochet said sunday the outgoing military ruler assured him he 
would obey chiles new civilian government 
quayle meeting with pinochet on the last day of his 16year 
presidency quoted pinochet as saying there would be no problems 
between himself and president patricio aylwin when president 
aylwin gave an order that order would be complied with 
quayle was jeered by a throng of pinochet supporters when he 
arrived for a 35minute meeting at the generals walled residence 
go away they shouted son of a whore and pinochet 
pinochet 
quayle waved to them as he got out of his limousine apparently 
unaware that their shouts were unfriendly 
there was no violence but secret service agents canceled plans 
for quayle to hold a sidewalk news conference near the 
demonstrators following the pinochet meeting the agents spirited 
him away in his limousine as the crowd booed and made thumbsdown 
gestures 
meanwhile nicaraguan president daniel ortega who arrived in 
santiago sunday night said he would like to meet with quayle while 
here i think it will be a good opportunity to talk with vice 
president quayle he said at a news conference when asked his 
reaction to quayles previous statements that he was willing to 
hold such a meeting 
until ortega was voted out of office feb 25 and agreed to turn 
over power to his successor quayle and other bush administration 
officials had avoided direct highlevel talks with the ortega 
government although the two maintained formal diplomatic relations 
quayles chief of staff bill cristol attended the ortega news 
conference and said i suspect theyll quayle and ortega have a 
chance to talk one way or the other well what happens tomorrow 
both men are scheduled to attend a luncheon monday being hosted 
by aylwin for all the visiting government officials 
pinochet still heads the chilean military and quayle aides said 
the vice president told pinochet the united states expected him to 
respect the new civilian authority pinochet has said he would 
honor aylwins authority but has indicated he would not necessarily 
consider other government officials his superiors 
there was no debate he knew who the people elected he was 
willing to abide by the wishes of the people i found that most 
encouraging quayle told reporters later 
the vice president traveled to valparaiso for aylwins 
inauguration later in the day on the third day of his south 
american trip 
quayle said he emphasized to pinochet that his role in history 
is just beginning to be recorded 
how he complies with the peaceful transition of government is as 
important to pinochets historical legacy quayle said as the 
years of his presidency when widespread rightwing terror prevailed 
pinochets regime came under increasing us pressure to respect 
human rights and was subjected to a us embargo on military aid 
and sales 
us officials traveling with quayle said that unlike most of 
the foreign representatives who came for aylwins inauguration 
quayle and the bush administration had no qualms about a 
facetoface meeting with pinochet 
several other heads of state arranged go directly to the 
inaugural ceremony so they would not have to greet pinochet that 
included venezuelas president carlos andres perez and spanish 
prime minister philipe gonzalez both of whom quayle met friday in 
venezuela en route to santiago 
but quayle said sunday morning that the right thing is to pay 
respects to the current president 
us officials who participated in sundays meeting described 
pinochet as proud and unapologetic about the past but accepting of 
the election that brought his 16year rule to an end 
pinochet wore a white military jacket and waved briefly from his 
balcony to his cheering fans 
he was a very proud man hes proud of what hes done for the 
people of chile quayle said 
pinochet began the meeting by comparing himself to the reformers 
who are bringing democraticstyle government to in eastern europe 
sixteen years ago we did what is happening in europe now we 
werent understood what is happening with the berlin wall that 
happened to us 16 years ago pinochet said while posing for 
photographers prior to the quayle meeting 
pinochet overthrew the elected government of marxist president 
salvador allende in 1973 thousands of allendes supporters were 
rounded up and many were tortured or killed victims of the human 
rights abuses have vowed to press charges against the military once 
aylwin takes office 
a senior official traveling with quayle said the disposition of 
those matters would be up to chilean authorities 
the bush administration has emphasized human rights issues 
abroad but we didnt come here to debate the last 17 years 
the official said 
however quayle and the other us officials with him said the 
administration hopes to see progress under aylwin on the 
prosecution in the 1976 assassination in washington of orlando 
letelier a former allende cabinet minister the us government 
has pressed unsuccessfully for the prosecution of two chilean 
military officers in that bombing 
quayle said however that issue did not arise in his meeting 
with pinochet

and clashes that have left the government of this caribbean nation 
in turmoil haiti remained under interim military control sunday 
the day after avrils resignation 
soldiers firing from a speeding truck killed five people sunday 
radio report said elsewhere in the capital news photographers 
said they saw police officers fatally shoot a young passerby on a 
street and then prevent witnesses from trying to save his life 
the state hospital reported treating 100 people mostly for 
gunshot wounds over the past two days 
opposition politicians meanwhile sought guarantees from a 
caretaker administration that there would be a transition to 
democratic rule with early elections for a civilian government 
haiti one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere has been 
ruled mainly by force of arms since it gained independence from 
france in 1804 and it would be the first time in its history that 
the civilian opposition has ruled 
maj gen herard abraham the army chief of staff assumed 
control after avril stepped down saturday he promised to yield 
power within 72 hours to a panel led by a civilian president that 
would organize elections for october 
avril 52 was said to be at his home in suburban 
portauprince diplomatic sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said avril might leave the country in a matter of days 
unity assembly a coalition of 11 opposition parties and one 
civic group that was influential in avrils downfall had 
threatened an unlimited total paralysis of the country unless 
avril resigned by monday 
at a news conference sunday the group issued a statement 
expressing confidence that abraham would give up power 
however it called avril a public danger and said it would 
not lift the strike call until the ousted leader left haiti 
the french and us embassies say the matter of avrils 
departure is settled but only popular pressure will force him 
out said business leader antoine izmery a unity assembly member 
avril agreed to step down after negotiations reportedly 
involving the us and french embassies the roman catholic church 
and opposition political parties 
he had been in power 18 months his resignation marked the 
caribbean nations fifth change of government since february 1986 
when jeanclaude baby doc duvalier fled into exile in france 
and ended the 29year dictatorship of the duvalier family 
thousands of people streamed into the streets saturday to 
celebrate avrils downfall but scattered violence soon broke out 
roving gangs of youths reportedly ransacked the homes of at least 
three prominent sympathizers of the avril and duvalier regimes 
early sunday soldiers in a speeding pickup truck opened fire on 
pedestrians in downtown portauprince killing five people and 
then removed the bodies independent radio metropole said 
later the radio station said army maj renaud st bert was 
killed in a lottery booth in the suburb of delmas the report gave 
no details of the killing but said soldiers fired into the air to 
disperse a crowd there 
four people reportedly were killed last week in clashes with 
security forces radio reports saturday said soldiers killed eight 
youths who attacked the home of a special police agent in suburban 
portauprince 
opposition politicians complained of the violence in the 
capital they called for neighborhood selfdefense groups to 
protect people from marauding gunmen 
the opposition was at odds with the army over who would be named 
provisional president 
the armys choice was supreme court president gilbert austin 
63 who said saturday he expected to be appointed austin was 
appointed chief justice by avril last year after serving as the 
generals justice minister 
but unity assembly rejected him sunday it believes he has been 
too much under avrils influence the group has favored the courts 
vice president gabriel volcy but he is 74 and ill 
the new president is to appoint a cabinet approved by an 
11member advisory council made up of representatives of the roman 
catholic church civic human rights and opposition groups and one 
member of the army 
united assembly did not name an alternative choice for 
president but conservative politician gerard philippeauguste 
said our first priority is a new provisional head of state we 
dont have a government yet when we do we will tackle the problem 
of elections 
speculation that avril might be on his way out began growing 
monday after a soldier killed an 11yearold girl apparently 
accidentally during a demonstration the killing set off violent 
antigovernment protests across the country 
avril came to power in september 1988 in a coup by 
noncommissioned officers he promised to hand over power to a 
civilian government after elections in october but critics said a 
brutal crackdown in january on government critics made clear that 
avril intended instead to make himself a dictator 
after jeanclaude duvalier went into exile in 1986 he was 
replaced by lt gen henri namphy duvaliers army chief of staff 
and avrils predecessor 
a first election attempt in november 1987 was called off after 
thugs killed at least 34 voters in january 1988 leslie manigat a 
university professor was elected president but most opposition 
leaders refused to participate five months later namphy deposed 
him

the us attorneys office in chicago at the request of acting 
us attorney ira raphaelson the chicago tribune reported citing 
unidentified sources the suspension began monday the paper said

runkel a spokesman for the justice department in washington dc 
said he had no knowlege of it the tribune reported saturday 
neither johnson nor raphaelson returned telephone calls from the 
associated press on sunday 
the tape played at a detention hearing for five alleged 
mobsters was recorded sept 14 by an alleged 
bookieturnedgovernment informant who was wearing a recording 
device featured on the tape was rocco infelise a reputed crime 
syndicate gambling boss 
infelise spoke on the tape of making payoffs to law enforcement

a weary nelson mandela dined with 
president ali hassan mwinyi sunday before heading to sweden the 
last stop on a fivenation tour to visit supporters of his movement 
for black majority rule of south africa 
mandela 71 was to take a latenight flight from this east 
african capital to stockholm 
visibly tired mandela was seen by doctors saturday evening in 
the tanzanian town of morogoro home to about 2500 south african 
refugees and a school and training camp run by his african national 
congress guerrilla movement 
hes no longer a 41yearold solly rathabe an anc 
spokesman said sunday he was tired and we called doctors to 
check him hes not sick hes just tired 
rathabe denied reports that mandela would shorten his visit to 
sweden where he will visit anc president oliver tambo who is 
being treated for a stroke he suffered late last year rathabe said 
mandela will remain there a full five days and might even extend 
his stay 
a swedish foreign ministry spokesman said last week that mandela 
planned to cut short his visit the swedish national news agency 
attributed the reported move to his concern over recent violence in 
south africas black homelands that has taken more than 200 lives 
mandela was named deputy president of the anc shortly after his 
release last month after 27 years in south african prisons 
with tambo ill the appointment made mandela the virtual head of 
the anc the leading group in the fight against south africas 
white government and its policies of racial discrimination 
on his last day of a sixday visit in tanzania mandela toured 
the ancs solomon mahlangu freedom college in morogoro named for 
an anc guerrilla executed in 1979 he then flew by helicopter to 
dar es salaam where he had a private dinner with the president 
since being freed by south african president fw de klerk on 
feb 11 mandela has kept an exhausting schedule his current trip

an aide to a leading presidential 
candidate killed by drug traffickers claimed victory sunday in 
primary elections for the governing liberal partys presidential 
nomination 
no official results were released sunday night but all five of 
cesar gavirias political rivals conceded defeat in the nations 
first presidential primary 
the election and others for federal state and local office 
followed a night of political violence that left six people dead a 
leftist guerrilla from a group trying to disrupt the elections was 
killed sunday military officials said 
in the capital bogota the leader of a leftist group that laid 
down its arms this week won a surprising 9 percent of the vote in 
the mayors race according to an exit poll 
gaviria 43 won more than 58 percent of the votes cast in the 
race for the centrist liberal party presidential nomination a wide 
margin over his rivals according to an exit poll of 150000 
colombians conducted by the rcn radio network 
this backing from the colombian people makes me very happy 
gaviria told reporters at his bogota campaign headquarters i 
never thought i would win by such a wide margin 
gaviria faces the opposition conservative candidate rodrigo 
lloreda in the may 27 presidential elections 
party leaders previously selected the liberal democratic 
presidential candidate at a closed convention lloreda was chosen 
at a conservative party convention in november 
about 138 million colombians 18 years or older were eligible 
to vote sunday 
colombians elected all 313 members of the nations bicameral 
legislature 9042 city councilmen 1009 mayors and 421 state 
assembly members there were a total of 1009 polling districts 
the national voting registry did not release vote counts but 
said preliminary results indicated the liberal party would mantain 
its majority in both the house and the senate the party previously 
held 67 of the 114 senate seats and 111 of the 199 house seats 
rcn said late sunday that its count from regional election 
boards showed gaviria winning 601 percent of the early vote 
403611 to 671478 for his rivals gavirias closest opponent 
ernesto samper received 123917 votes or 1845 percent according 
to the rcn compilation 
gaviria an economist by training was managing the presidential 
campaign of sen luis carlos galan when the candidate was killed by 
drug traffickers on aug 18 
this was luis carlos galans victory gaviria declared late 
sunday 
the assassination touched off a war between colombian drug lords 
and the usbacked government of president virgilio barco 
barco cannot run for reelection under the constitution the 
presidential term is four years 
gaviria decided to seek the liberal partys nomination several 
weeks after galan was killed and pledged to carry out galans 
reform platform if elected he has also promised to carry out 
barcos antidrug campaign 
gaviria is associated in the minds of many colombians with a 
campaign to open the countrys political system to more 
participation by the masses 
the only fatal incident during the elections occurred when 
police shot and killed a member of the leftist national liberation 
army in the southeastern town of puerto nidia said gen nelson 
mejia the commander of the countrys armed forces 
leftist guerrillas attacked voting booths in at least six towns 
and prevented balloting in four towns mejia said in a radio 
interview 
the national liberation army has carried on a campaign of 
violence in the last two months to disrupt elections in several of 
the countrys rural regions 
late saturday members of the rebel group assassinated two 
police officers guarding voting precincts in chaparral a town 125 
miles south of bogota according to tolima state police 
nevertheless elections went ahead in the town without further 
incident according to rcn 
in his campaign for the presidential nomination gaviria 
supported barcos antidrug war but he indicated that his 
administration after reforming the countrys judicial system may 
try traffickers in colombia rather than extradite them to the 
united states 
barcos administration has extradited 14 drug suspects since it 
intensified a campaign against the countrys cocaine cartels 
following galans death 
traffickers responded with 262 terrorist attacks mostly 
bombings that killed 209 people 
they called a unilateral truce in the drug war on jan 17 and 
have said they are willing to surrender their illicit business and 
themselves if the government scraps its extradition policy and 
promises to try them in colombia 
barco aware that traffickers have been able to evade colombian 
justice by bribing and killing judges has publicly refused to 
include the policy in any negotiations 
the liberal partys candidate for mayor of bogota juan martin 
caicedo was expected to recapture the capitals top post from the 
conservative party according to preliminary results 
former leaders of a leftist guerrilla group april 19 movement 
or m19 campaigned in many races saturday hours after signing a 
treaty with the government that ended their 16year insurgency rcn 
said carlos pizarro the leader of the group won 9 percent of the 
vote in the bogota mayors race 
the liberals were expected to lose mayors races to the 
conservative party in two other cities cali and barranquilla 
according to the rcn exit poll cali is home to colombia 
secondlargest cocaine cartel 
according to preliminary results a majority of voters approved 
a nonbinding referendum to call a convention to reform the 
countrys constitution changes would be aimed at increasing 
political participation through voting reform and reducing 
political patronage

the chairman of the taxwriting house ways and 
means committee on sunday called for a oneyear government spending 
freeze including social security benefits and new taxes on 
gasoline alcohol tobacco and the wealthy 
rep dan rostenkowski dill said his proposal would reduce 
the federal deficit by more than half a trillion dollars over the 
next five years producing slight government surpluses in 1994 and 
1995 
just in fiscal 1991 which begins next october rostenkowski 
said his package would cut the deficit from 161 billion as 
projected by the congressional budget office to 106 billion the 
next year the deficit would fall to 39 billion under his 
proposal instead of 124 billion as projected by the cbo he said 
rostenkowski estimated the 1991 spending freeze alone 
including no costofliving adjustments or colas in social 
security and other programs except those covering the very poor 
would save 105 billion over five years

two months into their switch from 
communism to capitalism poles have more to buy with less money 
inflation and production are down and unemployment is up thats 
just as expected the planners say 
deputy premier leszek balcerowicz who devised the program said 
there were no surprises so far and his assistants in the finance 
ministry agreed 
i can see absolutely no reason why we should change our 
policy marek dabrowski undersecretary of finance told the 
government newspaper rzeczpospolita 
on jan 1 the solidarityled government put an economic plan 
into effect that involved a sharp initial increase in prices 
holding down wages devaluing the currency and making it 
convertible and stopping subsidies and easy loans to state 
enterprises 
its first stage is intended to make prices realistic and bring 
inflation of 700 percent a year under control with a tight money 
policy 
in the second stage the goal is to reform the economy now 80 
percent stateowned this would be accomplished by forcing 
inefficient companies to shape up or close selling state concerns 
to private owners breaking up monopolies and removing barriers to 
free enterprise 
when the plan took effect coal prices rose 600 percent 
overnight electricity 400 percent gasoline 200 percent and food 
100 percent to 200 percent 
costs of food manufactured goods and services continued to 
climb until late january as the higher prices of energy and raw 
materials were passed on 
figures for january showed average prices up nearly 79 percent 
from december 
communist governments had raised prices but none was as 
successful in holding down wages families had to adjust instantly 
to what the government statistics office said was a 43 percent 
decline in real incomes in january 
by the programs third week a fundamental change became 
evident prices reached levels at which consumers were unable or 
unwilling to buy goods 
suddenly there were no more lines at gas stations getting a 
table in a restaurant was easy and international telephone lines 
were open more frequently 
furniture stores empty before filled with merchandise butcher 
shops were full of sausages and a bicycle could be bought without 
waiting weeks 
stores cut back orders because of full inventories producers 
became desperate for cash 
there were no more subsidies or government bailouts and the new 
loan rates were too high producers and manufacturers started to 
bypass the middleman and sell directly to the public 
trucks loaded with meat eggs butter sugar shoes clothes 
plumbing supplies tvs and other products now park outside stores 
and markets 
after decades of rudeness from employees of state stores 
consumers welcome the competition for their trade 
i prefer to buy here because i can at least choose and 
complain if i dont like a piece said krystyna wilczyk shopping 
at a meat truck outside the hala mirowska market 
partly in response to low prices on the trucks food stores 
began cutting prices the price of an egg had risen to the 
equivalent of 6 cents but soon fell to 3 cents 
many people still prefer the trucks even if its not that 
much cheaper anymore at least you know its fresh jolanta 
budzak said outside the hala mirowska market 
some stores are having sales a western phenomenon new to 
poland a major department store introduced another novelty 
letting customers pay in installments 
inflation is dropping from its peak in late january wojciech 
misiag another undersecretary of finance told reporters march 2 
that prices rose only about 1 percent a week in february and 
similar figures were expected for march 
deputy premier balcerowicz wrote cautiously in midfebruary 
we are relatively close to the goal of suppressing inflation but 
it is too early for fanfares it is necessary to keep the harsh 
rules in force 
tight money and slow sales have squeezed manufacturers unsold 
merchandise is backing up in their warehouses 
government figures indicate production fell in january and 
february the slowdown is being reflected in worker layoffs 
unemployment was virtually unknown under communist rule but 
55000 workers were registered as jobless in january and more than 
152000 in february 
benefits for 400000 unemployed were budgeted under the new 
program but the government now says the number may surpass 17 
million in a work force of about 18 million 
lowered production has been criticized but manufacturers and 
farmers say they cannot maintain output without lowercost loans 
although the government says easing up now would invite renewed 
inflation balcerowicz said in a recent interview while some 
recession was inevitable and we expected it we must defend 
ourselves from a really deep recession 
another criticism voiced by solidarity leader lech walesa is 
that balcerowicz has been too slow in converting the economy to 
private ownership legislation to accomplish the conversion has 
been written and will go to parliament soon 
the government has devalued the zloty by 38 percent to 9500 to 
the dollar and the national bank proclaimed full convertibility 
jan 2 supported by a 1 billion loan from western countries 
for decades the real value of the of the zloty was onefourth 
the official rate 
traders have accepted the level and no black market has emerged 
to sell the polish currency more cheaply the national bank said it 
had not used any of the 1 billion fund because the market remained 
in balance 
our guess was perfect balcerowicz said success in this 
respect was extremely important for the whole economic program 
including prices because a stable exchange rate means prices 
of imported goods do not go up

one woman reported canvassing shops for a 
halfhour to find the right coin to make a oneminute telephone 
call 
another had to paste stamps across most of the front and half 
the back of the envelope to amass enough postage for her letter 
to london 
then there are the new public transit ticket machines rendered 
virtually useless because the fare rose to 480 zlotys the chances 
of finding 24 of the largest coin available 20 zlotys are about 
nil 
and so it goes as poland adjusts its money and postage to the 
real prices of doing business 
tripledigit inflation has accompanied a massive overhaul of the 
economy which included removing government budget subsidies long 
used to keep prices artificially low 
the largest bill in circulation is worth 200000 zlotys or 21 
and was issued in november a 100000 zloty note worth 1050 went 
into circulation last month 
higher denomination postage stamps are being created with the 
largest now worth 1000 zlotys or nine cents about onesixth the 
cost of an express letter to london 
but until the larger denomination stamps are produced and 
circulated extensive licking and pasting will be required 
tales of post office chaos are widely traded including one 
about the man sent home to repackage his goods so the box would be 
big enough to accommodate all the stamps the new box he returned 
with weighed more and it was not big enough to take the additional 
stamps 
with 20 zlotys worth 02 cents coins have been rendered 
virtually obsolete except for use in pay telephones 
when the price of a call was raised last year from five zlotys 
to 20 the pay telephones were adjusted to accept only one of the 
three sizes of 20 zloty coins in circulation 
we did not know it would be so hard to find them said 
maciej zdzieniecki spokesman for the polish telephone company 
it was a surprise we adjusted the phones to this new 20 zloty 
coin and it turned out they were in short supply 
the lack of proper coins for pay phones is no small problem in a 
country where home telephones are scarce reports from the world 
bank and other sources put the number of telephones at 10 to 12 per 
100 people the lowest in europe except for albania 
it is impossible to make a call sighed iwona terlikowska a 
psychologist waiting at the bank of pay phones in warsaws main 
post office 
a young man with no telephone at home said he had waited 30 
minutes to get a bill changed to 20 zloty coins at the post office 
you have to get here very early to get change or they run 
out he said 
a black market has developed in the 20 zloty coins although 
zdzieniecki said reports they were selling for up to 400 zlotys 
apiece were exaggerated 
the telephone company is hurrying to introduce tokens but the 
spokesman said delays at the mint have postponed production

agricultural researchers would spend more time 
looking for ways to help farmers cut their use of chemicals under a 
bill by sen tom daschle dsd 
contending the government has disregarded efforts to promote 
sustainable agriculture sometimes called organic farming 
daschle wants to broaden the agriculture research and extension 
services environmental goals as part of the 1990 farm bill 
daschles proposal would require the agriculture department to 
direct at least 30 percent of its competitive research grants 
toward using crop rotation and mechanical cultivation techniques 
rather than chemicals and pesticides for controlling weeds 
predators and insects 
cosponsored by senate agriculture committee chairman patrick 
leahy dvt it also would establish boards for coordinating and 
assessing research needs and activities 
the secretary should take a proactive role on research 
extension and education on sustainable agriculture the proposal 
says 
the bush administrations 1990 farm bill proposals recognize an 
increased interest in sustainable agriculture but recommend no 
initiatives beyond the rather small research program now under way 
the bill will establish the nations agriculture policy for the 
next five years 
a report last week by congress offike of technology assessment 
said the agriculture department needs to focus more on sustainable 
agriculture and change its traditional research and extension 
service approach 
agriculture research is a form of social planning said 
chuck hassebrook a policy analyst with the sustainable agriculture 
coalition a group supporting daschles bill 
decisions about how public research dollars are spent and what 
farming systems technologies are developed go far in shaping life 
in rural communities hassebrook said

the battle to reform the futures markets 
returns to washington after last weeks gathering of the industrys 
largest trade group 
a house committee vote is scheduled for tuesday on a measure to 
give the securities and exchange commission limited jurisdiction 
over stockindex futures 
and sen alan dixon dill says he will soon introduce a bill 
creating a bridge between the sec and the commodity futures trading 
commission which regulates futures trading although the agencies 
would retain their separate jurisdictions 
such controversial issues as dual trading and user fees also got 
a workout during the threeday annual meeting of the futures 
industry association here 
congressional debate on those matters should heat up after 
easter when the senate is expected to vote on reauthorization of 
the cftc 
rep edward markey dmass one of about 20 federal legislators 
who spoke at the meeting said saturday that the house energy and 
commerce committee would vote tuesday on his bill giving the sec 
temporary jurisdiction over stockindex futures during periods of 
extraordinary volatility such as when the dow jones industrial 
average plunges 200 points in an hour 
the sec has long sought jurisdiction over stockindex futures 
financial instruments regulated by the cftc that allow investors to 
trade contracts representing the cash value of stocks without ever 
owning the stocks themselves 
some experts believe stockindex futures trading causes 
volatility in the stock market especially when they are used in 
computerdriven program trades involving huge amounts of stocks and 
futures contracts 
markey who chairs an energy subcommittee on finance has been 
critical of the cftc in the past he called his proposal a step 
toward a more permanent solution which he hopes to bring about as 
a moderator in negotiations between the securities and futures 
industries 
in the end some central responsibility is the goal he said 
the 1987 stock market crash and the unusually high degree of 
market volatility since then have resulted in a number of measures 
aimed at better coordinating the movements of the stock and futures 
markets 
dixon who chairs a senate subcommittee on regulatory affairs 
said this intermarket harmonization would be enhanced by his 
plan to make one sec commissioner a member of the cftc and one cftc 
commissioner a member of the sec 
this kind of crossmembership will help further encourage the 
kind of regulatory cooperation we have already seen and will 
institutionalize their working relationship he said 
dixon a friend of chicagos powerful futures exchanges 
suggested that crossmembership also would quiet critics who say 
the cftc is too close to the futures industry to be an effective 
regulator 
markey expressed opposition to dixons plan saying he would 
prefer a more formalized resolution of the problem

the pyramid companies will buy five bonwit 
teller stores in an agreement that is likely to ensure the survival 
of the elegant chains name according to a published report 
sale of the stores owned by financially troubled lj hooker 
corp must be approved by a federal bankruptcy court the new york 
times reported in sundays editions 
lj hooker which filed for protection from its creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code last august owned b 
altman amp co another elegant new yorkbased retail chain hooker 
liquidated six altman stores in january after the stores failed to 
draw acceptable bids 
the bonwit stores pyramid intends to buy are located in boston 
buffalo manhasset ny and short hills nj two others will 
operate in cincinnati and columbia sc the times said 
lj hooker plans to try to sell the remaining nine bonwit 
stores the times said 
pyramid is a syracusebased private company that operates 16 
malls in new york and massachusetts 
the purchase price was not disclosed but the times noted it was 
a cash transaction and did not involve any debt estimates within 
the retail industry put the pricetag on the deal at about 17 
million the times said 
bonwit was founded in 1895 as a small manhattan millinery shop 
and grew into one of americas most respected fashion retailers 
but it had not earned a profit for at least a decade partly 
because its corporate owners were reluctant to pay for improvements 
and expansion 
retail executives said they expect pyramid to sell more 
moderately priced clothes at bonwit than what has been sold there 
in the past 
lj hooker is the us arm of australias hooker corp the 
sydneybased parent company last autumn revealed severe cash flow 
problems due to high interest rates and a sagging real estate 
market in australia the company now is being liquidated

sunday providing the first major meeting ground for west german 
firms rushing to link with partners in east germany since the 
collapse of communist control 
the spring edition of the twiceyearly fair which focuses on 
industrial machines and electrical equipment comes at a time when 
both germanys are moving steadily toward de facto economic unity 
few cooperation agreements are expected to be signed however 
before the march 18 parliamentary elections in east germany 
small and middlesized western firms are especially prominent at 
the weeklong fair which east german economic minister christa 
luft dubbed a marketplace of new chances 
west german companies increased their presence by about 25 
percent over last year accounting for some 1000 of the shows 
9000 displays by manufacturers from 60 countries 
hans modrow communist premier of the east german caretaker 
government rejected recent west german charges that his country is 
not moving quickly enough toward a market economy 
there is no way modrow could act as a brake the premier 
said as he walked through the fair 
modrow appealed to west german industrialists to work together 
with his countrys struggling firms have faith in us he said

applications after last falls peaceful popular revolt which 
forced out hardline communist leaders opened east germanys 
western border and set the economically moribund country on course 
for unity with its rich powerful neighbor 
west german firms are looking for east german partners to tap 
the countrys skilled workers and gain access to what is expected 
to be a major consumer market east german companies run for 40 
years under a statecontrolled planned economy are hoping for 
injections of western technology and capital 
several dozen west german banks which will provide much of the 
credits needed for investments in east germany are also plugging 
their services at the leipzig fair the banks have already begun to 
set up offices in east germany

up its neighbors economy will stem the influx of worried and 
dissatisfied east germans that is straining west germanys social 
services

the federal government still will have a 
very major role in transportation programs despite a bush 
administration proposal that would shift more spending to the state 
and local level transportation secretary samuel skinner said 
sunday 
skinner whose national transportation plan last week was 
criticized by transport industries and some members of congress 
defended the proposed increase in user fees and local gas taxes 
that would raise costs for travelers and shippers 
interviewed on nbctvs meet the press skinner said 
decreases in federal funding would apply primarily to projects that 
benefit local economies and private businesses which would be 
asked to pay a greater share 
in some parts of the system where the local component is very 
important and where the cost of that system is being expanded 
because we have to build more facilities for that local 
development we think local development can pay a bigger share 
skinner said 
the federal governments role is still going to be very very 
major he said adding that twothirds of the 28 billion federal 
transportation budget goes for infrastructure projects 
skinner said more than 33 states already have raised gas taxes 
or found some independent funding source for transportation the 
9cent federal gas tax will continue to support transportation he 
said 
we dont have a mess on our hands skinner said referring 
to complaints of congestion in air and land transportation were 
trying to avoid a major crisis 
skinner predicted that within the next 10 years the busy 
shorthaul routes between major us cities would have highspeed 
rail systems paid for by private developers who then pass the 
costs on to the user 
he said commuters have indicated they are willing to pay for 
better service at the local level 
that will give us more funds to expand all over the country on 
a national basis to deal with these pockets of congestion he 
said

in the beginning there was cocacola 
but these days store shelves are stocked with cocacola coke 
classic caffeinefree coke classic caffeinefree coke diet coke 
caffeinefree diet coke cherry coke and diet cherry coke 
and last week officials of the atlantabased soft drink maker 
confirmed that cocacola also known as new coke may be renamed 
coke ii the newly named version will be test marketed later this 
year 
if coke ii catches on there will no longer be a drink called 
simply cocacola 
as incredible as that may seem given the enormous power and 
recognition of the cocacola brand name coke spokesman randy 
donaldson said its not a big deal to us 
donaldson rejected the notion that there would be no more 
cocacola if coke ii takes off 
we disagree he said there would be eight products with 
cocacola in the name 
ever since the 1982 introduction of diet coke cocacola has 
pursued the socalled megabrand concept of marketing its soft 
drinks that approach intensified after the 1985 introduction of 
the reformulated new coke and the consumer firestorm that resulted 
in the return of the original formula now called coke classic 
instead of selling one flagship brand store shelves are crammed 
with a large family of coke products cocacolas main competitor 
purchase nybased pepsico inc has adopted a similar approach 
there currently are seven products with pepsi cola in the name 
the numbers say the concept works according to jesse meyers 
publisher of the industry newsletter beverage digest 
in 1985 meyers said all coke products held 388 percent of the 
us soft drink market pepsis had 292 percent five years later 
the coke line including those such as sprite that do not have 
cocacola in the name has increased to 411 percent and pepsi 
to 311 percent 
let me put that in perspective meyers said each 
percentage point is worth 444 million at retail 
according to donaldson sales of products with the cocacola 
name account for 33 percent of the soft drink market in 1981 
original cocacola then the only product with coke in its name 
had a 25 percent market share he said 
the segmentation in the market has taken place because the 
consumers have said they wanted it he said 
donaldson said it is less important for there to remain a single 
product merely called coke than to put the brand name to its best 
use by spreading it out 
the strategy is to utilize the strongest trademark in the 
world and give the consumers what they want which is to say 
caffeinefree diet and cherry versions of our drink donaldson 
said the trademark is so strong that it clearly supports a wide 
variety of products 
some analysts including meyers say a successful coke ii tryout 
would pave the way for coke classic to drop the classic from 
its name coke classic is the bestselling soft drink and most 
people who purchase it just call it coke anyway 
but donaldson who said one of the aims of the coke ii 
experiment was to diminish confusion between cocacola and coke 
classic denied such a move was being considered 
despite all the hoopla last week over the news about coke ii 
the name switch is not necessarily a sure thing said emanuel 
goldman a soft drink industry analyst with paine webber inc in 
san francisco 
theyre going to tread gently goldman said recalling the 
now legendary backfire when the original cocacola was replaced by 
new coke they dont want to add insult to injury by doing 
something wrong with new coke 
goldman said that although new coke is a relatively weak seller 
with 14 percent of the market compared to no 1 coke classics 
20 percent it still generates about 621 million a year in retail 
sales for the company

a pennsylvania publisher plans to provide food 
for soviet minds along with bettertasting sausage for russian 
bodies as part of a new joint venture in the soviet union 
rodale press inc recently announced it has teamed up with two 
soviet partners to publish russianlanguage magazines and books in 
the soviet union where the government has been taking steps to 
encourage private enterprise 
as part of the deal the emmaus pabased publisher of 
magazines such as prevention runners world and organic gardening 
plans to contribute machinery to produce sausage and processed 
meats that will be sold for hard currency needed for paper and 
printing 
it is one of the more unusual joint ventures as western 
publishers move rapidly in the wake of improved ussoviet 
relations to produce russianlanguage magazines that american 
advertisers can use to reach a new market 
mcgrawhill incs business week magazine plans to publish a 
russianlanguage edition every other month starting in september in 
the soviet union 
readers digest association inc is considering publishing a 
russianlanguage edition of its flagship magazine already 
available in 39 languages 
vgp inc a bostonbased company that has previously published 
tourism and travel magazines has teamed up with a soviet partner 
to publish the americansoviet medical market journal 
the quarterly magazine which includes summaries of articles 
that have appeared in western medical journals was sent for free 
late last month to 10000 medical research facilities labs 
physicians scientists and public health officials in the soviet 
union 
the first issue ran 44 pages with 13 pages of advertising 
including sponsors such as johnson amp johnson pfizer inc and 
upjohn co 
kompass intercontinental publishing also based in boston 
recently launched two russianlanguage quarterlies and plans a 
third for the fall 
in a partnership with a russian publisher kompass is 
distributing moscow international business in the soviet union and 
expects to sell 100000 copes by subscription or at news kiosks 
the first issue was 52 pages with 11 pages of advertising from 
both american and russian companies the magazine is designed to 
help soviets do business with the west 
kompass also is producing music international a retitled 
version of the russianlanguage magazine music in the ussr in a 
partnership with the russian agency that brings performers into the 
spoviet union 
the quarterly magazine covers classical music and 25000 copies 
are expected to be sold at soviet newsstands 
procter amp gamble and mca classics records were among the four 
advertisers in the first 48page issue according to john m rose 
kompass chief executive 
in late summer kompass plans to begin publishing a 
russianlanguage popular music magazine koncert with a planned 
circulation of 100000 in the soviet union an englishlanguage 
version will be sold here 
but some advertising executives question whether buying space in 
russianlanguage magazines makes sense since the russian ruble is 
not easily converted into other currencies many western products 
are not available in russia and circulation figures cannot be 
independently verified 
associate publisher richard mills of the americansoviet medical 
market journal said advertisers arent looking for immediate sales 
but want to establish a beachhead 
the hewlettpackard medical products group of andover mass 
bought a twopage ad that explained in straightforward terms what 
the company does 
spokesman joseph laskowski said the company wanted to establish 
itself as a credible manufacturer and someone who has been 
supportive so that its salesmen can get right to business when 
the market is opened 
rodales first russianlanguage magazine will be a bimonthly 
called the new farmer which expects a circulation of 200000 when 
it debuts this fall 
it is designed mainly for the millions of people who rent small 
plots of land and use organic methods of farming according to 
robert rodale chairman of the privatelyheld rodale press 
the magazine will include original material and reprints or 
condensations of stories from american farm magazines he said the 
original copy will be from rodale staffers and the staff of the 
russian publishing partner 
the venture plans to publish a russianlanguage version of 
prevention magazine in 1991 and has begun translating a number of 
selfhelp and howto books rodale has published in the united 
states 
but rodale who is interested in agricultural research and wants 
to replicate in russia the rodale research center in operation in 
maxatawny pa included the state farm at kudinova as a partner in 
the venture as well 
the farm produces about 60000 pigs a year but has primitive 
processing equipment he said rodale said his company plans to buy 
about 250000 in meat processing equipment for the farm which can 
use it to produce higher grades of processed meats and sausage 
proceeds from the meat sales will be used to pay for publishing 
expenses and rodale said advertising sale profits will be used 
partly to fund the russian agricultural research center

as the paper industry celebrates its tricentennial this week it 
returns to the lessons of william rittenhouse americas first 
paper maker and in essence the first recycler to set its 
strategy for a new era 
rittenhouse traveled the globe 300 years ago scrounging for used 
rags to haul back to his mill on the banks of the wissahickson 
creek outside philadelphia laboriously he beat the old rags into 
pulp and fashioned the nations first sheets of paper 
with his small mill rittenhouse planted the seed that has grown 
into the nations 10th largest manufacturing industry producing 
112 billion worth of products last year ranging from puzzles and 
postage stamps to shoe boxes and home insulation 
but as the nations 6400 paper plants and mills churn out 76 
million tons of paper and paperboard products annually the 
industry is pressured by a nation bent on recycling 
just as the electronic age two decades ago threatened to dwindle 
the need for paper some have argued that recycling will 
drastically limit the markets for traditional paper products 
but americas paper makers are beginning to prowl the nations 
dumpsters for discarded paper to recycle into new products much as 
rittenhouse searched for old rags to recycle 
we see recycling as a big opportunity says red cavaney 
president of the american paper institute the trade association 
for makers of pulp paper and paperboard the institute kicks off a 
threeday anniversary forum on monday in new york 
in the era of the green consumer demand for products made 
of waste paper is so great that by 1995 it will lead to the 
consumption of all waste paper that can be reasonably recovered 
in usable condition according to a new study by franklin 
associates ltd commissioned by the paper industry 
last month cavaney announced the industry intended to be part 
of the solid waste solution and was setting a goal of 40 
percent paper recycling by 1995 also by that year the us paper 
industry expects to use waste paper for 30 percent of its raw 
material in the production of new paper and paperboard 
with total paper use expected to be just over 100 million tons 
by 1995 that would represent a recycling goal of about 40 million 
tons according to figures supplied by the institute 
already for example the insides of cereal boxes are last 
years recycled newspapers cardboard boxes containing televisions 
and vcrs are recycled waste paper and before the decade is out 
the drywall in peoples homes could be yesterdays disposable 
diapers 
cavaney is counting on such innovations to meet the latest 
environmental challenges and carry the industry into the next 
century 
in the 1970s the biggest threat to the industry was thought to 
be the proliferation of computers which some believed would lead 
to paperless offices 
instead the demand for paper has exploded says hugh hansen a 
former executive with weyerhaeuser paper co 
the demand for printing and writing paper used largely for 
computer printouts increased 70 percent between 1978 and 1988 
while the growth of the economy at large increased by 28 percent 
according to the american paper institute 
the proliferation of computers has actually spurred the need 
for paper rather than reduced it says hansen president of 
friends of historic rittenhousetown the rural village outside 
philadelphia which is the site of the nations first paper mill 
what seems to happen is people find more uses rather than less 
for paper 
in fact as computers cut production time to a fraction 
business executives decided they needed four or five drafts of 
documents instead of one or two says cavaney 
people still prefer to deal with paper rather than the screen 
on a computer cavaney says 
the arrival of modern facsimile machines has spawned a growth 
market in thermal paper which is expected to continue expanding

the securities and exchange commission already 
has gotten 500 million out of drexel burnham lambert so who 
better than the sec to pan for more money from the drying river bed 
of the wall street firm 
well according to the us trustees office the bank of china 
bank negara of indonesia copenhagen handelsbank and 14 other 
creditors are better candidates than the sec to sit on the 
committee investigating the drexel bankruptcy 
the sec which has the largest claim against drexel was denied 
a spot on the official committee of unsecured creditors and the 
goverment regulator has come up against opposition from other 
creditors in its appeal to join the group 
the committees goal is to recoup as much money as possible for 
more than 2000 creditors 
drexel still owes the sec 150 million of a 650 million 
settlement of securities fraud charges the unpaid amount would 
compensate individual investors who can prove they were harmed by 
drexels actions 
but the sec was left off the committee when it was formed last 
month it has filed a motion in us bankruptcy court to gain 
admission which would have to be granted by the us trustee 
administering the case 
the creditors havent exactly rallied to the secs cause after 
two weeks of negotiations creditors committee attorney marc 
kirschner said in court friday im not really confident this one 
can be resolved 
in other words the committee doesnt want the sec hanging 
around 
i think the creditors are distrustful of the sec said a 
lawyer for a large creditor not on the committee i think there 
is a view that the sec is the bad guy the entity that brought 
drexel down and they dont want to be on the same committee as 
them 
the sec initiated the investigation of drexel in 1987 after the 
firm was linked to suspicious behavior involving takeover deals 
drexel last year agreed to settle the charges by pleading guilty 
to six felonies and paying a 650 million fine drexels business 
suffered because of the charges and was further hurt by a decline 
in the junkbond market it helped create 
the parent company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 
feb 13 after defaulting on 100 million in shortterm loans and 
failing to obtain new credit drexel subsidiaries which are not in 
the bankruptcy case have liquidated tens of billions of dollars of 
assets since 
the request by the sec is unprecedented bankruptcy experts say 
the us bankruptcy code prohibits government agencies from sitting 
on creditor panels but an amendment permits such participation if 
the agency is acting on behalf of a person 
the sec argued in legal papers that it qualifies since the money 
it is owed by drexel is earmarked for individual investors a 
hearing on the issue is set for tuesday 
i have attempted to work out a compromise with the committee 
on this issue and we have not been able to agree sec chief 
counsel richard kirby said 
creditors have said they will go after the 500 million drexel 
already has paid the government but kirby said that shouldnt pose 
a conflict because the sec could remove itself from discussions 
about the money 
he added the sec believes theres no claim to the 500 
million creditors can seek back debt payments made up to 90 days 
before a bankruptcy filing or up to one year for payments to 
company insiders kirby said neither applies to the drexel payment 
which was made last september 
another reason for exclusion could be that the secs regulatory 
role would prove chilling to potential asset sales or 
investigations of old transactions with the sec in the room some 
participants may be reluctant to talk about relations with drexel 
our concern on the creditors committee is getting as much 
money from the estate as possible not necessarily enforcing the 
securities regulations said steven felderstein attorney for the 
california public employees retirement system unlike the sec the 
system was granted a nonvoting role on the committee after failing 
to be appointed initially 
on the other hand the secs encyclopedic knowledge of drexel 
and the securities industry could aid in scrutinizing the firms 
past and present actions 
the sec has an apparent ally in us bankruptcy judge howard 
buschman iii who said in court friday it is very hard to 
imagine keeping the largest creditor off the committee 
regardless of what hat they wear

members of a paperworkers union who lost 
their jobs during a bitter 16month strike against international 
paper co voted sunday on a contract offered to hundreds of their 
replacements 
i think everybody expects the same outcome a no vote 
said ronald roy a member of the united paperworkers international 
union local 14 
union officials said results wouldnt be released until monday 
after the unions national headquarters and the company had been 
notified of the results 
roy who was recalled to his old job at the mill last week is 
among 137 mill employees who are members of either the united 
paperworkers union or the international brotherhood of firemen and 
oilers according to company officials about 750 other members who 
claim rights to be rehired also were eligible to vote 
most of the roughly 1100 hourly mill employees who would be 
affected by the contract were hired as replacement workers during a 
sometimes violent strike in this central maine town that ended in 
october 1988 the work force includes about 70 former union members 
who crossed the picket lines during the strike 
the union represents both the present and past mill workers and 
all are allowed to vote 
international paper spokesman brad peters called sundays vote 
a unique set of circumstances to some extent unprecedented

lifethreatening two people underwent surgery for shrapnel wounds 
in the throat and side and all seven were taken to hospitals

initial reports to greyhound were that eight were hurt said 
george gravley a spokesman at the companys dallas headquarters 
the union representing greyhound drivers went on strike 1 weeks

striking driver was crushed to death by a bus driven by a 
replacement driver on a picket line in redding calif earlier in 
the strike 
there were no immediate arrests 
asked if the incident appeared strikerelated weintraub said 
i think it is i dont know why anybody would want to shoot a 
greyhound bus 
bill nicholson executive board member of the jacksonville local 
of the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions said he 
doubted a striker was to blame 
as far as im concerned it wasnt one of our strikers 
theyve been like choirboys nicholson said 
said dallas union spokesman jeffrey nelson we believe its 
important for the public to understand that this is a strike 
against the company not against the traveling public 
the driver uninjured when the shot was fired shortly before 8 
pm est was able to bring the bus to a safe stop weintraub said 
the bus carrying 41 passengers from jacksonville to daytona beach 
was on us route 1 about 10 miles south of jacksonville when the 
shot apparently was fired from the interstate 95 overpass 
greyhound said earlier that buses were again running sunday to 
120 communities that hadnt been served since drivers walked off 
their jobs at the only nationwide bus line 
the company was able to add routes to spots in the southeast and 
southwest sunday after a new class of drivers graduated from 
training courses said greyhound spokeswoman elizabeth hale 
the spokeswoman didnt know how many of the 9500 communities 
the bus line served before the strike were being served as of 
sunday night 
on saturday greyhound carried 38 percent of the number of 
passengers it did on the same saturday a year ago and operated 
onethird of the number of departing buses ms hale said figures 
for sunday would reflect the larger number of routes but were 
unavailable until monday she said 
the 120 communities had been without service since the union 
which represents 6300 drivers and more than 3000 office and 
maintenance workers went on strike march 2 
officials at the unions headquarters in phoenix and at offices 
in dallas and washington dc didnt respond to telephone calls 
sunday 
big cities had been served by greyhound virtually since the 
strike began the additions sunday included smaller cities and 
small towns along routes between metropolitan areas ms hale said 
our goal is to rebuild our passenger service to a full 
national network by the end of this month said greyhound 
president frank schmieder 
the expansion sunday included two transcontinental routes one 
from washington dc along a southern route to los angeles and 
one from new york to los angeles along a northern route 
on saturday federal mediators called the union to washington 
for a meeting monday the company may be called to a separate 
meeting a greyhound negotiator said
