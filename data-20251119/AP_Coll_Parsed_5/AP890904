in a quiet though dramatic 
reversal of policy brazil is now accepting foreign offers of help 
to save the amazon wilderness the worlds largest from destruction 
the government which early this year rebuffed a united nations 
proposal to swap some of its 112billion foreign debt for 
investments in amazon protection programs recently told britain and 
west germany it would work with them to curb damage mostly by 
burning to the huge rain forest 
in august brazil accepted italian and canadian planes for local 
authorities to police the jungle then it said yes to a project 
backed by the united nations and by private american companies to 
establish a 11 millionacre protected forest area to produce rubber 
and nuts 
the moves represent a sharp reversal in president jose sarneys 
amazon policy which in the past considered offers by foreigners as 
attempts to take control of the rain forest from brazil 
we cannot accept this form of colonialism which they want to 
create here sarney told reporters in march after france the 
netherlands and two us congressional delegations suggested trading 
some brazilian foreign debt the third worlds largest for amazon 
preservation 
but analysts say subtle shifts in political social and economic 
spheres are forcing the government to change its mind 
a bit of the persecution complex that took over the government 
which led to xenophobic and irrational behavior is being overcome 
opening the road to new initiatives wrote the brazilian physicist 
jose goldemberg in the o estado de sao paulo newspaper recently 
there is belief here that sarney widely discredited for his 
inability to check 1004 percent annual inflation talked tough in 
the past to placate rightwing supporters 
but with his centerright brazilian democratic movement party in 
splinters and the countrys first popular presidential election 
since 1960 set for nov 15 sarney might now be resigned to accept 
foreign aid the analysts say 
what you have is a lameduck government that lacks the 
legitimacy to start new initiatives and push them through 
congress rene dreifuss a political scientist at the fluminense 
university in rio told the associated press it has no choice but 
to accept help from abroad 
equally important the hostility marking the issue has undermined 
brazils trade links abroad 
it started to become taboo to do business in the amazon sen 
leopoldo peres a member of the democratic movement and president of 
a senate committee on amazon deforestation said in an interview 
american and european banks and lending organizations started 
hesitating on financing industrial projects in the jungle 
environmentalists pressured the european economic community to 
ban imports of iron ore produced at the greater carajas project a 
huge metallurgy project in para a state in the amazon region 
recently trade officials from belgium west germany and britain 
visited the 200 millionacre 70 billion project where thousands 
of acres of virgin forest southwest of the mouth of the amazon river 
are being burned for the charcoal needed to process ore 
a rio de janeiro city councilman alfredo sirkis of brazils 
green party contends sarney first stiffened on the amazon issue 
under a barrage of international news coverage of the shooting death 
of the acclaimed union leader and ecologist francisco chico 
mendes 
mendes who fought to keep cattle ranchers from cutting down the 
forest for pasture was killed last december outside his modest home 
in a backwoods amazon town 
all of a sudden chico was all over the front pages and us 
senators were showing up to talk about saving the amazon sirkis 
said it irritated the military and sarney reacted by turning it 
into a sovereignty issue 
but the british rock star sting met with sarney in january and 
received permission to begin a worldwide campaign to raise funds for 
an indian reservation 
in february indian tribes of the eastern amazon basin organized 
the first national tribal conference with a goal of blocking world 
bank loans for a series of hydroelectric dams planned for the amazon 
region 
these efforts added to a growing worldwide concern that 
uncontrolled tree burning in the 2 million squaremile amazon forest 
for farming ranching highway building and mining was changing 
global weather patterns 
environmentalists contend deforestation of the amazon also is 
destroying unique plant and animal life much of it unstudied and 
eliminating a major source of oxygen for the earths atmosphere 
satellite surveys show that more than 5 percent of brazils rain 
forest has been cut and burned some scientists say this adds carbon 
to the atmosphere and helps cause the global warming trend known as 
the greenhouse effect 
by april the first visible sign of change came when sarney 
announced a multimilliondollar plan to preserve the rain forest 
his our nature project extended the suspension of tax 
incentives for ranchers and created a special police force to fight 
the burning it also established new forest and indian reservations 
and an environmental fund banned timber exports and controlled the 
sale of mercury which is indiscriminately dumped into amazonarea 
rivers by freelance gold prospectors 
when the hysteria in the press and the government faded the 
nationalist jingo turned to apolitical dialogue flavio feldmann 
of the brazilian social democratic party a vocal ecology defender 
told a reporter 
on july 5 foreign minister roberto abreu de sodre signed a 
memorandum of understanding with britain to tackle urban and 
industrial environmental problems control of marine pollution and 
forestry management 
this cooperation does not affect the sovereign right of states 
to administer their natural heritage said abreu de sodre 
in august brazil accepted 655 million in grants and loans from 
west germany for conservation projects in the amazon over three 
years 
after this the interamerican development bank said it would 
study the creation of a new fund for environmental projects in latin 
america and the caribbean 
many brazilian politicians now say the country will open up more 
to foreign technological and financial help although some seemingly 
remain wary of the socalled sovereignty issue 
but christopher patten britains minister of overseas 
development a recent visitor to brazil said environmental 
problems are the worlds problem which has to be solved by 
cooperation and not throwing bricks at each other

colombian drug lords smuggle most of 
the cocaine sold in the streets of the united states through the 
caribbean which has become a strategic narcotics gateway 
on any given night small planes from colombia and other south 
american nations drop bundles of cocaine into the blue caribbean sea 
the bundles bearing sophisticated blinking signal lights are 
then picked up by boats waiting off any one of 25 caribbean 
islandnations or the bahamas 
no island is exempt no body of land john fernandez the 
us drug enforcement agency spokesman in miami said in a telephone 
interview it comes by boat by air any type of boat any type 
of plane any which way traffickers can get drugs in 
officials say the caribbean became the main cocaine route in the 
last few years because of increased drug production and relatively 
successful surveillance efforts in usual western routes including 
the usmexico border 
in just two or three hours a plane carrying cocaine from 
colombia also can fly the 600 or so miles across the caribbean to 
landing fields in haiti the dominican republic jamaica puerto 
rico or the us and british virgin islands 
the dea estimates 60 to 80 percent of the cocaine and marijuana 
smuggled to the united states is transshipped from the caribbean and 
the bahamas mostly to florida for redistribution to american 
markets 
officials say puerto rico a us commonwealth has become a 
recent favorite of traffickers because it has no us customs 
inspections for flights leaving for the us mainland 
if it arrives here its in the united states said bill 
mitchell a dea special agent in san juan you can go up to any 
airline counter and say you want to ship 20 kilos of hardware to 
your sister its a domestic shipment so you dont need to inspect 
it 
other ways to ship drugs to the united states from puerto rico 
are by cruise ships commercial planes luggage and the us mails 
but most shipments are made inside ship cargo containers puerto 
rico has about 1 million such containers a number too great for 
us customs to inspect effectively 
in fiscal 1988 the dea said 11 tons of cocaine 35 tons of 
marijuana nine vessels and 20 aircraft were seized in the caribbean 
but its believed only about 20 percent of drugs shipments are 
seized 
four five years ago if you found 50 pounds of cocaine it was 
a lot said jaime echeverria in charge of us customs in puerto 
rico today shipments easily have 1200 pounds 
echeverria said that because caribbean islands are small 
smugglers know there is little radar to track air traffic 
there are three radars to detect planes in puerto rico but 
things such as tropical weather and maintenance often incapacitate 
their ability to spot planes he said 
fernandez said law enforcers and drug smugglers play a cat and 
mouse game 
they have the resources and all the possible technology to 
detect where our efforts are he said as soon as they know 
where we are they shift then we shift 
lax security in some smaller islands makes them easy stopover 
points for drugs and money laundering 
corruption also plays a role especially in nations with low 
wages inflation and unemployment 
traffickers are ruthless and try to capitalize on the political 
and economic instability of a place say like haiti said 
fernandez for example you get the person in charge of ports 
who makes 800 a month i say to him all you got to do is clear 
us for inspection and forget about the 800 a month ill give you 
10000 
caribbean leaders want a united nations task force similar to a 
peacekeeping force to interdict drugs share intelligence train 
agents and even mount paramilitary attacks on traffickers 
the proposal is the initiative of prime minister michael manley 
of jamaica who said a un force would ease nationalistic hostility 
typical of past us drug operations mainly in bolivia and peru 
if i need some muscle some really firstclass narcotics agents 
from the united states somebody is going to scream about 
sovereignty manley said in a recent interview 
no one has ever quarreled with a un peacekeeping force 
manleys initiative was supported at a meeting in july of the 
13member caribbean community which also includes antigua and 
barbuda the bahamas barbados belize dominica grenada guyana 
montserrat st kittsnevis st lucia st vincent and the 
grenadines and trinidad and tobago

an naacp official monday accused 
authorities of overreacting during two nights of clashes between 
black college students and police an allegation this resort citys 
mayor denied 
as many as 43 people were injured and more than 100 stores looted 
in the bottlethrowing melees which disrupted the labor day holiday 
in this resort of 250000 and left miles of normally busy beaches 
nearly empty 
police said up to 100000 young people many here for an annual 
fraternity festival of students from mostly black colleges were on 
the streets when rioting broke out early sunday violence resumed 
sunday night and police backed up by state troopers and 150 
national guardsmen imposed an overnight curfew there was no 
recurrence of violence monday night authorities said 
police reported arresting about 260 people half of them area 
residents and hundreds of summonses were issued through sunday 
afternoon authorities said arrest figures overnight were not 
immediately released 
jack w gravely president of the state chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said police 
reaction would have been different if the students had been white 
their response was to confront the students from a position of 
power gravely said the virginia naacp strongly condemns the 
overzealous overpowering and overreactive actions of the virginia 
beach police 
but gravely added that is not to say that they did not have 
a right to protect property and persons 
naacp officials and students have said they felt unwelcome in the 
city and had been harassed by police gravely said the trouble 
erupted as students felt squeezed by police and felt a need to 
show discontent 
its been like were being singled out because we are young and 
black said charles stone 23 of new york city 
theyve been trying to regulate things that dont need 
regulating said paul williams a 21yearold temple university 
student said of police 
one witness said some participants in the disturbances chanted 
fight the power a phrase from the hit film do the right 
thing which is about racial violence in new york city 
no guardsmen and few police were on the streets during the day 
monday but the 150 guardsmen called out early sunday had not been 
sent home on monday evening eightman squads of police stood at 
intersections while young people strolled the sidewalks and cars 
cruised bumpertobumper along atlantic avenue 
city officials said they had no choice but to use force to clear 
the streets mayor meyera e oberndorf said police acted with 
extraordinary restraint 
we will not tolerate lawlessness from anybody said 
oberndorf let the word go out that virginia beach will not stand 
by and watch as unruly individuals trash our city 
at a news conference monday afternoon city officials played 
police videotapes of the looting but the tapes did not show police 
clearing students from the streets with riot batons sunday morning 
and sunday evening 
oberndorf said the situation was stable monday and we intend to 
keep it that way 
at least 13 young people and about 30 law enforcement officers 
were injured in the melees officials said two men ages 25 and 28 
suffered gunshot wounds and a third man was injured in a fall from 
a hotel balcony 
when they tried to move people it went crazy said errin 
smith 20 of new york people were yelling fight the power at 
first people were just having a good time but they harassed us from 
the minute we got here 
gravely at a news conference condemned the looting and said 
those responsible should be punished but he said the tactics of the 
local police troopers and guardsmen called out by gov gerald l 
baliles at the request of city leaders made the situation worse 
baliles said in a statement monday what has happened in 
virginia beach is not a pretty picture but we must recognize that 
there is no excuse for taking over public streets looting stores 
or destroying personal property it cannot be condoned and it must 
not be repeated 
george mimms president of the local naacp chapter said the 
reaction by police to the students showed that race relations in the 
city are poor 
no foundation ever was built for good racial relations in this 
city this has just forced it out into the open he said 
brenda andrews publisher of the journal amp guide a local 
blackoriented newspaper said she and other citizens would not 
condone violence by students or police we are here to call on the 
youngsters to leave because we are concerned with their 
safety she said 
some merchants along atlantic avenue the citys 30block main 
thoroughfare that parallels the beach complained about lost 
business 
this has destroyed tourism said ed wirtz at a tshirt shop 
that closed because the violence we would have done 3000 worth 
of business sunday and monday would have been bigger but now its 
down to zero 
others said the students were welcome 
the majority were great folks said abby yates owner of the 
bahama shop it was a cultural experience there was no abuse i 
would welcome them back next year

the slaying of a black teenager by a gang of 
whites has brought racial tensions to the surface in new yorks 
mayoral campaign dividing the two leading democrats one black 
one white 
the aug 23 death of 16yearold yusuf hawkins ended months in 
which the issue of race was rarely raised 
this touches the exposed nerve of the city said richard 
wade a graduate professor of urban history at city college it 
politicizes the racial question all other issues suddenly are less 
important 
hawkins shooting in the mainly white bensonhurst section of 
brooklyn recalled the 1986 killing of a black man chased to his 
death by whites in the citys howard beach section 
both cases sparked outrage 
but this killing came just three weeks before the sept 12 
primary in which mayor edward i koch whose critics call him 
racially insensitive faces manhattan borough president david 
dinkins who would be the citys first black mayor 
the koch voters and the dinkins voters have very different 
perceptions of where the city is and where it is going this will 
tend to magnify those differences said lee miringoff director of 
the marist college institute for public opinion 
koch already has drawn fire under the spotlight while he decried 
the killing he also criticized black protest marches held in 
bensonhurst saying they raised tensions 
its just as wrong to march into bensonhurst as it would be to 
march into harlem after that young woman in the jogging case koch 
said he was referring to the rape of a white jogger by a gang of 
blacks in april 
that drew criticism from the understated dinkins who has made 
conciliation a campaign theme 
to suggest that peaceful demonstrations led by members of the 
clergy as a matter of fact had no right to be there or that 
somehow would exacerbate tension is a position from which i 
dissent he said 
others were more direct koch has not displayed the same 
outrage with this incident as he did with other incidents in other 
communities said rep charles rangel dny a leading black 
officeholder it is generally felt that he does not consider 
himself the mayor of all of the people 
he knows what hes doing said wade the urban historian 
hes going after the white vote 
kochs supporters protested this is being pumped up because 
koch made the remarks not because of what the remarks were said 
david garth the mayors campaign strategist whatever koch said 
other than hello they would have jumped on because there are 
people out there who wanted to jump on him 
ray harding local leader of the liberal party and a supporter of 
republican rudolph w giuliani said koch may reap redneck votes 
from whites 
but he said dinkins may benefit from a greater turnout of black 
voters who make up a quarter to a third of the democratic vote and 
others concerned with deteriorating race relations 
thus in hardings view the outcome rests with the hispanic 
vote which could exceed 10 percent of turnout 
according to the 1980 census the citys population of people 18 
and older was 58 percent whites 215 blacks 17 percent hispanics 
and 35 percent asians and others 
there are two other candidates in the democratic primary 
although both trail badly in the polls on the republican side 
former us attorney giuliani faces cosmetics heir ronald lauder 
democrats outnumber republicans 51 in the city

a bomb exploded sunday night near a bookstore 
injuring three pedestrians and police said a telephone caller 
linked the blast to the campaign against salman rushdies novel 
the satanic verses 
they said they received an anonymous telephone warning about the 
bomb 10 or 15 minutes before it went off in londons west end 
detective chief superintendent derek wilson of scotland yards 
antiterrorist squad said the telephone caller mentioned rushdies 
book which has angered moslem fundamentalists around the world who 
claim it blasphemes their religion 
wilson said the explosion on the sidewalk on great marlborough 
street was near a window of a store that had a display of books but 
the satanic verses was not among them 
an ambulance service spokesman said a woman suffered leg injuries 
and shock and two men also suffered shock he said the victims were 
taken to university college hospital where officials reported they 
were in satisfactory condition 
an independent radio news reporter at the scene said the blast 
was next to a penguin bookstore 
the satanic verses was published last year under the viking 
imprint which is part of the penguin group the company received 
death threats against its staff after the islamic campaign began and 
two london bookstores one specializing in penguin books were 
damaged in arson attacks on april 9 
suddenly there was a huge bang said tracy ryan 23 who was 
looking in a store window across the street when the bomb went off 
it was really frightening and the pavement shook it was a 
terrible bang 
the main store of libertys a textile fashion firm established 
in 1875 is on regent street around the corner from the bomb site 
terry norman a scotland yard spokesman said there appears to 
be no structural damage to libertys or any other shop most firms 
in the area are closed on sundays 
an islamic group in lebanon claimed last month that a man who 
accidentally blew himself up in a london hotel on aug 3 was 
constructing a bomb to attack rushdie 
rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since irans late 
religious leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said last february it 
was the duty of a faithful moslem to kill rushdie 
the authors american wife marianne wiggins said a week ago 
that she could no longer stand the strain and had left her husband 
four weeks earlier

it begins with the cocagrowing peasant in 
bolivia or peru moves on to the colombian drug baron and ends up 
with the user in the united states or europe this is the cocaine 
trail that has brought the peasant more than he has ever had before 
and the baron enormous wealth but cocaine money as colombia has 
recently shown is a curse in south america 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the cocaine trade has become so pervasive 
and so great an economic force in south america that it threatens 
the sovereignty and security of nations 
billions of cocaine dollars are making their way into and in some 
cases corrupting the economies of colombia peru bolivia and more 
recently ecuador on a scale that approaches the amounts they earn 
from legal exports 
cocaine cartels producers and traffickers have established 
virtual autonomous states in remote areas and with the support of 
local cocagrowing peasants operate out of the reach of the law 
antigovernment guerrillas in peru are arming themselves with 
millions of dollars from drug cartels and traffickers with whom 
they have allied themselves in their attempts to seize power 
in colombia traffickers have formed private armies with 
intelligencegathering units modern weapons and fleets of aircraft 
in the past decade they have killed 220 judges and other court 
employees two newspaper editors a justice minister an attorney 
general hundreds of policemen and soldiers and dozens of others 
perceived as a threat to their business 
but it was the assassination last month of the popular 
presidential candidate luis carlos galan that left the nation in 
outrage and prompted the government to launch allout war against 
the cartels 
in bolivia and peru however officials say the overall war 
against the cocaine trade will be lost without a regional effort and 
greater resources for effective cocaleaf reduction and interdiction 
programs peasant coca farmers in the far reaches of bolivia and 
peru are the suppliers for the traffickers of cocaine to the united 
states and europe 
the implications for colombia and for other latin american 
nations where narcotraffickers are able to amass huge fortunes are 
crucial the us ambassador to bolivia robert s gelbard said 
in an interview the traffickers in a variety of ways are out to 
suborn and destroy the democratic system in bolivia as in other 
countries of the region this is nothing less than a war to decide 
who will govern these countries 
gelbard added both producing and consuming nations should take 
heed of what is happening in colombia there is no such thing as 
benign drug production or consumption the sovereignty of producing 
nations is a little less secure with every new acre of coca planted 
and with every dollar spent on a cocaine high 
what we require is a regional approach to the problem because 
otherwise whatever plans we have in bolivia would be affected by 
events in other countries said gonzalo torrico under secretary 
of the interior in charge of bolivias drug interdiction programs 
already there is concern that the offensive against the colombian 
cartels will drive the traffickers to other south american nations 
where vast areas are unpatrolled and lack radar to control air 
traffic increased border patrols have already been set up in 
brazil peru ecuador and bolivia 
so far the us governments antidrug strategy in south america 
has been based on an effective interdiction program involving the 
seizure of chemicals used to process coca leaves and the destruction 
of cocaineproducing facilities the intent was to drive down the 
price of coca leaves and encourage farmers to shift to other crops 
operation snowcap a multination cocaine interdiction 
program central to the us strategy has destroyed since its 
inception in 1987 more than 200 cocaine labs and seized more than 43 
metric tons of cocaine 
us drug agents and local police forces have in recent years 
increased their operating capacity but as police activities become 
more effective traffickers use their vast resources to bribe 
judges district attorneys and police officials 
despite a greater us presence in drug producing nations 
cocaine production continues to rise by 10 percent a year a us 
state department report says as a result cocaine prices in the 
united states have steadily declined making cocaine and crack more 
available europe and asia are now the growth markets for cocaine 
peru bolivia and colombia produced 348 to 454 metric tons of 
pure cocaine in 1988 according to us government figures 
with cocaine selling wholesale in miami for 15000 a kilo 22 
pounds or higher and retailing for 50000 to 120000 the value 
of south americas cocaine is worth at least 5 billion wholesale 
and at least 17 billion retail many times the legal exports of 
drugproducing nations 
in bolivia an impoverished country of 69 million people the 
cocaine produced is worth at least 17 billion wholesale from that 
an estimated 300 million to 500 million flows back into the 
economy compared with 600 million for all legal exports combined

for perus beleaguered economy 700 million to 12 billion 
enters the economy while legal exports bring in 25 billion 
the us government allocated 549 million for cocaine 
interdiction and police training programs for the fiscal year 1989 
for all countries south of the united states before president bush 
announced a 65 million emergency package for colombias antidrug 
war 
the us congress allocated to bolivia 10 million for fiscal 
1989 5 million less than in 1988 a single planeload of cocaine 
from bolivia to colombia usually about 14500 pounds would fetch 
10 million for the shipper 
bolivian antidrug police trained by us soldiers and assisted 
by members of the us border patrol and american agents have 
destroyed three cocaine labs and 5723 cocaine paste processing 
pits compared to 3542 pits in 1988 
but vast areas of the bolivian tropical lowlands are beyond their 
reach and traffickers planes fly cocaine from the northern regions 
of bolivia to colombia or brazil without interference 
at least 60 us experts operate in bolivia alongside 1050 
bolivian antidrug police 
ecuador is becoming an important money laundering and trafficking 
center in south america cocaine shipments for the united states and 
europe have been discovered in everything from canned fruit to wood 
and handicrafts while cocaleaf production is relatively small in 
ecuador traffickers are using that andean country as a transit 
point for drugs the us drug enforcement agency dea says 
police estimate that 200 million to 400 million was laundered 
or invested in ecuador last year the united states provides ecuador 
with 1 million a year for interdiction activities 
as pressure increases in colombia and peru cocaine trafficking 
will increase in ecuador because traffickers will move to the 
country with the least amount of pressure said william fernandez 
a us dea station chief for ecuador 
newspapers in ecuador have expressed concern in editorials about 
the danger of corruption of judges and government officials by drug 
cartels 
in ecuadors most publicized case so far two judges signed an 
order for the release from jail of an important drug trafficker the 
judges then fled into hiding one was captured later with nearly 
20000 officials said he apparently had received as a payoff the 
other judge and the trafficker are still at large 
the security threat in peru is concentrated in the expanding 
insurgency of the shining path a maoist guerrilla organization that 
in the last two years has received millions of dollars from its 
involvement in the drug trade the money has allowed shining path to 
better arm itself and is the principal reason the peruvian 
government is concerned about the drug trade 
at the same time corruption of lowerlevel officials and police 
in perus huallaga valley hampers government efforts to wipe out the 
cocaine trade in the jungle region 
in the campaign for bolivias national elections this year some 
congressional candidates received backing and money from cocaine 
traffickers 
bolivian traffickers also have even staked out whole towns or 
areas as their own 
when police tried recently to capture bolivian and colombian 
traffickers in the town of santa ana hundreds of townspeople came 
to the traffickerss defense and forced the police to leave the 
town is considered a haven for traffickers 
in san borja a cocaine trafficking center police and us 
agents tried to confiscate airplanes that had small traces of 
cocaine but thousands of area residents forced them out 
cocaine corruption has reached high places in the bolivian 
government in years pase a rightwing government installed after a 
military coup in 1980 was backed by cocaine traffickers 
luis arce gomez that governments minister of the interior is 
under indictment in miami on drug trafficking charges 
bolivias new president paz zamora says several hundred million 
dollars is needed to combat the cocaine trade in bolivia 
we can win the war he said but we must change the focus 
so that the war is backed by the people of the country

us drug officials are concerned that a 
disruption of cocaine production in colombia because of the 
government crackdown will raise cocaine prices in peru and bolivia 
and make it harder to persuade farmers to switch from coca leaf to 
other crops 
an estimated 300000 people in bolivia depend on coca farming and 
cocaine production for a livelihood coca leaf still provides a 100 
percent profit to farmers and cocaleaf acreage increased by 20 
percent in 198788 according to a us state department report 
for farmers to stop growing coca leaves viable alternative crops 
must be found but with the recent drop in the price of coffee a 
crop suited for the tropics where coca is grown and the lack of 
other profitable alternative crops farmers prefer to grow coca 
which provides four crops a year and is easy to sell 
the bolivian government last year passed a law that limits 
cocaleaf acreage president jaime paz zamoras government which 
was sworn in aug 6 says it will wage an allout war against 
traffickers 
cocaleaf reduction in bolivia is moving ahead but slowly as the 
new government implements an antidrug strategy 
bolivian law calls for the reduction of 12350 acres of coca land 
by the end of the year in order to comply with a quota agreed upon 
by the us government if the quota is not reached bolivia stands 
to loose 10 million in aid this year so far only about 3200 acres 
have been destroyed 
in peru coca leaf reduction programs in the 150mile huallaga 
valley 300 miles northeast of lima have been temporarily suspended 
because of threats to us drug agents and the killing of peruvian 
officials 
coca farmers and traffickers in peru have allied themselves with 
insurgency groups among them the shining path and many cocaleaf 
producing areas are off limits to law enforcement officials 
eradiction and interdiction activities in the huallaga valley are 
expected to resume this month when a secure base is completed in the 
santa lucia area 
peru destroyed 12670 acres of coca in just four months last year 
peru produces coca leaves on 285600 acres it is the main 
supplier of paste for colombian cocaine producers and distributors

the old man smoothes his blue uniform 
shirt and snaps to attention as a visitor approaches the 
fortresslike workers militia headquarters 
asked how long he has been a militiaman jozsef szerepi smiles 
broadly since the beginning he says 
established by the communists as the iron fist of the party a 
year after soviet tanks crushed the 1956 hungarian revolution the 
militia was for years the pride of the men who fought to defend 
communism 
but as hungary prepares for the first free parliamentary 
elections since the communists consolidated power in 1947 the 
militia is under orders from the communist party to transform itself 
into an apolitical force 
political opposition groups question whether it can do so 
warning darkly that the 60000member militia could take to the 
streets to keep the communists in power should they lose in the june 
elections 
on the other side of the ideological spectrum some hardline 
communist militiamen complain bitterly of being betrayed both by 
the party and by their organization 
although the organization makes much of its role in providing 
emergency help in floods fires and other natural calamities it 
remains identified with the soviet submachine gun that forms the 
centerpiece of its emblem 
a may survey of 700 hungarians showed that between 77 percent and 
84 percent of those polled favored the militias dissolution 
after endorsing the concept of multiparty democracy earlier this 
year the hungarian communist party announced may 8 that it no 
longer would control the militia 
militia officials say they are trying to reorganize into a force 
that would take orders only from the government even a future 
noncommunist government but its a daunting task 
for more than three decades militiamen have been required to 
swear allegiance to the red flag of the international workers 
class and to be prepared to give their lives to protect the 
rule of the working class 
militia spokesman andras zelenak acknowledged rankandfile 
discontent with hungarys reform course saying some members of 
the workers militia are stunned about what is going on in this 
country 
militiaman ferenc goenczoel agreed during an interview at 
zelenaks office where busts of lenin shared shelf space with books 
on marxist ideology 
it is difficult to digest these great and quick changes 
because much is contrary to the ideological philosopy that we 
brought with us goenczoel said i cannot make an about face 
from one day to the next 
goenczoel who said he had been a militiaman for more than two 
decades said disappointment in hungarys present political course 
is greatest among working class comradesinarms and those who 
fought alongside soviet troops in 1956 
the older ones are most bitter even about the party that it 
left the workers militia in the lurch said goenczoel 
many members felt most betrayed by the communist leaderships 
decision in february to abandon the 32year terminology describing 
the 1956 revolt what officially had been a traitorous 
counterrevolution suddenly became a popular uprising 
then the leadership rehabilitated the revolutions leaders and 
conducted their ceremonial reburial june 16 more than 30 years 
after their execution as traitors 
there was an outcry goenczoel said it was most difficult 
for the older members who fought on the barricades in 1956 he 
said 
zelenak said some embittered members of the largely volunteer 
force have resigned rather than accept the changes but asserted the 
militia could adapt to an emerging democracy 
but anticommunist political groups demanding abolition of the 
workers militia in preelection negotiations with the communists 
are skeptical saying the armed forces should be the only ones to 
have weapons 
some even see parallels to hitlers stormtroopers who helped the 
nazi dictator to power 
this workers militia is a little bit like the stormtroopers in 
germany a symbol of the totalitarian system said opposition 
figure csaba kiss 
kiss spokesman of the hungarian democratic forum suggested that 
hungarian communists could be waiting for the right moment a 
conservative turn away from reform in the soviet union the workers 
militia then could become the base for a reactionary turn at 
home he said 
militia members vehemently deny they would ever act against the 
popular will or the legal government although some radicals outside 
the organization say they do not exclude the possibility of armed 
insurrection to keep the communists in power 
announcing the formation of a marxistleninist party aug 25 
selfstyled spokesman sandor petres told the newspaper mai nap his 
organization would not hesitate to seize weapons if the 
elections exclude the working class from parliament 
most analysts made light of his remarks and of his organization 
but the army apparently attached enough importance to the comments 
to issue a statement expressing support of peaceful political change 
in hungary

coventry and dresden devastated by world war ii 
bombing despite having no military significance have come to 
symbolize the chilling 20thcentury concept of total war associated

even today nearly 50 years later there 
is a stillness at the heart of coventry 
here stand the skeletal remains of its 700yearold cathedral 
destroyed with the rest of the city center on nov 14 1940 in the 
longest deadliest single bombing raid inflicted by adolf hitler on 
a british city during world war ii 
there were armament plants in coventry but not in cathedral 
square just buildings shops and people 568 of whom were killed 
if coventry represented a new 20thcentury strategy known as 
total war the allies showed in february 1945 how far total war 
could go when they bombed the equally unthreatening german city of 
dresden killing 135000 people 
on sunday the 50th anniversary of britains declaration of war 
on germany worshipers in coventry and dresden came together through 
a british broadcasting corp radio linkup and they forgave each 
other once again 
the war which germany started set the world alight and 
destroyed your city pastor christof ziemer of the kreuzkirche in 
dresden told the 500 coventry worshipers over a loudspeaker in the 
new cathedral built next to the ruins of the old 
we are not minded to shake off the burden of our guilt but you 
have forgiven 
canon michael sadgrove replied from coventry we too need to be 
forgiven we will not forget the firestorm that killed so many 
thousands of your people 
father forgive intoned the congregation in coventry 
vater vergib came the answering murmur in german from 
dresden 
most of the ruins of coventry cathedral were long ago arranged in 
rows under the open sky truncated pillars a winding stairway that 
once led to a pulpit but now leads nowhere 
only the 295foot steeple survived intact pointing skyward like 
a remonstrating finger for the tourists who wander about in awed 
silence 
before the inscription father forgive stands the replica of 
a cross of two blackened wooden beams lashed together in 1940 by a 
roman catholic caretaker who pulled them from the ruins in a 
spontaneous gesture of remembrance that became world famous 
elsewhere in britain people quietly marked the anniversary of 
the wars outbreak without largescale remembrances independent 
radio news broadcast warera speeches of adolf hitler prime 
minister neville chamberlain and 13yearold princess elizabeth 
now the queen 
coventry today is a city of 303000 people 90 miles west of 
london it is best known for manufacturing the luxury jaguar car 
many residents found the strength to forgive through the words of 
provost dick howard who declared in a broadcast from the cathedral 
ruins on christmas 1940 we are trying hard as it may be to 
banish all thoughts of revenge to make a kinder simpler more 
christchildlike sort of world in the days beyond this strife 
preaching in coventry cathedral on sunday the rev ulrike 
birkner of dresden said it was christs example that gave men like 
howard the courage to make themselves unpopular by offering to 
forgive 
when enemies have become friends when both sides have faced up 
to their own sins they can accept forgiveness and lay aside the 
burden of guilt she said 
ms birkner who was born in dresden shortly after the war 
recalled taking long tram rides with my parents through miles of 
ruins with only the tower of st annes church still standing just 
like the tower of your cathedral here in coventry 
she remembered her uncle a foreman on a dresden reconstruction 
site bringing home young volunteers to help rebuild dresden 
they came from coventry

the german town of dresden and the english city 
of coventry were officially enemies but their grim eerily similar 
fates during world war ii have drawn them together on the 50th 
anniversary of the beginnng of the great conflict citizens of both 
cities gathered for church services that were joined by a radio 
linkup to recall their towns flaming destruction a half century ago

once the jewel of germany because of 
its magnificent architecture dresden virtually burned to death a 
halfcentury ago 
for two days allied aircraft relentlessly bombed the city 
killing tens of thousands of people 
in a solemn church service on sunday dresden recalled the 
firebombing and the germans own destruction of coventry england 
fifty years to the day after britain entered the war the people 
and clergy of two cities spoke to each other via radio hookup and 
shared their flaming pasts 
we in dresden and you in conventry we killed each others 
people and we destroyed each others cities rev christof ziemer 
told about 400 worshipers inside the kruezkirche lutheran church and 
500 others listening to his remarks inside coventry cathedral 
we germans are not minded to shake off the burden of our 
guilt but you have forgiven he told his british listeners via 
british broadcasting corp hookup 
canon paul oestreicher of coventry cathedral told dresden 
residents he could never expect them to forget the firebombing of 
dresden in february 1945 
when the war was practically over and this city crowded with 
refugees british and american bombers turned it into a raging 
inferno in which more women and children died than even in 
hiroshima oestreicher said 
but oestreicher also pointed out the horrors of the nazi 
holocaust unleashed by the war that began when hitler invaded poland 
on sept 1 1939 
i cant forget that many of my fathers jewish family were 
killed in german gas chambers said oestreicher who was born in 
germany but fled his homeland in 1939 
an estimated 6 million jews died in the nazi holocaust many of 
them gassed to death in german concentration camps 
on feb 1314 in 1945 combined angloamerican bomber forces 
attacked dresden creating a firestorm that destroyed the heart of 
the city 
incendiary bombs set fire to wooden roofs that were hundreds of 
years old heavy bombs created air suction that whipped up raging 
balls of flames 
estimates of the dead range up to 135000 many of them refugees 
who had fled the russian army that was rapidly advancing on dresden 
93 miles south of berlin 
the skyline of this city of 500000 still shows the marks of war 
such as the burned and gutted spires on the former royal palace 
downtown dresden once known for its lovely baroque and 
renaissance facades and spires now has rows of postwar concrete 
structures 
few of the citys old landmarks are still standing 
dresden and its destruction figured prominently in author kurt

in this bastion of free enterprise and 
profitmaking an industry is blossoming that cashes in on fear of 
the coming takeover by communist china 
from marriage counselors to immigration consultants thousands in 
this british colony are capitalizing on a growing desperation about 
1997 when hong kong comes under chinas rule some appear to be 
profiting illegally 
emigration industry specialists say hundreds of millions of 
dollars are being spent by nervous residents who want to flee the 
colony and they say business is bound to improve 
the june 4 crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in beijing has 
sparked more interest in emigration than ever before 
last year 45000 people left hong kong mostly for the united 
states canada and australia the number is expected to rise this 
year 
a survey in august said two out of every five residents want to 
emigrate indicating few among the colonys 57 million people 
believe in chinas promise to maintain hong kongs economic system 
for at least 50 years 
on a recent weekend at the hong kong convention center about 
50000 people packed a show on overseas investment and immigration 
opportunities 
australian women sporting bright blue 10gallon hats hawked 
houses in perth videos showed sandpipers speeding down a uruguayan 
beach and told of the wonders of investing in that latin american 
country a movie beckoned come to new zealand and be free 
one consultants chinese sign promised a peruvian passport for 
1500 and 20 days in lima the peruvian consulate said it was 
impossible 
another consultant was selling 100000 investments in the united 
states although america does not accept business immigrants 
theres always a window said former chemist junny co with a 
wry smile and a wink as he passed out leaflets with the investment 
information im selling the american dream 
surveying the crowd peter tse a real estate agent for an 
australian company heaved a sigh 
theres a sucker born every minute he said im just 
selling houses but the consultants theyre exploiting fear 
indeed in the immigration industry consultants are the big 
moneymakers charging as much as 50000 for a successful case 
consultants help prospective emigrants fill out forms draw up 
business proposals and determine whether they have the necessary 
credentials to emigrate 
since january the ranks of hong kongbased consultants have 
swollen to 600 a 100 percent jump according to alex lee an 
advertising executive at saleslink ltd which cosponsored the 
convention hundreds more including american lawyers added to the 
flock when they set up temporary shop in hotel rooms around the 
colony 
at the conference jagson cheu elbowed his way out of a booth run 
by a new zealand investment company 
they want all my money just to go to the bottom of the world i 
cant believe it said the securities trader but i dont have a 
choice i need help right now im just looking for the cheapest 
thief 
despite dozens of complaints of fraud to the hong kong consumer 
council the government does not monitor the industry and there is 
practically no way to sue a consultant 
horatio cheung who runs the only nonprofit consultancy in the 
colony tells of 290 people who were denied canadian citizenship 
after being bilked out of thousands of dollars by a consultant who 
tried to get around canadas residency requirement 
earlier this year royal canadian mounted police raided a law 
firm in toronto and several canadian lawyers have been charged with 
perjury and other crimes in connection with illegal immigration 
practices 
those who cant afford a consultant are going back to school to 
get necessary skills to emigrate some countries like australia 
welcome certain workers such as pastry chefs and carpenters 
singapore which is facing a labor shortage recently lowered its 
standards for immigrants sparking 30000 hong kong residents to mob 
the application office 
but competition for seats in hong kongs few universities is 
intense the open learning institute hong kongs newest 
collegelevel facility recently received 60000 applications for 
5000 spots for the upcoming school year the governmentrun school 
made about 380000 from applications alone 
fears about the takeover have also helped hong kongs matchmaking 
industry 
maria mo manager of the international computer marriage 
consulting agency says clients looking for a spouse with a foreign 
passport have increased by 50 percent since june 4 her company now 
gets up to 200 inquiries a month and charges at least 1000 for 
completed marriages 
r shek who is looking for a western husband said the crackdown 
made her want to leave hong kong as soon as possible 
hong kong life used to be peaceful said shek an executive 
secretary at an international firm but now its time to leave i 
dont have enough money to buy a passport so marriage to a westerner 
is the best route for me 
but this sector too is tainted by suspect practices one 
matchmaker showed letters from foreign men to his office offering 
marriage for a reasonable price or 35000 
the immigration business has spawned its own service industry 
with tv and radio talk shows newspapers and magazines 
the emigrant magazine started last year and now boasts 14000 
subscribers and a thick advertisement section pushing land in 
jamaica passports in latin america and factories in south africa 
we have people in line at all hours buying back issues 
editor katherine kreuter said this is definitely a growth 
industry

the opposition has chosen its 
candidates and approved a platform and its challenge now is to 
stick together to beat the ruling sandinistas in february elections 
but cracks showed in the 14party national opposition union 
coalition just minutes after violeta barrios de chamorro and 
virgilio godoy were chosen as its presidential and vice presidential 
candidates late saturday 
the chamorrogodoy ticket was approved with the minimum 10 votes 
out of a possible 14 after five rounds of voting saturday the 
balloting followed another five rounds on thursday 
three parties pushing businessman enrique bolanos for the vice 
presidential slot abstained in the final vote and one partys 
ballot was annulled 
all 14 parties signed a document committing themselves to support 
the winning ticket 
but the representative of the national conservative party one of 
the three abstaining was heard to say shortly after the meeting 
ended that his group might split from the coalition 
if one party drifts away from the opposition union and others 
follow the oppositions dream of defeating the sandinistas likely 
will collapse 
parties within the coalition reportedly have acknowledged that 
only by uniting might they defeat the sandinista national liberation 
front 
but merging the 14 parties of the traditionally fractious 
nicaraguan opposition into a common front is already a substantial 
achievement the parties range from communists to conservatives 
of the 21 parties legally registered for the feb 25 balloting 
three others have nominated their own candidates but they are not 
considered a major factor 
the real squaring off will be between the opposition union and 
the sandinista front 
the sandinistas biggest advantage is that they are in power in 
a country where the line separating the government party and the 
state apparatus is blurred at best 
government vehicles are used to transport people to sandinista 
rallies and public employees are expected to show up at 
spontaneous protests and consciousnessraising meetings or 
risk losing their jobs 
in addition to using government resources for party purposes the 
sandinistas are superbly organized and disciplined at every level of 
the national structure 
bickering and infighting on the other hand have characterized 
the nicaraguan opposition cardinal miguel obando y bravo the only 
prominent nicaraguan figure whose following crosses party and social 
lines often calls on politicians to leave behind personal 
interest and look out for the good of the whole nation 
the coalition still must decide how candidacies for provincial 
and local posts will be distributed something that is likely to 
bring into play the parties regional power 
they also must agree on how they will run for the 96 seats in the 
unicameral national legislature 
mrs chamorro was an ideal choice for the opposition union 
presidential candidate she is a unifying symbol for the 
wideranging coalition 
the jan 10 1978 assassination of her husband pedro joaquin 
chamorro a newspaper publisher and foe of late president anastasio 
somoza helped draw the country together in support of the 
sandinista revolution 
mrs chamorro is seen as a strong supporter of democracy and is 
widely recognized at home and abroad 
she publishes the family newspaper la prensa which now is a 
strong critic of the sandinistas who ousted somoza in july 1979 
mrs chamorro is not known to belong to a party and is weak on 
political experience and administrative expertise her upperclass 
background had to be balanced with a running mate more appealing to 
the center and left 
bolanos would have made the ticket too rightwing to attract 
widespread support 
thats where godoy came in godoy is a deft centerleft 
politician with long experience in nicaraguan politics and public 
administration 
for the past 10 years he has been president of the centrist 
independent liberal party he was a professor and dean of the 
sociology department at the nicaraguan national autonomous 
university for 14 years 
the criticism against the 55yearold lawyer stems from his 
tenure as labor minister under the sandinistas from july 19 1979 
until march 31 1984 and from what some have called an abrasive and 
arrogant personality

prince charles has renewed his attacks on soulless 
modern buildings writing that architects are creating 
frankensteins monsters 
the fashionable architectural theories of the 1950s and 1960s 
have spawned deformed monsters which have come to haunt our towns 
and cities our villages and our countryside the prince said in 
a vision of britain as excerpted in the sunday times 
the 40yearold heir to the british throne has harshly criticized 
modern buildings that he believes fail to meet the needs of the 
people who must live and work in them 
as a result of 30 years of experimenting with revolutionary 
building materials and novel ideas burning all the rulebooks and 
purveying the theory that man is a machine we have ended up with 
frankenstein monsters devoid of character alien and largely 
unloved except by the professors who have been concocting these 
horrors in their laboratories and even they find their creations a 
bit hard to take after a while the excerpt said 
the book is to be published in britain on thursday by doubleday

a homeless man has landed on free parking 
outside the philadelphia museum of art by charging drivers for spots 
that should be free 
much to the annoyance of police motorists and museum officials 
eugene harris charges drivers 3 to 5 and even hands them a stub 
he sees himself as an entrepreneur 
look he said last week nothings free in philadelphia 
right this isnt like theft or anything i can make 300 on a good 
day 
police say the 27yearold harris is a ripoff artist theyve 
arrested him three times during the past month on charges including 
resisting arrest but theyve had problems prosecuting 
we cant seem to get anybody to press charges and the few 
times we have we have trouble getting higherups to prosecute 
said police capt larry norton he said the latter is partly due to 
the prevalence of more serious crime and a cap on jail admissions 
because of crowding 
harris who sleeps at a railroad station near the museum carries 
ticket stubs that he picks up from other parking lots and gives 
them to his customers 
almost nobody turns me down he said people expect to pay 
for parking anyway the ticket stubs they help the image look a 
couple of years ago the city used to charge for this lot so i just 
sort of took over 
harris figures has made several thousand dollars with the parking 
lot during the past year or so 
he even has charged new museum security guards 5 to park in the 
lot before they found out it was free 
weve been getting five to 10 complaints a day for months about 
him its an embarrassment an outrage a disgrace that people 
from here and from all over the country are getting ripped off this 
way said michael j dougherty the museums assistant security 
manager 
police and the museum say harris walks around the lot directing 
motorists into parking spaces then charges them he raises his fee 
to 5 for major art exhibitions and often uses a helper on busy 
weekend days according to dougherty 
jan wechsler of narberth said she was charged 3 before she 
realized that harris was too grubby to be a parkinglot 
attendant 
i said theres never been a parking fee here before and he 
said lady nothings free in philadelphia 
she said he then tried to rip off a japanese tourist who was 
then told by another person not to pay 
harris said he knows hes not at the top of the list of police 
targets 
i know the system i guess i might serve a little time some 
day but they keep letting me go he told the philadelphia 
inquirer

two us c130 transport planes flew into 
bogota sunday marking the beginning of the delivery of 65 million 
in us military aid to combat drug traffickers 
an explosion ripped through four businesses near the cocaine 
capital of medellin sunday night wounding at least three people 
the colombian radio network rcn said 
the bomb in itagui just south of medellin damaged a bank an 
insurance companys office a shoe store and an optical shop an 
itagui police spokesman told the associated press in a telephone 
interview the spokesman asked to remain anonymous 
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing but it 
followed the method of terror that drug traffickers have employed in 
medellin where they have set off bombs at banks and other businesses 
two small bombs exploded sunday night in front of the 
intercontinental hotel in medellin but no one was hurt police said 
also sunday president virigilo barco replaced the chief of the 
antidrug effort in medellin a source said he was ousted for having 
dealings with drug lords but officials denied such reports 
us ambassador thomas mcnamara at the bogota military air base 
where the c130s landed said the planes are in excellent condition 
and should serve the colombian armed forces for many years 
the commander of colombias air force gen alfonso amaya 
maldonado said the c130s will be used in the fight in which we 
are engaged to reestablish order 
in washington white house chief of staff john sununu told cbs 
face the nation that if colombia requests more assistance 
president bush probably would order american troops to take an 
active role in fighting colombias drug lords 
mcnamara said the transport planes from national guard bases in 
louisville ky and martinsburg w va brought spare parts for 
eight a37 observation and attack aircraft the united states expects 
to deliver monday in the caribbean port of barranquilla 
three american crewmen all dressed in olivegreen flight suits 
disembarked from each plane 
an ap photographer who peered through the opened tailgate of one 
of the c130s said it contained large crates covered by plastic and 
nets 
five uh1h transport helicopters are to arrive tuesday the 
ambassador said 
washington has said as many as 200 american military personnel 
may come to colombia to assist security forces in installing and 
operating the american equipment this is a potential sore point as 
colombian officials have said they dont want american troops 
mcnamara told reporters right now i dont have an exact 
number of american advisers in colombia but it is very few 
coming in will be a few ground crews to handle the 
aircraft these crews will be here for a few hours or days he 
said we will have a few trainers come in and assist with the 
transfer of the equipment and the training of colombians 
the united states also has promised colombia rifles pistols 
machine guns rockets grenades and even bulletproof vests for 
colombian officials and judges who prosecute drug traffickers 
the fourengine c130s can take off and land on 3000foot 
runways even dirt airstrips and could be used in raids on remote 
cocaleaf plantations and refining laboratories 
the government gave no reason for removing police col antonio 
sanchez as chief of a special 4000member antidrug unit in 
medellin a source at national police headquarters in bogota 
speaking on condition of anonymity said he was ousted for dealing 
with drug traffickers 
but in a telephone interview with the associated press sanchez 
said the report that he had been relieved of command for alleged 
links to drug traffickers was absolutely false 
the chief of national police gen miguel gomez padilla said 
sanchez was under no suspicion or investigation and was merely being 
transferred to headquarters in bogota 
barco who has vowed not to back down from the cocaine bosses 
also on sunday took a helicopter flight over the wreckage of the 
bogota newspaper el espectador which on saturday was bombed by 
drugcartel terrorists 
eightyfour people were injured in the blast the paper printed a 
smaller edition from a makeshift newsroom 
we will continue moving forward the front page proclaimed 
in its 102 years el espectador has always gone ahead overcoming 
all adversities said the paper whose publisher was assassinated 
in 1986 by drug traffickers 
the drug cartels which last month assassinated colombias 
leading presidential candidate and also the top police official in 
the cocaine center of medellin have declared total and absolute 
war against the government

young people need help to break the cycle of 
negative choices in their lives says a minister who is lining up 
positive role models for youths living in the druginfested 
violencewracked nations capital 
the result is the youth group lean on me which recently 
completed a monthlong experimental run financed mainly by the rev 
elwood gray and a few friends 
i feel that education is a community responsibility said 
gray a child doesnt know if he wants to be an attorney preacher 
or medical doctor 
but just imagine in your own life if you were 11 or 12 years 
old and you would go to a place where there was an attorney a 
physician a teacher or a preacher and you had a chance to sit and 
question them about real life 
armed with evidence of the groups initial success mainly 
anecdotal reports from dozens of the adolescents and teenagers who 
attended gray is beginning plans for a permanent organization 
at the last meeting of the summer 14yearold michael smith said 
he enjoyed the opportunity to chat with rick sanders of a local 
radio station about the importance of setting career goals and with 
angele moss a prison psychologist about developing and maintaining 
positive selfesteem 
the discussions held at howard university turned into a 
freeforall 
do you ever feel sometimes like youre about to go crazy 
asked michael prompting ms moss to smile and the other youngsters 
to giggle 
describing the pressures on todays youth ms moss assured the 
youngster his feelings are natural 
the district of columbia is the nations murder capital with the 
death toll reaching 304 as of monday compared with 219 at the same 
time last year officer quintin peterson said 29 of the homicide 
victims were under age 18 other statistics show that 75 percent to 
80 percent of the homicides were drugrelated 
the city had a record 372 homicides in 1988 
gray is adamant about the need to provide positive role models 
for black children 
we are not talking about exoffenders exdrug addicts to move 
in and talk to the kids said gray who has worked for 10 years as 
a chaplain at the lorton correctional complex in virginia 
we are not proclaiming say no to drugs we dont have 
anything against those but what we are doing is we are giving them 
positive choices so they can make positive selections we need to 
give young people positive options dont tell them what not to do 
tell them what to do he said 
gray also wants to teach youngsters to use their leisure time in 
positive ways 
metropolitan areas throughout america struggle with problems 
regarding their youth making positive use of their leisure time 
said gray 
a recent survey of adolescents in minnesota found that for whites 
20 percent of aboveaverage students had alcohol problems but almost 
50 percent of belowaverage students abused alcohol only 5 percent 
of aboveaverage female students were at serious risk for pregnancy 
because of their behavior while 21 percent of belowaverage females 
were similarly at risk 
for many youth in our area life is a series of failures and 
they are trapped in a cycle of negative and unproductive choices 
said gray 
lean on me will provide positive alternatives presented by 
role models in order to break this cycle of negative choices and 
unproductive use of leisure time gray said adding that the group 
will provide a supportive network to facilitate the involvement of 
community volunteers who want to make a difference in the lives of 
our young people

the army is expanding its drug testing program 
to include checks for use of speed morphine and angel dust amid 
pentagon boasts that drug use already has dropped sharply in recent 
years 
although there is little evidence that such drugs are being used 
widely by enlisted personnel or officers army officials say the top 
brass wants the tests as a new deterrent against drug use 
since 1981 all activeduty military personnel have been subject 
to random urinalysis tests to check for the abuse of cocaine and 
thc the active ingredient in marijuana and hashish 
the testing was later broadened to include the army reserves and 
national guard and severe penalties were imposed 
since july the armys five drug testing laboratories have added 
a new test at an expected cost of 1 million to 2 million per year 
according to donna smith head of the armys alcohol and drug policy 
unit 
the army leadership made the decision that we wanted to 
have a greater capability for deterrence so that soldiers knew that 
if they use drugs they are going to be at risk for the 
consequences mrs smith said 
the new tests will include checks against opiates such as 
morphine and codeine amphetamines such as speed and phenclydine 
more commonly known as pcp or angel dust said army spokeswoman 
paige eversol 
everyone can be expected to be tested at least once a year 
ms eversol said we mean business 
drug use by military personnel already has dropped dramatically 
in recent years officials say 
steve duncan assistant secretary of defense in charge of drug 
policy said about 27 percent of the military forces overall tested 
positive for drug use in 1980 but last year the number was down to 
48 percent 
in the army mrs smith said in 1983 10 percent of all 
samples that we sent to the laboratory were positive in 1988 less 
than 2 percent of all samples come back that way 
not every sample among the 758000strong army force will be 
tested for all the drugs she said adding that the new tests will 
be conducted on a rotating basis 
soldiers in a unit that has been tested will not know which of 
the three newly added drug tests will be conducted on their samples 
but since some of the new drugs included in the tests can be 
obtained with legally prescribed medications soldiers who test 
positive for those drugs must be evaluated by a military physician 
to see if the drug use was proper mrs eversol said 
the army began the broader testing more as a preventive measure 
than because of any evidence that use of heroin amphetamines or 
angel dust is particularly high mrs smith said 
in fact she noted spot tests have shown that use of such drugs 
has not been above onehalf of 1 percent of the specimens that 
we have tested for that drug 
but the military leadership intends for the military to be 
drugfree ms smith said 
army policy requires every officer or noncommissioned officer 
who has a single positive drug test to be processed for discharge 
from the service 
an enlisted soldier who tests positive once is offered a chance 
for counseling and rehabilitation but a soldier who tests positive 
a second time must be kicked out of the service she said 
any soldier who is diagnosed as dependent upon a drug also must 
be discharged she said adding the army program is not designed 
to rehabilitate the addict its designed to rehabilitate the user 
in the 1988 fiscal year some 4600 soldiers were kicked out for 
drugrelated offenses ms eversol said

congress faces a host of billiondollar 
spending decisions this fall but a dispute over art and obscenity 
is directing much of the attention toward a relatively small 
appropriation for the arts 
lobbyists are waiting with blunt messages for legislators who 
return to the capitol this week from a monthlong summer vacation 
make no mistake about it warned a letter sent to lawmakers 
by paul weyrich chairman of a coalition of conservative groups 
if you vote to block the rep dana rohrabacher amendment we 
will alert our members that you are on record as supporting 
taxsponsored pornography 
rohrabacher a california republican wants the house to adopt 
senatepassed restrictions that bar federal funding for art that is 
deemed obscene or indecent or denigrates debases or reviles 
peoples beliefs based on religion sex race creed handicap age 
or national origin 
the word were putting out is not to let up at all said dean 
amhaus senior associate of the american council for the arts a 
nonprofit arts organization working to defeat the proposed limit 
the provision sponsored by sen jesse helms rnc is part of 
a 109 billion measure to finance the interior department and 
several other agencies during the upcoming fiscal year the senate 
passed it on a voice vote on july 26 
helms wrath was triggered by 45000 the national endowment for 
the arts spent from its 170 million budget to support exhibits by 
two controversial photographers one by robert mapplethorpe depicted 
homosexual and sadomasochistic acts another by andres serrano 
showed a crucifix in a container of urine 
the senate provision imposes a fiveyear ban on funding two art 
groups that sponsored grants to mapplethorpe and serrano 
the helms provision is not in the house version of the bill so 
the senate and house must find mutually agreeable language before 
sending it to president bush for his signature 
free speech does not require us to spend tax dollars to 
subsidize such photos says a radio commercial for helms 1990 
reelection campaign aired across north carolina two weeks ago the 
ad said mapplethorpes works were guilty of sexually exploiting 
young children and described him as an avant garde artist who 
died recently of aids 
general manager bryan mcintyre of raleigh nc radio station 
wptfam which ran the commercials estimates that threefourths of 
the telephone calls the station received about the ads supported 
helms 
rohrabacher said that in his long beach califcentered 
district support for his position is 95 percent opponents are 
merely a vocal minority he said 
rohrabacher faces an uphill fight in the house which 
overwhelmingly rejected efforts to slash the arts endowments budget 
in retribution for the mapplethorpe and serrano exhibits the house 
instead voted to cut the endowments coffers by 45000 the amount 
spent on the two artists 
opponents of helms proposal say they believe the public is on 
their side when they argue that the government should not censor art 
projects 
the larger question of state control is much more onerous than 
the possibility that from time to time some piece of art offends 
says anne murphy executive director of the american arts alliance 
a nonprofit advocacy group for the nations art institutions 
other budget issues facing congress when it resumes work 
wednesday are 
final passage of all 13 annual spending bills for federal 
agencies for fiscal 1990 
an effort by sen frank lautenberg dnj to extend a 
housepassed permanent ban on smoking on airline flights of two 
hours or less to longer routes the measure is part of the 
transportation spending bill 
completion of a bill providing 13 billion in savings through a 
combination of spending cuts and new tax receipts it is still 
unclear what taxes will be involved but a cut in the capital gains 
rate which supporters say would spark the economy and boost 
receipts is possible passage would probably enable congress to 
obey the grammrudman laws projected 1990 deficit target of 110 
billion 
extension of the governments authority to borrow money which 
expires oct 15 the mustpass bill is expected to attract numerous 
budgetprocess revision amendments

as her human handlers recounted linglings latest travails at a 
news conference sunday the blackandwhite animal sat in her nest 
cradling apples put there in place of her missing baby 
the tiny cub weighing only 31 ounces was born prematurely 
friday at the national zoo and taken from its 250pound mother six 
hours later because of concern of infection 
zoo officials said the cub first began showing signs of strength 
but then weakened despite aroundtheclock efforts by zoo 
veterinarians and pediatric experts enlisted from nearby childrens 
hospital 
the cub was placed in an incubator fed a special formula through 
a tube into its stomach and given antibiotics to fight the 
infection officials said 
every effort was made to pull this cub through its illness 
said robinson at one point when zoo officials managed to separate 
the cub from a sedated mother he recalled i thought wed won 
without human aid the baby would have died well before it did 
the infection would have run away with it he said 
mitchell bush chief veterinarian at the zoo said the cubs 
survival was an uphill struggle because of the premature birth and 
the infection during most of its 39 hours of life the care given 
the cub was similar to what a prematurely born child would receive 
zoo officials said a small tube inserted down the cubs throat 
and into its stomach was slightly mispositioned and that a 
minute amount of fluid entered the cubs lung cavity but bush 
said the amount of fluid was so small that it did not contribute to 
the cubs death 
bush said there had been concern from the start that the cub 
might have caught an infection from its mother which has had 
problems periodically with a kidney infection since 1983 and had a 
reoccurrence only a week ago the tiny cubs chances of survival 
were reduced further because it weighed only about threefourths of 
what a normal panda cub would weigh officials said 
three of the four previous cubs born to lingling also died of 
infection shortly after birth with the longestliving cub surviving 
for four days in 1987 because of the mothers problems with 
infection a decision was made nearly two years ago to take any 
future newborn away from the mother bush said that approach had 
never been tried before officials acknowledged 
no giant panda cub has yet been successfully bred in captivity in 
the united states although cubs have survived at zoos in mexico 
japan spain and china the native home for giant pandas 
the zoo staff will do whatever is humanly possible to provide 
the necessary care to support any future pregnancies and births 
robinson said 
ms stevens said lingling returned to the panda house after the 
anesthesia wore off and began searching for her offspring zoo 
keepers found after previous births that if apples are put into the 
nest the mother will for a time mistake them for the cub 
she still has her apples and is sitting in her nest cradling 
them said ms stevens the father hsinghsing was in a separate 
pen 
lingling and hsinghsing which were given to the united states 
by the chinese government in 1972 are the only giant pandas on 
permanent display in the country pandas are an endangered species 
with fewer than 1000 counted worldwide

with us military equipment and trainers 
arriving in colombia white house chief of staff john sununu says 
us troops could be ordered to take an active role in the war 
against drugs if that country requests it 
if president barco asks for a situation that might put 
americans at risk its a decision that the president bush would 
have to make sununu said sunday on cbs face the nation 
on sunday 65 million worth of us military equipment and other 
aid accompanied by up to 100 american military trainers began 
arriving in colombia 
sununu said the united states was providing the aid at the 
request of colombian president virgilio barco and the constraints 
on the folks and the resources that go down there are based on what 
president barco would like them to do 
sununu was asked is the president willing to risk american 
servicemen in this war on drugs 
the white house official replied well if that request ever 
came in im sure the president would recognize that the american 
public thinks that the drug problem is so tough and so important 
that there is a great feeling amongst american citizens that we 
probably should take even that risk 
defense secretary dick cheney interviewed on abcs this week 
with david brinkley also said american personnel in colombia 
would be at some risk 
i cant say with absolute certainty that there is no risk to 
our people in colombia he said theres probably risk to our 
embassy employees there the dependents are coming out because of 
that to the maximum extent possible we want to minimize the risk 
the colombian security forces will provide security for our people 
the pentagon chief said at this point no latin american 
country has requested nor has the president indicated any desire 
to send american troops into combat in latin america to deal with 
the drug problem 
in the current colombia operation he said we are not sending 
our folks into combat they are not going out for example with 
units of the colombian military to actually attack facilities of the 
cartel theyre going to be flying missions into colombia but not 
within colombia itself 
but cheney added i cant guarantee that its absolutely 
riskfree the possibility exists that they would become targets for 
the cartel there is some risk involved they us personnel will 
be able to defend themselves 
the american aid being sent to colombia includes two c130 
transport planes and eight twinengine a37 jet aircraft as well as 
weapons ammunition and communications gear

the highestranking chinese official known to 
have escaped from that country since the violent repression of 
prodemocracy demonstrators is calling for an international effort 
to bring down officials who ordered the massacre the washington 
post reported today 
chen yizi a former leader of chinas economic reform movement 
emerged from hiding in paris three months after leaving china the 
post said 
he criticized the bush administrations response to the killings 
in tiananmen square on june 34 the post said 
the crackdown was provoked by hardliners in the chinese 
government in an effort to gain control over the communist regime 
and put an end to zhao ziyangs economic reform movement chen was 
quoted as saying 
chen said he is organizing the front for a democratic china to 
be headquartered in paris adding that it will seek support from 
chinese exiles and other chinese who live overseas 
the post said chen would have liked to have the organization 
headquartered in the united states 
but the united states government has appeared to be reluctant 
to grant visas to dissidents and to help us be effective 
politically while france has been very helpful he was quoted as 
saying the attitude of the bush administration has been 
disappointing when you compare it to the support and sympathy we 
receive from congress 
the bush administration imposed limited sanctions on china 
following the crackdown chen said that if those sanctions are 
weakened that is oxygen for li pengs government and a bad 
investment for america because li pengs government cannot last 
long 
chen was the head of chinas institute for economic structural 
reform that helped zhao carry out many of that countrys economic 
reforms 
chen 49 said he was aware in may that he was being followed in 
china and he told the post he left beijing on june 5 two days 
after the military action began in tiananmen square he gave no 
details of how he escaped china 
chen described to the post a may 17 meeting of the chinese 
politburo in which zhao resigned under pressure from hardliners who 
wanted to crack down on the student demonstrators 
the student demonstrations brought to a head a twoyearold power 
struggle in the politburo over the reform issue chen told the post

forming a breakaway congregation the washington post reported today

paper he had oral sex two or three times a week with stallings in 
the church rectory for several months in 1977 
stallings could not be reached through telephone calls to his

the last air force titan 3 rocket 
roared into space with a secret pentagon satellite today ending 25 
years of launches by a workhorse booster that has hurled more than 
200 satellites into space 
the 16storytall rocket a 34d model blazed away from its 
launch pad at 154 am brilliantly illuminating the darkness as it 
rumbled skyward 
the vehicle is right on track said air force lt col ron 
rand the launch commentator 
the air force said it was the 135th success in 141 launches for 
the titan 3 
we close the book of the titan 34d and move on to another 
generation of launch vehicles said brig gen thomas w 
honeywill commander of the air force systems command id like to 
thank the entire air force and industry team for dedicated and 
dependable service 
officials provided no information on todays payload saying only 
that it was classified sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the rocket may have carried an advanced reconnaissance 
satellite 
a secrecy label has been placed on many of the satellites carried 
by titan 3 rockets since the first was launched here in 1964 
the payloads most built for the defense department have 
performed many strategic military assignments among them were photo 
reconnaissance communications monitoring missile tests 
intercepting military and diplomatic messages verifying soviet 
compliance with arms control treaties and establishing an orbiting 
system to provide instant alert of a hostile missile attack 
the titan 3s also have had some notable nonclassified launches 
including two viking spacecraft boosted toward landings on mars in 
1976 and the voyager 1 and 2 probes dispatched in 1977 toward the 
outer planets 
voyager 1 and 2 probed jupiter and saturn while voyager 2 two 
weeks ago week sent back stunning images of neptune and its moon 
triton as it completed a grand tour that included closeup looks at 
jupiter saturn and uranus 
the titan 34d launched today was the 15th for that model which 
is the most powerful in the titan 3 series it can boost 
31650pound payloads into low earth orbit or 4200 pounds to 
stationary orbit 22300 miles out 
the air force is replacing the titan 34d with the more powerful 
titan 4 the first of which successfully boosted a missile warning 
satellite into orbit on june 14 the new rocket can hoist 39000 
pounds to earth orbit or 10000 pounds to stationary orbit 
martin marietta space launch systems in denver has a contract to 
build 23 titan 4s for the air force for 51 billion the two are 
negotiating for an additional 26 rockets 
martin marietta developed the titan 3 series for the air force 
from the titan 2 intercontinental range nuclear missile which 
earlier had been modifed to boost into orbit the twoman gemini 
capsule in the mid1960s 
the space booster evolved through the titan 3a 3b 3c and 34d 
series each more powerful than the last 
with this launch the titan continued its unparalled success 
record said gareth d flora president of space launch systems 
titan expendable launch vehicles have been the backbone of the air 
forces space program for more than 20 years and we expect the 
titan 4 to continue that tradition

a gay former congressman who was forced out of 
office by a sex scandal nine years ago says the uproar over rep 
barney franks relationship with a male prostitute sounds all too 
familiar 
it has the strange familiarity of what yogi berra might have 
called deja vu all over again former rep robert bauman a 
republican wrote sunday in an article in the washington post on the 
controversy involving frank a democrat 
frank last month confirmed published reports that he had 
solicited and then befriended a male prostitute allowed him to use 
his washington apartment and paid him 20000 a year from private 
funds to do various chores frank acknowledged being gay in 1987 
the prostitute steven gobie claimed he operated a prostitution 
service out of franks apartment and that the massachusetts 
congressman knew about it frank has denied any such knowledge and 
has received signs of continuing strong support in his home district 
bauman called gobie a louse and a despicable character 
and warned the media and congress against censuring frank because of 
private acts saying the end result will be the decimation of 
government 
bauman was defeated in his maryland district after eight years in 
congress in 1980 when it was revealed he was gay and had been 
arrested for soliciting a male prostitute

us and soviet negotiators meet in leningrad 
later this month to talk about the illegal harvesting of salmon in 
the north pacific and possible regulation of bottom fishing off 
alaska 
the agenda may also include a discussion of the use of drift nets 
in the north pacific said ed wolfe the state departments 
ambassador for oceans and fisheries he said an international ban or 
regulation of such fishing may be possible after additional 
scientific information is collected 
the us delegation will include 10 advisers from the fishing 
industry in alaska and washington state 
both the united states and the soviet union are interested in 
negotiating a new salmon agreement that would be comprehensive and 
could potentially replace the international north pacific 
fisheries convention inpfc said wolfe 
the existing convention has been very effective since it was 
signed in the 1950s but times have changed the players have 
changed and there is a need for more regulation and cooperation that 
goes beyond the inpfc mandate said wolfe in addition the 
soviets are not members of the inpfc 
the united states japan and canada are the current members 
wolfe said the soviets have made a tentative proposal and the 
united states would offer a counterproposal during the leningrad 
talks 
us fishing groups have long insisted that foreign fishermen 
have been illegally catching salmon on the high seas and say such 
activity has hurt salmon runs in alaska washington state and oregon

fourteen police officers were killed during 
drug enforcement activities across the united states in 1988 says 
the washingtonbased crime control institute 
such killings of police officers have averaged seven a year since 
1972 when the fbi began publishing narratives on how police 
officers died in the line of duty according to a report released by 
the institute on sunday 
university of maryland professor lawrence w sherman who also 
heads the institute said part of the reason for the increase is 
that drug enforcement activity is increasing 
estimated drug arrests have set a record each year since reaching 
708000 in 1984 rising to 11 million in 1988 sherman said 
the numbers of police murders per 100000 drug arrests rose from 
71 to in 1984 to 122 per 100000 in 1988 
the record rate however was in 1976 when 196 officers died 
per 100000 arrests followed by 1980 when there were 189 police 
killings for every 100000 drug arrests 
while the risk of death per arrest is still not as high as in 
the record years of 1976 and 1980 this trend is still an ominous 
one the study said

shots have been fired and barricades set up 
as a coal strike has turned into open warfare in southern west 
virginia 
in rum creek hollow striking miners have built a barrier of old 
tires railroad ties and even a soggy used couch to keep coal 
trucks out 
about a mile up the road at the mouth of slab fork hollow 
pickets have erected a shield of timbers and sandbags to block the 
bullets from automatic weapons and other guns they say have been 
fired by mine guards and nonunion workers 
there is evidence of violence on both sides according to state 
police superintendent jack buckalew 
some of the mine equipment has been hit by gunfire he 
said its obvious there have been gunshots into the picket 
shacks 
the united mine workers union has been on strike against pittston 
coal group inc since april in a dispute over wages and benefits 
the strike affects 1900 pittston miners in west virginia 
virginia and kentucky including 300 in logan county pittston has 
been seeking concessions that many miners fear will set an 
industrywide precedent 
there have been minor incidents of violence throughout the 
strike the violence began to increase during wildcat walkouts in 
the east and midwest in june and july 
the situation became much worse when the at massey coal co 
reopened the rum creek mine in early august on aug 21 the strike 
was expanded to masseys nonunion operations in logan county 
on sunday about 10000 people rallying in southwestern virginia 
heard jesse jackson and umw president richard trumka blast the 
republican presidential administrations of the 1980s for what they 
called a hostile attitude toward labor 
during the past 10 years political leaders such as president 
george bush have used the american flag to pull the wool over our 
eyes jackson said 
pittstons elkay mining co subsidiary is within a mile up rum 
creek from masseys operation now being run by conserv inc a 
nonunion contractor the previous contractor encountered financial 
problems during wildcat strikes in july 
while union officials such as the west coast farm workers leader 
cesar chavez have praised the umw for its commitment to 
nonviolence pittston president michael odom has accused the union 
of thousands of violent acts since the strike began in virginia a 
judge fined the union nearly 45 million in july for what he called 
acts of terror including assaulting and threatening people in 
the coalfields 
along rum creek gunfire has erupted several times authorities 
said on aug 19 a union member was wounded in the arm he was 
hospitalized for a week and six nonunion workers were charged with 
attempted murder 
eight days later one of the six was charged with attempted 
murder again after driving a loader through a blockade of downed 
trees picking up a striking umw member in the bucket and carrying 
him more than 50 feet before being stopped by a police officer who 
witnessed the scene 
both sides blame the other for the violence 
richard zigmond president of masseys rum creek coal sales inc 
said pickets have been firing into mine property damaging equipment 
and endangering workers he said trucks have been hit by a barrage 
of rocks and steel balls fired from slingshots and he said miners 
swarmed over an endloader one day last week forcing guards to use 
tear gas 
eight umw members including charles gilliam a former member of 
the west virginia house of delegates have been charged with 
throwing rocks at company employees and vehicles 
huddled next to a picket shack behind the timbers and sandbags 
the umw members complained that security guards and nonunion truck 
drivers are heavily armed while pickets are barred by a court order 
from carrying guns 
zigmond says the employees open fire only to protect themselves 
and only when fired upon first 
each side is digging in as the violence escalates 
its a real confrontation there between the people working 
there and the pickets said buckalew the police superintendent 
one side has sandbags the other side has bulletproof guard

members of a church founded by freed 
slaves gave a resounding amen to four whites who came to say 
they were sorry for setting their building on fire 
the four pleaded guilty in october to breaking into church in 
southern kentucky and setting it on fire in may 1986 
before their sentencing they had paid 6000 to rebuild the 
116yearold church and prosecutors agreed to amend the charges 
from felonies to misdemeanors 
in sentencing them logan district judge dale l prince ordered 
them to apologize to the congregation or face contempt of court 
with a possible year in jail and 500 fine 
i think the general consensus of all of us here is that we are 
just amazed that this type of thing could happen said 56yearold 
sarah garrick who grew up next to the church and now lives in 
chicago 
when i lived here this would have never have happened because 
of the racial prejudices in the area i think its wonderful that 
the court made them come out here and apologize 
on saturday bill sircy 22 bowed his head and cleared his 
throat during the dedication of the new smith grove ame zion church 
before saying were sorry but i know thats not enough 
angela b estep about 19 added what we did was wrong it 
was an accident but it was still wrong and im sorry 
the others who offered apologies were sherri davenport 19 and 
danny smith 22 
the rev erskine wade tried to ease their fears before they spoke 
to 60 members of the congregation 
dont be nervous youre among friends wade told them and 
when i say friends i mean friends what happened happened and 
there is nothing any of us can do about that we are your friends 
now and we want to help you any way we can 
wade said that because the four made restitution most church 
members were not hostile toward them 
most are trying to be christians and i think they have 
sympathy for them theres no animosity just sympathy

despite col moammar gadhafis promise of 
continued support for liberation and alleged terrorist groups around 
the world western and palestinian sources say the libyan leader is 
cutting back on such aid 
the sources said sunday that gadhafi has told several palestinian 
groups they no longer will receive direct funding from his 
government and they should close their offices in libya 
the reports could signal an effort by gadhafi to appear more 
moderate as he tries to rebuild international ties 
the sources speaking on condition they not be identified were 
in tripoli for weekend ceremonies celebrating the coup 20 years ago 
that brought gadhafi to power 
one source in the palestine liberation organization said gadhafi 
has provided about 5 million since april 1988 to support the 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip with the money going direcly to hospitals universities and 
relief organizations the uprising began in december 1987 
the source also said gadhafis regime has not given any money to 
the plo since 1975 
if the reports are true the actions could reflect what appeared 
to be gadhafis efforts during the weekend ceremonies to improve his 
image with the west and reduce libyas isolation from the 
international community 
but gadhafi in his main anniversary speech friday promised to 
continue to support freedomfighters around the world 
declaring we stand in the trenches with you it is our duty 
economics also may be a factor in the stinginess libya currently 
receives up to 6 billion annually from oil revenues but it is 
estimated the government spends up to 8 billion a year and its 
foreign reserves are dwindling 
the palestinian source said gadhafi angered syriabased 
palestinian groups when he told them three months ago they would no 
longer receive direct funding 
a western diplomat said gadhafi refused to meet with leaders of 
the palestinian groups who flew to tripoli last month to ask the 
libyan leader to reconsider and he refused 
plo chief yasser arafat attended the anniversary celebrations but 
leaders of various other palestinian factions did not 
one western diplomat said saturday that gadhafi called in 
representatives of 70 different groups in august and told them 
they had to close shop here in tripoli and for financial 
assistance they had to go through official channels 
the diplomat who added he could not identify the 70 groups said 
official channels meant the request for funds had to be made to 
libyan officials and if money was granted it would be distributed 
through relief organizations 
us officials accused libya of being involved in the 1986 
terrorist bombing of a disco in west berlin that killed an american 
serviceman and a turkish woman us warplanes bombed tripoli and 
benghazi in retaliation 
president ronald reagan ordered an embargo on libya the same year 
because of terrorists attacks at the rome and vienna airports in 
december 1985 the united states blamed palestinian terrorist abu 
nidal for the attacks and accused gadhafi of harboring him

a federal grand jury is investigating 
allegations against a boeing division and at least one midlevel 
company official of overcharging the air force millions of dollars 
a newspaper reported 
the government contends boeing military airplanes of wichita 
overcharged the air force 11 million during the past decade on 
contracts to replace the aluminum skins of kc135 transports and 
refueling tankers the wichita eagle reported sunday 
because the fiveyear statute of limitations has expired on some 
of the contracts the felony criminal investigation is limited to 
alleged overcharges of 3 million to 5 million 
the defense department is considering civil action to try to 
reclaim all 11 million according to defense department sources who 
requested anonymity the newspaper said 
any convictions could result in a possible maximum penalty of 10 
years in prison and 50000 in fines the company could be fined 1 
million in addition to repayment of overcharges 
the newspaper quoted defense department sources as alleging the 
boeing division charged the government 12 percent to 13 percent more 
for aluminum than it was paying its suppliers a markup not allowed 
under such military contracts 
boeing military spokesman richard hill said the company has been 
cooperating fully with the investigation 
the issues pertain to the pricing of certain raw materials used 
in the performance of the contracts and it involves complex 
regulatory and accounting principles hill said 
he refused to explain boeings position further 
federal prosecutors plan to present a draft indictment to the 
grand jury before the statute of limitations expires early next 
month the eagle reported

scotland yards antiterrorist squad today said it 
was investigating a bomb blast linked to the campaign against salman 
rushdie the target of death threats for his novel the satanic 
verses 
police said an anonymous caller who mentioned rushdies book 
telephoned with a bomb threat shortly before the device exploded 
late sunday outside libertys department store in central london a 
woman passerby was injured 
the store was closed at the time but by day the area is one of 
the busiest in londons congested west end 
until recently libertys housed a penguin bookstore concession 
the satanic verses was published last year under the viking 
imprint which is part of the penguin group 
the novel angered religious moslems around the world who claim 
it blasphemes their religion 
viking penguin received death threats against its staff after the 
islamic campaign began and two london bookstores one specializing 
in penguin books were damaged in arson attacks on april 9 
there used to be a penguin paperback bookshop in the store on 
the ground floor near the area of our present bookshop but it 
closed a couple of months ago said a spokeswoman for libertys 
the new bookstore does not stock the satanic verses she 
said requesting anonymity 
the injured woman who was not identified underwent surgery for 
leg injuries and was in satisfactory condition at university college 
hospital 
she is the first person known to have been hurt in britain in the 
worldwide campaign by moslem zealots against the novel 
detective chief superintendent derek willison said that 10 or 15 
minutes before the blast police received an anonymous telephone 
warning which mentioned the satanic verses he would not give 
other details 
as police were searching the area the bomb went off on the 
sidewalk in great marlborough street near a window of the liberty 
department store where books were displayed 
willison said rushdies book was not among them but books issued 
by his publishers viking penguin were in the window 
libertys established in 1875 and housed in a mock tudor 
blackandwhite building on the corner of regent street and great 
marlborough street has an international reputation as a fashion 
leader in textiles 
willison described the bomb as small and other police 
officers said there was no damage to buildings but tracy ryan 23 
who was looking in a store window across the street spoke of a large 
blast 
suddenly there was a huge bang it was really frightening and 
the pavement sidewalk shook it was a terrible bang she said 
early today police sealed off the area around the store and were 
checking for clues and taking photographs they finally left at 5 
am removing barrier tapes there was a bloodstain on the sidewalk 
where the woman was injured 
rushdie has been in hiding since february when irans late 
religious leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called on moslems 
worldwide to kill him for his novel allegedly blaspheming islam two 
iranian clerics have offered a 52 million bounty for rushdies 
death 
rushdies american wife marianne wiggins has said she left him 
five weeks ago because she could not stand the strain 
moslems in britain have burned the novel and demonstrated against 
it in pakistan and india at least a score of people have been 
killed and hundreds injured in riots protesting the book 
in the novel prostitutes are named after the wives of the 
prophet mohammed prophets and that mohammed wrote the koran islams 
holiest book instead of receiving the words from allah

eagle laying to rest a newspaper name that survived nearly 117 
years

karen ann quinlans lapse into an irreversible 
coma in 1975 sparked a debate over a persons right to die that 
continues today as some people with severe disabilities such as aids 
seek death over suffering 
efforts by mary beth whiteheadgould in 1986 to get custody of 
her child after acting as a surrogate mother turned attention to 
reproductive issues most recently involving frozen embryos 
judges legal experts physicians and ethicists gathering this 
week say the 1990s will bring more life and death issues to the 
courts 
we have to give judges some medical and ethical background from 
which to decide these cases said judge gladys kessler associate 
judge in the district of columbia superior court the judiciary is 
taking the lead in this area not because we want to but because 
were being forced to 
things are moving so fast and legislatures usually for 
political reasons dont seem to want to address these issues and i 
dont blame them theres usually no right or wrong only ethical 
dilemmas added kessler who will be a lecturer at the conference 
chief justices in each state have been invited to send two judges 
apiece to the first national conference of the judiciary on 
bioethical issues to be held thursday through sunday 
twenty national organizations including the american medical 
association and the american bar association also have been asked 
to send two delegates each 
we wanted to hold the conference because these issues must be 
discussed to come up with some answers that judges can take back to 
their states said thomas russell associate dean of the national 
judicial college a school for judges on the university of 
nevadareno campus 
judges are expected to be wise and philosophical about these 
cases but theyre almost always very emotional issues and a judge 
must reach a solution that involves the least amount of turmoil for 
everyone 
more than 150 participants are expected at the conference paid 
for by the state justice institute and cosponsored by the college 
the women judges fund for justice and the institute of public law 
john robertson another lecturer for the meeting and a professor 
at the university of texas school of law said judges must learn the 
latest medical information to make sound decisions in cases where 
theyre often pressed for time 
weve got to start developing rules because these cases are 
only going to get more complicated as technology develops 
robertson said and there isnt any precedent or law to follow in 
most cases 
in one such case a tennesee judge in a divorce trial has to 
decide on the husbands request to stop his estranged wife from 
using seven frozen embryos they created through an in vitro 
fertilization program 
a federal court is reviewing a case in which a couple is suing 
the jones reproductive medicine institute of norfolk va for 
possession of their frozen embryo the couple moved to california 
last year and the clinic refused to ship it 
the latest right to die case surfaced last week when 
georgias attorney general supported a quadriplegics request to 
turn off the respirator that keeps him alive he wants a judge to 
let him activate a timer with his mouth to turn off a ventilator he 
has used since his neck was broken in a 1985 motorcycle accident 
the legality of authorities or friends assisting with suicide 
also has been an issue among aids patients and caregivers

syrian and christian troops clashed in 
gunbattles across beiruts dividing green line today after 
nightlong artillery duels that kindled forest fires in the central 
mountains 
police reported no casualties in the morning hostilities along 
the threemile demarcation line that splits beirut into moslem and 
christian sectors 
at least 826 people have been killed and 2449 wounded in 
fighting that broke out march 8 between gen michel aouns christian 
army units and syrian troops 
police said troops of the syrias elite special forces fired 
machine guns and hurled grenades on the lebanese armys 9th brigade 
at beiruts bombravaged port on the western tip of the green line 
the lebanese soldiers retaliated with tank fire and truckmounted 
machine guns said a police spokesman who cannot be named in line 
with standing rules 
the clashes later spread to the southern slums where the 
syrians barricaded in beiruts shuttered airport exchanged 
artillery and tank fire with aouns 10th brigade soldiers on nearby 
hills the spokesman added 
artillery duels had flared from dusk sunday to dawn in the 
mountain resort towns of douar btigrin ein eltuffaha and bekfaya 
starting fires in the pine stands that burned all night 
the towns form the eastern entrance into the christian enclave 
north of beirut that has been besieged by the syrians and their 
moslem allies since midmarch 
syrias main ally druse warlord walid jumblatt said in a 
statement published by several beirut newspapers today that aoun 
should leave lebanon as a precondition for a settlement with the 
christians 
aoun has pleaded for french help but france did not come to 
his rescue he also sought americas help and the united states did 
not respond 
what is aoun waiting for let him leave i am willing to take 
him out of lebanon he should go in order to avert further bloodshed 
and destruction jumblatt said 
he vowed to fight on to the bitter end if aoun stays and said 
mr general please spare us further death and misery please go 
go wherever you want but out of lebanon 
aouns spokesmen at the bombbattered presidential palace in 
suburban baabda declined to comment on jumblatts statement 
the confrontation erupted when aoun ordered his gunboats and 
helicopter gunships on march 6 to blockade three militiarun harbors 
south of beirut two of them run by jumblatts progressive socialist 
party 
jumblatt retaliated by shelling the christian enclave the 
syrians later jointed the bombardment and sealed off the enclave to 
prevent aoun from receiving arms from iraq his main arab backer and 
syrias arch rival 
the syrians intervened in 1976 under a peacekeeping mandate from 
the arab league but aoun maintains that syrias credibility was 
eroded when its troops sided with moslems in the 14yearold 
lebanese civil war

conflict has heightened in the roman catholic church 
over polish primate cardinal jozef glemps refusal to honor an 
agreement to move a convent away from the auschwitz death camp 
three of the four cardinals who signed the pact with jewish 
leaders in 1987 insisted sunday that it be carried out they include 
the leaders of france and belgiums catholics 
the three were responding to glemps suggestion last week that 
the accord be renegotiated 
prelates albert decourtray of lyon and godfried danneels of 
brussels and fellow cardinal jeanmarie lustiger of paris said in a 
statement that glemp could only have been speaking for himself 
cardinal franciszek macharski of krakow poland the other 
cardinal who signed the agreement said aug 19 that he was 
suspending the accord because of aggressive demands and protests 
by jewish activists at the convent located in his diocese 
glemp later angered many jews and nonjews with a sermon aug 26 
in which he said polish antisemitism would disappear if jews would 
abandon antipolish sentiments 
he asked jews to understand that it offended poles religious 
sensibilities and feelings of sovereignty to insist on removal of 
the carmelite convent which in 1984 was set up just outside the 
fence surrounding the former nazi concentration camp 
dear jews do not talk to us from the position of a nation 
elevated over all others and do not put to us conditions that are 
impossible to meet glemp said in the sermon 
glemp offended many jews by suggesting jews helped spread 
communism and by mentioning that some collaborated with nazis 
during world war ii or as businessmen neglected or detested poles 
pope john paul ii has not commented on the dispute vatican 
officials said in rome that the polishborn pope believes the polish 
church must resolve it 
jewish groups say the convent and its christian religious 
symbols including a 23foot cross offend the memory of the 25 
million jews who died there during world war ii 
under the 1987 agreement between a jewish delegation and the four 
archbishops the nuns were to have been moved by feb 22 to an 
interfaith prayer center to be built several thousand yards away 
glemp was quoted saturday in italian newspapers as saying it was 
a scandal to move the convent 
i want this accord to be renegotiated glemp was quoted as 
saying it has to be done by competent people and not by just any 
cardinal who doesnt understand the things 
in their statement issued in paris decourtray lustiger and 
danneels defended the agreement which they said was patiently and 
loyally negotiated over two years and the capacity of the 
negotiators on the two sides 
if the jewish delegation at the geneva meetings led by mr 
theo klein then president of the european jewish congress is not 
competent who would be they asked 
and if four cardinals including the archbishop of krakow are 
not qualified to represent the catholic side who might be the 
auschwitz camp is in the krakow diocese according to church law 
its archbishop has full authority there the cardinals who 
accompanied him belong to nations who in the west were among the 
chief victims of the hitler barbarism 
many poles argue that there is nothing offensive about nuns 
praying at a site where large numbers of roman catholics as well as 
jews were killed 
the jews should understand that devoting oneself to a life of 
prayer near the place where christians were martyred doesnt offend 
their feelings glemp was quoted as saying in the italian 
interview 
speaking to reporters sunday in lyon decourtray said he hoped 
the dispute could be resolved without requiring intervention by the 
pope who was macharskis predecessor as archbishop of krakow 
ill say that i am a little shocked a little hurt by monsignor 
glemps statements decourtray said but i want a clear 
understanding like mr theo klein i want auschwitz to become again 
a sacred place 
in warsaw a spokesman for the catholic episcopate marek pernel 
said today that glemp had not seen the cardinals statement that 
there would be no immediate comment 
the glemp comments reported saturday were the primates first 
published remarks on the convent issue since his aug 26 sermon 
seven jews including rabbi avi weiss of new york city 
demonstrated july 14 at the convent 
glemp was quoted as saying a squad of seven new york jews 
launched an attack against the convent but did not kill the nuns or 
destroy the convent only because they were stopped 
the seven demonstrators were roughly dragged away by workmen at 
the camp 
in chicago jewish leaders have called for a boycott of glemp 
during his scheduled sept 2125 visit 
only several thousand jews remain in poland from a prewar 
population of 35 million about 3 million jews were among the 6 
million poles killed during world war ii and most of the rest have

a watermain break that flooded the subway and 
left a muddy mess today on busy midtown streets caused the second 
major asbestos contamination in manhattan in two weeks

steam pipes sunday and the asbestosladen water poured into the 
street and into subway tunnels officials said 
the 63yearold 20inch underground main had been scheduled for 
replacement tuesday officials said 
asbestos has been linked to cancer and the breathing of asbestos 
fibers is known to be especially dangerous but the contamination 
was limited to the water and mud on the ground making the risk to 
people minimal if they avoided contact with it deputy mayor robert 
esnard said 
consolidated edison which owns the steam pipe said no asbestos 
fibers became airborne the utility had an underground steam pipe 
burst on aug 19 spewing fibers and forcing the evacuation of an 
apartment building 
the watermain break cut off water service temporarily sunday 
and 20 buildings including a hospital remained without hot water 
today because the steam pipes were turned off the hot water would 
not be turned on until the citys cleanup was complete said laurie 
hanson a con ed spokeswoman

to traffic at least through tuesday as cleanup crews used foam and 
water to get rid of the asbestos debris said department of

in international relations which we are witnessing but in which we 
have not always participated 
to this end he said it must discard various ideological 
concepts 
the movement a strong advocate of decolonization and the 
struggle against imperialism in the 1960s and 1970s has been 
steadily declining in importance during the past decade a series of 
wars among member countries deteriorating economies and eastwest 
detente have relegated it to the sidelines of international politics

adoption at the summit a draft document stressing the need for a 
northsouth dialogue to stimulate economic development and 
calling for settlements in conflicts among member countries 
the draft avoids polemical attacks on the west a hallmark of 
previous summit declarations for the first time it also includes 
references to respect of human rights environmental issues and the 
need to combat drug trafficking

zimbabwe told the session that a dialogue between industrial 
northern nations and developing southern countries was no longer a 
choice but a necessity

dialogue with creditor nations to resolve the deepening debt 
crisis

underground palestinian leaders today told 
residents of the israelioccupied territories to stop killing 
suspected collaborators without approval from the leadership 
the statement appeared to be aimed at stemming a rash of killings 
that have left 106 arabs dead since the palestinian uprising began 
in december 1987 most of the dead were accused of collaborating 
but some were suspected of drug sales or prostitution 
nearly twothirds of the deaths have occurred this year 
including 13 in august and six this month 
the israeli army says at least 245 collaborators have also been 
wounded by fellow arabs 
in their latest underground leaflet leaders of the revolt said 
palestinians should refrain from rash decisions about suspected 
collaborators and consult the uprising leaders before warning or 
punishing them 
a chance should be given to repent and dialogue and 
watchfulness should be employed as a better alternative than 
punishment said the leaflet which was circulated in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
israeli officials on sunday announced that rules for shooting at 
suspected enforcers of the uprising would be broadened they said 
israeli forces would be allowed to use live ammunition at any hour 
of the day or night to stop masked palestinians trying to avoid 
arrest 
sources said that previously troops could only use live 
ammunition in such circumstances at night 
there have been increasing reports that israeli security forces 
are arming collaborators the hebrew daily maariv said today that 
the arabs were also receiving weapons training 
in scattered clashes today in the territories seven palestinians 
were reported wounded by army gunfire 
in the 21month uprising aimed at ending israeli rule 557 
palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians and 
39 israelis have died in the violence 
also today two members of the civil guard were dismissed for 
failing to act on reports that subordinates beat 20 arabs three 
weeks ago in a dormitory five of the arabs were hospitalized 
the independent yediot ahronot said that in addition to beating 
the arabs the volunteer policemen took them to a rooftop and

east germany has delayed the mass exodus 
of its citizens to the west from hungary a hungarian official was 
quoted as saying today 
interior minister istvan horvath indicated it might even be weeks 
before the thousands of east germans are allowed to leave hungary in 
the unique emigration opportunity 
about 5000 east germans are huddled in emergency camps in 
hungary awaiting safe passage to west germany bonn and communist 
hungary agreed on a plan in which the east germans would be allowed 
to emigrate to the west and red cross officials overseeing the 
camps said the exodus may take place this week 
but horvath interviewed in the hamburg weekly stern was quoted 
as saying east and west germany must reach agreement in the refugee 
crisis and that this could take perhaps a month or one and a 
half 
stern did not say when the interview took place a foreign 
ministry spokesman in bonn said he knew of no change in budapests 
position 
a wellplaced hungarian official speaking on condition of 
anonymity told the associated press his government is reluctant to 
authorize the mass transport to west germany until it can placate 
its angry allies in east berlin 
there is need for further talks with east germany he said 
red cross official wolfgang wagner said sunday the caravan would 
begin leaving this week fueling speculation that hungary would risk 
east german displeasure but was waiting for the maximum number of 
refugees to arrive at the camp so it could make the transfer a 
onetime occurrence 
unseasonable cold and intermittent drizzle at the refugee camps 
increased the pressure on the hungarians to begin the transfer 
outside one of the five emergency camps sheltering shivering 
refugees west german diplomat gunter mulack told reporters that 
bonn is just waiting for budapests word to launch the caravan 
westwards through austria to newly built tent cities in bavaria 
if successful the transfer would amount to the largest single 
transfer of east germans to the west since the berlin wall was built 
in 1961 and would represent unprecedented cooperation between an 
east bloc and nato nation to resettle thousands of citizens of 
another warsaw pact country in the west 
more than 500 new arrivals registered today with red cross 
officials managing the four overflowing camps in budapest and a 
fifth opened friday in zanka 
the lake is a popular destination with many of the 1 million east 
germans who holiday in hungary each year up to 200000 are 
currently thought to be in the country and hungarian premier miklos 
nemeth has said up to 20000 of them may want to go to west germany 
some of the east germans have been camping out for more than four 
weeks and a few are said to be suffering from colds and other 
illnesses 
vacationing east germans began crowding the west german embassy 
in july to demand safe passage to west germany forcing the closure 
of the mission last month 
hungarian officials have maintained throughout that resolution of 
the standoff was a bilateral matter between the two germanys 
but communist party president rezso nyers told a visiting west 
german politician last week that budapest would allow the east 
germans to go west in effect breaking a 1969 bilateral agreement 
with allied east berlin to send back those who try to flee 
the decision has clearly embittered east germany whose hardline 
communist leadership has been increasingly critical of hungarys 
recent reforms and moves toward a multiparty democracy 
with legal travel to the west difficult but permission for trips 
to hungary relatively easy to obtain thousands of east germans have 
decided to test hungarys new commitment

national guardsmen with rifles helped 
enforce an overnight curfew after a second night of violence 
followed the looting of more than 100 stores by young people in town 
for a fraternity festival 
the curfew issued after a labor day weekend gathering of students 
from mostly black colleges turned violent was lifted this morning 
the resorts main thoroughfare atlantic avenue was reopened and 
families began heading for the beach for the last holiday of the 
summer 
officials in this town of 250000 praised police but a civil 
rights leader said officers contributed to the tension that touched 
off the riot 
a 35minute sweep by clubwielding officers late sunday added 
dozens of arrests to the 160 arrests and 395 citations between 
friday evening and sunday afternoon police had no immediate figures 
on the number of arrests overnight 
two people both over college age were shot in the first night 
of violence 
last year everything was real nice there was no violence 
but this year the place was jammed with police and they were 
hassling people said paul williams a 21yearold student from 
philadelphias temple university 
another witness said some participants chanted a slogan from the 
hit film do the right thing which is about racial violence in 
new york city 
we will not tolerate lawlessness from anybody mayor meyera 
e obendorf said let the word go out that virginia beach will not 
stand by and watch as unruly individuals trash our city 
in an interview on nbcs today show this morning the mayor 
said police have shown extraordinary restraint in making 
arrests she said police had fired no shots and had not used tear 
gas 
she said the city has gone out of its way to welcome the 
young people gathered for the annual greekfest which attracts 
students from up and down the east coast she said some students had 
complaints about the way they were treated but theres no excuse 
for trashing a city if youre not happy with your circumstances 
but jack w gravely president of the virginia chapter of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people faulted 
the citys tactics as much as an element who came to disrupt the 
students gathering 
during last years greekfest police cleared smaller groups of 
young people from the street other large fraternity gatherings have 
erupted in violence in the past including a beach party in wantagh 
ny in july at which three people were shot and some florida 
towns packed with college students every spring have seen scattered 
street disturbances alcohol problems and vandalism over the years 
sunday night dozens of officers and 150 national guardsmen armed 
with assault rifles and wooden batons left the visitors center for 
the beach area two blocks away 
once the police came on the scene the tension level rose 
gravely said the students had what i call an attitude of 
controlled defiance they did not understand what they had done to 
warrant this treatment 
he said virginia beach officials should have been better prepared 
for the annual gathering of students from predominantly black east 
coast colleges 
city officials said they had no choice but to use force after 
young people went on a rampage early sunday down beachfront atlantic 
avenue 
the authorities estimated 100000 young people jammed a 30block 
section around 215 am when police tried to clear the streets 
shots were fired more than 100 businesses were looted and small 
fires were set in the streets city officials said 
by the time order was restored around dawn four people were 
reported injured they remained in hospitals today two with gunshot 
wounds one critically injured in a balcony fall and one in serious 
condition after an auto accident during the disturbance 
by 6 pm sunday atlantic avenue was again crowded with young 
people though many shops were boarded up two hours later 
officials closed all streets leading into the beach allowing in 
only residents 
a short time later the guardsmen moved in followed by 
explosions that sounded like firecrackers causing momentary panic 
among about 250 young people 
bottles were thrown at officers tenman squads of police backed 
by an armored state police truck and a swat team began making 
arrests 
by 930 pm hundreds of police in wedge formations swept the 
beachfront with a police helicopter overhead they were met by a 
hail of bottles from balconies and parking decks but cleared the 
streets by 11 
when they tried to move people it went crazy said errin 
smith 20 of new york people were yelling fight the power at 
first people were just having a good time but they harassed us from 
the minute we got here 
fight the power is the musical theme of do the right 
thing a current movie about racism and the death of a young black 
man at the hands of police 
the mayor said the decision to clear the streets was made by 
commanders at the scene after reports of looting and shots fired 
gravely said he and an naacp attorney were meeting with the mayor 
at the time and were not told of any looting or shooting 
its been like were being singled out because we are young and 
black said charles stone 23 of new york city 
merchants denied slighting the students most of whom they said 
were nice but some shopkeepers said they were not surprised by the 
trouble 
we tried to welcome these people wed been hearing rumors all 
week that something was going to happen said bobbi basnight an 
atlantic avenue merchant 
our problem is we had so many people in a small area said 
arnie cohen whose shop was spared i dont care if they were 
jewish black or whatever with all those people with so little 
to do and some of them drinking its a volatile situation

a powerful earthquake off alaska early 
today prompted 5000 residents of kodiak to take to higher ground 
for fear a seismic sea wave would hit at dawn but the threat 
subsided without incident officials said 
the quake registering 69 on richter scale struck at 915 am 
edt and was centered about 140 miles southwest of kodiak island 
said the us geological survey in golden colo there was no 
immediate indication the quake was felt on land 
george carte a seismologist at the alaska tsunami warning 
center had warned of a possible tsunami in alaska and british 
columbia with kodiak the first point to be hit about 11 am edt 
but lifted the warning within hours 
were past our eta and theres been no wave action said 
kodiak police dispatcher kathy cliver police said they would allow 
some 5000 residents back into their homes in the island community 
at the foot of a mountain 
carte said the centers gauge at sand point 180 miles west of 
the quakes epicenter recorded a small tsunami of less than 
onehalf foot 
therefore no destructive tsunami threat exists for coastal 
areas in the pacific he said 
some small sealevel changes may be recorded however as local 
conditions can cause a wide variation in tsunami wave action the 
allclear determinations must be made by local authorities 
carte gave no estimate of how big a wave generated by the quake 
might be 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion in which every 
increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude 
an earthquake of 7 is a major quake capable of widespread heavy 
damage 
the 1964 alaska quake that killed 131 people measured 84 while 
the san francisco quake of 1906 was estimated to register 83

spokeswoman said according to the national radio network caracol 
he was a business administrator for a medellinbased paint company 
pintuco the countrys largest 
pintucos factory was bombed last thursday in one of an almost 
daily series of attacks blamed on the cocaine cartels 
col luis camejo the national police commander for antioquia 
province said the gunman began to fire indiscriminately 
on sunday night a bomb tore through shops in an industrial 
suburb of medellin and wounded five people authorities said 
the bomb attack came just hours after us military gear began 
arriving along with ground crews trainers and technicians for use 
in the governments 2weekold offensive against the nations 
ruthless and powerful cocaine chietains

cross in itagui said by telephone the blast came half an hour 
before a 10 pm to 6 am curfew took effect in medellin and 
several suburbs including itagui 
there was no claim of responsibility but the attack was similar 
to others carried out by drug traffickers who are combating an 
unprecendented government antinarcotics sweep that began aug 18 
when a leading presidential hopeful was assassinated 
in the sweep authorities have seized hundreds of millions of 
dollars in property and arrested thousands of suspects 
two bombs were tossed from a motorcycle into a garden of 
medellins intercontinental hotel on sunday but no one was hurt 
police said 
in the northwestern city of monteria a c123 airplane of the 
us state departments antinarcotics division burned at an airport 
sunday a us embassy spokesman in bogota said 
the plane was bound from peru to the united states when it made 
an emergency landing in monteria because an engine failed the 
spokesman said he said the cause of the fire was being investigated 
drug traffickers have declared a total and absolute war on 
the state judges industrialists and journalists in response to the 
government crackdown which has included seizure of their property 
and renewal of extradition to the united states 
eight a37 observation and attack jets from air national guard 
bases in illinois and michigan were expected to be delivered today 
to the countrys military at the caribbean port city of barranquilla

officials and judges who prosecute drug traffickers 
the aid began arriving sunday when two hulking us c130 
transport planes landed at a bogota air base they were formally 
handed over by us air force officials and mcnamara to the 
colombian military 
the c130s powered by four turboprop engines can take off and 
land on unpaved runways as short as 3000 feet and could be used in 
raids on remote cocaleaf plantations and clandestine 
cocainerefining laboratories 
five uh1h transport helicopters which the pentagon already said 
would be given to colombias antidrug forces were to arrive 
tuesday mcnamara said 
washington has said as many as 200 american military personnel 
may come to colombia to assist security forces in installing and 
operating the american equipment this is a potential sore point as 
colombian officials have said they dont want american troops

opened to all races in recent years 
one angry white man barged into the crowd yelling and pushing 
but police said they could control the situation on their own some 
whites yelled to the officers shoot them dead

with shotguns and a water cannon but made no efforts to stop the 
protesters from moving onto the segregated beach

whitesonly beach near cape town on aug 19 at least two cabinet 
ministers of the governing national party have expressed regret for 
that incident but the government has given no public indication 
that it is ready to make major changes in remaining segregation laws 
under apartheid south africas 5 million whites control the 
government and economy and maintain separate districts schools and 
health services

a powerboat operator ducked and 
apparently saved his life seconds before the craft punched through 
an anchored houseboat and killed a woman asleep on a couch 
authorities said 
investigators were trying to determine if the houseboat was 
properly lit at the time of the crash off the florida keys there 
was no moon so it was a dark night said lt bruce buckson of the 
florida marine patrol 
no charges were filed three other people on the houseboat were 
not injured in sundays accident 
the 18foot fiberglass powerboat used for fishing knifed 
through the sheetmetal walls of the houseboat and emerged intact on 
the other side said coast guard petty officer john sewell 
buckson said the driver and owner of the powerboat william 
cannon estimated he was going 40 mph 
if he hadnt ducked it would have probably cut him in two from 
the waist up sewell said its a wonder he came out as good as 
he did 
cannon 23 of islamorada suffered cuts and was in shock he 
went straight to the coast guard station at islamorada after the 
accident the crash broke off the boats antenna preventing cannon 
from radioing the coast guard sewell said 
barbara basford 38 of jacksonville was injured when the boat 
passed over the couch buckson said she died at mariners hospital

is it someone you see at church is it a sailor who 
passed through town it could be either or one of thousands of 
others say experts working on a serial murder case thats raised 
many questions and yielded few answers 
for a while ronald ray griffith looked like a solid suspect 
he drifted into southeastern massachusetts about the time the 
first of nine victims was reported missing and took off again last 
fall just as the bodies stopped turning up along highways 
but when officials finally arranged to have griffiths brought to 
the seaport of new bedford from missouri where hes serving time 
for larceny the unemployed carpenters tips didnt pan out 
griffiths toyed with investigators before a lie detector test 
confirmed he didnt know anything about the crimes said jim martin 
spokesman for district attorney ronald a pina 
and so it has gone in the 10 months local state and federal 
authorities have tracked the deaths of nine women and disappearances 
of two others all of them linked with weld square a district known 
for drugs and prostitution 
the probe has cost 109000 and 3930 overtime hours 
undercover investigators have spent months on new bedfords 
seedier streets questioning prostitutes and drug dealers who are 
often fogged by alcohol cocaine or heroin martin said 
the circumstances surrounding the new beford slayings are the 
circumstances of sleaze and thats one of the critical problems 
he said 
martin said the list of suspects was narrowed from four to three 
once griffiths was discounted and the probes end is nowhere in 
sight 
we are by no means at a point where theres been any 
consideration of pulling back martin said theres a lot of 
work to be done 
but serial murder experts say the money may never produce the 
answers the victims relatives crave and investigators seek 
the odds are growing slimmer daily said jack levin a 
criminal justice professor at northeastern university and coauthor 
of mass murder americas growing menace 
some experts say investigators should look close to home others 
insist the assailants move on they disagree on whether systematic 
murderers inevitably lash out again 
theres one point however on which the experts agree serial 
murder cases are tough to crack 
if enough crime scene data can be collected and if you get 
lucky with a national system then maybe maybe at the sixth or 
seventh killing youll get leads said robert o heck an 
architect of the fbis serial killing unit and a manager at the 
justice departments office of juvenile justice 
bud merle executive director of the santa cruz calif criminal 
justice council said serial killers are more adept at escape and 
evasion measures than most criminals and their crimes tend to be 
more random 
levin however said his research indicates most serial killers 
stick to familiar territory in the dark world of serial killing 
the vast majority kill on a parttime basis while playing with their 
kids attending church carrying on a relationship with their 
wife he said 
under the circumstances and given the length of time since the 
last victims skeleton was turned up the experts said the new 
bedford murderer or murderers may never be caught 
if this case is ever solved it will most likely be in a 
serendipitous way not through some logical connection of evidence 
but because the killer turns up in another city and makes a mistake 
there levin said

the air forces last titan 3 rocket 
blasted off with a secret military satellite monday ending a 
quarter century of launches by a workhorse booster that has hurled 
more than 200 satellites into space 
the 16storytall rocket the powerful 34d model brilliantly 
illuminated the darkness as it blazed away from its launch pad at 
154 am 
the air force said it was the 135th success in 141 launches for 
the titan 3 family a success rate of 96 percent 
we close the book of the titan 34d and move on to another 
generation of launch vehicles said brig gen thomas w 
honeywill commander of the air force systems command 
officials said mondays payload was secret sources who spoke on 
condition on anonymity said the rocket may have carried a 
reconnaissance satellite 
many of the satellites carried by titan 3 rockets have been 
cloaked in secrecy since the first was launched here in 1964 
the payloads most of them built for the pentagon have performed 
a number of strategic assignments including photo reconnaissance 
communications navigation monitoring missile tests intercepting 
military and diplomatic messages verifying soviet compliance with 
arms treaties and establishing an orbiting system to provide instant 
alert of a missile attack 
titan 3 rockets also launched two viking spacecraft toward mars 
in 1976 and sent the voyager 1 and 2 probes in 1977 toward the solar 
systems outer reaches 
voyager 2 two weeks ago week sent back stunning images of neptune 
and its moon triton as it completed a grand tour that also included 
a closeup look at uranus 
the titan 34d can boost 31650pound payloads into low orbit 
about 150 miles up or 4200 pounds to stationary orbit 22300 miles 
out 
the air force is replacing it with the larger titan 4 the first 
of which boosted a missile warning satellite into orbit on june 14 
the new rocket can hoist 39000 pounds to low orbit or 10000 pounds 
to stationary orbit 
martin marietta space launch systems has a contract to build 23 
titan 4s for the air force for 51 billion and is negotiating for 
an additional 26 rockets 
martin marietta developed the titan 3 series for the air force 
from the titan 2 intercontinental range nuclear missile which 
earlier had been modified to boost into orbit the twoman gemini 
capsule in the mid1960s 
the booster evolved through the titan 3a 3b 3c and 34d series 
each more powerful than the last 
with this launch the titan continued its unparalleled success 
record said gareth d flora president of space launch systems 
titan expendable launch vehicles have been the backbone of the 
air forces space program for more than 20 years and we expect the 
titan 4 to continue that tradition

a troubling challenge facing president bush as 
he gropes for ways to combat drug smuggling is the emergence of a 
drug super state in latin america an entity with many of the 
trappings of a nation state 
the drug super state a term once used by a colombian 
attorney general shortly before he was murdered by drug traffickers 
last year has a defense establishment controls large swaths of 
territory issues communiques and even boasts what amounts to a 
commerce department which assiduously promotes the export of 
cocaine and other illicit drugs 
it also has what its defenders regard as a progressive political 
philosophy 
diego cordoba a lawyer employed by colombian drug barons 
contended in an interview with a brazilian newspaper last year that 
drug trafficking has done more to alleviate poverty and hunger in 
latin america than any government in the region 
another lawyer for the traffickers mario arango wrote in a 
bestselling book that the drug business has opened new 
opportunities for the underprivileged classes 
the money from the drug traffic has acted as a brake on the 
social and political deterioration of the country arango says 
according to us government figures as much as 17 billion in 
cocainegenerated revenues last year bolstered the economies of peru 
and bolivia the two largest cocaine producers in the world the 
figure for colombia the conduit for 80 per cent of the cocaine 
consumed in the united states and europe is estimated at 4 billion 
the super state boasts a formidible defense establishment while 
the underfunded colombian police have about 30 helicopters at their 
disposal one single trafficker jorge luis ochoa reportedly has 50 
aircraft and an arsenal of weapons 
unlike the colombian government which requires months and 
sometimes years to acquire weaponry for its military the drug 
traffickers unhindered by red tape can get what they want in 
days or even hours 
another characteristic of a nation state the drug lords have is 
the ability to declare war after colombian president virgilio barco 
ordered a crackdown on the drug traffickers two weeks ago 
confiscating millions of dollars worth of property and arresting 
11000 suspects the cartel issued a statement asserting the 
existence of a state of absolute and total war with the 
government 
if the drug super state has a capital it is of course 
medellin a city located about 150 miles northwest of bogota 
medellin is desribed as the central star of a sprawling 
fluctuating constellation by douglas payne director of 
hemispheric studies for the prodemocracy research organization 
freedom house 
the super state has numerous branch offices including one in 
panama where a key ally gen manuel antonio noriega from time to 
time has welcomed colombian drug kingpins needing a safe haven 
with the combined economic political and military powers of a 
government payne says the cartel is now acting like a state and 
asking to be treated like one 
he asks will diego cordoba some day be addresing the united 
nations offering proposal for cooperation in alleviating the social 
and economic problems of latin america 
will he present the first drugbased development model 
the drug barons for some time have sought what amounts to 
statetostate relations with the colombian government and some 
prominent politicians are advocating a dialogue with them 
thus far at least barco has held firm to his hardline 
nonegotiations stance 
we will not be cowed he has said we shall prevail over 
the forces that would destroy our democracy and enslave our nation 
but with president bush scheduled to outline is antidrug 
program in a speech tuesday raymond hesse a top official in the 
state departments bureau of international narcotics matters warns 
that unless decisive action is taken soon the drug traffickers may 
prevail 
the history of this hemisphere may some day reflect that what 
we do in the next year the next five years in this war against

the legislature monday dismissed the culture 
minister a novelist who supported freedom of expression among 
artists he was the highestranking government official to lose his 
post in a crackdown on political dissent 
also monday the official news media reported that several top 
government officials had been implicated in a campaign against 
corruption 
wang meng was dismissed from his job as culture minister by the 
standing committee of the national peoples congress chinas 
legislature 
poet he jingzhi who has served as deputy chief of the ruling 
communist partys propaganda deparment was named to replace wang 
staterun national television and radio reported 
premier li peng who ordered martial law during studentled 
prodemocracy protests last spring submitted the proposal to 
dismiss wang the official xinhua news agency said 
china central television said wang had repeatedly asked to be 
relieved of his official posts to concentrate on writing and 
literary criticism 
however there was speculation wang had been in trouble since 
china launched the crackdown on dissent beginning with a military 
assault on beijing protesters on june 34 that killed hundreds 
perhaps thousands of unarmed civilians 
wang did not appear with other ministers to greet the troops who 
swept through beijing to break up protests 
previous news reports said wang did not attend the party central 
committee meeting in late june that purged moderate party chief zhao 
ziyang who sympathized with the spring protesters 
zhao allowed a measure of freedom for chinas writers and 
artists wangs appointment in 1986 was regarded as a sign of the 
governments increasing tolerance of artistic expression but the 
government has been trying to reign in artists since crushing the 
prodemocracy movement 
as culture minister wang tried to walk a fine line between 
official ideology and artistic freedom 
shortly before his appointment wang said i honestly support 
party policy and also honestly stand for the creative freedom of 
writers theres no contradiction 
in their reports on the anticorruption drive the official press 
said monday that the top trade official in south chinas guangdong 
province was dismissed for corruption 
xu yunian director of the provincial foreign economic relations 
and trade committee was under investigation for spending 57000 in 
public funds on an imported car and portable telephones for his 
private use and for taking advantage of his position to obtain a 
fiveroom apartment for his family the reports said 
the ministry of supervision announced last week it was stepping 
up such investigations of highranking officials 
in addition a western diplomat in hong kong said monday that 
liang xiang governor of the southern island province of hainan was 
removed from his post 
however hainan officials reached by telephone would say only 
that nothing has been decided 
liang formerly party secretary in shenzhen a special economic 
zone next to hong kong was close to zhao and viewed as a symbol of 
chinas economic reform but reports from hong kong have said he was 
under investigation for encouraging family members to engage in 
profiteering

after a long day of performing brain surgery 
dr bernard stopak loves nothing better than slipping into a tuxedo 
grabbing a microphone and crooning lets get away from it all 
before a night club audience 
by day hes a prominent neurosurgeon at george washington 
university medical center by night hes a cabaret singer who cures 
his listeners blues with a fingersnapping repertoire of jazz and 
broadway show tunes 
a vocalist in the mellow tony bennett style bernie stopak has 
composed a few songs in his car a sort of portable studio equipped 
with tape deck the tunes pop into his head while hes driving from 
one hospital to another he says 
one of his originals remember me is the title song of his 
first album which was released in 1987 and features stopak singing 
such golden oldies as makin whoopee and old devil moon 
i was big in elkton md he says with a smile i was sixth 
on the charts at the radio station there 
stopak enjoys the best of both worlds medicine and show 
business and sees a link between the two 
the delicate surgery that i perform which is often a 
lifeanddeath situation is really theater at its most dramatic 
and it requires a considerable degree of creativity he said in an 
interview 
singing though certainly not lifethreatening can be very 
inventive in creating various moods and interpretations of music 
the son of russian immigrants who operated a momandpop jewish 
delicatessen in washington stopak grew up with music his parents 
gave him a violin when he was 5 and he still remembers his first 
case of stage fright 
i had to play at an elementary school talent show or 
something he said i got so nervous seeing the crowd that i 
turned around and played the violin with my back to the audience 
as he got older stopak played horns saxophone and clarinet in 
the local police boys band the old washington redskins band and a 
jazz band he formed in high school called the young moderns he 
worked his way through the university of maryland playing music 
he also sang in student musicals and toured with two university 
choral groups by early 1961 he was good enough to sing with a 
dance band at one of president kennedys inaugural balls where he 
attracted the attention of actress angie dickenson a year or two 
later he flew to california to see her 
i had a feeling i could make it in show business he said 
but miss dickenson turned my life around 
she told me whatever you do in life the first thing you have 
to be is a man thats what i always heard from my family zoy a 
mensch be a man i thought do i want to be singing and playing 
in life or do i want to do something substantial thats when i got 
serious about medicine 
for the next quartercentury stopak studied medicine in france 
and returned to perform thousands of operations and become associate 
professor of neurosurgery at george washington university 
specializing in brain surgery under a microscope 
then nearly five years ago some jazz musician friends made a 
surprise appearance at his 48th birthday party and stopak 
rediscovered the joy of singing with a combo after he won applause 
singing with the band at a friends wedding at the carlyle hotel in 
new york stopak decided it was time to pursue an afterhours 
musical career 
when he wasnt performing surgery he was performing at jazz 
clubs restaurants hotel lounges and other night spots in 
washington and new york until early 1988 when a traumatic divorce 
put his singing on temporary hold 
now remarried to a fellow neurosurgeon juliet and the proud 
father of a son born last june stopak 52 is eager to return to 
the stage and recording studio 
he no longer suffers stage fright but admits that his mouth 
still gets dry before he sings that first note 
i am much more comfortable in the operating theater than on 
stage he said in surgery you have the time to make a move 
then back off stop and think about it but when youre performing 
you cant stop if you make a mistake you hum a few notes laugh it 
off shrug and keep going 
said stopak in surgery if something goes wrong the worst 
that can happen is you lose the patient which is always agonizing 
on stage the worst they can do is boo and i can handle that

3000 riders 300 covered wagons and 2700 head of cattle set out 
today on a 60mile cattle drive in honor of montanas statehood 
centennial 
the drive began in this small community on the high plains and 
will end saturday in the stockyards of billings 
steam jetted from the nostrils of horses and cattle in the crisp 
morning air as the herd bawling and protesting began its journey 
south 
the cattle were moved by whistling and whooping drovers clad in 
bright yellow slickers and carrying lassos and bullwhips the 
animals were herded past brilliant green alfalfa fields through a 
canyon and onto the open range 
cowboys and the curious thronged this town of 2200 to 
commemorate the cattle drives of the late 1800s the event is the 
biggest planned for montanas 100th birthday 
there have not been this many horsemen together since the 
battle of the little big horn said barry mcwilliams an 
organizer it is stupendous anybody who doesnt see this is 
really going to miss it 
the route of the great montana centennial cattle drive ambles 
south from the musselshell river along us 87 a twolane blacktop 
to stockyards in billings 
organizers faced problems with 20th century environmental 
concerns humane society objections and private property rights 
as a result the cattle about 85 percent longhorns often will 
be separated by several miles from the 300 or so covered wagons on 
the road 
everything has turned out right said trail boss jim stovall 
ranch people just do it we are going to solve the problems the 
cowboys will do it i didnt really realize this was going to happen 
until i got up here wednesday morning behind a load of longhorns 
the nonprofit latigo corp the sponsoring organization 
originally contemplated 10000 cattle 5000 riders and 500 wagons 
but although those numbers werent met the celebration swelled 
roundup with visitors in cars with license plates from at least 20 
states 
by sunday evening beer stands were doing a steady business and 
countrywestern bands provided entertainment 
several people said they were taking part in the drive because 
they expect it to be a unique experience 
i dont want to brag said sam redding of hardin but well 
never see anything like this again 
ive never done anything like this and i dont know anybody 
who has said george schiller of east helena 
ellen hargrave who runs a ranch outside kalispell with her

ileana roslehtinen heads to washington this week to 
become the first cubanamerican in congress the latest 
demonstration of the exile communitys growing political power 
but some doubt whether the conservative and fiercely 
anticommunist republican will fit in with the other hispanic 
members of congress mostly liberal democrats in building 
influence for the nations 20 millionplus hispanicamericans 
the hispanic caucus is social issuesoriented and i think 
shell have difficulty with her views said alfredo duran a 
cubanborn lawyer and former state democratic chairman 
ms roslehtinen 37 was elected a week ago to the house seat 
held for 27 years by democrat claude pepper before his death may 30 
she was elected almost solely on hispanic mostly cubanamerican 
votes after a campaign in which she accused democrat gerald richman 
of bigotry for his claim that he was running for an american 
seat 
ms roslehtinen will become the 12th member of the hispanic 
caucus which is dominated by representatives of mexicanamerican 
and puerto rican descent she will be the only hispanic republican 
with a vote in congress 
marguerita roque staff director of the hispanic caucus said in 
washington that the caucus has focused in recent years on such 
issues as bilingual education immigration health care getting 
undocumented aliens counted in the federal census and minority 
business development 
she said the caucus which also has 58 associate members who are 
nonhispanic also has become more involved in us foreign policy 
particularly in central america 
cubanamericans leaving a communist homeland have tended to 
emphasize foreign policy and distrust of big government and taxes 
the average income and employment of the more than 1 million 
cubanamericans are higher than that of other hispanic minority 
groups 
definitely the cubans are much more conservative than the rest 
of the hispanic community said duran 
ms roslehtinen said during her campaign that she believes she 
can explain the communist threat to other members of the hispanic 
caucus she said her background as an educator should help as she 
tries to work with hispanics on issues of common ground 
some cubanamerican leaders say ms roslehtinens views 
represent older cuban exile attitudes and not those of young cubans 
mayor xavier suarez an independent elected in 1985 as the first 
cubanamerican in that job said ms roslehtinen will make the bush 
administration more sensitive to hispanic concerns and can explain 
communist cuba without being fanatical about it 
duran said ms roslehtinen may help bring younger cubans to the 
democrats 
just wait until ileana starts casting her votes in congress 
duran said

us participants in trade talks said they urged 
japan on monday to give its consumers a better deal by increasing 
imports and changing the economic structure to bring prices down 
goods are expensive public infrastructure is inadequate and 
leisure time is scarce in japan even though nominal income here is 
the worlds highest an american delegate said privately we 
urged the government to find ways to solve these problems and solve 
them quickly 
american negotiators said they suggested broad changes in japans 
land use policies retail and wholesale distribution networks 
pricing and business practices to reduce japans 50 billion annual 
trade surplus with the united states and improve the lives of 
japanese citizens 
a japanese commentator said the us demands were like asking a 
healthy person to become sick but the us official said steps 
we suggested would be supported by increasing purchasing power for 
consumers and lowering prices we discussed a variety of ways 
japanese consumers would benefit 
he said americans raised the issues of tax and zoning rules that 
tend to limit land available in urban areas for residential housing 
and urged the japanese government to spend more on roads airports 
sewers and public parks 
in nine hours of talks monday the american side also argued for 
changes in japanese business practices that discriminate against 
outsiders and keep prices high 
another us official said keiretsu tightknit business 
networks and exclusive business practices prevent newcomers from 
penetrating the market 
dango or collusion and group boycotts are illegal but seem 
to occur nonetheless he said on condition of anonymity other 
practices such as buy japanese procurement policies are not 
illegal but do make entry into the japanese market difficult 
on the agenda for tuesday are japanese recommendations for 
structural reform of the us economy japans delegation is 
expected to press for reduction of the federal budget deficit 
increased investment in factories and greater efforts to sell 
american goods abroad 
japanese officials said they would urge the united states to 
improve vocational training programs increase the savings rate 
strengthen drug enforcement and focus on longterm investments 
rather than shortterm profit 
negotiations on japanese tariffs and other trade restrictions 
have succeeded in reducing such barriers but japanese surpluses 
with the united states and other industrialized countries remain 
high 
in this round of usjapanese trade talks expected to last a 
year delegates are focusing on the need for changes in the way each 
does business educates its children and structures its society 
both sides are expected to find ambitious structural adjustments 
politically difficult to achieve 
during his visit to washington last week prime minister toshiki 
kaifu said such changes must be made if the trade imbalance is to be 
overcome 
michihiko kunihiro deputy foreign minister told reporters 
monday the problems are broad and socially deeprooted so i 
cant predict at this point what degree of results can be achieved 
from the talks 
us participants in mondays talks said they expected to have an 
interim statement on the negotiations next spring and a final report 
on recommendations by summer 
we all think its possible to get a concrete result said 
lynn williams deputy us trade representative and one of the

south africa has been gripped by a growing campaign by 
antiapartheid groups to defy segregation laws the series of 
rallies and marches some involving violent clashes with police 
have been staged to protest the exclusion of blacks in wednesdays 
parliamentary elections

fw de klerk in zambia to discuss de klerks plans for ending the 
blackwhite conflict 
also at mondays meeting plo leader yasser arafat accused the 
united states of refusing to respond to the palestinian groups 
peace initiatives 
arafat blasted the bush administration for continuing to deny 
our people the most elementary and important human rights namely 
the sacred right of selfdetermination for all peoples in the 
world 
despite meetings with the plo during the last nine months the 
us has not responded to the palestinian peace initiative 
instead they adopted the plan of the israeli government to 
perpetuate the israeli control over the palestinian land the plo 
leader said 
arafat said aug 19 that the dialogue between the united states 
and the palestine liberation organization was deadlocked and could 
fuel the 20monthold palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied 
territories 
the united states in december ended a 13year ban on dealings 
with the plo after arafat renounced terrorism and recognized 
israels right to exist 
the nonaligned movements ninth summit is aimed at revamping the

stroh brewing co has withdrawn 600000 in 
financing for national audubon society television specials after 
northwest loggers upset with an upcoming program on the regions 
ancient forests threatened to boycott the brewerys products 
environmentalists say 
a spokeswoman for the detroitbased brewer said stroh was 
reviewing its underwriting of the audubon series but said the 
review was driven by the need to cut costs rather than the loggers 
concerns and that no decision has been made 
i want to stress any consideration or thought of canceling 
future contributions to the audubon societys program productions is 
completely independent from concerns related to the upcoming program 
ancient forests rage over trees said lacey logan 
however environmental sources who spoke on the condition they 
remain anonymous said the company had suggested to the audubon 
society that changes be made in the program to make it more 
favorable to the loggers and that the money was withdrawn when the 
society refused to change the program 
logging interests in the northwest saw an ad for the program 
and they started to put a lot of pressure on stroh said one 
source they were prepared to launch a nationwide boycott 
ms logan conceded that loggers had been in contact with the 
brewery 
we have been having discussions with logging interests 
regarding the programs content she said but insisted that the 
review of backing for the series had nothing to do with those talks 
we have made no decisions said ms logan all sponsorships 
and community activities are under review 
stroh recently announced it would cut more than onethird of its 
workforce in detroit in an effort to streamline its operation and 
cut costs 
the timber industry and environmentalists have been locked in a 
bitter struggle for months over the future of logging in the 
northwests old growth forests which provide prime habitat for the 
northern spotted owl 
the audubon society is among the environmental groups that have 
sought to have the owl protected as a threatened or endangered 
species and logging in the ancient forests was stopped 
christopher palmer an audubon vice president and executive 
producer of the television series would say only that stroh had 
dropped its funding he declined to discuss any threatened loggers 
boycott 
stroh has withdrawn their support said palmer they said 
it had nothing to do with the ancient trees film 
but several sources said stroh told the audubon society of its 
decision to drop its funding the same day the society refused to 
make changes in the program 
palmer said he felt the program on the trees was fair and 
balanced and that strohs decision to drop its underwriting could 
put the entire series in jeopardy 
stroh has provided about half the money for the series with 
turner broadcasting system providing the balance 
the show on the ancient forests is scheduled to air on cable 
television on sept 24 and on public television later 
actor paul newman is host and moderator for the hourlong show 
the audubon society has been producing four shows a year for the 
past five years

the treasury department has new evidence that a 
large number of americans living abroad cheat on their taxes and a 
new way to track the culprits 
if a sample studied by bryan l musselman of the internal revenue 
service is correct hundreds of thousands of americans living in 
other countries are not filing the tax returns that the law requires 
musselman did not estimate the loss to the treasury but in 1986 
the general accounting office which makes audits for congress 
estimated it at 620 million to 2 billion a year 
the gao said billions more are lost because americans at home 
make money in other countries and fail to report it 
earned income up to 70000 a year is exempt from us income tax 
for us citizens living abroad but they are still supposed to file 
returns and pay taxes on earned income above that level and on any 
unearned income such as interest 
musselmans report appears in this months treasury department 
volume 1989 update an analysis of statistics and trends 
in 1988 musselman began getting data from the state department 
under a new law on american citizens who apply for new passports 
from us consulates in other countries there were 73000 in the 
first year of operations he assumed that these are americans who 
live for a considerable time outside the united states american 
adults who go abroad need new passports every 10 years those under 
18 need one every five years 
revenue officials are matching the names from the state 
department against their master file to see who is filing tax 
returns and who is not 
no accurate data exist for the number of americans who live 
abroad and are not employed by the us government musselman 
wrote 
he estimated that 3 million americans were living abroad last 
year including about 750000 in the armed services for 1986 the 
internal revenue service got 264000 returns from addresses in other 
countries if it had received returns from abroad in the same 
proportion as in the united states there would have been about 12 
million 
its a bleak picture so far as tax collection is concerned 
musselman said in an interview 
many business people say it puts the united states at a 
disadvantage to collect taxes from its citizens abroad they say it 
encourages american companies in other countries to hire 
nonamericans 
i dont know of a single major industrial country europe or 
japan that taxes the earnings of its citizens when they reside 
abroad said bruce reynolds a tax partner with the international 
accounting firm touche ross and co 
the united states requires all but the poorest citizens to report 
their incomes wherever they live an unmarried person must report 
anything over 5100 a year 
if the income is earned americans overseas only have to pay 
taxes when a salary amounts to more than 70000 the military like 
other us government employees are not entitled to the exemption 
unearned income such as payments from stocks bonds real estate 
or other investments is all taxable whether americans get it in the 
united states or other countries though taxes paid to other 
countries can be deducted from american tax bills musselman said 
some of his figures give reason to think that a lot of the 
unreported income is unearned 
musselman studied a sample of 615 names he got from the state 
department and compared those with tax returns 
we can be 95 percent certain that the actual nonfiling rate is 
between 515 percent to 667 percent he said 
that would mean that one in every two or three americans living 
abroad did not send in returns he pointed out that this comes close 
to a figure from the general accounting office that 61 percent are 
nonfilers

a power plant on indian land that supplies 
electricity to three states is accused of casting a haze over the 
grand canyon but officials say theres little chance the plant will 
be forced to close 
plant officials say the coalfired plant produces power so 
cheaply in comparison to oilfired plants that theres no question 
of shutting down even if they have to install hundreds of millions 
of dollars in new equipment 
and while disputing how much the navajo generating station really 
affects the grand canyon plant officials and nearby residents are 
looking at the bright side saying cleanup efforts are sure to bring 
more jobs 
its the only major southwestern power plant without scrubbers in 
its smokestacks to remove pollution 
we are part of the problem but we are not the major part of 
the problem said tom hull a control room operator my parents 
are involved in tourism i dont want the grand canyon to be hazy 
the 2250megawatt plant one of the largest in the country was 
built in the early 1970s on navajo reservation land just outside 
town and uses coal mined on navajo land the plant is 80 miles from 
the center of the grand canyon 
the project is owned by a group that includes the federal bureau 
of reclamation and public and private utilities in arizona 
california and nevada it is managed by the salt river project a 
statefederal agency 
the owners pay to lease the navajo land and also pay the tribe 
for the coal 
last week the environmental protection agency said there was 
substantial evidence that sulfur dioxide emissions from the 
plant were reducing visibility at the grand canyon 
bob yunke a lawyer for the environmental defense fund said 
programs under way to reduce smog in los angeles and control the 
copper smelters in the region leave the page plant as the single 
major contributor to the problem 
cleaning up the emissions will translate to approximately the 
cost of a candy bar per month to the average customer he added 
the plant can generate electricity for at least 600000 less a 
day than it would cost to buy replacement power elsewhere said 
charles bruback the plants acting manager that means even the 
most expensive pollution controls estimates range up to 1 billion 
would be cheaper in the long run than scrapping the plant 
i would be amazed if there could be any kind of control 
required of us that would make this not a viable alternative he 
said 
the operation saves money because coal is cheaper than oil and 
because the coal is mined so close by that it saves transportation 
costs 
well be here operating this plant as long as it has economic 
life in it bruback said in fact there probably will be more 
jobs because of this 
thats good news for the 7190 residents of page built 
overlooking lake powell on the utaharizona line 
while the population has dropped since the plant was completed 
the project is still the economic mainstay of the town its annual 
payroll of 40 million includes more than 750 permanent employees 
and up to 1000 seasonal workers 
we live and die by that plant says will hannemann a real 
estate broker and seasonal plant worker 
the plant also means income for the navajos but lease and other 
payments go directly to the tribal government in window rock 300 
miles away critics complain that little of it comes back to the 
navajos living near here 
there are people living a mile outside the generating station 
that have no running water or electricity says denis tsosie head 
of the tribes local government agency 
still indians derive some jobs from the plant because its lease 
gives hiring preference to navajos bruback said indians make up 
about 48 percent of the permanent work force

president bush refreshed by nearly three weeks 
in the summer hideaway he calls his heaven returned to 
washington on monday after proclaiming himself eager to get back to 
work 
as if to underscore that sentiment the president left maine 
dressed casually and emerged from air force one at andrews air force 
base barely an hour later dressed in a business suit for the final 
helicopter hop to the white house 
bush who broke a jinx by reeling in a bluefish sunday caught 
two more fish in a final outing aboard his speedboat fidelity before 
he and wife barbara boarded the marine one helicopter at their 
walkers point retreat to begin the journey homeward 
meanwhile a white house spokesman roman popadiuk denied a 
report in the tehran times that bush had written personal letters to 
the new leaders of iran there has been no message sent by the 
president to the iranian leadership he said 
the united states last sent a message to the government of iran 
through third parties six weeks ago popadiuk said the united 
states has used the swiss embassy and other channels to communicate 
with iran in the past 
the presidents first task back at the white house was to finish 
work on the nationally televised address he will deliver from the 
oval office tuesday night unveiling his antidrug strategy 
bush who spent 20 days in maine at his sprawling home 
overlooking the atlantic appeared eager to get back to work as 
he put it sunday in an impromptu talk at services at st anns 
episcopal church 
he told his fellow parishioners that part of his antidrug 
strategy will involve asking americans to involve yourselves in 
the lives of others and to strengthen the bonds of community life 
the 78 billion antinarcotics plan crafted by drug policy czar 
william bennett is expected to stiffen penalties for individual 
users expand treatment for addicts and boost aid to the andean 
countries and others to help eradicate drugs at the source 
in launching this war against drugs bush is seeking to make good 
on the pledge in his inaugural address that this scourge will 
stop 
bush filled his days here with jogging golfing boating 
horseshoes and other activities and read david halberstams the 
summer of 49 a lengthy book about a classic pennant race between 
the new york yankees and boston red sox 
he also squeezed in a modicum of business dispatching 65 
million in military aid to colombia for its war against the drug 
barons hosting visits from danish prime minister poul schlueter and 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney and their families and 
huddling with bennett and top cabinet officials on the drug 
battleplan 
he also found time last wednesday to accept the 1989 outstanding 
citizen award from the kennebunkport chamber of commerce the 
choice was unanimous where he told the local boosters its been 
a joy to be here 
this is a place where we really enjoy ourselves but more than 
that kind of refurbish our souls and get our batteries all charged 
up and enjoy life really to the fullest said bush 
it was actually bushs second stay of the summer at the spot he 
calls this heaven and where he has come every summer of his life 
except one when he was off fighting in the pacific 
he is expected back again once or twice during a busy fall that 
will also see him holding an education summit with governors sept 
2728 in charlottesville va and journeying the following month to 
a latin summit in costa rica 
he has trips to at least seven states coming up in the next three 
weeks including a speech at the united nations on sept 24 even 
while he struggles with congress to reach an accord on the deficit 
and taxes and to unclog a backlog of nominees awaiting confirmation

his threeweek trip catching a fish

came ashore sunday holding aloft a twofootlong bluefish 
even as he fulfilled his vow to catch one before his return the 
presidents mind was clearly turning back to the white house and the 
first major item on his schedule a tuesday night address to the 
nation revealing his national drug policy strategy 
tomorrow it starts all over again i dont know what you guys 
have to do but i know what ive got to do head back to work

he said he needed to start studying hard for the drug speech 
the first presidential address he will deliver for broadcast on 
national television

going to be scared he said recounting how as a young child he 
would shake when called upon to recite a verse at st anns 
he said he will ask the nation to become involved in community 
service to help fight the drug problem 
in addition to the 78 billion antidrug plan bush is gearing 
up for rough sledding in congress on how to reduce the federal 
deficit and other budget and taxation issues 
he has a full travel schedule including an education summit for 
the nations governors sept 2728 in charlottesville va a trip 
to costa rica for a hemispheric meeting in october and short jaunts

eduard shevardnadze in wyoming it is anticipated they could set a 
date for a summit meeting between bush and soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev 
also looming is what to do about continued problems in nicaragua 
and panama 
reporters asked the president if he would be sad to leave the 
seaside resort where he has spent all but one wartime summer of his 
life 
yeah but im ready to go back he replied im ready to go 
to work 
the icing on the cake for a recreationfilled vacation was 
that he finally caught the bluefish he said 
his press aides summoned reporters and photographers dockside for 
his triumphant return to his walkers point home 
bushs inability to reel in a fish despite daily outings since 
his aug 16 arrival had become a media fixation first lady barbara 
bush son marvin and national security adviser brent scowcroft were 
aboard for the successful outing 
bush brandished the fish aloft as he motored his speedboat to 
shore he invited the press corps to stick around as he cleaned the 
fish and hacked its head off saving it for soup 
a tremendous fish a very strong fish he said estimating 
its weight at nine or 10 pounds 
he replied with an emphatic no when a reporter voicing an 
ongoing vacation joke asked if there was truth to the rumor that 
navy divers were below the boat helping the fish get on bushs hook 
later bush pronounced a great ending to his vacation when he 
and golf pro ken raynor beat scowcroft and friend spike heminway on 
the links 
bush also beat heminway in three sets of doubles tennis earlier 
according to heminway who said the president was on a roll

president bush back at the white house after a 
threeweek vacation put the finishing touches monday on a major 
speech on fighting drugs by attacking both supply and demand 
the oval office address tuesday evening will be bushs first 
formal nationally televised address since becoming president he is 
expected to outline a 78 billion program of stiffer penalties for 
narcotics users more treatment for addicts and more aid to latin 
american nations to help them cut supplies 
all three commercial networks and cnn plan to broadcast the 
speech at 9 pm edt 
before leaving his summer vacation home in kennebunkport maine 
the president told fellow parishioners sunday at church that his 
antidrug message to americans will be a call to involve 
yourselves in the lives of others 
bush is seeking to redeem a campaign pledge that he stressed in 
his inaugural address when he said of the burgeoning drug problem 
take my word for it this scourge will end 
the administration also has not ruled out sending us troops to 
colombia a chief source of cocaine to bolster the battle against 
drug traffickers 
white house chief of staff john sununu said the military could be 
ordered to take an active role in the war against drugs if colombia 
asks for it 
its a decision that the president would have to make if the 
latin american nation requests troops sununu said 
on sunday 65 million worth of us military equipment and other 
aid accompanied by up to 100 american military trainers began 
arriving in colombia 
some democrats are expressing skepticism about bushs commitment 
to the war on drugs 
the single most important thing the president must do when he 
announces his plan whatever the cost is to tell us how we are 
going to pay for it and commit that we will pay for it said sen 
joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee 
democrats may offer legislation to rival the presidents version 
depending on the administrations proposals biden added 
that could include debt relief for latin american nations to 
subsidize withdrawal of farm land from producing coca crops that are 
refined to produce cocaine 
democratic mayor tom bradley of los angeles said over the weekend 
that the size of the program bush is expected to endorse is 
inadequate 
i think that 8 billion is simply not going to do it he 
said bradley also said he fears the money will come from cutting 
back other domestic programs vital to the cities such as housing 
william j bennett the nations new drug czar who played in key 
role in devising the administrations battle plan has said law 
enforcement must go after the casual drug user as well as the drug 
cartels 
the idea is to increase the sanction for drug use at every link 
in the chain he said 
some of the details of the bush drug package already have been 
revealed 
administration sources said the plan will include sending some 
260 million in economic and military aid to the three main cocaine 
producers colombia bolivia and peru the final figure could go 
higher they said 
the package also likely will include some 925 million for drug 
treatment 12 billion for new prisons and 350 million to help 
state and local law enforcement 
the administrations crackdown on drug users also includes 
authority for judges to strip student loans and other federal 
benefits from drug offenders

president bushs new blueprint for fighting 
drugs faces a credibility problem in congress unless the 
administration specifies where it plans to get the 78 billion hes 
calling for to wage the war says a senate committee chairman 
appropriations skirmishes earlier this year over paying for 
current antidrug efforts already have some lawmakers expressing 
skepticism even before bush unveils his new initiative tuesday night 
the single most important thing the president must do when he 
announces his plan whatever the cost is to tell us how were 
are going to pay for it and commit that we will pay for it said 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee 
the biggest issues immediately facing congress upon its return 
tuesday from a monthlong vacation are a bill in the senate 
mandating that new services by provided to the disabled and 
prohibiting discrimination against them and a measure in the house 
to upgrade trade relations with hungary 
and the alleged sexual peccadilloes of four congressmen reps 
barney frank dmass gus savage dill donald e buz lukens 
rohio and jim bates dcalif will be examined by the house 
ethics committee 
the overriding topic however will be bushs proposed new 
strategy to dam the flow of tens of billions of dollars worth of 
cocaine into the united states annually and curb the appetite of 
estimated 24 million americans for it and other illegal drugs 
biden who will wield considerable power over the proposal bush 
sends to congress has repeatedly complained that many provisions of 
an antidrug bill approved last year turned hollow from a lack of 
funds 
it meant hundreds of fbi agents and hundreds of dea agents and 
hundreds of treatment programs all of which were promised to local 
communities and the american people never got into place after all 
the folderol he said 
this time he says the money must be earmarked 
it cannot be the blue smoke and mirrors of saying we are going 
to reprogram biden said if youre going to reprogram tell us 
precisely where is the money specifically going to come from 
white house chief of staff john sununu has said the 78 billion 
in new antidrug initiatives that bush will advocated will be 
scraped together through cuts in other programs 
administration officials however have offered no specifics and 
one officials speaking anonymously had said the administration 
hopes to keep secret about 30 percent of the new program 
biden said democrats may decide to draft their own alternative if 
they dont like bushs proposal 
meanwhile both the house and senate have a light week of floor 
action facing them 
in the senate lawmakers on thursday take up a bill to provide 
disabled individuals with the same rights accorded under the civil 
rights act of 1964 to racial religious and ethnic minorities 
the measure which has bipartisan support also requires 
wheelchair access to new and modified buildings public 
transportation vehicles and terminals and mandates wider use of 
telecommunications equipment for the hearing impaired 
a day earlier the senate will take up a 2 billion bill for 
paying the cost of running congress for the next fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 the house already has approved a 16 billion 
version 
legislation to extend most favored nation trading status to 
hungary comes before the house on thursday the bill would 
effectively reduce tariffs and other barriers against imports from 
hungary 
the house then plans to act on proposed changes in laws governing 
how commodity futures are traded in the aftermath of trading 
scandals at the chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile 
exchange 
among other things the bill would prohibit approval of new 
futures contracts by the federal commodity futures trading 
commission if the trading pits fail to meet new auditing standards 
requiring a detailed trail of transactions

from mcdonalds but thats just fine for inmate charles e wilson 
he won 1000 in a promotion run by the fastfood chain 
ive never won anything wilson said monday 
wilson 33 of brooksville fla is apparently the biggest local 
winner in the national mcdonalds instant winner promotion in which 
game pieces are peeled from soft drink cups said bob kennedy 
assistant manager of the conway store 
wilsons chances of winning were 476000to1 kennedy said 
adding that the restaurant sells about 1000 drinks a day each 
bearing a game piece 
city officials said wilson is apparently the only prisoner in the 
jail to ever win a fastfood promotion 
wilson was arrested thursday and is awaiting extradition to 
carthage mo to face a charge of possession of a controlled 
substance that was filed in february a spokesman for the jasper 
county mo sheriffs department said monday the extradition 
which wilson is not fighting should be complete in a few days 
officers said 
on sunday night wilson said he finished his meal and noticed the 
game piece on his softdrink cup 
i wasnt paying any attention i thought i might as well pull 
it off it was something to do wilson said i thought maybe id 
win a hamburger and theyd pick me up an extra one 
however i pulled it off and said do what 
i had to look at it a bunch of times i kept thinking instant 
winner its got to be 1000 he said its pretty good to be 
sitting in jail and win 1000 
wilson asked patrolman lynn carter to look at the game piece 
it said bigger than life instant winner of 1000 the 
patrolman said 
the prisoner had a real big grin on his face carter said 
he was just short of jumping up and down 
as far as im concerned its his he pulled it off the cup 
carter said im quite sure there will be no controversy over 
wholl get it 
hes in jail but youre still happy for him 
carter said a restaurant spokesman told him forms would have to 
be sent in to verify the win and allow wilson to claim the prize 
money 
we told him if we had to wed handcuff him and take him up 
there carter said needless to say hes real excited and 
mcdonalds is too 
kennedy said it might take up to eight weeks to process the prize 
claim

less than onehalf foot 
i was up in my sisters house and we just woke up to shaking

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki will 
announce nominees for the east blocs first noncommunistled 
cabinet this week the parliamentary leader of solidarity said 
monday 
meanwhile lech walesa objected to continued pressure by the 
communist party for more posts in the government and solidarity 
activists urged tough measures to halt polands protracted economic 
problems 
mazowiecki has kept secret his cabinet selections so far but an 
outline of the composition of the government could come as early as 
tuesday when solidaritys parliamentary caucus meets 
deputy bronislaw geremek the caucus chairman said in an 
interview monday that mazowiecki is close to announcing the 
government and that in a break with tradition parliament will have 
several days to examine cabinet nominees before voting 
we hope that in the next few days there will be a meeting of 
the club with the premier on the makeup of the new government and 
that by the end of the week hearings on candidates will be held 
by particular sejm committees geremek told the pap news agency 
geremek said the sejm or parliament could vote on the cabinet 
early next week sejm speaker mikolaj kozakiewicz said he expected 
the vote on sept 12 at the earliest 
in gdansk walesa responded negatively monday to communist party 
statements saturday that the party was promised a wide role in the 
next government 
communist first secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski and 
parliamentary leader marian orzechowski did not go into details but 
said mazowiecki had promised them more than two portfolios 
orzechowski said the party would be represented in all basic 
spheres of life 
the two leaders praised mazowiecki as a realist and indicated 
there was no danger the party would put itself in open opposition to 
mazowieckis government as had been threatened several times since 
his election 
i must say that i do not like it walesa told reporters in 
gdansk when asked about those statements 
poland belongs to everybody if poland is to be reformed 
then party members have to enter the government as reformers and 
not as party members they should think about poland and reform 
and not about the number of seats that fall to them 
walesa citing a supervisory role he was granted last month in a 
resolution by the solidarity caucus said he would warn and 
shout in protest if he saw someone getting a government post 
simply by right of party affiliation 
in the polish government there can be only reformers 
regardless of what kind of party cards they have he said and no 
reserved seats 
before the selection of mazowiecki as prime minister on aug 24 
solidarity promised the communist party that it would continue to 
hold the ministries of defense and internal affairs controlling the 
army and the police 
party central committee secretary slawomir wiatr interviewed in 
bonn on monday said the party wanted parity representation in 
the government he said that would mean six seats for the party six 
seats for solidarity and six seats divided between the trade unions 
coalition partners the peasants and the democrats 
but solidarity activists have hinted at a smaller role for the 
communist party saying that if it gets too many posts society will 
not feel anything has changed 
meanwhile solidarity activists writing in the prosolidarity 
gazeta wyborcza newspaper on monday stressed the need for drastic 
action to boost the faltering polish economy 
the economy is slipping out of control we are on the verge of 
hyperinflation said a frontpage commentary this means that 
the activities of premier mazowieckis government must be firm deep 
and quick 
it urged a tight monetary policy an end to restrictions on 
private enterprise the breakup of monopolies sale of state 
enterprises and immediate talks on rescheduling polands 39 billion 
foreign debt 
solidarity sen aleksander paszynski presented his own economic 
program in the same issue advocated an immediate halt to state 
industrial investments steep cuts in military spending 
renegotiating economic agreements with east bloc countries and 
ending most government price subsidies

ride to the nonaligned summit on horseback monday with 50 of the 
young women who guard him and a scuffle began when security tried 
to keep his protectors out of the hall 
maj abdullah senussi chief of khadafys security service was 
said to have complained at the highest level 
we were willing to let gadhafi ride his arab bay from dedinje 
suburb down to the sava center but when he asked for 50 of his 
bodyguards to follow we had to put our foot down a police source 
told the associated press 
gadhafi arrived an hour late for the meeting in his bulletproof 
cadillac rather than one of the audis that summit organizers put at 
the disposal of national leaders 
yugoslav security tried to let only a handful of the 50 
bodyguards into the conference hall and the result was a 
freeforall gadhafi apparently unaware of the melee outside 
passed through with two of the young women 
yugoslav security guards were not allowing any weapons into the 
building and tried to disarm the two guards at the door but 
succeeded with only one 
the other pushed her way through and sat at gadhafis side still 
armed but surrounded by four yugoslav state security officers

sam nunn chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said monday any troop cuts by nato allies will provoke 
withdrawals of us forces from europe and undermine talks with 
moscow on conventional arms 
in remarks to the international institute for strategic studies 
the georgia democrat also also urged us banks to open branches in 
poland to attract billions of american dollars poles are believed to 
be hoarding 
nunn who often says many americans think they pay too great a 
share of the cost of defending western europe said he had 
disquieting reports that several european nato nations plan 
large reductions in troop levels 
he said the cuts might exceed the 30000 soldiers the united 
states would withdraw a 10 percent reduction under washingtons 
proposal for reducing american and soviet troop levels by 1993 to 
275000 each stationed on the territory of european allies 
if our allies cut their forces then we will cut ours 
proportionately nunn said referring to a provision in the 
defense authorization bill the senate passed last month that puts a 
ceiling on the us proportion of nato troops in europe 
i believe the us congress is prepared to maintain our current 
share of natos deployed forces in europe while we are negotiating 
with the soviets but we are not willing to increase our share 
of the burden he said 
while we negotiate in hope of reaching eastwest common 
ceilings nato must not open holes in our own floor 
in vienna the 16nation nato alliance is negotiating coventional 
arms reductions with the seven members of the sovietled warsaw pact 
nunn did not identify the nato nations said to be planning troop 
reductions 
commenting on poland he urged american banks to open branches as 
soon as permitted by the new government led by solidarity 
the poles believe these banks would immediately draw deposits 
of several billion longheld us dollars he said these are 
called sleeping dollars because they are now kept in mattresses 
polish people do not have confidence in their own banks

autonomy from moscow and some activists there are pushing for 
secession

the great montana centennial cattle drive 
began monday in the golden light of sunrise as the lead longhorns 
crested a ridge in single file and then all 2700 animals formed an 
undulating bawling river of beef 
the sixday 60mile journey from this small community on the 
high plains of eastern montana to the stockyards of billings is the 
largest spectacle in montanas yearlong celebration of its birthday 
as a state 
the cattle herded by a band of 105 drovers was joined south of 
here by a contingent of about 300 covered wagons and 3000 riders 
prepared to spend the next week on the trail 
shortly before daybreak the cattle were headed up east of town 
along the musselshell river where they had been bedded down 
overnight 
as the sun broke over the horizon and lightened the clear sky 
the first longhorns trotted over the hill steam jetted from the 
nostrils of cows and horses in the crisp air and the cattle kicked 
up a haze of dust that drifted through the morning light 
whistling and whooping drovers in bright yellow slickers and 
waving lassos and bullwhips urged the complaining reluctant herd 
southward into a small canyon and between fields of brilliant green 
alfalfa 
from there the cattle were moved onto open range 
at late morning cheers greeted the sight of huge longhorns being 
herded through roundup leading the miles of wagons and riders 
toward their rendezvous with the main herd 
stomping and snorting in confusion one group of the animals 
turned onto main street where they were met with thousands of 
spectators lining the milelong route the crowd shied away from the 
steers each standing about six feet tall with horns spanning as 
much as five feet 
the people cheered and applauded many of the riders and wagons 
and cheered and rose to their feet hands over their hearts when 
the first of several flags finally appeared in the parade column 
riders on horseback and in wagons took on the appearance of their 
old west forerunners except in their desire to record the event 
many trained their video cameras on the other wagons and the crowd 
the first day of the cattle drive was marred by only one serious 
injury 
buck draper a cook from colorado springs colo suffered a hip 
injury when his horse reared over backwards and fell on him said 
musselshell county sheriff brian neidhardt he was flown by 
helicopter to a billings hospital 
the recreation of an old west drive will climax with another 
parade when the cattle arrive in billings on saturday 
on the trail the horse and wagon riders will eat catered meals 
and be entertained nightly by countrywestern performers 
trucks will bring 200000 gallons of water and 70 tons of hay 
each day to the animals 
montanas erractic endofsummer weather which can range from 
driving rain to broiling heat remains the greatest threat to the 
drive forecasts call for rain and cooler temperatures for most of 
the week

leaders of the palestinian uprising said monday 
the united states was stalling efforts for peace and they urged 
residents of the west bank and gaza strip to escalate the revolt 
against israeli occupation 
israeli newspapers said us officials were angered by lack of 
progress and had told israel they might support egyptian demands for 
concessions in prime minister yitzhak shamirs peace plan 
israeli soldiers imposed a curfew on talluza a west bank village 
35 miles north of jerusalem after residents stoned an army truck 
and set it afire military and arab sources reported 
the truck driver said to have lost his way escaped and fled to 
a nearby army base soldiers later entered the village and arab 
sources said they were searching for those who attacked the truck 
arab hospital sources said 20 palestinians in the occupied 
territories were wounded monday by lead or plastic bullets shot by 
soldiers 
since the uprising began 21 months ago 557 palestinians have 
been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians and 39 israelis have 
died at least 106 palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs who 
accused them of collaborating with israel 
in a leaflet distributed in the israelioccupied lands monday 
the uprisings underground leaders accused the united states of 
regressing in talks with the leadership of the palestine 
liberation organization 
it said the american obstinancy is blocking tangible progress 
in a peace settlement 
the united states began talks with the plo in december after the 
group recognized israel and renounced terrorism that stategy 
spearheaded by plo chief yasser arafat seemed to rest on persuading 
the united states to pressure on israel to make concessions for 
peace 
but the leaflet said the lack of progress casts serious doubts 
among the rankandfile of our people about the usefulness of the 
usplo dialogue 
it added facing these obstacles our people have no choice but 
to escalate the uprising the only option for reaching freedom and 
independence 
israel radio said meanwhile that us ambassador william brown 
told israeli officials last week secretary of state james a baker 
iii was favorably disposed to egypts stand on the shamir plan 
for elections in the occupied territories 
the plan put forward in april calls for electing palestinians 
to open talks with israel on interim autonomy for the territories 
president hosni mubarak of egypt raised 10 points related to the 
plan that essentially demand such israeli concessions as agreeing to 
trading occupied land for peace and allowing the 140000 arabs of 
east jerusalem to vote 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc has ruled out either step but the 
leftofcenter labor party which is a partner with likud in the 
coalition government has accepted both moves 
american diplomats were not available to comment on the reports 
because of the labor day holiday 
in their leaflet the uprising leaders called for residents of 
the occupied lands to refrain from rash decisions about 
suspected collaborators and consult uprising leaders before warning 
or punishing them 
a similar appeal in a leaflet distributed aug 15 had no effect 
there have been reports israeli security forces are arming 
collaborators and the hebrew daily maariv said monday that the 
arabs were receiving military training in use of weapons

the united states placed panamanian 
officials on a blacklist monday forbidding us companies and 
government agencies from buying from them or their businesses 
us embassy officials said the action was intended to hurt the 
pocketbooks of people associated with panamanian strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
the measure affects panamanian officials who own companies that 
sell millions of dollars to the us southern command military 
installations or to the panama canal commission a us government 
agency that administers the panama canal 
the list released by the us embassy contains more than 150 
names including all members of the cabinet and the 14 members of 
the defense forces strategic command the officials said 
us government agencies in panama spend almost 900 million on 
goods and services in panama 
embassy officials said they plan to release a list of companies 
owned by noriega or people near to him within days 
the us government does not recognize the provisional president 
francisco rodriguez who took office friday the united states 
considers rodriguez a puppet of noriega the defense forces leader 
who has been indicted by two federal grand juries in florida on drug 
trafficking charges 
rodriguez filled the vacuum created when the panamanian 
government annulled the may 7 elections which international 
observers say the opposition was winning by a 3to1 margin 
rodriguez who swore in his cabinet on monday said he would 
govern with an appointed legislative commission six of the 11 
cabinet members were reappointed 
opposition leaders who refused to participate in the new 
government last weekend turned down an offer to participate in the 
41member legislative commission 
our fight is for the democratization of our country and not for 
bureaucratic spoils or for political spaces said ricardo arias 
calderon a vice presidential candidate in the may elections 
the list released monday includes fortunato magravita owner of a 
meat market that counts the southern command among its principal 
customers magravita is a director of the national bank of panama 
the us army also is the biggest customer of the company firmas 
efficientes a computer paper and forms distributor owned by angel 
modesto jaen an official of the national sports institute and one 
of those on the list 
us companies cannot sell to these people or their companies 
or extend any credit said embassy spokesman terry kneebone 
still in effect are us government sanctions imposed on panama 
more than a year ago that withhold payment of canal fees and taxes 
on panama canal commission salaries the sanctions also freeze 
panamanian government funds in the united states and forbid us 
companies from dealing with panamanian government agencies 
us officials and opposition leaders acknowledge that the 
sanctions had not achieved the desired effect noriegas ouster 
sources indicated that us companies and others were violating 
the sanctions through intermediaries 
this time the treasury department will be more vigorous in the 
application of the sanctions a us source said on condition of 
anonymity 
many of those on the list were reported to have bank accounts and 
properties in the united states and us officials said the treasury 
department was not discounting further action regarding those 
assets 
the us governments displeasure with those associated with 
noriega will also mean revoking the us citizenship of panamanian 
finance minister orville k goodin the sources said goodin who 
also holds panamanian citizenship held the same post in the 
previous cabinet 
officials confirmed the united states acted to remove goodins 
citizenship on the grounds he is an official of a foreign government

minna keal who is 80 and resumed her music studies 
after retiring heard the premiere of her first symphony monday at 
the royal albert hall 
im living my life in reverse instead of feeling that my whole 
life is behind me i feel its all in front of me she said before 
the british broadcasting corp symphony orchestra performed her 
work which she calls simply symphony 
i feel as though all my dreams that i had as a teenager are 
now coming true mrs keal a small whitehaired woman with a 
melodic voice said on bbc televison 
in her teens she reluctantly quit music studies at the royal 
academy to devote herself to the family book business in london 
she resumed them upon retiring and has composed three other major 
works symphony was finished four years ago 
the fact of her having produced a major symphony a major 
symphony not just a nice little symphony as her third piece of 
music is beyond belief said oliver knussen who taught mrs keal 
composition and conducted her work monday night at the annual summer 
promenade concerts so named because holders of bargain tickets 
stand throughout 
you cant predict anything with a talent like that knussen 
said on television 
after the concert the bbc showed the composer at royal albert 
hall modestly acknowledging the applause smiling at the audience 
and applauding the orchestra 
mark pappenheim of the newspaper independent called the work an 
astonishingly assured achievement for any composers first 
orchestral work let alone for an old age pensioner 
its music that expresses a fierce concern for all the human 
brutality and turmoil her life has witnessed backed by a full 
battery of percussion from tamtams to tomtoms via bongos and a 
whip he wrote

lawmakers in northern ireland 
expressed anger monday that a soldier convicted of providing 
information that could be of use to terrorists is now an army 
instructor in england 
cpl cameron hastie 23 of the 1st battalion of the royal scots 
was given an 18month suspended jail sentence in belfast crown court 
last year after being convicted of giving information to the ulster 
volunteer force an outlawed protestant group 
the disclosure of hasties job as an instructor followed a recent 
case in which protestant extremists claimed they used securityforce 
information to select the man they killed aug 25 
the ulster freedom fighters said they obtained security force 
documents that identified loughlin maginn as a member of the 
outlawed irish republican army ulster freedom fighters gunmen 
killed maginn in his house his family denied he had ties to the ira 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting to unite northern 
ireland a british province where protestants outnumber catholics 
32 with the predominantly catholic republic of ireland protestant 
terrorists determined to keep northern ireland in the united kingdom 
are battling the ira extremists 
a british army spokesman in northern ireland who spoke on 
condition of anonymity confirmed that hastie had returned to duty 
and had been appointed as an instructor at a training base in 
england he refused to say which base 
i do not believe that anyone convicted of offenses should ever 
be allowed to serve in the security forces again i am appalled 
said john alderdice leader of the centrist alliance party that has 
both protestant and catholic supporters 
ken maginnis of the largely protestant official unionist party 
said hasties return to duty showed a degree of contempt to the 
entire community in northern ireland 
northern ireland minister john cope has said that any member of 
the army or police found guilty of passing information to terrorists 
could expect to suffer the full severity of the law 
the ulster freedom fighters is a code name for the ulster defense 
association a group founded in 1971 to coordinate paramilitary 
groups that favor british rule in northern ireland

pledges from about 100 million viewers 
corporations contributed an additional 36228846 during the 
21hour event which featured a parade of top name entertainers and 
poignant stories from muscular dystrophy victims and their families 
to push the total telethon donations since 1966 to 526524210 
lewis opened the show sunday night by saying that inroads had 
been made against 40 neuromuscular diseases that the muscular 
dystrophy association is involved in fighting lewis called the 
advances stunning to the heart stunning to the mind 
as in previous years it was the victims and their families who 
provided the telethons most affecting moments 
united airlines executive bob sampson drew a standing ovation 
from 2000 people in the jerry lewis theater at the cashman field 
center when he said theres been enough of this disease killing 
children and devastating families 
sampson who has suffered from muscular dystrophy since he was a 
teenager and has lost two grandchildren to the disease appeared in 
a poignant appeal and encouraged viewers to keep up the fight until 
the disease is beaten 
sampson told lewis last week he would rather not be on the 
telethon this year because it was too hard on him emotionally lewis 
said he persuaded sampson to return because he has been an 
inspiration in the annual event 
lewis was moved to tears when former high school football coach 
charlie wedemeyer the subject of the tv movie quiet victory 
told the audience you never know which dollar it will be to make 
the difference and win the fight 
wedemeyer of los gatos calif is paralyzed by amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis also known as lou gehrigs disease he conveyed 
his message through his wife lucy who read his lips 
so often i feel i am a prisoner in my own body that has been 
given a life sentence wedemeyer said but i have chosen with 
gods help to turn this disadvantage into an advantage 
the oak ridge boys stopped the show sunday when they introduced 
11yearold bradley thomas walker of huntsville ala the alabama 
poster child for the muscular dystrophy association they then sang 
their hit elvira with the child 
lewis has been a spokesman for the new york citybased muscular 
dystrophy association for 40 years conducting the annual labor day 
telethons for the benefit of jerrys kids since 1966 
the telethons have raised more than 500 million from individual 
donors and hundreds of millions more in corporate contributions that 
are not included in the telethon totals 
lewis said last week that the 1989 telethon would have a special 
meaning this spring lewis 63 and his 38yearold wife sam 
learned she was pregnant then were told may 5 that the fetus heart 
had stopped beating 
mrs lewis was two months pregnant at the time lewis has six 
sons by a previous marriage 
famed heart surgeon michael debakey of houston said great strides 
are being made to find the cause and cure for muscular dystrophy 
the future is so optimistic so great debakey said i 
think its wonderful that the american people can be assured that 
the money given to this great cause will find a solution and 
eliminate the disease 
more than 50 topname entertainers were featured on this years 
show including tony orlando frank sinatra liza minnelli sammy 
davis jr billy crystal alabama the oak ridge boys jack jones

more than 100 million travelers visit the alps each 
year and may destroy them by the next century two environmental 
groups said monday 
the main problem is too much tourism and the departure of 
agriculture said martin holdgate head of the switzerlandbased 
world conservation union he urged tourists to behave in less 
damaging ways 
pollution by cars and other means littering and offtrail skiing 
are major dangers said a survey by holdgates group and the 
international center for alpine environments based in france 
forest damage and soil erosion are among the serious consequences 
the report said 
according to the survey the number of hotel beds and visiting 
cars continues to rise and the use of lifts serving 41000 ski 
trails increases by about 5 percent annually 
if you have too many people visiting the alps the way it is 
today there will be no alps to visit in the next century said 
dominique rambaud of the french organization 
he said the french resort area around albertville where the 1992 
winter olympics will be held is under particular pressure 
about 12 million people live in the alps and more than 100 
million visit every year 60 percent of them for a day or weekend 
the survey said 
it recognized tourism as an economic mainstay for many areas and 
said one solution was to promote its less damaging forms such as 
crosscountry skiing hiking and camping

a former prime minister said in memoirs 
published monday that as recently as 1981 a russian diplomat 
offered to try to influence finlands presidential election 
the memoirs clearly show the extent of finnishsoviet 
relations what was talked and whispered about before is now set 
here before our eyes in black and white said jukka tarkka 
editor and cowriter of the book 
the minister of the president by center party politician 
ahti karjalainen says that viktor vladimirov a diplomat at the 
soviet embassy offered to help karjalainen win the presidency 
he says vladimirov told paavo vayrynen who was then finlands 
foreign minister that he would like to continue to work hard so 
karjalainen could succeed longtime president urho kekkonen who had 
announced his retirement because of ill health 
vayrynen chairman of the center party related the conversation 
in a letter to karjalainen 
vladimirov had openly asked vayrynen how the soviet union could 
promote my election he told vayrynen that he would influence the 
communists and other political parties to support my position 
karjalainen wrote 
excerpts of the book were first published in a magazine last 
week causing a stir in normally placid finnish politics 
vayrynen denied he acted against the interests of finland or of 
president mauno koivisto who opposed karjalainen as the social 
democratic candidate and who won the 1982 election 
vayrynen said he spoke to the soviet diplomat as party leader and 
not as a government minister legal experts said however that 
vayrynen also represented his country and could be accused of a 
treasonous act 
the former foreign minister who now is opposition leader said 
it was common practice at that time to discuss such matters with the 
soviets although that had changed since then 
finland defeated in war was coerced into signing a friendship 
treaty with the soviet union in 1948 though officially neutral its 
caution to avoid antagonizing the soviets gave birth to the word 
finlandization generally used to describe the subservience of a 
small country to a greater power

perpetuation of white minority rule said the letter ramaphosa

cuban news reports said monday that as many as 
150 people died when a passenger jet bound for italy crashed in a 
thunderstorm shortly after leaving havanas airport 
italian and cuban officials worked monday to identify victims of 
sundays crash in which all but one of the 126 people on the 
sovietmade jetliner were killed cuban news reports said another 25 
were believed killed on the ground 
cubas official news agency prensa latina said 22 bodies had been 
identified by monday evening including four crewmembers and nine 
who were killed by falling wreckage after the plane exploded it did 
not release any names 
prensa latina said 104 bodies had been taken to the medical 
examiners office 
the plane crashed during a heavy thunderstorm after takeoff from 
jose marti airport sending flaming debris plummeting into 
neighborhoods on the southern outskirts of the capital 
the chartered cubana de aviacion jetliner en route to milan was 
carrying 113 italians two cubans and a crew of 11 said the cuban 
ambassador to rome javier ardizones he confirmed there was one 
survivor 
the cause of the crash had not been determined but a foreign 
ministry employee in rome said the weather appeared to be a factor 
it was very bad a storm with rain and lightning he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the lone survivor from the plane was not immediately identified 
prensa latina it did not give the survivors condition 
cuban film critic jose antonio gonzalez 44 was one of the two 
cubans killed it said

garcia marquez visited the crash site and then castro visited the 
hospitals where prensa latina earlier reported that at least 63 
people were taken with injuries many had extensive burns and 
multiple fractures prensa latina said

injured people changed as the death toll climbed to 150 from 126 the 
news agency reported earlier 
a taxi driver and three passengers he was driving down boyeros 
avenue in the havana suburb of boyeros were among the injured it 
said 
prensa latina said the crash of the ilyushin 62 was the worst in 
the history of cubana de aviacion 
the fact that most of the victims were foreigners and the bodies 
were burned slowed the identification process the agency said

officials of the italian embassy and the revolutionary national 
police it said 
many of the 24 people being treated at the calixto garcia 
hospital one of several where the injured were taken had burns on 
more than 70 percent of their bodies and multiple fractures it

message sent through the italian embassy in havana the report said 
planes were landing monday at jose marti airport but were not 
taking off from there prensa latina said 
italian television showed footage of emergency workers rushing 
through the wreckage carrying bodies on stretchers in the darkness 
firefighters aimed streams of water at the charred shell of the 
plane 
nearby were the smoldering hulks of two trucks apparently hit by

of a domestic jetliner that vanished in the amazon jungle with 54 
people aboard after the pilot said he needed to make an emergency 
landing 
a transportation official said the jet which disappeared late 
sunday en route to belem could not have landed in the jungle and 
probably crashed a varig airline spokesman monday night described 
press accounts that the plane landed safely in the amazon as 
totally false 
we have not located the plane spokesman joao de souza said 
in rio de janeiro 
in brasilia the capital air force spokesman col ronaldo borges 
said the search for the boeing 737200 had been suspended until 
first light tuesday 
we dont have a precise location of where the plane went down 
and that is making the search operation difficult borges said 
the plane disappeared on the last leg of a regularly scheduled 
flight from the southeastern city of sao paulo to belem 2140 miles 
northwest of rio at the mouth of the amazon river varig spokesman 
gilberto brito said 
the plane was carrying 48 passengers and a crew of six all 
brazilian he said 
in his last contact the pilot said he would try an emergency 
landing brito said the pilot cesar augusto padula garcez did 
not say why he needed to land he said 
the belem supervisor for infraero the government agency in 
charge of commercial airports said in a radio interview the plane 
probably had crashed 
a plane of that size would have no chance of a successful 
emergency landing in the middle of the jungle col pompeu brasil 
said in an interview with the radio liberal station of belem 
in belem a varig official said on condition of anonymity we 
have checked two rumors one that the plane landed in amazonas state 
and another that it landed on an indian reservation in southern para 
state but nothing has been confirmed 
varig spokesman de souza added the planes beacon emits an 
emergency signal that is being picked up but it takes time to 
pinpoint the exact spot where the signal is coming from 
brito said flight 254 took off sunday morning from sao paulo 
brazils biggest city with 10 million people the plane made its 
scheduled stops in uberaba uberlandia goiania brasilia 
imperatriz and maraba he said 
early sunday evening the plane took off from maraba in good 
weather brito said shortly afterward the pilot signaled by radio 
that he was flying at 8000 feet with only one engine working and 
would try an emergency landing in the jungle guided by a forest 
fire the spokesman said

to learn whether ptl founder jim bakker is competent to continue his 
trial for fraud and conspiracy 
the tv evangelist spent labor day confined for psychiatric 
examination in the federal correctional institute mental health unit 
in butner about 100 miles northeast of here on the orders of us 
district judge robert potter 
its still a little bit up in the air bakkers psychiatrist 
dr basil jackson said monday in a telephone interview from 
milwaukee i havent been given the green light yet to go and see 
him 
bakker anxious and disheveled with chains on his hands and legs 
was escorted by federal marshals to butner after jackson testified 
bakker was hallucinating and hiding his head under a couch in his 
attorneys office 
potter suspended bakkers trial pending a determination of 
whether the tv evangelist is competent to stand trial the jurors 
were not told about bakkers condition but were told to check with 
the court on tuesday to see whether court proceedings would continue 
wednesday 
jackson said he was told psychiatrists at butner were speeding up 
their evaluation of bakkers emotional state over the weekend 
if thats true then its conceivable one of their people could 
come back into court tuesday or wednesday to certify that hes 
bakker ready to come back into trial he said 
attempts on monday to reach administrators at butner were 
unsuccessful and attorneys and others in the case are forbidden to 
discuss it under a gag order issued by potter

said evaluations of patients like bakker typically last 30 days but 
could take 45 days or more 
jackson who said he has not been allowed to talk with bakker 
since his arrival at butner said he has been in daily contact by 
phone with bakkers wife tammy faye bakker and bakkers attorneys 
for news on his condition 
jackson also said he has heard bakker has tried to contact him 
daily 
i think that he has settled down and certainly has improved a 
lot from the way he was thursday morning jackson said 
i continue to be impressed with the emotional strength of this 
man and his resilience 
he said it was possible bakker would be ready to return to court 
this week 
id like to see what condition hes in and have an opportunity 
to make a clinical judgment as to the likelihood of whether he might 
have a similar reaction to stress in the days ahead jackson said 
im interested not in his ability to be competent to withstand 
trial on one day but competent for the entire trial the 
psychiatrist said 
bakker is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy and 
faces 120 years and prison and more than 5 million in fines 
prosecutors say bakker used nearly 4 million in ministry funds to 
finance a lavish lifestyle

thousands of east germans waiting in the 
cold rain for passage to a new life in the west got the 
disheartening word from hungarian officials monday that their exodus 
depends on further talks with east berlin 
interior minister istvan horvath was quoted as telling the west 
german weekly stern that east and west germany need to agree on the 
refugee crisis and this could take perhaps a month or 1 
months 
the hardline east german government is angry over the planned 
mass exodus and hungarys role in it 
a wellplaced hungarian official who spoke to the associated 
press on condition of anonymity also cited need for further 
talks with east germany before hungary gives the goahead for an 
organized mass departure to west germany via austria 
as recently as sunday west german and hungarian officials had 
suggested the departure was imminent of 4700 east germans marking 
time in tents and summer cabins at five makeshift refugee camps in 
hungary 
east german refugees began fleeing to the west through hungary 
after the liberal communist regime in budapest decided in may to 
remove barbed wire and other obstacles from its frontier with 
austria 
since may an estimated 6000 east germans have fled to austria 
their final destination is west germany which gives them automatic 
citizenship and generous help in starting new lives 
interior ministry spokesmen were not available to comment on the 
stern interview monday 
but a woman answering the telephone at the ministry secretariat 
said horvath spoke to stern aug 29 two days before rezso nyers 
president of the hungarian communist party promised west german 
social democrat politician karsten voigt the east germans could 
leave 
many east germans waiting to go west have told reporters they 
fear theyll be fired and face legal action if they return 
but in a statement issued by its budapest consulate late monday 
east germany promised for the first time that those coming home 
would have the right to return to their jobs it said anew they 
would not face punishment and could apply for emigration once they 
returned home 
some of the east germans have been waiting to leave for more than 
a month and mondays news of a possible delay struck like a 
bombshell 
at one budapest camp offlimits to reporters like the four 
others dozens broke off lunches rushing out the main gate to mob 
western reporters to ask if horvaths comments were true 
the bread almost fell out of my mouth said a 39yearold 
engineer from dresden with two children if thats true im 
finished i have to go back to east germany i have no more money 
and my children are sick 
they cant do this to us said a young single mother her 
eyes brimming over with tears weve been here for 15 days and 
now theyre taking away our last hope 
earlier west german diplomat gunter mulack told reporters bonn 
was just waiting for budapests word to launch the caravan westward 
through austria to newly built tent cities in bavaria 
the refugee camp behind him appeared quieter than usual most 
residents were inside because of rain and unseasonable cold 
this would be the largest single transfer of east germans to the 
west since the berlin wall was built in august 1961 and would be an 
unprecedented case of cooperation between a soviet bloc and nato 
nation to resettle citizens of another eastern european nation in 
the west 
more than 500 new arrivals registered monday with red cross 
officials managing the four camps in budapest and a fifth that 
opened friday at zanka on the shores of lake balaton 
the lake is popular with the 1 million east german tourists who 
visit hungary each year up to 200000 east germans are thought to 
be in hungary now and premier miklos nemeth has said 20000 may want 
to go to west germany 
hungarian officials said solving the problem was up to the two 
germanys but then nyers told voigt the east germans would be 
allowed to go west that in effect breaks hungarys 1969 agreement 
with east germany to return those caught trying to flee 
budapests decision embittered the east germans whose leaders 
have criticized reforms in hungary and its moves toward multiparty 
democracy 
escape through hungary to austria peaked in late august with 
hundreds of east germans crossing daily the hungarians apparently 
concerned about east german anger strengthened border patrols and 
the flow was cut to a few dozen each night 
west german chancellor helmut kohl has urged his countrymen to 
welcome the east germans 
state assistance has spawned some resentment there

two newspapers that identified a source after 
promising confidentiality must pay 200000 in compensatory damages 
but not the 500000 in punitive damages also awarded by a jury the 
state court of appeals said in a ruling released tuesday 
first amendment guarantees of freedom of the press do not protect 
the star tribune and the st paul pioneer press dispatch from 
liability under contract laws in this case the oral contracts of 
reporters confidentiality promises a threejudge panel said in 
upholding the compensatory damages 
in the ruling to be filed tuesday in st paul the judges 
rejected public relations man dan cohens claim of misrepresentation 
by the newspapers and said he is not entitled to punitive damages 
awarded by a hennepin county jury 
the court also rejected the star tribunes contention that the 
closing argument for cohen was so inflammatory that a new trial is 
required the damages payment is to be shared by the newspapers 
the court made the ruling available to the news media with the 
proviso that the parties involved not be contacted for comment 
before 830 am tuesday 
judge gary crippen in a partial dissent said the entire 
700000 award should be overturned because the case involves the 
exercise of the coercive power of the state to punish the choice of 
the private press to publish 
in a statement issued for release tuesday however star tribune 
executive editor joel r kramer said the paper is pleased with the 
courts unanimous decision on punitive damages and heartened by 
crippens partial dissent 
we are disappointed with the court majoritys ruling that 
contract law applies in this case and supersedes first amendment 
protections he said no decision on whether to appeal has been 
made he said 
the case concerns a revelation during the 1982 gubernatorial 
campaign that marlene johnson a democratic farmer labor candidate 
for lieutenant governor had been arrested on shoplifting charges 
several years earlier 
cohen who worked for independentrepublican gubernatorial 
candidate wheelock whitney provided the information on the 
condition that he not be identified as the source 
reporters for the two newspapers gave that assurance but their 
editors ordered that cohens name be published because they argued 
the public had the right to know that the information came from the 
whitney campaign 
johnon went on to win the election but cohen sued claiming that 
he lost his advertising agency job because the newspapers breached 
an oral contract 
the appeals court agreed saying an oral contract between a 
source and a reporter is no different from any other contract 
any first amendment rights the newspapers might have had to 
publish the sources name were waived when the reporters made the 
confidentiality pledge the opinion said 
the newspapers argument that the public had the right to 
information about the source was valid the court said to provide a 
context of the sources credibility and motivations but that 
doesnt mean the papers had to use cohens name the opinion said 
cohen based his claim of misrepresentation in part on a legal 
inference that editors never intended to keep the reporters 
promises of confidentiality in addition he claimed that the 
reporters concealed that they had no authority to bind the 
newspapers to their promise 
the appeals court said cohen could not legally infer that the 
editors didnt intend to keep the promise the court also noted that 
no witness could recall a previous instance when a reporters 
confidentiality promise was vetoed by an editor at either paper 
because it was the newspapers practice to honor their 
reporters promises of confidentiality the reporters did not by 
omission misrepresent their authority the court said in rejecting 
punitive damages in the misrepresentation claim 
judge marianne short who wrote the decision defended the ruling 
against potential complaints that its effect would be to restrict 
the media and limit public access to information 
were we not to enforce the newspapers promises of 
confidentiality confidential sources would have no legal recourse 
against unscrupulous reporters or editors she said 
ultimately news sources could dry up resulting in less 
newsworthy information to publish

investigators browbeat him into implicating one of his shipmates as 
a suicidal homosexual who may have been responsible for the 
explosion that killed 47 crewmen according to a report broadcast 
monday 
in an interview with abc news seaman david smith said he 
believed that gunners mate clayton hartwig did not cause the 
explosion that destroyed one of the battleships gun turrets

investigators that hartwig had made sexual advances to him the night 
before the april 19 explosion and that on other occasions hartwig 
had talked about how to set off explosions and showed him a timer 
device 
part of me can see him doing it smith was quoted as saying 
hartwig died in the explosion with the other sailors 
in his abc news interview smith said the investigators 
questioned him in sessions lasting up to 12 hours and threatened to 
charge him with 47 counts of murder and accessory to murder if he 
did not cooperate 
smith said investigators put words into his mouth and distorted 
his testimony abc said 
navy spokesman kendall pease said he was unaware of the abc

former gov pat brown once let a deathrow 
inmate die to get a bill through the legislature and hes still 
haunted by the lifeanddeath power he held over 59 prisoners 
brown emerges as an opponent of the death penalty in public 
justice private mercy the 163page memoir of his decisions to 
grant or withhold clemency from prisoners facing death sentences 
while he was governor from 195967 
it was an awesome ultimate power over the lives of others that 
no person or government should have or crave brown writes 
each decision took something out of me that nothing not family 
or work or hope for the future has ever been able to replace 
brown commuted 23 death sentences the most of any california 
governor he denied clemency in 36 other cases 
the decisions were some of the most agonizing he ever made brown 
said in the book he wrote with dick adler it was published last 
month by weidenfeld amp nicolson 
some of the 23 prisoners whose sentences brown commuted were 
released on parole one was later convicted of murder despite his 
opposition to capital punishment brown recalled after learning 
about the 1975 murder he stated he would have been willing to trade 
all 23 lives for the life of the killers victim 
there is a message for future governors particularly opponents 
of capital punishment the tension between justice and mercy 
may be impossible to resolve especially in a heated arena of 
political ambitions and public expectations 
the issue is far from academic in california which with more 
than 200 inmates has one the nations largests deathrow 
populations and is likely to begin executing the prisoners soon 
after a 22year respite 
the state put more than 500 people to death from 1851 to 1967 in 
1976 the us supreme court allowed states to resume executions 
but the california supreme court under liberal chief justice rose 
bird threw out many death sentences since a more conservative court 
took over after birds election defeat in 1986 state laws have 
changed to make executions easier 
in his book brown writes that he found the moral and political 
decisions became hopelessly entangled in the case of richard 
lindsey a drifter convicted of raping and murdering a 6yearold 
girl in a kern county farm labor camp in 1961 
as brown describes it he was seriously considering clemency for 
lindsey who though legally sane had been mentally disturbed for 
many years but the governor also sought legislative approval of a 
minimumwage law for migrant workers and he needed the vote of a 
kern county lawmaker who wanted lindsey dead 
by letting richard lindsey go to the gas chamber i was giving 
the victims parents and people like them a chance at a living 
wage brown writes lindsey died and the legislation passed 
brown criticizes some of his actions and appears to have been 
genuinely wrestling with two principles his personal opposition to 
capital punishment and his belief he was elected to uphold the law 
including the death penalty 
brown is less convincing in describing his decision not to 
commute the death sentence of caryl chessman convicted of a string 
of kidnappings and rapes who spent 12 years on death row before he 
was executed in may 1960 
brown said chessman was a nasty arrogant unrepentant man 
but probably did not deserve to die because he hadnt killed anyone 
brown admits his decision not to grant clemency was partly 
because widespread anger at chessman made that decision politically 
untenable 
brown concludes that the death penalty is unfair irrational and 
ineffective but that it will not be abolished until more people 
realize how inhumane it is 
for this reason he supports an initiative being circulated for 
californias june 1990 ballot to speed up court proceedings by 
narrowing defendants rights with speedier appeals the gas chamber 
soon would be operating two or three times a week brown said 
then he said people would begin to see the death penalty in 
all its naked ugliness

marine workers searched for hours monday 
before the found the right milk substitute to feed a weekold 
900pound baby sperm whale found floundering in shallow waters this 
weekend 
the whale dubbed odie was found beached saturday west of sabine 
pass and taken by flatbed truck the next day covered with sunscreen 
and wet cloths to sea arama marine world in galveston 
hes ok hes just kind of sitting there in his holding tank 
sea arama spokeswoman christy benson said monday he now needs 
some nourishment hes a big guy and hes just a baby 
odie is estimated to be a little more than a week old but 
already is 13 feet long we dont know why he beached himself 
ms benson said adding that most whales become stranded because 
they are ill 
experts nationwide were contacted for help on caring for odie 
because a sperm whale has never been captive long enough to study 
said gina barron coordinator for the texas mammal stranding 
network which rescued the whale 
marine workers have been feeding the whale an electrolyte 
solution through a stomach tube to keep him hydrated but the mammal 
also needs caloric intake ms benson said 
sea arama officials had trouble finding a lactosefree milk 
substitute for odie because many businesses were closed for the 
labor day holiday but finally found the right veterinary product at 
the houston zoo she said 
zoo officials brought us what they had for the whale ms 
benson said they also told sea arama officials where they could 
find more tuesday the whales first scheduled milk feeding was 
planned monday evening 
were just going to continue to treat him and feed him and hope 
for the best she said 
laboratories closed because of the labor day holiday also have 
delayed efforts to find out whats wrong with the whale she said 
odies move to the marine park sunday was delayed almost 19 hours 
to make sure another whale possibly the mother was not in the 
area but no other whale was found ms benson said

400milewide band of stormstrength wind across the atlantic toward 
the caribbean 
however it will be four to five days before forecasters can say 
if it will strike the us mainland said bob sheets director of 
the national hurricane center it was on a path that could take it 
northwest of the virgin islands 
the storm is actually a long way away from any potential 
impact sheets said 
the atlantic seasons fourth hurricane had maximum sustained wind 
of 130 mph and meteorologists at the hurricane center in suburban 
coral gables said gabrielle would probably strengthen as it moved 
over warm tropical water 
everything is favorable as far as the hurricane itself is 
concerned to strengthen slightly said sheets its a very large 
hurricane 
at 1030 pm edt gabrielles center was near 193 north 
latitude and 563 west longitude about 375 miles east of the 
northeastern leeward islands it was moving westnorthwest at 15 mph

gabrielle had hurricaneforce wind of at least 74 mph extending 
as far as 100 miles north of its center according to reports from 
an air force reconnaissance plane that flew through the storm 
monday sheets said 
forecasters said wind of tropicalstorm force at least 39 mph 
extended up to 250 miles northeast of the center and 150 miles to 
the southwest 
this is definitely a hurricane that needs to be respected 
forecaster bob case said 
gabrielle formed thursday off africa and its sustained wind 
quickly surpassed minimum hurricane force of 74 mph 
tropical storm felix strengthened as it drifted westerly far to 
the north and was expected to gradually turn toward the northwest

westernmost azores 
its winds were estimated at about 65 mph 25 mph stronger than

under the terms of the accord brunswijks estimated 200 to 400 
men will become a special police force in eastern suriname where 
they operate and where many amerindians live 
the amerindians allied to the army during the threeyear 
guerrilla war fear retribution if they fall under the control of 
brunswijks men 
the army also has opposed turning the guerrillas into a police 
force 
army commander and strongman desi bouterse said monday the 
amerindian insurgents have captured a large amount of supplies and

official coverups of diseases affecting 
cattle and horses have embarrassed agriculture officials and led to 
concern that the european economic community may ban spains booming 
beef exports 
agriculture minister carlos romero has made no comment on reports 
that his ministry covered up a case of rampant bovine 
pleuropneumonia for four years and permitted the sale of affected 
meat to the public for reasons of national interest the disease 
is not transmittable to humans 
the european commission the executive body of the 12nation eec 
has ordered spain to provide a detailed report on the outbreak of 
the disease in 1985 in navas de san antonio 45 miles northwest of 
madrid in the castilleleon region 
this could lead to an eec decision to prohibit beef exports 
said pedro llorente castilleleons agricultural production 
director 
the value of spanish beef exports has shot up to 393 million 
during the first half of this year from 2 million in the same 
period in 1986 according to government figures 
principal markets are other eec countries such as france 
portugal italy britain and west germany 
the scandal comes on the heels of the third outbreak in two years 
of african horse sickness in southern spain the recurrence of the 
deadly horse disease a virus transmitted by insects that has 
resulted in the deaths of more than 500 animals could force a 
change of venue for equestrian events scheduled for the 1992 summer 
olympics in barcelona 
critics blame the government of prime minister felipe gonzalez 
and reticent civil servants for perpetuating the longheld custom of 
hiding problems seen as harmful to spains image abroad 
the first reports of the outbreak of the disease in navas de san 
antonio came as spain was negotiating its entry into the eec it 
became a member jan 1 1986 
something is not working right in this nation the barcelona 
newspaper la vanguardia said in an editorial there is too much 
silence based on the belief it better serves collective concerns 
even when consumers are left in the dark 
critics also view the bovine pleuropneumonia scandal as 
confirmation of the lack of rigor and concern on the part of public 
officials for public health 
over the past four years thousands of consumers have been 
fooled with the excuse that it was necessary to hoodwink the 
european community and avoid having our partners repudiate us 
said el pais spains leading newspaper 
but what will make europe repudiate us is not that we declare 
an outbreak and cattle are quarantined and destroyed but that 
things are covered up and people pretend nothing has happened 
at a recent news conference castilleleons llorente confirmed 
the coverup and said his regions officials and the ministry of 
agriculture in madrid agreed not to make the outbreak public 
he called the action a clear case of highrisk cooperation 
adding that such action was not rare in other european countries in 
order to prevent the closing of borders to beef sales 
the agriculture ministrys sole statement on the coverup charges 
placed the blame on the castilleleon regional government saying it 
was responsible for animal health in its territory 
the ministry said its obligation was to declare an outbreak if 
the disease was nationwide 
the 198588 outbreak in navas de san antonio eventually forced 
farmers to destroy 4808 head of cattle 1604 of which tested 
positive for the disease 
but by the end of the first year only half the cattle in the town 
had been destroyed said antonio vazquez the navas de san antonio 
veterinarian who reported the first cases of the disease which is 
fatal to cattle 
theres been a definite case of lack of coordination and delay 
among the finance agriculture and health ministries that has 
stymied efforts to eradicate the disease he said in a telephone 
interview 
some of the affected cattle were sold to slaughterhouses and then 
to the public after authorities certified the animals were infected 
with bovine tuberculosis llorente said the law permits the sale of 
meat of cattle infected with tuberculosis but requires destruction 
of all meat of cattle infected with pleuropneumonia 
pleuropneumonia has been largely eliminated in western europe 
spain declared the disease eradicated in 1965

from underfertilized fields in romania to 
the tiny private plots in poland and yugoslavia the east blocs 
farmers are angry and clamoring for higher prices and more land 
even in hungary a traditionally rich agrarian nation that 
exports thousands of tons of farm products each year the farming 
success story is turning sour 
for decades in eastern europe breakneck industrialization 
overshadowed agriculture which was kept starved of machinery and 
fertilizers by state bureaucracies and left to subsist on low farm 
prices 
now east bloc farmers are serving notice they cannot survive 
much longer and are demanding more from communist governments that 
need to keep food prices down for lowpaid factory workers 
in poland with city dwellers complaining about the high price 
and scarcity of food the subject of farm production has become one 
of the most sensitive issues facing the east blocs first 
noncommunist prime minister 
polish farmers displeased with the prices they were getting 
withheld their livestock and grain from the market in july 
resulting in severe shortages in the stores 
although a free market for food was introduced aug 1 in 
poland and farmers were offered more for their produce many were 
reported holding back in hope of still higher prices 
in gdansk and elsewhere polands farmers blocked roads with 
wagons and tractors in protest eighty percent of polands farmland 
is still in private hands 
in addition to low prices polands farmers like farmers in 
hungary and yugoslavia complain about de facto state monopolies for 
their purchases of supplies and sales of their produce 
polish officials are so worried about possible unrest that they 
are spending some of the countrys badly needed hard currency to buy 
frozen meat from western europe 
they hope however to ease tensions with deliveries of 120 
million in food aid promised in early august by the european 
economic community after president bushs visit to poland 
in yugoslavia about 5000 farmers wheeled their tractors to the 
federal parliament building in belgrade on aug 28 in an 
unprecedented protest of government attempts to curb inflation by 
forcing food prices down 
it is cows that should be milked not peasants said one 
slogan 
faced with a 750 percent inflation rate the yugoslav government 
recently flooded the market with cheap flour wheat sugar and other 
foods from federal stockpiles to try to halt price increases 
one of the chief problems facing yugoslav farmers is that they 
are allowed to own no more than 75 acres of land until last year 
that limit was just 25 acres they call these limits artificial and 
say they curb efficient farming and higher yields 
we cant wait any longer said sava govorcic a member of a 
newly formed farmers initiative none of our demands have yet 
been met 
in hungary where private household plots on only 55 percent of 
arable land accounted for 36 percent of all agricultural production 
in 1988 the farm work force is aging and declining produce prices 
are not keeping pace with increases in the cost of fertilizers and 
other farm needs 
state investment is declining with the hungarian farmers seeing 
none of the extra revenue generated by several rounds of foodprice 
hikes imposed by a cashstrapped government this year alone 
the farmers anger first boiled over a year ago when winegrowers 
in kiskoros staged the communist nations first agricultural 
demonstration in memory demanding change 
in midaugust some 2 million hungarian workers went on a warning 
strike to protest price increases on selected meat products notably 
missing from many shops in the weeks before 
radical solutions may be coming in some countries however 
in hungary in the spring a report commissioned by the communist 
party recommended easier lease terms and private land ownership in 
agriculture 
in a similar bid to stimulate extra production soviet farmers 
could soon be paid in foreign hard currency for surplus grains and 
seeds 
in romania however the government holds 91 percent of the 
farmland and there is no sign of change ahead much of the countrys 
abundant produce goes for export with little left for domestic 
consumption

for more than 800 years a medieval 
fortress honoring the crusaderfoe saladin knew only wars or rumors 
of wars today rebuilt on a tiny island in a turquoise gulf the 
picturesque citadel enjoys the fruits of peace 
named for the most dreaded and able moslem warrior saladins 
citadel has become a tourist mecca 
it was little more than rubble when egyptian antiquities 
officials came in 1985 they put archaeologists and restorers to 
work piecing together the longforgotten history and architecture of 
the onceproud fort egypts eastern gateway and the restoration 
continues 
but the rebuilt citadel stands again its walls up to 100 feet 
high 
from the site in the northern gulf of aqaba visitors can see 
four countries with the naked eye the forts doorway faces saudi 
arabia its curving wall jordan and israel the peaks of egypts 
sinai peninsula and the coral reefs of the gulf complete the 
panorama 
egyptian and foreign tourists including many israelis come by 
launch from mainland egypt little more than a stones throw away 
others come by passenger ferry from jordan 
still others like jordans king hussein and queen noor pass by 
in private yachts 
visitors from jordan and israel still technically at war with 
each other scamper side by side up down and around walls and mazes 
that cover pharaon island 
nevertheless until september 1988 the forts future was 
uncertain because of a protracted struggle between egypt and israel 
over taba 250 acres of israeliheld beachfront four miles to the 
north seized by the israelis in the 1967 war 
international arbitrators however have given taba back to egypt 
and now saladins citadel holds a large share of the areas tourist 
market 
at night its lighted walls can be seen for miles against the 
backdrop of the sinais seemingly endless starry sky 
its a peaceful setting now but in the late 12th century it 
wasnt so 
saladin spent his adult life fighting he fought islamic holy 
wars against the crusades most famous knights and he fought local 
skirmishes among rival moslem groups throughout the middle east 
saladin became sultan of egypt syria yemen and palestine 
founding the ayyubid dynasty in 1171 
known not only for his battle prowess but also his statesmanship 
and courtliness he was driven by the idea of jihad islamic holy 
war in 1187 saladin captured jerusalem for the moslems which had 
been in frankish hands for 88 years 
war was everywere said fahmy abdulalim director of islamic 
monuments for the egyptian antiquities organization and a leading 
egyptian islamic archaeologist 
many battles happened here this fortress is of major 
historical interest because it was the gateway to egypt strategic 
for saladin 
he built many fortresses in egypt but this one is especially 
important it helped to prevent the enemy from cutting the caravan 
and supply routes east and west which enabled pilgrims to continue 
making the hajj to mecca 
the hajj is the pilgrimage moslems make to mecca the prophet 
mohammeds birthplace 
though much smaller the forts architecture bears some 
resemblance to saladins masterpiece old cairos hillside citadel 
the pharaon island installation was an active fort until early this 
century 
a front tower holds the remains of a roost for carrier pigeons 
used by saladin for communicating with cairo and damascus 
archaeologist abdulalim said the fortress enabled the moslem 
militiamen whose lives were difficult and lonely to be 
selfsupporting for long periods 
the fortress has storerooms for food and a water system that 
would have allowed the soldiers to survive for months at a time 
until reinforcements arrived he said you even have a mosque 
for their religious needs 
during excavations last winter egyptian archaeologists uncovered 
a weaponsmaking area the first such furnace at a citadel in egypt 
you have to remember how isolated this fortress would have 
been abdulalim said the soldiers naturally would have been 
required to repair their weapons on the spot make new ones if 
necessary 
he said the archaeologists also found coins dating to the end of 
saladins reign and a plaque with his name 
gamal celiman the islands antiquities inspector said the 
island is made of granite which in saladins time was quarried and 
shaped on the spot other stones and building materials were brought 
from elsewhere 
we found stones with 2000yearold nabatean writing which 
probably were taken from buildings in south sinai celiman said 
the nabatean kingdom was based in what is now western jordan one 
room was covered by a palm roof but no palms grew here he said 
the fort had some comforts for its soldiers 
there were steam baths with hot water pipes celiman said 
but the fort also provided for troublemakers 
we have chains with cuffs just in case he said

on the night of march 20 1990 about 9000 
gritty censustakers will set out on a difficult and thankless 
mission they will try to count homeless americans 
their findings already are being challenged 
advocates of more federal spending on homelessness contend that 
the count will be too low by far and the census bureau doesnt deny 
that saying that it will seek only to deliver demographic social 
and economic data on components of the homeless population 
it wont be a comprehensive survey and the numbers will be 
conservative meaning it will err on the low side but whatever the 
flaws it will be the first major effort to count the homeless since 
their plight became a national political issue 
thats why the arguments began early estimates of the number of 
homeless people in the united states range from 250000 to 3 
million with that margin of error numbers are meaningless 
activists demanding new and more extensive programs for the 
homeless came up with the guess that there are 3 million of them a 
number that never has been substantiated but nevertheless is used in 
the debate over action for the homeless 
in may 1984 the department of housing and urban development 
reported after a sixmonth study of homelessness that the best 
estimate of the number of homeless was 250000 to 350000 president 
bush said during the 1988 campaign that a 1986 harvard study 
supported the higher of the hud figures 350000 an urban institute 
report in 1988 estimated the number of homeless at 567000 to 
600000 that also was criticized as too low by advocates for the 
homeless 
the numbers send a political signal and that puts the census in 
the middle of the debate 
a sociologist and a housing expert contend the whole thing should 
be called off they contend the administration should forget about 
counting the uncountable and seek more money for housing programs 
we believe the census will severely undercount the homeless 
pulling the rug out from under the few programs that presently 
exist say richard p appelbaum of the university of california at 
santa barbara and peter dreier director of housing for the boston 
redevelopment authority 
the number of homeless people has become a political 
football they contend in an article in the chicago tribune the 
bush administration like its predecessor does not like to think of 
the problem as too big or too costly small problems require small 
numbers and small numbers apparently require large studies 
on the other side of the argument an urban planner writing in a 
conservative journal says the homeless lobby cooked up phony numbers 
in order to push its demands 
prominent individuals and organizations acting on behalf of the 
homeless have argued that not simply hundreds of thousands but 
millions of americans on any given day are resigned to a life in 
shelters institutions or the streets says carl f horowitz 
beginning around 1983 the number 3 million approximately 12 
of every 100 americans has come to be reported as the benchmark 
figure politicians celebrities and corporations have found it a 
convenient rallying point to elicit sympathy and tax deductible 
contributions for the homeless 
in an article published by the heritage foundation horowitz 
traces the number to a 1982 study by mary ellen hombes now with the 
national coalition for the homeless and mitch snyder whose 
community for creative nonviolence issued the report 
their study concluded that about 22 million americans were 
homeless in 1980 and said the number could reach 3 million or 
more during 1983 snyder later said in congressional testimony 
that the numbers were meaningless the far lower hud estimates also 
were dismissed as meaningless during house hearings on the subject 
horowitz says a sound count of the homeless and information on 
the problems behind their homelessness are vital in shaping 
policies that can help them advocates who disparage research 
about their numbers are doing a serious injustice to the people they 
ostensibly are trying to aid he says 
now the census bureau will try to produce meaningful figures 
counting the homeless in shelters and cheap hotels and then after 
midnight on the streets census workers will seek to interview the 
people they find in shelters and on the streets to get demographic 
data on the homeless population but they wont awaken any sleeping 
street people in those cases theyll guess age sex and race 
we are measuring components of the homeless on one night not 
the dynamics of homelessness the census bureau said in a 
statement describing its survey we expect that the count of 
the street component will be very conservative a generalpurpose 
survey such as the census cannot provide comprehensive data on the 
homeless 
those caveats notwithstanding next years numbers are certain to 
stir a new round of debate on how many americans really are 
homeless and what the government should do about it

the little girl has been out in the rain with her 
umbrella and a container of salt for 75 years demonstrating the 
slogan that helped make morton salt a household standby when it 
rains it pours 
customers still occasionally write morton salt co claiming to 
know the childs true identity but officials say she has none 
shes the figment of a forgotten artists imagination 
some people say they modeled for the illustration others swear 
its their daughter or granddaughter earl c thorne advertising 
and promotion manager for the chicagobased company said recently 
the morton salt girl debuted in 1914 the first of her 
incarnations was as a chubby child with curly hair standing in a 
downpour with a container of salt carelessly tucked under one arm 
and spilling to the ground 
shes been made over five times since to update her dress hair 
and face for a while she had pigtails these days she has sleek 
dark hair 
but the idea is the same all but the original are taking a step 
with the right foot all are spilling salt though the 1956 version 
and the current model introduced in 1966 are losing just a 
sprinkle rather than pouring it out in a stream 
and the slogan hasnt changed at all though the scientific 
process it promotes has ceased to be a novelty 
in the united states it is one of the 10 bestknown symbols 
thorne said 
in 1911 founder jay morton wanted his young company to stand out 
from the competition at the time salt tended to cake in humidity 
making it difficult to use and it was sold in bags 
morton added magnesium carbonate to prevent caking and designed 
the nowfamiliar moistureresistant container with the patented 
spout 
he then went to advertising agency nw ayer amp co for a campaign 
to promote the merits of his salt 
when the agency came up with some ideas mortons son company 
secretary sterling morton was struck by a drawing of a little girl 
in the rain with an umbrella salt spilling freely from the 
container under her arm 
here was the whole story in a picture the elder morton 
recalled some time later the message that the salt would run in 
damp weather was made beautifully evident 
the slogan was the hard part 
the original was even in rainy weather it flows freely 
sterling morton wanted something short and snappy 
finally the mortons and the admen came up with when it rains 
it pours 
the company went on to great success in 1988 morton thiokol 
then an aerospace and chemical company reported about 23 billion 
in sales the company formed seven years ago when morton 
international merged with thiokol corp recently split into two 
companies restoring the old names 
the morton salt girl remains with morton international which 
also makes airbag propellants and chemicals thiokol based near 
salt lake city produces aerospace and defense equipment

hj heinz co subsidiary starkist foods 
announced a plan to fund research to reduce the number of dolphins 
killed in tuna fishing nets just days before animal rights activists 
plan to protest the companys alleged involvement in dolphin killing 
starkist spokesman erik bloemendaal said last weeks 
announcement of the research funds was unrelated to a protest 
scheduled to take place wednesday before heinzs annual meeting in 
pittsburgh 
todd steiner director of the save the dolphins project at earth 
island institute in san francisco which organized the protest 
called the research project a public relations scam 
the institute claims star kist purchases tuna caught by 
encirclement nets that each year needlessly kill 100000 dolphins 
the group said it targeted starkist because it is the worlds 
largest tuna processor 
heinz has studied the possibility of funding research by the 
world dolphin research society since the beginning of the year but 
had not determined all the details until recently bloemendaal said 
the research is intended to develop acoustic and electromagnetic 
signals to calm dolphins and guide them out of the nets 
the world dolphin research society is a nonprofit organization 
founded two years ago by the aspen research institute of aspen colo 
bloemendaal declined to say how much the company will spend for 
the research but called it a significant amount 
steiner said the research funds would be better spent designing 
alternative fishing methods he said 95 percent of all tuna is 
caught by methods that dont harm dolphins 
earth island institute organized a demonstration at the 1988 
heinz shareholders meeting and has asked consumers to boycott 
starkist tuna the boycott has not affected sales heinz 
spokeswoman debbie foster said 
heinz chairman jf anthony oreilly has said he sympathizes with 
animal rights groups but claims foreign fleets kill most of the 
dolphins boycotting starkist will not save any dolphins he told 
shareholders last year 
foreign fleets will simply sell their catch to other countries 
who have little or no concern regarding the dolphins oreilly 
said

research center 
while one month is too brief a period on which to make a 
longterm judgment the magnitude of this months decline cannot be 
dismissed as inconsequential he said in a statement we must 
wait for at least another month to see whether this is the beginning 
of a trend

conditions are good down from 316 percent a month earlier about 
31 percent said they believed jobs were plentiful down from about
