the justice department sought a temporary 
restraining order wednesday in an attempt to stop the district of 
columbia from barring newly sentenced prisoners from its 
overcrowded jail facilities 
the department filed suit in us district court after the 
district failed to accept the federal governments offer of 
shortterm help to alleviate jail overcrowding in exchange for a 
commitment by the district to quickly increase its space for 
housing prisoners 
the offer by associate attorney general frank keating would have 
assigned to federal prison facilities up to 200 newly sentenced 
people that offer would have lasted until oct 14 and the city 
would have resumed accepting prisoners oct 17 under the offer 
the people temporarily housed in federal facilities from oct 4 to 
oct 14 would have been returned to the district by jan 1 
the city had until 330 pm wednesday to accept the offer and 
did not do so said a statement issued by the justice department 
federal prisons now hold nearly 2000 city prisoners 
the crisis was triggered last thursday when us district judge 
william b bryants ordered the corrections department to comply 
with a courtordered inmate cap at the jail he gave the district a 
fiveday grace period before the decree took effect at noon tuesday 
an appeals court decision handed down the same day as bryants 
ruling requires the corrections department to bring the population 
at the overcrowded central facility at lorton va in line with a 
courtordered cap by nov1 
the dc department of corrections closed its overcrowded prison 
system to new inmates tuesday to comply with the court order and 
placed responsibility for housing them in the hands of the attorney 
general 
in a sixpage letter to washington mayor marion barry keating 
said the pace of new prison construction in the district has been 
totally inadequate 
the district has been unwilling to take the obvious emergency 
measure of placing on vacant sites within the district the modular 
facilities which other jurisdictions have used to provide quick 
accommodations for excess prison populations said keating 
the city submitted a report to bryant on wednesday morning 
explaining its plan for reducing the jail population a spokeswoman 
for bryant said 
in addition to closing the prison system the city announced 
plans to release 350 inmates early transfer 130 to penal 
institutions in other states and hire contractors to post bond for 
some indigent inmates awaiting trial 
district of columbia and federal officials met for hours 
wednesday in an unsuccessful effort to resolve their differences 
meanwhile the dc police departments traffic branch holding 
cell was turned over to the department of corrections to house some 
prisoners temporarily according to police spokesman joe gentile 
and police station houses were placed on alert to prepare to accept 
overflow prisoners

lloyd bentsen said he thought he did fine 
in wednesday nights vice presidential debate and that republican 
opponent dan quayle did not adequately explain what he would do if 
he suddenly became president 
bentsen received a telephone call from democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis immediately after the debate then left for 
a rally at a nearby hotel 
there the democratic vice presidential nominee was cheered by 
700 supporters a large sign declared and the winner is 
bentsen 
asked if he thought he had won the debate bentsen said i 
think i did fine and i enjoyed it i had fun i think we made our 
points 
bentsen referred to the repeated questioning of quayle about the 
republican vice presidential nominees qualifications to assume the 
presidency 
i stood up there for 90 minutes listening to senator quayle 
say what he was going to do if he was president of the united 
states and i still didnt know finally i realized all he was 
going to do was go back to that script again bentsen said 
dukakis called bentsen to wish him well before the debate the 
democratic ticket planned a reunion thursday at a steel plant rally 
near longview texas 
bentsen arrived in omaha on tuesday night after four days of 
intense preparations first in washington and then in austin 
texas he took time to spend with his wife and three children and 
planned to work out in the hotel gym to help him relax before the 
debate 
ba bentsen accompanied her husband to the private tour of the 
debate site wednesday afternoon afterward according to press 
secretary mike mccurry bentsen 67 picked up his wife and carried 
her off the stage she looked like she was willing to go with him 
anywhere he said 
much of his preparation was devoted to making bentsen 
comfortable with the format of the debate which limited the 
candidates to twominute answers and oneminute responses aides 
said 
its a matter of taking the language of the us senate and 
putting it in a form thats suitable for television mccurry said 
although his advisers admitted helping bentsen frame his 
answers mccurry said we have not armed him with a lot of cute 
oneliners thats not really his style 
i think well leave the oneliners to roger ailes and dan 
quayle said dukakis aide leslie dach referring to the 
republican media strategist who has been coaching the gop candidate 
bentsen and other democrats have tried to exploit public 
uneasiness about quayles qualifications for the job and public 
polls show quayle is a drag on the republican ticket a strong 
performance by the 41yearold quayle could turn that around 
i dont think people are going to judge this just by the fact 
he doesnt stumble dach said he said quayle needed an 
extremely strong performance to overcome the publics doubts

republicans declared that dan quayle exceeded 
expectations in the vice presidential debate wednesday night while 
democrats said the confrontation demonstrated lloyd bentsens 
experience and qualifications for president 
as expected reaction to the 90minute debate held in omaha 
neb and broadcast nationally was strongly partisan with backers 
of republican george bush praising quayles performance and 
supporters of democrat michael dukakis declaring bentsen the 
victor 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater described president 
reagan as gratified by the outcome and said the president 
called quayle to congratulate him 
democratic sen paul simon of illinois said neither scored a 
knockout but lloyd bentsen looked and sounded more presidential 
i dont think theres any question quayle made himself an 
asset to the ticket tonight said sen mitch mcconnell of 
kentucky a national cochairman of the george bush campaign 
prior to tonight he was not 
bentsens jibe at quayle when the indiana senator compared his 
experience to that of john f kennedy drew a mixed reaction 
jack kennedy was a friend of mine the texas democrat told 
quayle senator youre no jack kennedy 
that was uncalled for senator retorted quayle 
it threw a chill over the whole debate a sour note said 
atlantabased pollster clairbourne darden it changed from then 
on the way you looked at lloyd bentsen 
but democrats said quayle looked bad when he tried to compare 
himself with kennedy 
i think quayles worst moment was when he tried to cpmpare 
himself to jack kennedy said democratic sen alan cranston of 
california 
he quayle was forced to think for himself and it didnt go 
over said sen albert gore jr dtenn 
steve teichner a california pollster said he saw no clear 
winner 
because of the low expectations for quayle the polls will 
probably show that quayle probably won said teichner as for 
whether the debate will help in the overall race i think its a 
wash 
merle black a political scientist at the university of north 
carolina said i think bentsen did a better job i think the 
dukakis ticket ought to be helped by his performance 
but he also praised quayle who he said performed well enough 
that the bush campaign will not have to engage in extensive damage 
control after tonight but i think he was outdebated by bentsen 
nancy neuman president of the league of women voters called 
the debate a draw 
i dont see that one outshone the other particularly she 
said i think they came off pretty well as they intended whether 
the voters won im still trying to figure out

portauprince haiti ap about 100 haitian merchants blocked 
the dominican consulate wednesday claiming dominican soldiers were 
confiscating their goods radio haitiinter reported 
in another development the roman catholic priest who escaped 
injury when thugs massacred his parishioners three weeks ago made 
his first public comment on the attack wednesday and applauded the 
haitian soldiers rebellion 
the merchants who in haiti resell merchandise bought in the 
dominican republic claim the incidents occurred from sept 26 to 
oct 1 most of the incidents occurred at barahona a small town in 
southwestern dominican republic near the haitian border 
the merchants claimed the dominicans said it was a special 
control measure ordered by dominican president joaquin balaguer 
an unidentified witness alleged the soldiers pointed their rifles 
at them and confiscated the goods to sell them 
in a recorded radio address broadcast by local stations the 
rev jeanbertrand aristide paid tribute to the 13 parishioners who 
died and the more than 70 who were wounded sept 11 when men with 
guns machetes and metal skewers attacked his st jean bosco church 
like jesus christ the victims of the massacre of st jean 
bosco fell in a bloodbath of love for the liberation of their 
country aristide said 
aristide an advocate of marxist liberation theology who has 
been condemned by the church hierarchy saluted the valiant 
soldiers who have decided to continue the housecleaning 
operation 
but he did not praise lt gen prosper avril the countrys new 
leader associating him with other officiers linked to the duvalier 
regimes of the past 
the people do not trust you the people should consider all 
bigshot duvalierists as bigtime criminals until they prove the 
contrary for the rest of their lives he said in remarks 
addressed to avril 
rankandfile soldiers of the presidential guard upset by the 
church massacre and other governmentsponsored violence overthrew 
military ruler lt gen henri namphy on sept 17 and sent him into 
exile in the dominican republic they named avril as his successor

masterminding the massacre 
the enlisted men ousted many of their unpopular commanding 
officers in the week following the coup while the general populace 
hunted down stoned to death and burned a number of tonton macoutes 
believed responsible for the church massacre 
the macoutes are former members of the private militia of the 
duvalier family dictatorship that ruled haiti for 29 years until 
jeanclaude duvalier was ousted and exiled in february 1986 
avril has been identified for years as a staunch duvalierist and 
became a multimillionaire as financial advisor to the dictators

republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle said wednesday night that he did great in his debate 
with lloyd bentsen and said he was pleased at being grilled three 
times about his qualifications for higher office 
we were delighted that they brought it up three different 
times because it gave us three different times to talk to the 
american people about what ill do for the country quayle said 
as he left the civic auditorium where the debate was held and 
headed toward a postdebate rally 
asked about his performance quayle smiled at reporters and 
said great 
david prosperi quayles spokesman said quayle received 
congratulatory calls after the debate from vice president george 
bush president reagan and senate republican leader bob dole 
he quoted bush as telling his running mate you did great 
thank you very much quayle told bush according to prosperi 
at the rally at an outdoor park following the debate quayle 
asked 2000 flagwaving supporters did we win the debate 
they shouted back yes 
referring to wednesdays american league playoff game in which 
the oakland athletics beat the boston red sox 21 quayle said 
this afternoon the team from massachusetts lost and tonight 
the man from massachusetts lost 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis is governor of 
massachusetts 
quayle said bentsen had made absolutely no response to the 
fact that michael dukakis is simply out of step with mainstream 
america 
after tonight america has a little better picture of the road 
that we want to take right into the 21st century quayle said 
as he was leaving the rally to head for his hotel room quayle 
was asked by reporters about bentsens comment during the debate 
that youre no jack kennedy 
it was uncalled for quayle said 
before the debate quayle in a jocular mood had admonished the 
press to watch us carefully take good notes good news stories 
now 
i feel good quayle said as he left his hotel for the debate 
earlier wednesday the indiana senator wearing makeup for his 
morning rehearsal before the cameras and tour of the civic 
auditorium stage with his top aides looked confident and relaxed 
were ready quayle told reporters as he emerged from his 
hotel asked if he was nervous quayle replied not yet 
the mike works thats very important to make sure the mike 
works and ours is working well he said as he left the debate hall 
as for bentsen his democratic counterpart quayle joked i 
just hope he shows up 
quayle had a lowkey day as he prepared for the debate he spent 
the afternoon relaxing in his hotel room except for a brief walk 
outside 
when reporters asked about his debate strategy quayle said 
we dont want to give any strategies away 
but he said youre going to see dan quayle as he really is 
youre going to see the real dan quayle 
quayle and his aides telegraphed his strategy days ago saying 
the focus would be on dukakis rather than bentsen who the 
republicans say is closer to them than the democrats on many issues 
dukakis is running for president and hes the one im very 
concerned about becoming president quayle told reporters 
tuesday it would be a very troubling notion for many americans 
quayle took part in two mock debates this week with sen bob 
packwood rore who played bentsen and has had dozens of issues 
briefings he said packwood and his briefing team thought of 
every tough question you could possibly think of during the 
rehearsals 
i gave brilliant answers he said

here are excerpts from wednesday nights 
debate between vice presidential candidates sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas and sen dan quayle rind 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
question why do you think that you have not made a more 
substantial impression on some of these people who have been able 
to observe you up close 
quayle qualifications for the office of vice president or 
president are not age alone lets look at the three biggest 
issues that are going to be confronting america in the next 
presidency those three issues are national security and arms 
control jobs and education and the federal budget deficit on 
each one of those issues i have more experience than does the 
governor of massachusetts 
bentsen this debate tonight is not about the qualifications 
for the vice presidency no the debate tonight is a debate about 
the presidency itself and a presidential decision that has to be 
made by you the stakes could not be higher 
question if you had to step in to the presidency whos agenda 
would you pursue yours or dukakis 
bentsen we agree on so many things and the vast majority 
of the issues we agree on the fact that we have to cut this 
deficit governor dukakis and i agree that we ought to have a 
trade policy for this country that weve seen this administration 
more than double the national debt that theyve moved this country 
from the no 1 lender nation in the world to the no 1 debtor 
nation in the world under their administration that they have not 
had a trade policy that theyve let trade be a handmaiden for the 
foreign policy objectives of the country that this country has 
exported too many jobs and not enough products 
quayle governor dukakis one of the most liberal governors 
in the united states of america raised taxes five times he 
just raised taxes this last year and thats why a lot of people 
refer to him tax hike mike thats why they refer to the state 
of massachusetts as taxachusetts 
question arent you and gov dukakis using social 
security politically rather than dealing with it responsibily 
bentsen we have a contract with the american people on 
social security and social security is an issue where sen quayle 
voted eight times to cut the benefits on social security now 
when you talk about social security the people that are going to 
protect it are the democrats who brought forth that program 
quayle sen bentsen you know that i did not vote to cut social 
security benefits eight times what i have voted for and what sen 
bentsen has voted for is to delay the costofliving adjustments 
youre right they use this for political advantage what they 
try to do time and time again is to scare the old people of this 
country 
question do you consider yourself an environmentalist and 
if you do how do you reconcile that with your voting record 
quayle i have a very strong record on the environment in the 
united states senate i have voted for the major pieces of 
environmental legislation that have come down and been voted on in 
the united states senate if you bring up the environment you 
cant help but think about the environmental policy of the governor 
of massachsetts the boston harbor which is the dirtiest 
waterway in america what has the governor of massachusetts 
done about that virtually nothing 
bentsen were the authors the democratic party of clean 
air of clean water of the superfunding im one who played a very 
major role in passing the superfund legislation and every 
environmental organization that i know every major one has now 
endorsed the dukakisbentsen ticket 
question id like for you to explain your votes against 
the school breakfast program the school lunch program and the 
expansion of the child immunization program 
quayle i have a very good record and a commitment to the 
poor to those that dont have a family want to have a family 
this administration and a george bush administration will be 
committed to eradicating poverty the poverty program we are 
going to concentrate on is creating jobs and opportunities so that 
everyone will have the opportunities that they want 
bentsen what also frustrates me is the kind of votes 
hes cast against child nutrition programs the fact that he has 
voted against money that we needed for further immunization the 
denial of polio shots to kids where the parents couldnt afford to 
get that kind of a shot now i dont really believe that is 
identifying with the concerns of people in poverty 
question you and michael dukakis seem to be diametrically 
opposed on contra aid 
bentsen gov dukakis and i have disagreed on the contra program 
but my big difference with this administration is they look at 
the contra aid program as the only way to resolve that problem 
i believe that you have to work with the leaders of those other 
central american countries to try to bring about the 
democratization of nicaragua 
quayle theres no doubt in a dukakis administration that the 
aid would be cut off to the democratic resistance in nicaragua and 
that is unfortunate 
question governor dukakis has tried to make ethics a major 
issue in the campaign and he has you as a running mate a man who 
leads the league at last count in the receipt of pac money do 
you find that embarrassing senator 
bentsen no i dont wwhat ive done in pac money is just 
what my opponent in my campaign has done in his campaign so 
what you have to do is comply with the laws as they are i have 
been for campaign reform and have pushed it very hard but ive 
noticed that the senator from indiana has opposed that campaign 
reform and voted repeatedly against it 
quayle senator bentsen is the number one pac raiser as a 
matter of fact he used to have a 10000 breakfast club it 
only cost highpaid lobbyist special interests in washington to 
come down and have breakfast with the chairman of the senate 
finance committe the one that oversees all the tax loopholes in 
the tax code 10000 im sure they werent paying to have corn 
flakes

very important thing

an associated press panel of veteran debate 
judges called lloyd bentsen the winner by a wide margin over dan 
quayle in their vice presidential debate wednesday night an 
instant abc news poll also gave the victory to the democratic 
nominee 
abc news polled 637 registered voters immediately after the 
debate fiftyone percent said bentsen had won 27 called quayle 
the winner and 22 percent said it was a tie 
the debate also swayed some undecided voters over to the 
democratic ticket 
in a survey prior to the debate 50 percent said they favored 
george bush while 45 percent picked michael dukakis and 5 percent 
were undecided after the debate the same people favored bush with 
50 percent dukakis received 48 percent and 2 percent were unsure 
eightyseven percent said bentsen was qualified to become 
president 12 percent said he wasnt and 1 percent was undecided 
asked whether quayle was qualified to assume the presidency 48 
percent said yes 49 percent said no and 3 percent were undecided 
the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 45 percent 
the ap panel of six debate judges unanimous in calling bentsen 
the winner scored the contest 148125 for the texas senator some 
panel members pointed to bentsens statement that quayle was no 
jack kennedy as the turning point of the debate 
melissa maxcy wade the director of forensics at emory 
university in atlanta scored it 2422 for bentsen i thought 
quayle really held his own until we got to the john kennedy 
question she said it was like a father putting down a child 
i thought the momentum turned then 
up to that point bentsen had not answered the breakfast club 
questions well but after that it was almost like he got more 
confidence said wade it was almost like the john kennedy 
question fueled bentsen for the rest of the debate 
james j unger director of the national forensics institute at 
american university in washington and chairman of the ap panel 
picked bentsen 2517 he said quayle generally lived down to his 
expectations bentsen lived up to and even above his in fact 
bentsen made a better case for mike dukakis than mike dukakis has 
james m copeland national executive secretary of the national 
forensic league in ripon wis said itwas the best of any of the 
presidential or vicepresidential debates since 1976 
copeland who scored it 2522 for bentsen said quayle chose 
to ignore questions that were being asked and instead to attack 
dukakis and to bring in political themes of his own choosing he 
said some of quayles slashandburn attacks were reminiscent of 
sen bob dole in the 1976 vice presidential debate against 
walter mondale 
copeland said bentsen with his very avuncular manner stuck 
closer to the debate format but he added that the panel of 
reporters also gave quayle as harsh a grilling as i have ever 
seen 
steven p mancuso director of intercollegiate forensics for the 
university of michigan scored it 2320 for bentsen i felt dan 
quayle failed to answer the question that was asked him three times 
about what he would do if he had to assume the presidency said 
mancuso 
william southworth director of forensics and professor of 
speech at the university of redlands calif scored it 2624 for 
bentsen but said i thought bentsen won a large majority of the 
issues but im not convinced he will come out looking as if he 
did he said he was not sure how viewers will take bentsens 
kennedy crack 
donn parson director of graduate study in the university of 
kansas department of communication studies rated bentsen a 2520 
winner the difference was quayles inability to cite 
specifics said parson one of the best examples was on the 
environment he answered by saying bush will take on the problem 
in the sept 25 debate between michael dukakis and george bush 
the ap panel picked dukakis as a narrow winner on points 144141 
the judges watched the debate on television and used a scorecard 
modeled after the one used in collegiate and scholastic debates 
they awarded one to five points in each of six categories 
reasoning evidence organization refutation crossexamination 
and presentation a 1 was poor 2 fair 3 average 4 excellent and 
5 superior 
each judge could award a maximum of 30 points a perfect score 
would have been 180 
here are the candidates combined scores

governments with a stake in the oilrich 
persian gulf should give urgent priority to the threat from mines 
western military and diplomatic officials say 
even though there is a ceasefire in the iraniraq war the 
mines dont know theres a ceasefire said us navy capt jim 
miller 
miller who has commanded the us minesweeping contingent in 
the gulf for the past few months said monday theyre out there 
cocked and ready to fire if we dont deal with them on our terms 
well have to deal with them on theirs 
at least seven mines have been found in the persian gulf since 
the truce went into effect 45 days ago and military sources speak 
of a statistical probability that a ship will hit one of the 
explosives 
american intelligence assessments say there are 150 to 200 mines 
still in the gulf concentrated in the north most are believed to 
have been laid by iran and some by iraq officers say but neither 
country has provided data on the locations 
these officers have predicted that the problem will worsen as 
winter storms cause more of the longsubmerged explosives to break 
loose and follow prevailing currents down the western coast of the 
gulf 
military sources speaking on condition they not be identified 
said the mines threaten not only shipping but the fishing industry 
underwater oil pipelines and children who sometimes find the 
oddlooking globes washed up on beaches 
several coastal fishing dhows have been sunk or damaged by 
mines one source recalled that two bahrain children were killed by 
a mine last year and said another was found recently in qatar 
between 12 and 50 mines are known to have been sunk unexploded 
by local naval units off the coast between kuwait and the united 
arab emirates one source said if those arent found and 
destroyed one of them bumping against a pipeline and exploding 
could create an immense pollution problem he said 
progress toward a coordinated effort to clear the mines is 
impeded by political concerns within the sixmember gulf 
cooperation council the military and diplomatic sources said 
the countries saudi arabia kuwait bahrain qatar the united 
arab emirates and oman remained nominally neutral during the war 
but supported iraq against nonarab iran 
now say western diplomats the council states are reluctant to 
undertake any action that either baghdad or tehran might interpret 
as hostile as long as the geneva peace talks remain stalled 
nobody wants to do anything that could be seen as antianybody 
said one diplomat 
the mine threat one said isnt something theyre paying a 
lot of attention to and theyre not likely to until things start 
to go bang in the night 
although council states privately welcomed the foreign warships 
sent to the gulf last year to escort tankers their presence 
remains a touchy political issue and the governments might not 
recognize the mine problem before antimine vessels leave the gulf 
one western source said 
there now are at least 16 foreign mine sweepers in the gulf 
region including six us three british two italian two french 
one belgian one dutch and one or more soviet 
us officers say there are no plans for the 30yearold 
woodenhulled american craft to leave and suggest some might remain 
indefinitely

new government figures show that farmers last 
year got the smallest portion of the food shoppers dollar since 
the agriculture department began compiling such figures 75 years 
ago 
according to revised figures by the departments economic 
research service the farm value of the retail cost of a market 
basket of food sold in grocery stores in 1987 was 30 percent down 
for the third straight year from 35 percent in 1984 
the farmers share of the food dollar dropped to 32 percent in 
1985 and to 31 percent in 1986 
earlier agriculture department estimates had put those readings 
even lower to 31 percent in 1985 30 percent in 1986 and 29 
percent in 1987 
department records show the farm share of each consumer food 
dollar averaged 46 percent in 1913 when recordkeeping began until 
the figure fell to 31 percent in 1986 the record low mark had been 
32 percent in both 1932 and 1933 during the depression the high 
was more than 50 percent in world war ii and for a few years 
thereafter 
the market basket contains average quantities of domestically 
produced food bought in grocery stores excluding nonalcoholic 
beverages and fish and seafood 
one reason for the slippage in the farm value of grocery items 
has been a general weakening of prices for some raw commodities 
but the situation varies greatly from item to item and it depends 
on how much processing is involved 
only a slight amount of raw milk is lost for example as it 
is handled and processed for sale in cartons to consumers the 
report said therefore the farm value of the retail price per 
halfgallon is just a little more than the price that milk 
producers receive per halfgallon 
the report added in contrast nearly 24 pounds of live 
animal are needed to yield one pound of choice beef on the meat 
counter the payment the cattle producer receives for that large 
quantity of live animal is the gross farm value in the price of one 
pound of retail beef 
with the 1987 farm value of groceries at 30 cents of each 
consumer food dollar that means 70 cents went to nonfarmers the 
people who buy transport process and sell food at wholesale and 
retail 
each time the farmers share declines it means a greater 
farmretail share for the others 
ralph parlett a food economist in the agency says the trend to 
a smaller share for farmers also is the result of a growing 
consumer preference for a greater degree of processing in food 
when the farmers share of the food dollar was 45 cents to 49 
cents in the early 1950s there was less processing people bought 
raw food took it home and cooked or preserved it now parlett 
said in a recent telephone interview supermarkets display the 
latest in the processors art 
the products we have today arent the same he said 
microwave products are an example we didnt have those at all a 
few years ago 
also he said the efficiencies of farmers have picked up 
meaning that greater yields are resulting from the same acreages 
more meat from the same amount of feed

fears of a decade ago that city sprawl might 
consume farmland by the millions of acres annually have not 
materialized according to a new study by the agriculture 
department 
marlow vesterby and douglas h brooks of the departments 
economic research service estimated that urban areas grew at the 
rate of about 740000 acres a year during the 1970s 
concern continues about the survival of farms in highgrowth 
ruralurban fringe areas and about the adequacy of cropland for 
future food and fiber production they said in the latest issue 
of agricultural outlook magazine however ers calculations based 
on aerial photographs show that urbanization of agricultural land 
is not occurring as rapidly as previously thought 
in january 1981 just before the carter administration left 
office a report by the national agricultural lands study said new 
intiatives were needed to protect farmland and to ensure that the 
nation would have enough productive capacity 
the study estimated that the united states was losing 
agricultural land at the rate of about 3 million acres a year 
including about 1 million acres from the nations cropland base 
other experts at the time questioned the studys figures as 
misleading they asserted that the united states was in no danger 
of running out of cropland 
the study also estimated that american farmers would have to 
plant between 84 million and 143 million additional acres by the 
year 2000 in order to meet anticipated domestic and foreign 
demands for agricultural products

the agriculture department says farmers soon 
will be getting about 12 billion in cash payments for 
participating in the conservation reserve program 
milton hertz executive vice president of the departments 
commodity credit corp said tuesday the payments are rental fees 
for land contracts signed in the 1986 1987 and 1988 fiscal years 
under the program farmers agree to take highly erodible 
cropland from production for 10 years in return usda helps pay 
for planting the land with protective grass or trees and provides 
annual rental payments over the 10year contract period 
the goal under the program is to take 40 million to 45 million 
acres of highly erodible land from crop production by 1990 more 
than 255 million acres have have been enrolled officially and an 
additional 34 million acres were offered by farmers in a recent

for three decades serious mishaps at the 
savannah river nuclear weapons plant were kept secret for national 
security reasons and in some cases not reported to washington 
according to federal officials who are trying to change that 
attitude 
one senior energy department official has compared the approach 
to safety at the savannah river plant near aiken sc to that 
which led to the explosion of the shuttle challenger on jan 28 
1986 
and one member of congress says the facility which has been 
closed since august should not be allowed to reopen until the 
situation improves 
an energy department spokesman will callicott said that since 
the federal government began making atomic weapons in world war ii 
there has always been a mind set a culture that we are doing 
work that is important for national security and perhaps that may 
override any obligation toward public accountablility 
people have historically not been sensitive to the importance 
of disclosing things callicott said clearly there is a lot 
of information that did not make it up the chain to top management 
here at headquarters 
without a detailed review of the record he said it would be 
impossible to determine exactly what information had reached 
washington and what had been released to the public 
energy secretary john herrington since taking office in 1985 
has given heightened attention to the area of environmental 
safety and health and for the first time placed these issues in 
the hands of an assistant secretary callicott said 
the savannah river facility produces plutonium and tritium 
which are used in making nuclear weapons it is run by ei du pont 
nemours amp co under contract from the energy department 
a du pont inspector gc ridgely wrote in a recently released 
august 1985 memorandum that 30 reactor incidents of the greatest 
significance occurred there none however were as serious as 
the may 1986 disaster at chernobyl in the soviet union according 
to congresssional aides 
one of the most serious mishaps at savannah river was the 
melting in november 1970 of a rod used to start an atomic chain 
reaction causing radioactive contamination of an adjacent room it 
took 900 people three months to clean up the contamination 
according to the memo 
serious radiation exposure could have occurred because no 
outside alarm existed and an alarm was ignored for two hours 
the memo said 
last friday energy department officials said the department had 
not been informed of the incidents but on monday senior department 
spokesman c anson franklin said those statements were incorrect 
and that the incidents had been reported to the departments 
regional office in aiken 
he said the information apparently had not been relayed to 
headquarters in washington from the regional office 
the reactors at savannah river were closed down after the most 
recent incident in august and had been scheduled to reopen 
tuesday but energy department officials assured members of 
congress last week that production would not resume until safety 
was assured possibly after 30 days to 45 days 
if they restart those things without having briefed us and 
without having convinced us they have solved the safety and health 
issues they will be in serious trouble in the congress said 
rep mike synar dokla 
synar chairman of the energy environment and natural resources 
subcommittee of the government affairs committee held hearings on 
the savannah river facility last friday 
he reacted angrily tuesday to assertions that national security 
considerations ever justified keeping mishaps secret at savannah 
river 
just because they claim it is national security doesnt make 
it national security he said i didnt know that the health 
and safety of the workers and the surrounding citizens was a 
national security issue 
synar agreed that the department had an institutional problem 
but challenged assertions that herrington had changed the situation 
they have set up a system that rewards managers in the field 
for keeping the lid on bad news synar said 
i think that there are good people at the energy department 
that want to make safety a priority he said that attitude 
starts at the top and i havent seen it it is very clear that 
headquarters has not been supportive of that there has not been a 
system set up that made the operational or field offices 
accountable 
the most blistering charge last week came from richard 
starostecki deputy assistant secretary for safety health and 
quality assurance in a memorandum discussing the most recent 
incident a small power pulse in august 
the issue was not whether the reactor was out of control this 
time it was not starostecki said in the memo which was released 
at a congressional hearing 
the more serious issue deals with an institutional problem and 
attitudes toward safety starostecki said 
there are currently some managers within the department with 
an attitude toward production reactor safety which on the face 
seems to be similar to that which existed in the space program 
prior to the challenger accident he said

america now has more than 245 million 
residents thanks to strong immigration and an increase in the 
natural growth of the us population the census bureau says 
as of jan 1 the national population was 245110000 the bureau 
said up from 242825000 a year earlier 
the largest part of the increase was from natural growth 17 
million people that resulted from 38 million births minus 21 
million deaths 
in addition there were an estimated 600000 immigrant arrivals 
the bureau said 
at 09 percent for the year the overall increase is consistent 
with longterm trends the agency reported the nations population 
has been growing at about 1 percent annually since about 1960 
births last year averaged 156 per 1000 people up from 154 in 
1986 but below the 157 rate of 1985 
while this is well above the alltime low of 145 recorded in 
1976 there has been no consistent trend in recent years 
population experts note that the giant post world war ii baby 
boom generation currently has produced many women in their prime 
childbearing ages thus producing more potential mothers to raise 
the birth rate 
even so the birth rate is nowhere near the high rate set in the 
wake of the world war ii when births climbed to a record 265 per 
1000 in 1947 
deaths occurred at a rate of 87 per 1000 people and have been 
fluctuating in the 85 to 87 range since 1977 after declining from 
94 in 1972 
there were 25 net immigrants per 1000 people including an 
allowance for illegal arrivals the bureau said thats down from 
27 in 1986 and well below the 37 mark of 1980 highest since 
world war ii 
the overall growth rate was 07 percent last year for whites and 
15 percent for blacks both down substantially since 1960

the supreme court is deciding whether 
excluding prospective jurors because of race violates a criminal 
defendants right to a jury representing a crosssection of the 
community 
the high court ruled in 1986 that racially motivated 
disqualifications violate equalprotection provisions of the law 
however chicago attorney patricia unsinn asked the justices 
tuesday to expand on that decision by ordering a new trial for 
frank d teague a black man convicted of armed robbery and 
attempted murder 
an allwhite jury found teague guilty in august 1978 after a 
cook county prosecutor used all of his peremptory challenges the 
disqualification of potential jurors without stating a reason to 
exclude 10 blacks from the jury 
the supreme court ruled on april 30 1986 in a case called 
batson vs kentucky that a defendants right to equal protection 
would be violated if prosecutors disqualified potential jurors 
based on their race 
it later held that the ruling does not apply to convicted 
criminals who had exhausted direct appeals in state courts prior to 
the announcement of the batson decision 
while the batson ruling came too late to help teague his 
attorney argued that the exclusion of blacks also violated her 
clients sixth amendment right to a jury representing a 
crosssection of the community 
because the prosecutor took affirmative action to destroy the 
representative makeup of that jury we did not get the protection 
that the sixth amendment guarantees unsinn said 
assistant illinois attorney general david e bindi argued that 
it is impossible to ensure a representative crosssection of the 
community for every trial and said the fact that teagues jury was 
all white did not necessarily deny him a fair trial 
crosssectionalism is not the litmus test of impartiality 
bindi said to equate jury impartiality with some form of mix on 
the jury is to take a dangerous step toward saying that juries 
be filled by quotas 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals ruled in may 1987 that 
past supreme court decisions make clear the fair crosssection 
requirement of the sixth amendment does not apply to the jury 
itself but only to the pool of potential jurors from which the 
jury is chosen 
the supreme court is expected to rule on the case sometime next 
year

but clear creek county treasurer geraldine thompson may have 
upstaged walters she returned his change of 110 mostly in 
nickels dimes and pennies 
i guess he was just trying to make a statement said 
thompson i just gave him all the change i could dish out i 
mean turnabout is fair play 
walters said he enjoyed thompsons response to his silent 
protest he said he was trying to make a point when he paid his 
2890 in taxes in person with an old gunpowder crate full of 1 
bills 
i dont mind paying my property taxes said walters but 
sometimes they county officials have a tendency not to realize 
how much money theyre taking from people 
i only get to see 3000 twice a year once when i borrow it 
to pay my income taxes and once when i borrow to pay my property 
taxes 
thompson said she has known walters for about seven years and 
realized he has an ornery sense of humor she said it could 
have been worse 
he could have undone the bundles and just thrown them at me

could learn from a truckload of pumpkins 
but her experiment turned out to be a lesson in entrepreneurship 
for the youngsters 
ms cooley lent her class 100 to start their own business 
called the pumpkin patch she then persuaded her brotherinlaw 
orchard owner joe huber to give the class more than 300 pumpkins 
ms cooleys loan covered the cost of paint and brushes which 
the children use to draw goblin faces on the pumpkins the 
youngsters then sold their handiwork back to huber at 150 each 
he in turn sells them to the public 
the students already have made enough to pay off their loan ms 
cooley expects the class to turn a profit of about 500 which will 
be used to pay for several field trips extra money will be given 
to the school to purchase playground equipment she said 
at the beginning of the year many of these kids had a 
difficult time calculating the value of money and being able to 
make the right change but this project has really gotten through

basketball coach jerry tarkanians long feud 
with the ncaa is being refereed by the supreme court in a case 
testing the collegiate organizations disciplinary authority 
the courts decision could affect among other things the 
national collegiate athletic associations investigations into 
alleged drug use by some athletes 
the justices who granted an ncaa appeal last february were to 
hear arguments in the case today a decision is expected by july 
tarkanian head coach at the university of nevada at las vegas 
since 1973 is trying to preserve the victory he won in lower 
courts and avoid a twoyear suspension for alleged ncaa violations 
following a 30month investigation ncaa officials said 
tarkanian arranged for a student to get a b grade without 
attending class provided free air fare to a studentathlete 
encouraged individuals to give the ncaa false information to impede 
its probe falsely certified unlvs program as complying with ncaa 
rules and failed to comport with high ethical standards 
the nevada supreme court ruled that tarkanian was denied 
dueprocess during the ncaa investigation that led to his 
suspension but to reach that conclusion the state court had to 
find that the ncaa a private organization acted with governmental 
power 
the justices handling of that larger issue will affect coaches 
and athletes at staterun ncaa member schools across the nation 
individuals and private organizations generally cannot violate 
someones constitutional rights only a government and its agents 
can do that because the constitution protects against governmental 
not private wrongdoing 
courts call the concept the doctrine of state action 
the ncaa is a private organization representing nearly 1000 
colleges and universities 
but in the tarkanian case the state court said the ncaa was 
acting as a surrogate for unlv a state university 
the right to discipline public employees is traditionally the 
exclusive prerogative of the state the nevada court said unlv 
cannot escape responsibility for disciplinary action against 
employees by delegating that duty to a private entity 
because the ncaa investigators were acting as agents of a state 
school the state court ruled tarkanian was entitled to more due 
process more opportunities to be heard and more information about 
the investigation 
the ncaa insisting its investigation was not state action 
sought help from the nations highest court 
if the justices agree with the nevada court the ncaa will find 
itself in a curious position it will have to afford more 
dueprocess rights to coaches and athletes at staterun schools 
than those who work for or attend private schools 
the unlv program was placed on two years probation in 1977 for 
recruiting violations and the ncaa that same year ordered the 
school to suspend tarkanian 
his court fight staved off the suspension and won him the right 
to have the ncaa pay some of his legal fees

the power of states and local governments to 
require minority participation in public works projects is being 
explored by the supreme court in a key affirmative action dispute 
the justices were to hear arguments today over a richmond va 
program that set aside 30 percent of the value of all municipal 
building projects for minority participation the court is expected 
to decide by july whether the plan should be reinstated 
the plan was challenged successfully in a lower court by ja 
croson co a building contractor 
at stake could be similar setaside plans established by most 
states and some 190 local governments 
the case also is attracting widespread attention because of what 
it might foretell about the courts future approach to other forms 
of affirmative action and alleged reverse discrimination 
justice anthony m kennedy is participating in his first case 
involving preferential treatment for minorities since joining the 
court last february he replaced justice lewis f powell who often 
cast the deciding vote on affirmative action issues in the closely 
divided court 
setaside programs also have caused some deep divisions and 
seemingly contradictory views within the reagan administration 
president reagan for example said in 1984 he favored 
channeling billions of additional contract dollars to 
minorityowned firms and the administration generally has looked 
upon public works setasides more sympathetically than other 
affirmative action quotas it sternly opposes 
but the justice department responding to an invitation from the 
supreme court in a case similar to the richmond dispute challenged 
the constitutionality of setasides 
the richmond plan was declared unlawful in september 1987 by the 
4th us circuit court of appeals the appeals court said there is 
insufficient evidence that richmond city officials discriminated 
against minorityowned businesses in the past 
also the appeals court said the citys 30 percent quota 
appeared to be a completely arbitrary figure that simply emerged 
from the mists 
richmond adopted the plan in 1983 to require that a prime 
contractor on any city building project subcontract at least 30 
percent of the value of the project to firms that are at least 
onehalf minority owned 
the minorities named in the plan are blacks hispanics 
orientals indians eskimos and aleuts 
the 4th circuit court in invalidating the program relied 
heavily on a 1986 supreme court ruling that struck down an 
affirmative action plan in michigan designed to protect from 
layoffs the jobs of minority teachers with less seniority than 
whites 
the justices in that case said preferential treatment of 
minorities must be narrowly tailored to avoid hurting whites the 
justices also restricted the power of employers to adopt 
affirmative action programs when there has not been proof the 
employers practiced past discrimination 
but civil rights groups point to a 1980 supreme court ruling 
that allows congress to earmark 10 percent of federal public works 
contracts for minoritycontrolled businesses 
the court also has upheld other forms of affirmative action 
programs in a string of recent decisions 
minorities make up about half of richmonds population and 
minorityowned businesses received less than 1 percent of the value 
of city contracts prior to adoption of the setaside 
the plan was challenged by ja croson co after its bid the 
only one submitted to install stainless steel urinals and water 
closets at the city jail was rejected 
city officials refused to award the contract even though croson 
said there was only one minority contractor that could help on that 
project and croson considered that company unqualified croson also 
said the cost of the project would rise by 7663 if the minority 
contractor took part the city then called for new bids

two of the worlds largest food distribution 
companies have denied charges they failed to follow international 
guildelines for marketing infant formula in third world countries 
both the swissbased nestle sa and american home products corp 
responded quickly tuesday when action for corporate accountability 
announced it was renewing a boycott against nestle products and 
extending it to american home products 
leaders of the minnesotabased group engineered a sevenyear 
boycott against nestle that ended in 1984 when the company agreed 
to an infant formula marketing code worked out with the world 
health organization and unicef an arm of the united nations 
boycott leaders said they were renewing their call for the 
marketplace action because nestle and american home products were 
not abiding by the agreement 
nestle has worked diligently to ensure its marketing policies 
follow who recommendations company spokesman thad m jackson 
said in washington he said the guidelines allow companies to 
provide free or reducedprice formula to hospitals in third world 
nations for babies who have to be fed breastmilk substitutes 
carol emerling a spokewoman for american home products said 
this whole activity is based on allegations that we violate the 
who code and we flat out deny it 
the real issue is infant health she said breastfeeding 
is best for infants weve always said that but every infant who 
is not receiving breast milk has the right to the best alternative 
available that alternative is a scientifically formulated infant 
formula that is as close to breast milk as man can make it and 
that is what our infant formula products are 
boycott leader douglas a johnson chairman of action for 
corporate accountability contended at a news conference that 
nestle and american home products and to a lesser degree other 
formula distributors are interpreting the guidelines in a way that 
allows them to skirt the intent and encourage mothers who could 
breast feed their babies to use formula instead 
although johnson does not have a blanket objection to using 
infant formula he maintains it is wrong for manufacturers to 
encourage its use in powdered form in third world countries where 
most mothers typically dont have the money education and sanitary 
facilities to mix it properly 
the result he argues is that thousands of third world babies 
develop often fatal diseases because they drink from bottles with 
understrength formula that either does not give them the nutrients 
they need or infects them with various germs or both 
the fundamental issue is whether formula distributors 
effectively get babies and their mothers hooked on formula within 
days of birth by making their product available for free 
distribution at hospitals and other birthing facilities 
in the hands of the poor the feedingbottle often becomes a 
passport to death for the young child said dr rk anand a 
pediatrician from bombay india present at the news conference 
the physician said his practice has convinced him of three 
things bottle feeding continues to kill a large number of babies 
in india and other developing countries even poor mothers can 
produce enough breastmilk for their babies for at least the first 
four months of life restraint on the aggressive marketing of 
infant formula is essential 
otherwise said anand more and more babies will be 
displaced from their mothers breast by big business 
janice mantell executive director of action for corporate 
accountability estimated that about 6 billion in infant formula 
is sold worldwide each year half of it in developing countries 
she estimated nestle has 40 percent to 50 percent of the market in 
the third world and american home products about 20 percent

a congress split by economic and regional 
differences has proven again that cleaning up air pollution from 
vehicle tailpipes and industrial smokestacks remains the nations 
toughest environmental problem 
only once since the clean air act was enacted in 1970 has 
congress been able to agree on major amendments to strengthen the 
basic law and that occurred 11 years ago 
two years ago environmentalists in the house and senate renewed 
the campaign to escalate the battle against urban smog acid rain 
caused by coalburning factories and power plants and toxic fumes 
from chemicals 
on tuesday they tossed in the towel vowing to try again next 
year 
there has not been sufficient willingness to compromise 
said sen george mitchell dmaine who spent much of 1988 trying 
to put together a consensus on a clean air bill as a result we 
will do nothing 
mitchell citing this summers smog alerts around the country 
said the technology exists to control air pollution all we lack 
is the political will to do so 
among those he cited as resisting compromise were the 
environmental lobby and the two behemoths that would be most 
affected by such legislation electric utilities and the auto 
industry domestic and foreign 
sen robert stafford rvt a veteran of clean air wars 
pointed his finger at senate majority leader robert byrd dwva 
who held the environment committees bill off the floor for 11 
months while he pushed for concessions for west virginias coal 
the bills death left the nation with no new tools to combat the 
ozone and carbon monoxide chiefly from vehicle emissions that 
has grown to the point that upwards of 100 urban areas are 
violating air quality standards designed to protect human health 
also left in the dust was any new plan to deal with toxic fumes 
from chemical plants and the acidrain chemicals produced by 
coalburning power plants and factories 
last month mitchell and richard trumka president of the united 
mine workers union worked out an acid rain plan that favored west 
virginias high sulfur coal industry and mandated the use of 
expensive stack gas scrubbers by about two dozen large utilities 
the proposal infuriated senators from western states with 
cleaner burning low sulphur coal alan simpson rwyo threatened 
to filibuster the environmental lobbys clean air coalition also 
criticized the plan saying that no bill was better than a weak one 
southern lawmakers were unhappy because the proposal would have 
forced some of their power plants to install scrubbers to solve 
what is generally seen in the capitol as a problem of midwest 
utilities polluting the northeast 
for its part the utilities lobby the edison electric 
institute consistently said no to acid rain controls it cited 
scientific disagreements over the problem and said controls should 
await development of cleancoal technology which is expected to be 
cheaper than scrubbers 
byrd issued a statement saying he was disappointed that a 
compromise on acid rain could not be reached this year that would 
both enhance the environment and protect the economies of 
coalproducing states like west virginia i will continue to 
work to resolve this issue 
the fight over acid rain was just part of the complicated 
closeddoor negotiations over the clean air bill 
another major factor in its demise was a proposal to help combat 
urban pollution by forcing reluctant automakers to produce vehicles 
with cleaner exhaust emissions 
a key player in this area was rep john dingell dmich who 
represents an automaking district and who chairs the house energy 
and commerce committee 
dingell and cleanexhaust advocate rep henry waxman dcalif 
were unable to agree on new tailpipe standards thus paralyzing the 
committee and keeping a clean air bill off the house floor 
dingell and waxman held no serious negotiations after august 
taking the position that the senate should solve its acid rain 
problems and send a clean air plan to the house 
mitchell and dingell had even discussed a scenario under which 
the senate would pass the basic acid rain language the house would 
handle the urban pollution provisions and the two bodies would 
accept each others product 
matters never got to this point stafford said he and some other 
proenvironment senators could have taken the mitchelltrumka plan 
had byrd agreed to support the antismog and toxic chemicals 
sections 
byrd however declined to make this commitment leaving 
supporters of a strong bill unwilling to leave the question of 
stricter tailpipe emissions to chance and eventual negotiations 
with dingell 
richard ayres chairman of the clean air coalition said the 
environmental lobby was unwilling to support the mitchelltrumka 
plan because we cant recommend an acid rain program unless it is 
good

supporters of a bill to impose tougher 
restrictions on textile imports after failing to override 
president reagans veto promise to renew their efforts when 
congress returns next year 
well be back sen ernest f hollings dsc said tuesday 
after the house voted 272152 to override reagans veto but fell 11 
votes short of the twothirds needed to enact the measure over his 
objections 
the action appeared to close the book on the battle for textile 
legislation this year with two weeks at most remaining before 
lawmakers adjourn to campaign full time 
the bill designed to protect american industry from foreign 
competition would freeze current textile and apparel imports at 
1987 levels and limit future increases to 1 percent annually the 
same would apply to nonrubber footwear except that no future 
growth would be allowed 
countries that increase their purchases of us farm goods would 
get larger shares of the us textiles market a pilot program 
would be established allowing the government to auction off import 
licenses a special quota would be created for imported silk 
neckties 
reagan vetoed the measure sept 28 saying it represented 
protectionism at its worst and would not only narrow consumer 
choices but inhibit trade and cost america overseas sales sponsors 
said it would save american jobs now in jeopardy because of a wave 
of asian textiles and apparel crowding us merchandise out of 
stores 
house speaker jim wright dtexas lobbied furiously for the 
override and sponsors said they were close to twothirds at one 
point but we had some guys we just couldnt pull across said 
rep wg hefner dnc 
obviously im disappointed hollings said in a statement 
he claimed the bill was similar to provisions endorsed by reagan 
several years ago before the president became critical of this 
protectionism nonsense 
the failure to override the veto means that the next congress 
or the next administration must act to restructure our current 
inefficient textile policy sen strom thurmond rsc said 
after the vote 
textile and apparel workers bused in for the occasion from 
various east coast cities held a flagwaving rally on the steps of 
the capitol at noon chanting save our jobs save our jobs 
some then watched glumly from the house galleries as the 
legislation met its doom 
critics portrayed the measure as guaranteed to spur price 
increases that would amount to a fresh tax on consumers 
stand up for consumers stand up for america support your 
presidents veto urged rep william frenzel rminn 
rep sam gibbons dfla another of the bills fiercest 
critics said it imposes a tax on consumers of about 20 billion 
a year 
rep ed jenkins dga sometimes said to occupy the textile 
seat on the house ways and means committee scoffed at the notion 
of new price hikes under the bill and added that import curbs are 
common in asian countries 
they have quotas all over asia jenkins said 
rep olympia snowe rmaine whose homestate shoe factories 
have been hammered by imports urged lawmakers to ignore the 
ideological rot of an obsolete freetrade policy and approve 
this sensible trade bill 
a number of lawmakers alluded to upcoming elections and 
political pressures arising from the bill 
if the house were to do this by secret ballot there would be 
no doubt about the outcome said rep tom downey dny to 
override the presidents veto makes no sense open markets make 
us all richer 
dont be dissuaded by those who tell you that this is a great 
political issue said rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of 
the house ways and means committee bad economics doesnt make 
for good politics 
imports surged into the us market in the early 1980s and 
congress responded with a textile bill that reagan vetoed on 
similar grounds in december 1985 an override attempt failed in the 
house in august 1986 
the textile industry already protected by 1400 tariffs 
undertook a wave of modernization as a result and there were many 
layoffs as aging plants closed and new ones were automated 
earnings were up last year and critics of the bill say the 
industry is flourishing 
but earnings fell 12 percent in the first quarter of this year 
and layoffs have increased over the last 12 months

call it the first oneman debate in 
presidential campaign history dan quayle versus dan quayle 
lloyd bentsen will share the stage for tonights vice 
presidential debate but its clearly quayles show 
if the polls are right most americans have a positive view of 
bentsen the lanky patrician senator from texas few doubt his 
qualifications to move up to the office of president if that were 
required 
quayle is quite another matter opinion polls say most americans 
have serious doubts about the youthful indiana senators 
qualifications to be president 
people are looking for him to get up there and stumble said 
herb mabry a democratic national committee member from georgia 
one of the few southern states the democratic ticket still is given 
a fighting chance to carry in november 
if quayle comes across as a person who could lead the country 
its going to make our job tougher mabry said 
when the lights go up in omaha neb tonight attention will be 
riveted on quayle the fact that he is seen as far more likely to 
blunder opens a greater opportunity for him to emerge a big winner 
will he fall on his face will he commit some verbal gaffe that 
will dominate coverage of the debate can he survive 90 minutes in 
front of a national audience of millions 
no such questions are asked about bentsen obviously thats a 
great danger for the democratic ticket 
perhaps quayle represents the ultimate political expectations 
game a candidate who can claim victory if he avoids embarrassing 
himself while his opponent goes on stage with the burden of being 
portrayed as mr senior senator a man who doesnt make mistakes 
how will voters judge these two candidates will they score one 
gaffe by bentsen as the equal of three by quayle 
but the omaha debate can be much more than an expectations game 
in a sense neither candidate wants to be seen as debating the 
other each gains far more by establishing his own credentials an 
easier job for bentsen than for quayle 
but that is the factor that moves the debate beyond the surface 
expectations game of can quayle survive 90 minutes without 
stumbling 
dorothy english executive director of the arkansas republican 
party saw the debate as an opportunity for quayle to settle in 
the voters minds that he is vice presidential material if he falls 
on his face which we certainly do not expect then it would go 
in the opposite direction 
as for bentsen democratic pollster peter hart said i think 
hes looking for two words to be said about him solid and 
competent hes not debating dan quayle hes in essence telling 
you why a dukakis administration makes sense and why a bush 
administration doesnt make sense 
good advice to a candidate up against an opponent who could win 
as long as he doesnt trip over his tongue 
it may be enough for quayle to come across to viewers as a 
credible united states senator from indiana a man who sits across 
the aisle from bentsen one who often is on the same side of issues 
as the texan 
certainly one expectation is that quayle will try to make just 
that point during the debate that he will point out his agreements 
with bentsen and the many areas of disagreement both have with 
dukakis 
that might do it for quayle or it might leave the lingering 
question established in the minds of many voters in the weeks 
immediately following bushs decision to place the indiana senator 
on the gop ticket 
the larger and broader question about quayle is left 
unanswered said hart that question is how does he perform if 
you turn the keys of the free world over to him

campaign strategists for george bush 
say they are trying to win the nations most populous state by 
pursuing not only the reagan democrats but also more moderate 
democrats who might be attracted to a futureoriented 
republican candidate distinct from president reagan 
a number of swing voters are not reagan democrats steve 
merksamer the bush state campaign chairman said in reference to 
those democrats who voted for reagan in the past two elections 
they are more moderate democrats who are not necessarily in 
sinc with reagans conservative ideas 
with a democratic edge in the states voter registration the 
republicans must attract democrats as they have in past elections 
to win the state with the most electoral votes 47 
public opinion polls show the race virtually even making 
california a critical tossup state its diverse economy and broad 
demographic and social makeup makes california an expensive state 
in which to campaign but both candidates are making an allout 
push 
the bush campaign will devote most of its resources in the 
coming weeks to winning swing voters and democrats said senior 
campaign consultant bill lacy who is heading the california 
effort he said the bush forces are confident they have already 
shored up their republican support in the tight contest 
in comments to reporters traveling with the campaign tuesday 
lacy and merksamer refused to disclose projected budget figures for 
the california effort 
the moderate democrats many of whom live in the sacramento 
area do not respond with the same emotional intensity to the 
socalled value issues that are popular with the democrats who 
crossed party lines to give president reagan his two general 
election victories said merksamer 
the campaign believes they are more likely to be swayed by 
speeches like the one bush made here tuesday in which he proposed a 
program to promote volunteer service by young people he said 
the proposal was aimed at showing bush to be a strong leader 
with futureoriented ideas lacy said 
a tv ad attacking democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis for the pollution in boston harbor under his governorship 
has played well in california but the bush campaign does not see 
environmental concerns as decisive in the election said merksamer 
he said it is primarily a coastal population that sees the 
environment as a top issue while voters inland are more concerned 
about crime taxes and defense both from a foreign policy 
perspective and an economic one since much of californias economy 
is driven by defense contracting 
besides the boston harbor commercial the campaign has been 
running a crime quiz commercial attacking dukakis and positive 
ads featuring excerpts from bushs lively speech at the republican 
national convention in august and another feelgood ad 
narrated by bushs wife barbara

honduras is calling for the creation of a 
united nations peace force to evacuate thousands of nicaraguan 
rebels based in honduras and relocate them far from its borders 
the honduran proposal unveiled tuesday night by foreign 
minister carlos lopez contreras also would apply to the 
comparatively small number of leftist rebels from el salvador who 
operate out of honduras 
state department spokesman charles redman said tuesday night he 
had not seen lopez contreras speech and had no comment 
nonetheless the speech appeared to signal honduras 
determination to end the tacit cooperation it has been providing to 
the united states by allowing the anticommunist rebels to use 
honduras as a staging area for attacks against nicaragua 
underscoring lopez contreras apparent effort to disassociate 
honduras from us policy was his description of the united states 
along with the soviet union as a hegemonistic power 
lopez contreras called on un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar to oversee the creation of a peace force comprised of 
troops from canada spain and west germany 
the force would guarantee the nonuse of honduran territory 
by foreign insurgents he said adding that the proposed unit 
should be authorized to use force if necessary to achieve its 
objectives 
the unit should locate the combatants in nicaraguan and 
salvadoran territories far away from honduran borders he 
said their relocation in third countries should be carried out 
from sites in costa rica and guatemala whose governments have 
declared themselves neutral he added 
the proposal represents a revised and updated version of a plan 
which the hondurans set forth in november 1987 at the time 
however there were relatively few contras in the border era 
honduras as a frontline state which shares a long border with 
nicaragua has been a major pillar of american policy toward 
central america for more than six years as a deterrent to 
potential nicaraguan aggression the united states maintains about 
1200 troops in the country and has carried out numerous us 
military training missions there honduras also has been a major 
recipient of us economic aid 
but honduras always has been uneasy about the presence of the 
usbacked contras along the border fearing that the situation 
could be used by the militarily powerful sandinista government as 
an excuse to invade honduras there have been numerous crossborder 
incidents involving the two countries 
the situation in the region has changed radically since 
february when the congress rejected an administration proposal for 
additional military aid to the contras thousands of contras have 
fled across the border to the honduran base camps where us 
foreign aid officials have been carrying out a large scale 
humanitarian assistance program 
under an agreement the contras signed with the sandinistas in 
march the aid was to have been distributed to contras in several 
designated zones inside nicaragua but that plan was never 
implemented leaving many contras no choice but to go to the border 
area for sustenance 
honduras has watched these developments unfold with a deep sense 
of unease worried about the possibility that the contras may 
settle in the border area for an indefinite period 
the rebels and the sadinista government signed a temporary 
ceasefire agreement on march 23 but have been unable to agree on a 
lasting peace accord

republican dan quayle with two mock debates

nationally broadcast confrontation between the vice presidential 
candidates 
with george bushs media guru roger ailes and a host of top 
campaign strategists at his side quayle arrived in omaha tuesday 
night he declined to tip his hand about debate strategy saying 
only tune in and find out 
but its no secret that quayle will be on the attack against 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis not the texas 
senator whom the republicans portray as closer to them on the 
issues than to the democrats 
dukakis is running for president and hes the one im very 
concerned about becoming president it would be a very troubling 
notion for many americans quayle told reporters on his campaign 
plane en route to omaha 
quayle plans a brief walkthrough today of the omaha civic 
auditorium scene of the debate 
he sounded upbeat and appeared confident tuesday as he chatted 
with reporters in the first such ontherecord session hes had on 
his plane 
im going to just be myself quayle said i will be 
prepared to answer any and all questions 
quayle said he sees the debate as an opportunity to 
communicate with the american public in an unedited version 
theyll be able to see dan quayle as i really am he said 
the american people dont know me they have a lot of questions 
they dont have any details of who dan quayle is 
asked in what areas he was anticipating attacks from bentsen 
quayle replied everywhere 
aides to george bush were effusive tuesday in their public 
expressions of confidence in the indiana senator and denied that 
they had tried to boost his odds going into the confrontation by 
lowering expectations for his performance 
we are very very proud of you we are very very proud of the 
job you are doing for this campaign and we are very very proud of 
the job we know youre going to do in omaha bush campaign 
chairman james baker said at a rally at campaign headquarters in 
washington dc 
quayles tenure as bushs running mate has been marked by 
intense media scrutiny and controveries over his academic record 
military service and personal life he has also committed a number 
of gaffes and malapropisms during the campaign 
gop strategists have said that because quayle has been portrayed 
as a caricature and lightweight candidate he should benefit from 
the low expectations for his performance in essence they suggest 
anything short of a major blunder will allow him to come away 
looking good 
but lee atwater bushs campaign manager said we havent 
done anything at all about lowering expectations 
i think hell do fine on all the issues atwater said 
quayle has had two 90minute mock debates saturday and monday 
night with sen bob packwood rore who played bentsen during 
the debate preparation his aides have been conducting briefings 
along with questionandanswer sessions since last week 
david prosperi quayles spokesman said much of the area they 
had focused on involved attacks that were anticipated from bentsen 
polls have indicated that voters have doubts about quayles 
qualifications but prosperi resisted suggestions that tonights 
debate could have a critical effect on the election 
this is only part of the campaign theres a continuous debate 
every day and there will be until nov 8 he said the debate 
will be an important part of it but its not the endall

michael dukakis returned home to catch up on 
gubernatorial duties after courting crucial voters in the 
industrial midwest with a promise of a white house that cares about 
the plight of struggling families 
i care about working people and working families and thats 
the difference between mike dukakis and george bush and democrats 
and republicans the democratic presidential nominee told a rally 
tuesday afternoon in toledo ohio we care 
dukakis was in toledo to tour its jeep assembly plant where he 
received a warm welcome from its union workers earlier he 
addressed students and faculty at northwestern university in 
illinois and he ended his campaign day by attending two private 
receptions in washington dc with democratic party luminaries 
dukakis was spending most of today at the massachusetts 
statehouse and was scheduled to meet with reporters this afternoon 
he also was attending a rally with supporters after tonights vice 
presidential debate between democrat lloyd bentsen and republican 
dan quayle 
because of the focus on the space shuttle mission and the vice 
presidential debate dukakis offered no new proposals this week but 
sought to bring together his initiatives under the umbrella issue 
of restoring us dominance in the world marketplace he also 
underscored the theme of his campaigns largest advertising effort 
a fourad series portraying bush as a product of media handlers 
who has presented no viable solutions to the nations problems 
he offers slogans and symbols we offer solutions dukakis 
said this nation didnt become the greatest on earth because we 
were satisfied with the status quo 
dukakis also repeatedly likened this years race to the 
kennedynixon contest of 1960 at one point comparing bushs 
tactics to those of richard m nixon in the race 28 years ago 
they said the same thing about jack kennedy in 1960 all that 
gloom and doom dukakis said and what was he saying we can 
do better 
dukakis aides while conceding they still trail bush have said 
privately in the past two days that some of bushs support appears 
to be waning and that dukakis hopes to attract the growing number 
of undecided voters in the campaigns final five weeks 
the stakes are very high and the race is geting even closer 
dukakis told his ohio audience 
in the illinois speech dukakis delivered a sharply worded 
attack on bush and said his rival was running from a record of 
failure and walking away from every major challenge he has faced 
he told the college audience that he and bentsen would restore 
americas leadership in the world economy through innovative 
business and labor partnerships at home and a tough trade stance 
abroad 
dukakis said bush was trying to pin the gloom and doom label 
on democrats because he had no answers to the trade and budget 
deficits and the decline of research and development in the united 
states 
cite these facts and george bush will tell you that youre 
downgrading america the same thing richard nixon did in 1960 when 
john kennedy was telling us to look to a new frontier dukakis 
said my friends if we disregard these facts we endanger 
america 
he also boasted im running for president on my record mr 
bush is running away from his a record of failure and walking 
away from every major challenge he has faced 
there were no new proposals in the speech dukakis repeated his 
familiar call for businesslabor partnerships tough enforcement of 
the new trade law reduction of the trade and budget deficits and 
some reasonable limits on the merger and acquisition binge that 
continues to sweep this country

ptl announced tuesday it had negotiated a 
sale of its assets for 115 million to a canadian businessman a 
month after ptl founder jim bakker failed in his efforts to return 
to the helm of his television ministry 
stephen r mernick 34 of toronto will pay 50 million at 
closing under terms of the deal and pay the balance over five 
years according to a statement handed out prior to a news 
conference by a mernick spokesman 
mernick has interests in real estate clothing garbage 
collection and landfills the statement said 
ptl has been under the supervision of us bankruptcy court 
judge rufus reynolds who told ptl trustee ml red benton that 
a buyer must be found by oct 14 or he would order the assets sold 
to pay creditors the ministry is estimated to owe more than 130 
million 
mernick was not at tuesdays news conference an orthodox jew 
he was in toronto and didnt travel to charlotte because tuesday 
was the jewish holiday of simhat torah 
his primary interest as a businessman is to get the maximum 
return on his investment charlotte attorney joseph kluttz said 
at a news conference 
ptls property mostly in fort mill sc includes a television 
studio a hotel and shopping center a campground amusement park 
and a church private housing also has been developed on the 
property 
bakker who resigned as head of ptl last year after admitting to 
adultery made a 172 million offer last month for the ministry but 
couldnt raise the money 
tammy and i remain committed to the restoration of the 
ministry of ptl bakker said in a statement through his attorney 
if the present offer is agreeable to the creditors the partners 
and the court and gods will is satisfied with the respect to the 
ministry of ptl we will be happy with that outcome 
kluttz said the contract was signed with benton on monday after 
about three weeks of negotiations 
benton also did not attend the news conference but kluttz 
distributed a statement from benton saying he would recommend 
approval of the bid to reynolds later this week 
ptls religious functions have been separated from its other 
operations and heritage usa church is leasing back its facilities 
from ptl to continue onsite worship and christian tv show 
production 
in a sept 15 letter to benton mernick wrote while i am not 
a christian i have a great deal of respect for the depth of the 
religious feeling of the many thousands of christians that have 
supported the heritage ministry over the years 
mernick cautioned that he could not commit himself on the 
ultimate disposition of the property but left the door open to 
keeping at least some of the property as a religious park 
ptl filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the 
bankruptcy code in june 1987 three months earlier bakker quit the 
ministry after admitting he had a sexual encounter with church 
secretary jessica hahn charges of mismanagement and grossly 
inflated salaries for the bakkers and top aides resulted in an irs 
investigation of ptl and a lawsuit by the ministry to recover 52 
million from the bakkers and their chief assistant 
ptls trustee also considered a bid for 113 million from 
canadian real estate executive peter thomas benton said last week 
that another group of investors from new york and washington also 
were interested in the property 
a hearing on oct 17 at which the judge is expected to hear 
arguments from creditors seeking liquidation of the assets has 
been set in columbia 
at heritage usa the ptl complex in fort mill staff members 
said they knew little about the new owner or his plans but were 
relieved a deal had been struck 
most of the staff here right now his name is just being 
filtered down until more information is disseminated through the 
news media i think the initial reaction from the staff is going to 
be who said jerry knode retail director for heritage usa 
but i think theres going to be a real sigh of relief that 
everything has come to a conclusion all of us have been through 
the wringer and were glad the ringer has stopped

michael s dukakis is fighting in court for the 
rights of governors to veto federally issued training assignments 
for the national guard a position that a us attorney said was a 
dagger aimed at the heart of national defense 
in a hearing tuesday in federal appeals court massachusetts 
attorney general douglas wilkins argued that governors have a right 
under the militia clause of the constitution to veto national 
guard training assignments 
john bolton head of the us justice departments civil 
division said this is a political case and warned that 
dukakis governor of massachusetts might regret a victory if 
elected president 
the view from washington is very different from the view from 
boston bolton said if each of the 50 governors were allowed to 
opt out of controversial training assignments he said you end 
up with potential chaos 
bolton said the states position amounted to a dagger aimed at 
the heart of national defense 
the issue began when federal authorities ordered 13 public 
relations specialists from the massachusetts national guard to 
train in honduras and panama in may and june dukakis withheld his 
consent and filed suit on jan 29 seeking to block the mission 
however the court upheld the authority of federal officials on 
may 6 on the grounds that national guard troops are sworn to 
federal duty as well as state duty the mission was carried out 
the threejudge panel of the 1st us circuit court of appeals 
said it would review the arguments lawyers said it could take 
months to issue a ruling 
afterward dukakis statehouse press secretary james dorsey 
said dukakis was trying to uphold a principle endorsed by many 
governors of both parties 
there is a very important principle at stake here a 200year 
tradition of the states being responsible for the training of the 
militia dorsey said 
asked if the dukakis campaign was concerned that the governors 
position could be used against him in the presidential campaign to 
portray dukakis as soft on defense dorsey shot back whos 
going to make that argument dan quayle 
he was referring to republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle who came under criticism for seeking a position in the 
indiana national guard during the vietnam war a status that spared 
him from combat duty 
bolton warned that if massachusetts prevailed it would permit 
governors to interfere in sensitive foreign policy decisions 
specifically he said the constitution gave congress the power 
to enact the 1986 montgomery amendment which prohibited governors 
from objecting to national guard assignments in peacetime unless 
their states were facing an emergency such as a flood 
the massachusetts case is paralleled by a similar challenge 
filed by minnesota gov rudy perpich which was also rejected at 
the district court level the minnesota case also is on appeal

the house for the first time is offering its 
employees limited civil rights protection by establishing a 
procedure for workers to contest sexual harassment or 
discrimination 
supporters called the resolution which was approved tuesday on 
a 40812 vote a first step toward ending the legislative hypocrisy 
for which critics fault congress passing laws to protect all 
workers in the nation except its own 
discrimination is just as wrong in congress as it is anywhere 
else said rep leon panetta dcalif 
rep steve bartlett rtexas predicted congress would go 
further in future years to extend to its workers the protections 
offered in fair labor standards laws and by the occupational safety 
and health act 
the legislation covers only the 12000 or so employees of the 
house so it takes effect without further action by the senate or 
the president and because it is a resolution not a change in the 
law it will have to be reenacted next year to continue in force 
lawmakers voting against the measure were reps bill dickinson 
rala robert stump rariz john paul hammerschmidt rark 
robert badham rcalif charles pashayan rcalif larry hopkins 
rky john dingell dmich ron marlenee rmont joseph gaydos 
dpa paul kanjorski dpa tom delay rtexas and alan 
mollohan dwva 
not voting were reps jerry lewis rcalif buddy mackay 
dfla connie mack rfla fred grandy riowa brian donnelly 
dmass jack kemp rny marcy kaptur dohio jake pickle 
dtexas beau boulter rtexas mack sweeney rtexas and mike 
lowry dwash 
the change based on the civil rights act of 1964 sets up a 
house office of fair employment practices to handle discrimination 
complaints court interpretations of the law extend its protection 
also to sexual harassment cases 
the office will investigate discrimination charges and is 
empowered to mediate cases determine whether the charges are true 
and specify remedies including job reinstatement or promotion 
back pay and monetary compensation reprisals against employees who 
complain to the office are prohibited 
among cases this year that gave impetus to the move 
rep ernest konnyu rcalif got into political hot water 
after reports that he made offensive comments to female staffers 
regarding their physiques in one case he suggested that a woman 
in his office wear high heels instead of flat shoes and instructed 
her to turn around so he could see how she looked konnyu was 
defeated in this years gop primary 
tom pappas the top aide to rep roy dyson dmd committed 
suicide by leaping from a 24thfloor hotel room in new york after 
the washington post reported unorthodox social demands he made of 
male aides in dysons office 
rep jim bates dcalif came in for criticism following 
reports that he made sexually explicit comments to female aides and 
in some cases embraced them so he would feel better 
panetta noted that the house has resisted being placed under 
regular workplace laws because it would put the executive branch in 
the position of enforcing laws on congress which lawmakers see as 
an infringement on the constitutional separation of powers 
panetta said the new rules will let the house police itself the 
new house procedure would permit lawmakers to continue to 
discriminate among employees on the bases of geographical and 
political preference so they can choose workers from their home 
districts and of their own parties

the iraqi foreign minister complained of 
iranian searches of shipping on the persian gulf and insisted that 
iraqs outlet to the persian gulf be cleared for navigation before 
the latest peace talks progress 
foreign minister tariq aziz met with un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar on tuesday and then spoke to the un 
general assembly 
afterward he told reporters we had a very constructive 
exchange of views about the course of the negotiations and he 
perez de cuellar is going to see my iranian counterpart 
iraq and iran renewed peace talks saturday at un headquarters 
in new york after a session in geneva from aug 25 to sept 13 the 
talks followed a ceasefire aug 20 in the 8yearold war which 
left at least 1 million killed or wounded 
the statements made by both delegations during the weekend and 
by aziz on tuesday gave no indication of substantial progress on 
major issues 
when asked tuesday if perez de cuellar had introduced new 
proposals to break the deadlock aziz answered 
we are discussing all possible ideas you see on how to make 
further progress and the discussions went well with his 
excellency the secretarygeneral 
perez de cuellar has reportedly suggested that iraq agree to 
postpone discussion of the shattalarab waterway its outlet to 
the persian gulf until later in the talks and that iran stop 
searching neutral ships in the gulf 
the two belligerents would then proceed to deal with exchange of 
prisoners of war and withdrawal of troops 
aziz told delegates to the 43rd general assembly that iran 
accepted the security councils peace proposal resolution only 
because of a crushing military defeat 
this suspicious position on the part of the iranian delegation 
was followed by its insistence on provisions which impose a de 
facto arms embargo on iraq at sea said aziz he was referring to 
irans searches of neutral ships in the gulf 
iraq insists the shattalarab waterway forming the southern 
border between the two nations must be cleared of sunken ships and 
silt accumulated during the war 
shattalarab is iraqs only outlet to the high seas aziz 
said tuesday he said navigation there must be addressed for the 
peace to be durable comprehensive and just 
but aziz denied he was setting a precondition for peace talks 
calling such an interpretation a pure lie and deception 
baghdad also says irans policy of searching neutral ships in 
the gulf for war cargo bound for iraq violates the ceasefire 
which calls for ending all military activity 
iran says it has the right as a nation at war to search ships 
for war material bound for its enemy it says the issue of 
navigation on the shattalarab should not be included in peace 
talks 
azizs speech was moved up at his request from its scheduled 
time friday to tuesday evening so he could leave for baghdad early 
aziz did not explain his premature departure 
on saturday aziz met with iranian foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati for direct talks but the session soon shifted to indirect 
talks the secretarygeneral and his special mediator swedish un 
ambassador jan k eliasson shuttled between the iranian and iraqi 
delegations in separate rooms

the people who engineered a sevenyear boycott 
against the nestle company to fight the promotion of infant formula 
in third world nations called on tuesday for a renewal of the 
protest on an even larger scale 
douglas a johnson chairman of action for corporate 
accountability called for a resumption of the boycott at a news 
conference arguing that nestle has failed to live up to the 
agreements it signed in 1984 that ended the original action 
this time said johnson the group is expanding the boycott to 
american home products which it said is the second largest 
distributor of infant formula in developing nations 
while urging an acrosstheboard boycott of the two companies 
products protest leaders are asking their followers to focus on 
two products from each company nestles taster choice instant 
coffee and carnation coffeemate nondiary creamer and american 
home products anacin and advil acrossthecounter pain relievers 
action for corporate accountability accused both companies of 
violating at least the spirit and by johnsons interpretation 
also the letter of the world health organization and unicef code 
of marketing of breastmilk substitutes 
the code which nestle agreed to as a condition of ending the 
earlier protest permits donations or sales of formula for 
distribution to infants needing breast milk substitutes and says 
the formula may not be used for sales promotion 
at issue is whether the formula distributors effectively cause 
the babies to become hooked on formula within days of birth by 
making their product available for free at hospitals and other 
facilities 
johnsons group based in minneapolis says it is immoral for 
manufacturers to encourage the formulas use in powdered form in 
third world countries where most mothers dont have the money 
education or sanitary facilities to mix it properly 
the group says that thousands of third world babies drink from 
bottles filled with drastically understrength formula that does not 
give them the nutrients they need or infects them with germs 
boycott leaders said the companies actions have undercut the 
premise that mothers milk is best especially for third world 
babies representatives of both firms denied the assertion 
illness often occurs when the mothers take their babies home 
dr rk anand a pediatrician from bombay india said at the news 
conference 
in the hands of the poor the feeding bottle often becomes a 
passport to death for the young child said anand 
the physician said that bottle feeding kills large numbers of 
babies in india and other developing countries 
even poor mothers can produce enough breastmilk for their 
babies for at least the first four months of life he said 
restraining on the aggressive marketing of infant formula is 
essential 
janice mantell executive director of action for corporate 
accountability estimated that about 6 billion in infant formula 
is sold worldwide each year half of it in developing countries 
she said nestle has 40 percent to 50 percent of that 3 billion 
market and american home products about 20 percent 
nestle which is based in switzerland and the new yorkbased 
american home products are huge conglomerates with extensive 
holdings and product lines 
nestles better known products besides candy include libbys 
canned vegetables and juices lean cuisine diet food and the 
stouffer hotel co which has more than two dozen hotels and 
resorts in the united states 
american home sells today condoms preparation h dristan and 
dozens of overthecounter drugs and food products ranging from 
chef boyardee pizzas to jiffy pop popcorn 
a washington spokesman for nestle thad jackson insisted that 
the company is in total compliance with national and 
international codes he also denied that the company is dumping 
infant formula in foreign hospitals and said it never gives the 
product directly to mothers 
we do not dump supplies in hospitals said jackson we 
only supply materials at their request and in appropriate 
amounts 
he said if the supplies requested by the hospitals for 
distribution seems excessive then we contact the hospital 
carol emerling a spokewoman for american home products said 
this whole activity is based on allegations that we violate the 
who code and we flat out deny it 
ms emerling said the company believes that breastfeeding is 
best for infants 
but every infant who is not receiving breast milk has the 
right to the best alternative available that alternative is a 
scientifically formulated infant formula that is as close to breast 
milk as man can make it and that is what our infant formula 
products are

state governments are vulnerable to new 
financial strains in 1989 despite their success this year in 
maintaining services without major tax increases according to a 
study by the national governors association 
in its biannual survey the governors said a drop next year in 
federal aid could trigger economic problems for states since their 
budget surpluses are narrowing 
these balances if they hold as projected are already at 
their lowest point in the 12 years we have been producing the 
survey said raymond g scheppach the ngas executive director 
the survey released tuesday showed revenue collections exceeded 
expenditures in all three fiscal years studied 
but the states are reporting steady growth in spending up 63 
percent in fiscal 1987 6 percent the following year and an 
estimated 68 percent in fiscal 1989 
in the 1988 legislative session 27 states passed tax laws but 
most involved minor changes to conform with the new federal tax 
structure the new tax laws were expected to yield less than an 
additional 1 billion with most of the money generated by motor 
vehicle fuel tax increases 
in general state economies seem to be growing while the 
northeast and far west continue to enjoy solid growth most states 
elsewhere that were hurt by poor farm performances and a downturn 
in energy prices seem to be making significant economic and 
budgetary improvements 
here is an overview of the regions 
new england the region enjoys the lowest unemployment rate and 
highest personal income growth in the country the positive 
economic signs are manifested in the highest percentage increase in 
state expenditures projected for fiscal 1989 
mideast unemployment rates are lower than the national average 
and increases in personal income are 1 percent higher than the 
national average general fund expenditures are slightly higher 
than the aggregate figure for all states 
great lakes the regions unemployment rate is higher than the 
national average in addition the expected fiscal 1989 
expenditures show the lowest growth rate in the country 
the plains these states have made a recovery from the economic 
and budgetary doldrums of a few years ago since the march 
governors association survey the unemployment rate dropped 
dramatically from 55 percent to 42 percent but the annual growth 
in personal income also declined in the same period the growth in 
expenditures is slightly above the national average with the 
exception of north dakota and minnesota 
southeast unemployment has declined and personal income has 
risen since the march survey but the fiscally troubled states of 
kentucky louisiana and west virginia make an analysis of the 
regions economy difficult 
southwest this region has the highest unemployment rate and 
the second lowest percentage increase in personal income in part 
because of the oil bust in texas the state that dominates the area 
rocky mountain states this area struggles to improve its 
economic and fiscal health personal income growth is the lowest in 
the nation while unemployment is slightly above the national 
average 
far west growth here continues strong with personal income 
increasing at an average of 67 percent annually led by nevada 
with a rise of 89 percent and oregon at 72 percent unemployment 
is very close to the national average

george bush wants to tone down his attacks on 
democratic presidential rival michael dukakis a top aide contends 
but bush continues to sprinkle speeches with a hefty dose of 
opponent bashing 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller told reporters on tuesday 
that the republican presidential candidate wanted to get away from 
the appearance of waging a negative rather than issueoriented 
campaign 
he was uncomfortable with a perception forming that his is a 
campaign that was not talking about issues as much because he has 
been talking about issues said fuller 
he cited bushs first campaign stop tuesday as evidence of the 
new approach 
in a speech to the businessoriented comstock club of 
sacramento calif bush made barely a passing reference to 
dukakis he proposed a 100 million program to encourage community 
volunteer service by young people a new foundation chaired by the 
president would work with existing volunteer programs and act as a 
clearinghouse to help get more youths involved in community service 
todays campaigning in denver included remarks on a companion 
topic what society can do for children and education 
but after tuesdays speech calling for a youth engaged in 
service to america program of voluntary charitable activity bush 
went back to some familiar dukakis oneliners 
the barbs he delivered in his stump speech to a rowdy rally on 
the steps of the riverside county courthouse lacked a bit of the 
sting that has characterized similar recent speeches 
but he unveiled a new oneliner commenting on dukakis proposal 
to reduce the deficit by beefing up internal revenue service 
collection of unpaid taxes 
politicians used to promise a chicken in every pot he said 
he promises a tax agent in every kitchen 
by the time he got to a lateafternoon rally in albuquerque 
bush was revved up for attack 
referring derisively to his opponent as the liberal governor 
of massachusetts bush said i love calling him that i love 
it 
dukakis bush said doesnt even dare use the big l word 
anymore 
he trotted out his environmental attack on dukakis ridiculing 
the democrat for making an environmental pitch in california when 
he was the governor who wanted to dump the crud from 
massachusetts in a waste site offshore from new jersey 
bush laced the negative comments into a speech in which he 
portrayed himself as an environmentalist in the mold of teddy 
roosevelt and a man concerned about education and crime and one 
who wants to build a more caring nation 
he noted dukakis had proclaimed himself tough on crime 
if you believe that hes got some bottled water from the 
boston harbor to sell you bush said in one of his favorite 
references to the severe pollution in the governors homestate 
harbor 
but fuller maintained this weeks agenda would be devoted to 
more positive issuebased speeches 
he would like his campaign to talk about issues and not be 
caught up in an attack on his opponent he said 
that does not mean that bush is going soft on dukakis said 
fuller forecasting future speeches that draw sharp contrasts 
between the two candidates 
bush today was visiting arapahoe high school where the 
intinerary included a tour of the science lab and remarks at an 
assembly where national merit scholarship finalists will be 
recognized 
bush then was holding a rally at the 16th street mall before 
heading off for a campaign stop in oklahoma city

president reagan signed intelligence 
authorizations in 1984 and 1985 giving cia agents broad 
antiterrorism powers that some administration officials saw as a 
license to kill according to a published report 
the authorizations deemed as lawful any covert actions 
including potentially violent ones taken in good faith by 
us intelligence agents against terrorists according to a report 
in wednesdays editions of the washington post 
the language of the findings seemingly was ambiguous the post 
said actions taken in good faith and as part of an approved 
operation would be deemed lawful in advance but also they must 
be lawful sources told the post 
the newspaper quoted a former white house official whom it did 
not identify as saying the reagan orders were a goanywhere 
doanything authority 
the language of the findings caused disputes among 
administration officials the post said because actions that could 
be authorized under the findings might conflict with earlier 
presidential executive orders banning any direct or indirect 
involvement of us intelligence agents in assassinations 
the post quoted a source as saying the language was specifically 
designed to circumvent the assassination ban and protect cia 
agents who might take part in foreign strike teams 
white house spokesman bob hall told the associated press he knew 
nothing about the findings late tuesday night 
the post reported that unidentified white house officials said 
vice president george bush would have been given a copy of or would 
have had access to the findings 
a bush spokesman and bush campaign chairman james baker iii who 
was white house chief of staff at the time reagan signed the 1984 
finding had no comment the post said 
reagan signed the first finding on nov 13 1984 shortly after 
his landslide reelection victory the report said because us 
officials had become frustrated with carbombings at us 
facilities and the taking of american hostages 
congressional intelligence committees were not informed of the 
crucial language in the findings the report said 
the authorization was rescinded on april 10 1985 a month after 
a car bomb exploded killing 80 people in beirut near the residence 
of a leader of one faction of iranian fundamentalists 
the second authorization which included similar language was 
signed by reagan on aug 11 1985 two months after the highjacking 
of twa flight 847 in which american navy diver robert steedham was 
killed the intelligence panels were briefed after the signing of 
the second finding the post said

president virgilio barco withdrew a 
peace proposal to leftist guerrillas because of a wave of rebel 
attacks and the army has been ordered to attack the insurgents a 
cabinet minister said 
it is incomprehensible that the answer by subversive groups to 
a generous peace proposal would be so violent and criminal the 
minister of government cesar gaviria trujillo said in a broadcast 
interview tuesday 
trujillo is in charge of internal security in colombia 
last month the president offered a ceasefire negotiations 
pardons to guerrillas who surrendered and a chance for rebel 
leaders to speak before congress 
all six of colombias leftist guerrilla groups rejected the 
plan calling it an ultimatum for surrender 
gaviria was particularly critical of the countrys largest 
guerrilla group the colombian revolutionary armed forces known by 
its spanish acronym as the farc 
sunday and monday farc attacks killed 12 soldiers six policemen 
and three civilians the defense ministry said monday 
the government authorizes full institutional support for the 
armed forces to confront the guerrillas because weakness or 
complacency doesnt result in peace gaviria said in an interview 
with the bogota radio station caracol 
minister of justice guillermo plazas said the guerrillas answer 
to the olive branch offered by president barco has been attacks 
on the army blowing up of pipelines and setting off bombs 
the farc has used a ceasefire during the last four years to 
cheat the government by building up its strength plazas said in 
a broadcast interview with the bogota radio station rcn 
the farc signed a truce with the government of president 
belisario betancur four years ago there has been sporadic fighting 
between the farc and government security forces during the truce 
another guerrilla group the national liberation army has blown 
up the countrys main oil pipeline 85 times in the last two years 
last saturday the guerrilla group blew up the pipeline which 
carries 225000 barrels of oil a day from the canon limon field in 
the northeast state of arauca 
last wednesday the national liberation army set off a bomb in 
bogota as the car of a texaco executive was passing by 
the executive john buttle a canadian was not injured 
and last july the national liberation army kidnapped the owner 
of general pipe co of houston jake gambini there has been no 
word on gambinis fate

pregnant women infected with the deadly aids 
virus would be treated with the drug azt in an attempt to protect 
their unborn children if an experiment being planned by researchers 
gets the goahead from review boards 
the reason we think prevention of infection of the fetus 
might be possible is that azt prevents the replication of the 
virus said dr daniel hoth director of the aids program at the 
national institute of allergy and infectious diseases 
its theoretically possible that the azt if it reaches the 
fetus might prevent it from establishing an infection he said 
referring to the drug formally known as azidothymidine 
hoth said in a telephone interview tuesday night that the 
studies are still at least several months away as a formal 
proposal has not yet been completed and the proposal would have to 
pass numerous hurdles in the form of review boards concerned with 
the safety of such tests 
patricia randall the institutes spokeswoman went even 
further saying the likelihood of an early start to such a study is 
still pretty tenuous 
theres a lot of steps between now and the beginning of a 
study with pregnant women she said 
as of sept 26 aids had been diagnosed in 74447 americans of 
whom 1185 were children under age 13 and 924 of those children 
were infected at birth according to the federal center for disease 
control of the 41925 deaths among aids patients 672 have been 
children the cdc reported 
most new infections of children with aids are related to an 
infected mother hoth said 
among the still unanswered questions are exactly how the child 
gets infected he said 
the virus might be transmitted in utero that is across the 
placenta hoth said the second possibility is it might be 
transmitted at the time of childbirth through some bloodborne 
transmission the third possibility is that the child becomes 
infected through close association with the mother after birth 
such as through breastfeeding although that remains totally 
speculative totally unproven 
however he said its the widespread opinion of most experts 
in the field that one of the most important ways to stop the 
infection in children is to prevent the infection by catching it as 
early as possible that leads you to the necessity of treating the 
infected mother 
the proposal will call for studies on only a few dozen women who 
would be in their third trimester of pregnancy to limit the 
possibility of birth defects he said 
these are mothers that may be infected with the virus but may 
not have symptoms of aids he said 
animal model studies using mice have shown that azt the only 
drug approved by the food and drug administration for aids patients 
prevents the transmission of viral infection from an infected 
mother to the offspring he said adding that he believed there 
were no birth defects in those studies however he noted that 
those tests did not involve the human immunodeficiency virus or 
hiv that causes aids but a closely related retrovirus 
the sideeffects of azt encountered by some people taking the 
drug include a decrease in production of red or white blood cells 
and such problems are a major concern for the researchers he said 
thats the whole question here hoth said will it be 
safe what is the riskbenefit ratio so were proceeding 
cautiously there will be consultation with many experts we have 
obstetricians on our team pediatricians well be talking with 
other experts including ethicists on this issue 
the institutional review boards that would have to approve the 
studies once the protocol is completed are charged with the 
protection of human subjects in clinical trials so they must 
review the protocol with an eye toward the riskbenefit for both 
the mother and the child hoth said before we send it for 
review we want to have consensus among all of the experts 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus 
most often is spread through close contact with blood blood 
products or semen from infected persons 
no one is known to have recovered from aids whose chief victims 
have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users

the house has approved and sent to the senate 
a bill strengthening protection for whistelblowers who expose 
federal waste and mismanagement 
the measure was approved tuesday on a 4180 vote 
sponsors said the bill was needed because the office of special 
counsel established to represent the interests of whistleblowers 
was not doing its job 
the bill is designed to reverse decisions of courts and the 
merit systems protection board a federal judicial agency that 
made it difficult for whistleblowers to win their cases 
the legislation would define clearly the office of special 
counsels role as one of protecting whistleblowers in some cases 
the counsel has proceeded against whistleblowers who came to the 
office for help 
the measure would make the office of special counsel an 
independent agency it currently is part of the merit systems 
protection board a quasijudicial body that hears employees 
appeals 
the bill also would 
alter the burden of proof in reprisal cases against 
whistleblowers the employee would have to show only that the 
agencys knowledge of the whistleblowing was a factor in his or her 
punishment rather than a significant or dominant factor as 
required under current law 
require an agency to demonstrate with clear and convincing 
evidence that whistleblowing was not a material factor in the 
personnel action currently the courts require a preponderance of 
evidence an easier standard for government agencies 
expand the definition of prohibited personnel practices to 
include reprisals against workers who cooperate with inspectors 
general or the special counsel those who testify in government 
proceedings and those who refuse to obey an order that violates 
the law 
allow individuals facing reprisals to appeal their cases 
directly to the merit board

it said rebels attacked monday in speedboats with 60mm mortars 
at a government border post 125 miles northwest of managua the 
post at el charro is on the gulf of fonseca which is shared by 
nicaragua honduras and el salvador on the pacific coast 
the ministry said the other clashes occurred saturday through 
monday in northern jinotega and southeastern zelaya sur provinces 
defense ministry sources said rebels wounded ortegas relatives 
when they ambushed a civilian vehicle tuesday morning in central 
chontales province 
they identified the two relatives as irma mongrio rivas and 
alfonso ortega mongrio rivas suffered a bullet wound in a leg the 
sources said the extent of alfonso ortegas injuries was not known

a simple urine test that detects bladder cancer 
at a treatable stage may be used to help diagnose prostate and some 
of the other cancers that afflict nearly a million americans 
annually researchers say 
the test detects a protein associated with the spread of tumors 
said dr raouf guirguis of the national cancer institute the 
protein also has been found in patients with kidney cancer 
prostate cancer and a nervous system cancer called neuroblastoma 
it seems to be in all the cancers we have screened guirguis 
said 
existing tests to diagnose bladder cancer involving removal of 
tissue pose risk are often painful and sometimes do not detect 
the cancer until it has spread and can no longer be cured the 
cancer institute said 
but guirguis elliott schiffman and colleagues whose study is 
published in todays journal of the national cancer institute said 
their test can identify bladder cancer at an early treatable stage 
they said they do not yet know whether the test will identify 
cancers other than bladder cancer at an early enough stage for them 
to be effectively treated 
cancer will strike 985000 americans this year according to the 
american cancer society about 49 percent of cancer patients 
survive five years after diagnosis 
more than 49000 americans get bladder cancer each year and 
about 10000 die annually the cancer institute said the fiveyear 
survival rate is 77 percent 
the researchers are now using the test on volunteers from the 
navy the army and in egypt where bladder cancer is a more serious 
problem guirguis said 
if these expanded trials show that the test is accurate it can 
be used as a screening test to diagnose cancer and as a 
followup to determine whether treatment has eradicated cancer 
the followup of these patients is extremely important 
guirguis said 
widespread use of the test awaits completion of the largescale 
trials in progress guirguis said 
the test is based on the detection of the protein autocrine 
motility factor 
the protein is produced in the transformed or malignant 
cells guirguis said we think its stimulating the movement of 
the cancer cells and aiding their invasion metastasis 
the researchers used a very sensitive test that allows detection 
of minute amounts of a chemical 
researchers hope to develop an even simpler version of the test 
that would consist of a paper strip that would turn color if the 
protein were present guirguis said such a test could be 
manufactured for only a few cents per test and could thus be used 
widely to screen people for cancer 
for some cancers the test might be used with urine and for 
other cancers it might be used to look for the protein in blood 
guirguis and his colleagues said in their report that in 
patients with spreading bladder cancer the protein occurs at higher 
levels than in patients with localized bladder cancer and it is 
absent in patients without cancer 
the researchers are trying to make sure the protein is not 
secreted in the absence of cancer they have determined that it is 
not present during pregnancy or in inflammatory conditions 
guirguis said 
thats different from other tests that people have used he 
said

brazil today is to enact a new 
constitution consolidating the countrys return to democratic 
government after 21 years of rightwing military rule 
this is a historic date for our country president jose 
sarney told brazilians tuesday night in a nationwide tv broadcast 
we have reached the end of a long path my mission of helping 
the country through its transition to democracy is fulfilled 
the 559 legislators doubling as a constituent assembly worked 
for 19 months on the 245article document that governs everything 
from interest rates to mining rights and land reform the charter 
is brazils eighth since independence from portugal in 1822 and 
replaces the authoritarian document handed down by military 
generals in 1969 
the new constitution will consolidate a representative and 
participatory democracy the president of the constituent 
assembly rep ulysses guimaraes said in a press conference for 
the first time the individual will have precedence over the state 
sarney who at times fought bitterly against leftleaning 
measures in the new document said in his broadcast he would be the 
constitutions greatest servant 
in earlier broadcasts sarney made veiled threats that if 
certain articles were passed the military might refuse to respect 
the new constitution 
the constitution removes many of the arbitrary powers used by 
the military government during its harsh rule the document 
abolishes the presidents power to simply decree laws ends 
censorship prohibits torture guarantees political rights and 
broadens workers right to strike and to unionize 
nationalistic legislators also managed to limit mineral mining 
to national companies and prohibit further oil drilling risk 
contracts between the staterun petrobras which has a monopoly on 
oil exploration and drilling in brazil and international companies 
at the same time the rightwing scored a victory managing to 
waterdown a land reform law that protects productive land from 
expropriation the law further stalls sarneys program to 
distribute land to 14 million peasant families in a country where 
2 percent of landowners hold 60 pecent of arable land 
judiciary analysts have said however there are many articles 
in the hefty document that will be difficult to define or to 
enforce in complimentary legislation 
guimaraes 72 said the charter would be respected by all 
including the armed forces 
the military period left deep marks there is an awareness 
that the regime is good and from the armed forces we have heard 
only words of support and confidence in the stability of 
democracy guimaraes said 
the enactment of the new constituion will be marked by daylong 
celebrations starting early today with an openair mass before the 
twindomed congress and a reception for delegates from more than 30 
latin american and portuguesespeaking nations 
sarney 58 became president in 1985 after presidentelect 
tancredo neves died before taking office

vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen is 
sounding confident about his showdown tonight with republican dan 
quayle although the democrats staff is downplaying expectations by 
expressing concern 
are you going to be standing behind me as we open the quayle 
season early tomorrow night bentsen asked a flagwaving crowd of 
more than 500 who greeted him at the omaha airport tuesday night 
the texas senator hammered the republicans on issues hes bound 
to raise given the chance in the first nationally broadcast 
debate between the two candidates 
tomorrow night were going to have 90 minutes to present mike 
dukakis vision of america an america on the move an america 
that believes in excellence in education for all of our children 
bentsen said 
it would be he said a democratic administration thats 
committed to protecting social security against the republican 
raids that have come year after year with dan quayle voting eight 
times to cut social security 
he said the democrats would pursue health insurance for the 
uninsured while the opposition has done nothing 
mike dukakis is committed to an america that is number one in 
the economy of the world and number one in national defense 
he said later citing the huge budget deficits of the reagan years 
one of bentsens goals will be to counter what he contends are 
distortions of dukakis positions on defense and crimefighting 
important issues in texas and other southern states where bentsen 
is working hardest for the ticket 
bentsen has led a nearly cloistered existence for four days 
taking part in issues briefings and conducting mock debates in 
washington dc and later in austin texas but he set off for 
omaha with a flurry speaking at a campaign rally at the texas 
state capitol and later at the omaha airport 
campaign staff said bentsen again would slip behind closed doors 
today except for a quick midday trip to examine the setup in the 
auditorium and later the debate itself 
bentsen talked casually with reporters on his campaign plane en 
route to omaha appearing relaxed and upbeat but his staff 
continued to try to blunt public expectations that the powerful 
bentsen would thrash the less experienced quayle 
despite days of practice aides said the 67yearold texas 
senator was not adept at the mediaage need to boil down his 
statements into one and twominute sound bites 
press secretary mike mccurry who was quayles standin for 
bentsen in mock debates in austin on tuesday said the democratic 
candidate was looking for the best way of making a point 
memorable or punchy and he was still having trouble with the 
time limits 
the red light goes off frequently he said 
its all a matter of getting ready to present it his 
positions in twominute answers and oneminute rebuttals said 
susan estrich michael dukakis campaign manager who was helping 
brief bentsen our counsel to him has been to be himself 
bentsen displayed no sign of being unsure of himself 
tomorrow is a big day for us and a big day for this 
campaign bentsen told the crowd of about 1500 people at the 
austin rally and i cant think of a greater way to start it than 
surrounded by friends here on the capitol steps of texas 
bentsen said the democrats offered proven and tested 
leadership 
george bush and dan quayle hear no questions and offer no 
answers they tell us to lower our sights to live on our past 
rest on our laurels while the democrats would offer new 
leadership he said

nbc plans to do some research to find out why 
its coverage of the summer olympics fell more than 3 rating points 
short of the guarantee to advertisers a discrepancy that could 
cost the network millions 
gerald jaffe nbc vice president for research projects said the 
network probably wouldnt make the results of the study public 
since it could bear on competition with the 1992 games 
but among the likeliest contributors the 14hour time 
difference between seoul and new york that put live coverage of 
such popular events as gymnastics in the morning and the late 
septemberearlyoctober timing 
the games ended sunday and nbcs coverage had an average ac 
nielsen co rating of 179 not counting opening and closing 
ceremonies considerably lower than the 212 rating nbc had 
promised advertisers the 1984 summer games from los angeles had 
averaged a 232 for abc 
each rating point represents 904000 households with television 
nbc will have to give advertisers as much as 70 million in 
commercial time to make up for what had been promised according 
to the wall street journal 
cbs has been awarded the tv contract for the next winter 
olympics which will be held in 1992 and expects to make a bid for 
that years summer games the network also is studying nbcs 
results 
but cbs vice president for marketing david poltrack thinks 
the 1988 olympics suffered mainly from competition with other 
sports and from time pressures on viewers especially students back 
in school 
i attribute a lot of the underdelivery of ratings to the fall 
scheduling its not necessarily typical of what we can expect in 
future olympics said poltrack the 1992 games in barcelona 
spain will be earlier in the summer 
nonetheless nbcs six nights of olympics coverage last week 
took six of the the top 10 spots in the nielsen ratings and gave 
nbc a decisive victory over abc and cbs nbc had an average 175 
rating to abcs 123 and cbs 112 it also provided an important 
promotional base for nbcs new fall shows 
the actual performance by the olympics in key groups of 
viewers was a really dominant performance whether it was as 
dominant as anticipated thats something else said jaffe 
the closing ceremonies sunday fell to a 123 rating nbc had 
expected closer to 200 cbs 60 minutes murder she wrote 
and the movie cocoon outrated the sunday coverage as did 
liberace on abc those four shows made up the rest of the top 
10 the closing ceremonies ranked 22 out of 55 shows 
during the games first week ratings tended to climb as the 
week wore on the second week they tended to decline mondays 
coverage was the highestrated show of the week with a 193 rating 
abcs world news tonight won in the news nielsens with a 
100 rating the cbs evening news was second with a 98 nbc 
nightly news preempted on the west coast by olympics coverage 
had a 96 
the weeks lowestrated primetime shows were live dick 
clark presents wiseguy mutts beauty amp the beast 
equalizer mr belvedere sunday deal of the century 
franks place first impressions and a paid political 
program by lyndon larouche 
cbs announced tuesday that due to low ratings it had canceled 
franks place the critically acclaimed comedy starring tim 
reid as the owner of a creole restaurant in new orleans 
also tuesday the union that represents nbcs technical workers 
said the network has offered to buy out the jobs of 140 new 
yorkbased engineers and technicians 
if all 140 people accept they will pay it although they are 
aiming to cut only 40 positions said paul mcelroy a spokesman 
for local 11 of the national association of broadcast employees and 
technicians 
nbc like abc and cbs has dramatically reduced its payroll 
since it was taken over in its case by the general electric co 
two years ago about 400 people in the news division lost their 
jobs and 110 others are scheduled to go before the end of the year

a 28yearold man who hijacked a 
brazilian jetliner with more than 100 people aboard has died 
following a fivehour police interrogation hospital officials said 
raimundo conceicao described by authorities as a 
psychopath died tuesday of kidney failure after five days of 
steady progress according to a medical report released by the 
santa genoveva hospital in goiania 850 miles northwest of rio 
on sep 29 conceicao underwent surgery to stop internal 
bleeding caused by police bullet wounds suffered as the hijacking 
drew to a close 
on sunday conceicao underwent five hours of intense questioning 
by police on the hijacking late monday afternoon conceicao was 
rushed to the hospitals intensive care unit with soaring blood 
pressure 
the causes of conceicaos sudden change in condition were 
unknown according to the medical report but a doctor who asked 
not to be identified said conceicaos soaring blood pressure could 
have been prompted by a buildup of intestinal gases during the 
interrogation 
doctors on monday refused to let police talk to conceicao 
saying his health had deteriorated the contents of conceicaos 
police deposition were not made public 
on sep 29 conceicao burst into the cockpit of a brazilian 
jetliner on a routine flight from western brazil to rio and 
demanded the plane be flown to the federal capital of brasilia 
he reportedly told negotiators he wanted to crash the plane into 
a government building to settle accounts with the government 
over its economic policies 
the plane was forced to land 125 miles southwest of the capital 
in goiania where conceicao shot and killed the copilot and 
wounded two others before being wounded by police as he prepared to 
change planes 
on monday government officials announced passengers at major 
brazilian airports will now have their baggage checked before 
boarding domestic flights previously only passengers boarding 
international flights were subject to police checks

dukakis record especially the democratic presidential nominees 
stand on defense and crime 
tomorrow night were going to have 90 minutes to present mike 
dukakis vision of america an america on the move an america 
that believes in excellence in education for all of our children 
the texas senator told a flagwaving crowd of more than 500 people 
at the omaha airport 
bentsens running mate the massachusetts governor was 
limiting his campaign appearances today tending to gubernatorial 
duties in boston and later attending a debatewatching party 
george bush was speaking to high school students in littleton 
colo before addressing rallies in denver and oklahoma city 
the vice presidential candidates were planning walkthroughs at 
the refurbished civic auditorium around midday before their own 
last minute preparations for the debate 
organizers said tuesday that the 10000seat hall was ready for 
the debate after workers put the finishing touches on network 
anchor booths patriotic bunting and even a redcarpeted spin 
valley where democrats and republicans will expound on their 
views of the debate for any reporter who wants to listen 
we think weve got this hall turned into what we want and 
that is a debate hall said ed fouhy producer of the event 
a national poll released tuesday found quayles presence on the 
republican ticket doing some damage to the gop cause and put the 
race for the white house at essentially a dead heat 
in the cbs newsnew york times poll the bushquayle ticket drew 
the support of 48 percent of the 1034 probable voters surveyed 
while dukakisbentsen got 46 percent 
when the respondents were asked about the presidential nominees 
without their running mates the support for dukakis declined to 43 
percent while bush remained at 48 percent the poll conducted 
saturday through monday had a margin of error of plus or minus 
three percentage points 
on tuesday the bentsen campaign was setting low expectations 
for its vice presidential candidate in the debate with aides to 
the candidate suggesting that he was not adept at boiling down his 
positions to oneminute sound bites the campaign is trying to 
dispel the belief that the more experienced bentsen would manhandle 
the junior senator from indiana 
bentsen however was buoyed by his chances 
are you going to be standing behind me as we open the quayle 
season early tomorrow night he asked the airport crowd 
quayle was providing few details on his debate strategy but 
promised to just be myself as he communicates with the 
american public in an unedited version 
theyll be able to see dan quayle as i really am he said 
the american people dont know me they have a lot of questions 
they dont have any details of who dan quayle is 
quayles running mate bush used a speech in sacramento calif 
to propose a 100 million program to encourage community volunteer 
service by young people 
i want our affluent to help our poor the vice president 
said of his youth engaged in service to america plan i want the 
young men and women of our treelined suburbs to get on a bus or 
the subway or the metro and go into the cities where the want 
is 
dukakis meanwhile told a rally in toledo ohio that his white 
house would care about the plight of struggling families 
i care about working people and working families and thats 
the difference between mike dukakis and george bush and democrats 
and republicans he said we care 
the democratic nominee also compared bushs attempts to portray 
the democrats as a party only interested in the nations negatives 
as the same tactic used by richard m nixon 28 years ago 
they said the same thing about jack kennedy in 1960 all that 
gloom and doom dukakis said and what was he saying we can 
do better 
in his campaign stops in the midwest dukakis underscored the 
theme of his latest ads titled the packaging of george bush 
which depict the gop nominee as a product of media experts and a 
candidate with no solution to the nations problems 
he offers slogans and symbols we offer solutions dukakis 
said 
aides say the ad series is expected to cost the campaign more 
than 1 million 
the bush campaign meanwhile released an attack ad aimed at 
dukakis handling of the massachusetts prison furlough system said 
bush spokeswoman sheila tate 
the ad shows inmates walking through a revolving door while an 
announcer says the states system gave weekend passes to 
firstdegree murderers and crime statistics appear on the screen 
the bush campaign has repeatedly criticized dukakis in the case 
of willie horton who raped a maryland woman and stabbed her fiance 
while on a weekend furlough

children with aids improve dramatically when given 
the drug azt regaining lost intelligence speech and the ability 
to walk according to a study 
however the drug does not cure the disease and children 
continue to die despite the treatment researchers said 
the results of the research were widely publicized when 
presented at an international aids meeting in stockholm in june a 
detailed report on the treatment was published in thursdays new 
england journal of medicine 
hiv the aids virus destroys the bodys immune system and 
damages the brain in children these neurological problems are 
particularly severe youngsters intelligence falls and they often 
lose their ability to walk and talk 
the drug azt also known as zidovudine or retrovir is already 
the mainstay of treatment for adults with aids in the latest 
study doctors gave the medicine to 21 aids victims who ranged from 
age 1 to 12 
of these 62 percent had clear evidence of brain damage caused 
by hiv and every one improved overall iq scores rose 15 points 
and in some cases the youngsters intelligence returned to the 
level before they got sick 
the study by dr philip a pizzo and colleagues from the 
national cancer institute concluded that azt produced consistent 
and dramatic improvement in symptoms 
the iq of an 11yearold boy had fallen from 99 to 71 after the 
start of aids symptoms within nine months of getting azt his iq 
was back to 99 
even those with no obvious brain damage showed increases in iq 
the doctors said this may be particularly important because it 
suggests that the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome may have subtle effects on youngsters mental functions 
brain scans also showed that shrunken tissue in the youngsters 
heads had returned substantially after treatment 
despite the improvements however five of the youngsters died 
during the yearlong study

freedom to worship but other clergmen have vowed to defy any 
infringement on their religious rights 
moses mudavadi secretarygeneral of the kenya african national 
union threatened to strip biship david gitari of his freedom to 
worship after the bishop criticized the way the ruling party

anglican bishop alexander muge of the rift valley eldoret 
province said mudavadis comments marked a sad moment for our 
independent kenya 
prison cells and enough graveyards must be prepared before the 
decree is effected because many will continue to worship whether 
mr mudavadi likes it or not muge said 
muge and kuria were quoted by the englishlanguage daily nation

party 
on thursday legislators lambasted gitari accusing him and 
three other outspoken clergymen of trying to destabilize the 
government 
it was the second time in three months parliamentarians have 
suspended legislative business to criticize clergy members a sign 
of increasing friction between the government of president daniel 
arap moi and anglican clergy who have spoken out against alleged 
government corruption and human rights abuses 
muge said he was briefly detained on july 17 and police kept 
parishioners from entering his church after one runin with the

in two days of picketing the hollywood 
teamsters strike has accomplished what scriptwriters failed to 
achieve over five months in their walkout the shutdown of a studio 
citing death threats bomb scares and sabotaged equipment 
cannell studios said tuesday it has halted production on its 
television shows hunter and sonny spoon 
it said the incidents were related to the strike by 3200 
drivers laborers and electricians and that production would resume 
work only when it is safe 
in a separate incident one picket was arrested for battery 
tuesday morning at universal studios said police lt ron young 
the picket was released on 250 bail 
a cannell spokeswoman said production of the nbctv programs was 
suspended because tires were slashed or deflated on nine vehicles 
a brake line was severed on a semitrailer holding tanks were 
punctured on a mobile dressing room a trailer hitch was sabotaged 
and at least three employees were physically assaulted 
employees also received death threats and the companys los 
angeles office received a bomb scare said the spokeswoman lisa 
lewinson the office building containing several hundred 
employees was evacuated for more than two hours monday the first 
day of the strike 
lewinson said the company was outraged by the acts of 
violence vandalism and threats to our employees and property 
the studio planned to resume production as soon as possible with 
or without an end to the strike 
a teamster official denied that the union members had done 
anything illegal 
all of the members were advised that they were to conduct 
themselves in a lawful manner said ed prelock director of legal 
and contract affairs 
were going to do everything thats lawfully permissible and 
nothing more he said sure theres liable to be emotions 
hopefully the reactions are simply that and nothing more we are 
not personally aware of any physical violence 
teamsters pickets were stationed tuesday at nearly every 
hollywood studio 
the teamsters drivers who transport actors equipment and props 
for television and movie producers picketed monday at the cannell 
offices and the outdoor productions of sonny spoon at an 
undisclosed location and of hunter at the santa monica pier 
at the hunter filming some pickets blew air horns and 
banged on a trash container during scenes filming was delayed by 
more than an hour and the production closed earlier than scheduled 
monday evening lewinson said 
hunter stars former pro football player fred dryer as a 
quickwitted detective sonny spoon an nbc adventure program 
features mario van peebles the cannell studios are named after 
producerscriptwriter stephen j cannell who also created the 
rockford files and the ateam 
there have been other reported bomb threats related to the 
strike said police sgt roger jackson at least one other studio 
complained that some replacement drivers had been harassed by 
pickets 
these actions will not be tolerated the alliance of motion 
picture and television producers said in a statement the incidents 
are not only inappropriate but perhaps illegal we expect 
and demand that no further incidents take place and we call on the 
teamsters to take appropriate action to ensure that their strike be 
conducted in a legal and nonviolent atmosphere 
the strike against the 217member alliance began early monday 
after weekend negotiations collapsed on thursday the teamsters 
voted 1441196 to reject the contract proposal submitted by the 
alliance 
unresolved issues include overtime rules for weekend work 
salary rates wages for outoftown film and television production 
and guidelines for the making of nonunion films some drivers are 
being asked to take a pay cut from 1661 to 14 per hour 
although the fivemonth strike by the 9000member writers guild 
of america halted much of the industrys production it never 
caused any the alliance members to close their doors and halt 
production

women suffering from premenstrual syndrome 
should react cautiously to a new report suggesting that a common 
antibiotic may help ease symptoms in some says a national 
institute of mental health researcher 
dr david rubinow a psychiatrist and clinical director at the 
institute said many treatments have been proposed for premenstrual 
syndrome but none have been proven to work 
i think the whole area of premenstrual syndrome has been 
characterized by a new story and a new treatment every year for the 
last 50 years he said 
he made the comment following an announcement tuesday that the 
antibiotic doxycycline could ease symptoms in women who had an 
unrecognized underlying infection the report by dr atilla toth a 
gynecologist at the new york hospitalcornell medical center in new 
york was published in the journal of international medical 
research 
rubinow said he was not familiar with toths study but he had 
some general comments about premenstrual syndrome which is one of 
his research interests 
while i cant reject the results of this study out of hand 
without having an opportunity to review the work i would simply 
urge considerable caution in the interpretation of this data lest 
people run out and demand the latest of a long series of treatments 
that may not be effective at best and may be associated with 
complications at worst 
at a press conference toth said that 15 women who were given 
the antibiotic and asked to rate their symptoms showed a highly 
significant improvement in the symptom score at the end of the 
month fifteen others given a placebo showed little change in 
symptoms 
toth said an estimated 90 percent of women suffer from 
premenstrual syndrome during their reproductive years and about 
onefourth of those have symptoms severe enough to disrupt their 
professional or personal lives the symptoms can include weight 
gain breast tenderness extreme irritability fatigue and 
sometimes suicidal tendencies he said 
he said he does not know how many of the women may have 
infections and could therefore be helped by the antibiotic i 
dont think theres going to be one approach thats going to answer 
the universe of patients that have this difficulty he said 
doxycycline is a commonly used drug without severe side effects 
rubinow said the danger is that doctors who do not do a careful 
evaluation of a patient may prescribe it and miss another 
underlying psychiatric or medical condition that could be treated 
he said 
toth said seven of the women studied remained free of symptoms 
as long as three years after taking doxycycline 
his explanation is that lowgrade infections in these women are 
disrupting the lining of the uterus or the function of the ovaries 
producing hormonal irregularities that result in the symptoms of 
premenstrual syndrome

amnesty international today accused a record 135 
nations of abusing human rights in its annual report but it hailed 
the creation of more than 1000 human rights groups as well as new 
laws to protect prisoners 
the violations charged by the human rights group in its report 
include execution of a mentally retarded man in the united states 
and killing of unarmed afghan civilians by soviet and government 
troops 
amnesty said the list of offenders for 1987 was the longest it 
has published since the organization was founded in 1961amnesty 
which won the nobel peace prize in 1977 recorded abuses last year 
in more than 80 percent of the 159 un member states 
but it said it was encouraged by the emergence of more than 
1000 human rights groups in recent years and the proliferation of 
laws to protect prisoners rights 
it added more than ever before in world history governments 
are exposed to the glare of international publicity the greatest 
weapon we have 
it said at least 760 political prisoners were executed in 39 
countries in 1987 but estimated the number probably was much higher 
because of secret executions it also reported that governments 
used a variety of methods to deflect criticism including death 
squads in latin america 
the 278page report said in at least half the countries of 
the world people are locked away for speaking their minds often 
after trials that are no more than a sham in at least a third of 
the worlds nations men women and even children are tortured in 
scores of countries governments pursue their goals by kidnapping 
and murdering their own citizens 
the report cited the united states where 25 prisoners were put 
to death last year for executing john brogdon a man diagnosed as 
mentally retarded he was executed july 30 1987 in the louisiana 
electric chair for raping torturing and murdering an 11yearold 
girl 
the group also said substanstial doubts clouded the 
conviction of edward earl johnson who was executed in 
mississippis gas chamber on may 20 1987 for murdering a marshall 
in a small town 
amnesty opposes the death penalty 
the report said the soviet union released 259 people most of 
them prisoners of conscience but it added that nearly 200 were 
pardoned under secret decrees that falsely implied they were 
criminals and hid the fact that they had been unjustly imprisoned 
in the first place 
authorities held 300 other soviet prisoners of conscience in 
prisons in exile or in psychiatric hospitals it said 
soviet and afghan troops often in reprisal attacks against 
anticommunist rebels killed dozens of unarmed civilians in 
afghanistan the report said 
in china more than 200 convicted criminals were put to death 
for offenses ranging from murder and rape to drug smuggling theft 
and showing pornographic movies but that figure represents 
only a fraction of the total number of death sentences and 
executions the report said 
turkey czechoslovakia and east germany closed channels of 
information to hide violations it said and china haiti syria 
and south africa clamped down on the reporting of abuses by denying 
prisoners access to lawyers or families 
it said the death from torture of a south korea student park 
chongchol in january 1987 sparked widespread protests that 
resulted in the prosecutions of eight police officers and the 
resignation of government ministers 
today even one death can set off waves of anger and protest 
worldwide it doesnt always happen but it can amnesty said 
among other abuses were the reported massacre by sudanese forces 
of hundreds of unarmed dinka tribespeople the summary execution by 
iraq of hundreds of unarmed kurds the disappearance of hundreds of 
peruvian farmers seized by government forces and courtordered 
executions south africa and iran 
the report cited politically motivated killings by 
progovernment assassins in brazil el salvador and the 
philippines as well as arbitrary arrests torture and killings in 
sri lanka afghanistan and uganda 
in western europe spain was cited for torturing basque 
separatist prisoners britain for failing to publish a police 
inquiry into the killings of six unarmed irish republican army 
guerrillas in 1982 and france italy austria greece malta 
norway and switzerland for jailing draft objectors 
in israel the report said a court permitted the secret service 
to use a moderate measure of physical pressure in interrogating 
suspects 
iran executed at least 158 people although the true number was 
probably higher it said

a michelangelo drawing of the suicide of 
cleopatra discovered last august will go on display for the first 
time sunday at the national gallery of art 
the drawing had not been noticed before because it was on the 
reverse side of a better known work that had been pasted onto a 
backing it was revealed when conservators removed the betterknown 
drawing which also depicts the ancient egyptian ruler because it 
was not being preserved properly on the backing 
the wellknown drawing on the front illustrates the traditional 
story of her suicide in which she had an asp brought to her in a 
basket of figs and put it on her arm it shows the snake biting her 
breast cleopatras hair is carefully dressed and her expression is 
calm and melancholy 
the newlyfound drawing much less finished shows her hair in 
disorder her eyes staring out at the viewer and her mouth open as 
if in a scream it will be at the gallerys west building until

the house has killed a move to set ways for 
reviewing the continued detention of cubans who entered the united 
states during the 1980 mariel boatlift 
under legislation defeated tuesday by a 271144 vote mariel 
aliens denied parole would have been given the right to a hearing 
before an administrative law judge 
the hearing would have been required within 90 days after the 
end of a justice department review or within 90 days of the 
aliens detention by the immigration and naturalization service 
the legislation provided that to continue detention the 
department would have to prove that the detainee would pose a 
threat to the community or would violate reasonable conditions of 
release 
more than 125000 cubans came to the united states between april 
and october 1980 when cuba opened its port of mariel for citizens 
wishing to leave the group included many people with criminal 
records and mental illness

a federal judge has ruled that conrail cannot 
seek reimbursement from amtrak for damage claims arising from the 
deaths of 16 people last year when a conrail engine was hit by an 
amtrak passenger train 
us district judge oliver gasch ruled that an indemnification 
agreement between amtrak and conrail cannot be enforced because of 
evidence that gross and willful negligence by the conrail crew 
caused the jan 4 1987 accident 
the collision occurred north of baltimore after the conrail 
engineer and brakeman ignored a series of railroad signals before 
the freight engine entered the path of an oncoming highspeed 
amtrak passenger train 
if upheld the ruling signed late monday means that conrail 
would be solely responsible for defending more than 60 wrongful 
death and personal injury suits that seek millions of dollars in 
damages

the leader of britains transit 
workers union warns that the labor party by moving to the center 
to broaden its appeal could jeopardize its standing with its 
strongest supporters 
they want our money and our strength but they fear our 
power ron todd head of the 125 millionmember transport and 
general workers union said tuesday night during a meeting at the 
partys annual conference 
there is a real division in the party which needs to be 
bridged as a matter of urgency he said 
todds broadside marked the first serious public clash at the 
weeklong conference which party leader neil kinnock regards as a 
key step toward the adoption of a wholesale review of labor 
policies 
todd controls onefifth of the voting strength of the 
policymaking conference through a system under which the bosses of 
the trades union congress the national labor federation wield 
huge blocks of votes allocated according to membership 
the arrangement dates back to the turn of the century when the 
unions founded the party 
in the 1920s labor overtook the centrist liberals to become 
along with the currently governing conservatives one of britains 
two major parties 
the first postworld war ii labor government founded the welfare 
state and set up the free national health service 
earlier in the conference which ends friday todd and other top 
union chiefs used their block votes to ensure kinnock a huge 
victory in a leadership challenge by the leader of labors left 
tony benn 
the union leaders also endorsed broadly the first phase of a 
twostage policy review which acknowledges a permanent role for 
capitalism and drops previous commitments to wholesale 
renationalization of stateowned industries sold by conservative 
prime minister margaret thatcher 
the unions are themselves divided between moderates and leftists 
such as todd 
but their nearunanimous stance in blackpool reflected a tacit 
acceptance of kinnocks argument that the party must modify its 
image as the only hope of regaining power after three election 
defeats by mrs thatcher 
polls show that the clout of the unions which fund the party 
and provided more than 33 million for the general election 
campaign in 1987 is itself a vote loser for labor 
kinnocks aides said privately they were annoyed by todds 
outburst soon after the leadership election ballot and the vote on 
the policy review 
the speech partly overshadowed kinnocks keynote address tuesday 
in which he said labor must adopt new economic policies he 
rejected charges that he was selling out socialism 
there is no concession to thatcherism as great as letting it 
win again said kinnock 
todd also is opposed to dropping labors electorally unpopular 
commitment to scrap britains nuclear weapons unilaterally 
the second and thirdbiggest unions engineers and municipal 
workers are led by moderates who now suggest a reduction in union 
voting power in favor of legislators and local party branches at 
labor conferences

police today arrested an alleged aide 
of former lt col gregorio gringo honasan and a senior 
officer claimed investigators were closing in on the renegade 
leader of last years bloody coup attempt 
col manuel oxales deputy military commander of manila told 
reporters former master sgt godofredo gamboa was arrested early 
today during a raid on his home in suburban caloocan city 
meanwhile president corazon aquino acknowledged that her 
government had failed to resolve many of the countrys problems and 
restore social justice as promised after the marcos administration 
collapsed 
oxales said the raiders also seized a 45 caliber pistol and 
assorted ammunition gamboa a former counterintelligence agent 
denied he was involved in any attempts to topple mrs aquino 
but oxales claimed gamboa who faces illegal weapons charges 
was a close contact man of honasan renegade leader of the aug 
28 1987 coup attempt 
at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded in 
the failed coup 
we are closely following the leads we are receiving and we 
are closing in on gringo oxales said to get honasan we are 
getting those people who are close to him 
on monday police arrested three renegade soldiers sought in the 
failed coup and seized 5000 dollars in pesos which brig gen 
rodolfo biazon said was apparently earmarked to finance another 
coup attempt 
oxales said information given by one of the three capt 
francisco baula helped lead to todays arrest he did not 
elaborate 
todays arrest brought to 74 the number of alleged rightwing 
extremists taken into custody in recent weeks they include key 
officers who helped seize military and media facilities in manila 
and central luzon during honasans coup attempt 
honasan was arrested last december but escaped from a prison 
ship in manila bay the following april honasan played a key role 
in the february 1986 militarycivilian revolt which toppled 
president ferdinand marcos and propelled mrs aquino to office 
but honasan became disillusioned with mrs aquino because of her 
alleged failure to crush the communist rebellion and rid the 
government of corruption 
mrs aquino acknowledged certain failings during an emotional 
eulogy for joaquin chino roces a newspaper publisher who 
convinced her to run for office but two years later rebuked her 
administration publicly for its failures 
roces a leader in the struggle against marcos died friday of 
cancer at the age of 75 after receiving the legion of honor from 
mrs aquino last july roces publicly chided her for failing to 
establish a new moral order after the marcos government 
collapsed 
it hurt when he said it but it had to be said mrs aquino 
said her voice breaking with emotion and he was one with the 
moral authority to say it he has warned us that we the friends of 
democracy shall have a worse time of it than the clear enemies of 
the people if we fail the people 
the aquino government has faced growing criticism in the press 
over alleged corruption mismanagement and the promotion of 
officials chosen more for their loyalty to the administration than 
their qualifications 
in another development the philippine constabulary announced 
today it had seized a chinese research vessel off eastern luzon 
after inspectors found weapons and ammunition aboard 
the science research vessel no 1 was detained monday off 
casiguran after three machine guns eight assault rifles two 
semiautomatic rifles and 4850 rounds of machine gun ammunition 
were found aboard capt edgardo ingusan of the 119th philippine 
constabulary company said 
communist rebels operate in the remote area which has few 
harbors and inadequate roads 
in manila a chinese embassy spokesman said the vessel dropped 
anchor off casiguran to escape a tropical storm and the weapons 
were on board for selfdefense 
china maintains diplomatic relations with the philippines last 
april mrs aquino visited china and was assured by chinese leader 
deng xiaoping of his governments support for her

two 7yearold siamese twins were in satisfactory 
condition today after their separation in a 14hour operation a day 
earlier in vietnam a japanese red cross official said 
a team of 72 doctors and nurses separated twins viet and duc in 
the operation at tu du hospital in ho chi minh city formerly 
saigon it was believed the first separation of siamese twins who 
had been joined for more than seven years 
yoshiaki nemoto of the japan red cross quoted tadateru konoe 
one of three japanese observers in the operation as saying the 
twins were in satisfactory condition wednesday morning 
the medical team will keep a roundtheclock vigil on the two 
boys for four days until saturday nemoto quoted konoe as 
reporting by phone from ho chi minh city 
the japanese red cross provided some medical equipment and 
medicine needed in the operation nemoto said 
kyodo news service quoted a vietnamese doctor as saying in ho 
chi minh city that it will take about a week to tell the 
outcome of the operation 
viet and duc were joined at the pelvis and had a single pair of 
legs with their two torsos they shared a large bowel anus 
bladder genitals one pair of kidneys and a major artery leaving 
doctors with the difficult ethical question of how to divide their 
shared parts and give both a chance of survival 
japanese newspapers reported today that each twin received one 
leg while the single organs went to duc the more healthy twin 
viet has been comatose since may 1986 
vietnamese officials have attributed a reported rise in the 
number of births of siamese twins in the country to the american 
use of defoliants during the vietnam war including the central 
highlands area where viet and duc were born in february 1981 
the defoliants included agent orange which contains a compound 
dioxin known to produce birth defects in animals

editors at the california state 
university campus here are wrangling with the student government 
over censorship after the student politicians shut down the 
newspaper over a satiric edition 
the california state university long beach associated students 
senate withdrew funding for the union last week because of the 
newspapers satire supplement the grunion which took as its 
theme the sexually frustrated male 
the issue featured phallic illustrations and a photograph of 
three nearly nude cavorters 
union editor gary stark who is appealing the decision to the 
student judiciary charged the senate violated its own policies in 
its sept 28 decision 
our bylaws specifically state that staffing and editorial 
content shall not be subject to the review or approval of the as 
senate stark said 
student body president roger thompson said there is no first 
amendment violation because the paper can continue without student 
funding 
the 10000 we give the union comes from student fees i have 
to ask myself how appropriate is it to spend 10000 on this 
thompson said 
journalism professor ben cunningham said there is friction 
whenever campus papers are funded by student fees 
its an unholy alliance that invites this kind of thing to 
occur said cunningham adding that the editor exercised poor 
judgment and the student government overreacted 
if the politicians didnt want to pay for a student newspaper 
this wasnt the time to make the decision what they did was to 
make it very clearly a first amendment issue cunningham said 
the schools administration has remained neutral

californias largest supermarket chain began 
removing cigars pipe tobacco and chewing tobacco from shelves 
because the products are not labeled as cancercausing in 
compliance with a state law 
cigarettes are not involved in the action announced tuesday by 
vons cos inc because they already carry a federally mandated 
warning label several brands of chewing tobacco that carry such 
labels also are exempt 
its the first time we are aware of that a supermarket has 
taken product off the shelves in response to proposition 65 said 
deputy attorney general craig c thompson the state enforcement 
coordinator for the law created by the november 1986 ballot 
initiative 
the law requires the state to identify products and substances 
than can cause cancer birth defects and sterility businesses must 
warn the public of significant amounts of the substances 
vons has 336 stores in the central and southern parts of 
california it recently acquired 172 safeway supermarkets in 
southern california 
the removal of 17 tobacco products produced by five companies 
was designed to comply with proposition 65 said vons spokeswoman 
vickie sanders 
on friday state attorney general john k van de kamp filed a 
civil lawsuit against 25 tobacco manufacturers and eight food store 
chains including vons the suit claimed the companies failed to 
warn consumers of the cancer risk of certain products 
however ms sanders told the los angeles times that the 
decision to pull the products had nothing to do with the lawsuit 
we did not do it without warning or notice to manufacturers 
this is not a sudden move on vons part she said 
tobacco manufacturers and distributors were told in august that 
vons would require warning labels on products by sept 17 ms 
sanders said that deadline later was extended until monday she 
said 
the tobacco industry hoped it could comply with the law by 
posting signs in stores and other measures short of attaching 
warning labels to their products 
norman f sharp president of the cigar association of america 
and the pipe tobacco council said in a statement from washington 
dc the warning message is in fact reaching the mass of cigar 
and pipe tobacco purchasers throughout the state we do not think 
the producers efforts which have been timely and responsible can 
be legitimately faulted 
mary hernandez assistant manager at vons westside pavilion 
store said she finished pulling the cigars and other items from 
shelves late tuesday so far no customers had complained she said 
you will see bare shelves there will be a sign up there 
telling customers we apologize for the inconvenience but it is a 
necessary inconvenience ms sanders said 
john shepherd a spokesman for safeway stores inc said the 
chain which has 221 stores in california gave manufacturers until 
oct 17 to label products or have shipments refused meantime the 
stores have posted warning signs near cigar pipe and chewing 
tobacco displays

ptls trustee has accepted a 115 million 
bid from a canadian businessman for the christian ministrys 
assets but the buyer who is jewish hasnt said what he will do 
with the remnants of jim bakkers empire 
the decision tuesday came down to who offered the most money 
and the best terms said bankruptcy trustee mc red benton 
id hoped we could get a bit more for it but this is not a 
bad price said benton who spent nearly six months talking with 
bidders 
one of them was bakker who nearly a month ago failed to secure 
the financing for his 172 million offer 
bakker gave a conditional blessing to the winning bid by stephen 
r mernick of toronto 
tammy and i remain committed to the restoration of the 
ministry of ptl bakker said in a statement if the present 
offer is agreeable to the creditors the partners ptls major 
donors and the court and gods will is satisfied with respect to 
the ministry of ptl we will be happy with that outcome 
mernick 34 will pay 50 million at closing which the contract 
set at no later than dec 31 and the balance over five years said 
his attorney joseph kluttz 
if approved by a us bankruptcy court judge in columbia sc 
mernick will own the 500acre heritage usa a christian retreat and 
theme park south of charlotte in york county sc the ptl 
satellite tv network and 1700 undeveloped acres in york county 
ptls religious functions have been separated from its other 
operations and the heritage usa church is leasing back its 
facilities from ptl to continue onsite worship and christian 
broadcasting 
mernick an orthodox jew who was celebrating the holiday simchat 
torah did not travel to charlotte to attend tuesdays new 
conference announcing the winning bid 
kluttz said mernick has interests in real estate clothing 
garbage collection and landfills 
his primary interest as a businessman is to get a maximum 
return on his investment kluttz said 
in a sept 15 letter to benton mernick said he would welcome 
the opportunity to meet with representatives of any group or groups 
that are seriously interested in exploring ways of preserving or 
enhancing the christian orientation of parts or all of the existing 
developed assets 
aaron grubner mernicks attorney in toronto told the charlotte 
observer last month that mernick wanted ptl because its a large 
tract of land and im not sure those types of parcels are readily 
available 
mernick who entered the negotiations a month ago outbid fellow 
canadian peter thomas of vancouver thomas offered 113 million 
46 million of it in cash but not all would have been payable 
until september 1989 
by signing mernicks contract benton agreed to stop negotiating 
with any other bidders and to file a motion with bankruptcy judge 
rufus reynolds recommending mernicks offer by friday 
other bidders may still present offers directly to the court 
but benton said his recommendation gives mernick the upper hand 
reynolds has said a firm bid must be submitted by oct 14 or he 
would order ptls assets sold to pay creditors who are estimated 
to be owed more than 130 million he is expected to hold a hearing 
on the bid in about a month 
an assistant to reynolds susanne robicsek said the judge 
doesnt have any comment on the offer 
ptl has been in bankruptcy reorganization since june 1987 three 
months earlier bakker resigned after he admitted having a sexual 
encounter with jessica hahn in 1980 and disclosed that money was 
paid to silence the former church secretary 
some ptl employees were relieved by tuesdays announcement 
the pastor of heritage village church the rev sam johnson 
said the man is not buying the ministry he is buying the assets 
of heritage usa thats important to us because our objective is to 
continue to preach the good news of jesus christ 
im glad we finally have a buyer and know which way were 
going said linda gray a security administrative assistant i 
think the whole staff feels like partying

heavy readers take heart the longawaited second 
edition of the oxford english dictionary will weigh in at a 
whopping 137 pounds worth of words 
the venerable oed worlds biggest dictionary is getting bigger 
we are sure we will sell a lot because the dictionary is the 
standard work of reference on the english language and any 
substantial library will have to have it said ludo craddock 
promotions executive of the oxford university press 
the tumescent tome will span 22000 pages fill 20 voluminous 
volumes and sell for about 2500 
the publishing house founded in 1584 describes the dictionary 
as its most adventurous project since it began the first edition in 
the 19th century 
but the first edition had a mere 44 million words of text and 
the second has 59 million there are 290500 main entries on 
different words a 15 percent increase from the first edition 
in addition there are 157000 combinations and derivatives and 
169000 phrases making a total of 616500 word forms which are 
defined the 1928 edition had 414825 
the oed was first published in parts between 1884 and 1928 and a 
supplement of new words and words missed the first time was added 
in 1933 together they made up 13 volumes 
the last of four additional volumes was finished in 1986 by new 
zealander robert burchfield who spent 29 years on the project the 
publishers had expected it to take seven years 
since burchfields four volumes 5000 new words have been added 
most of them at the beginning of the alphabet as burchfield was 
continually adding as he progressed said craddock 
james murray a scottish village tailors son was the 
dictionarys original editor he had a flowing white beard and 
worked in a garden shed from slips of paper he died in 1915 when 
he was halfway through the letter s 
the new edition also has been computerized with the vocabulary 
of english since 1150 ad on a single data base to be available by 
home computer 
the first advertisements for the dictionary are now appearing in 
britain and the united states the publishers are reluctant to 
divulge any other details about the dictionary before it is 
officially launched on march 29 
but this book is big according to craddock the new oed is 
more than five times the size of any other dictionary of the 
english language

a father who lost his son in a hitandrun 
accident turned detective when he discovered that the man banned 
from driving for killing his 14yearold was driving again 
bernard proctor tracked gordon stratton with a camera and video 
equipment in a specially converted van to prove stratton was 
violating the driving ban a court heard this week 
his evidence helped send stratton back to prison 
i sat in my van and used a telescopic lens to get pictures of 
him coming out of a pub and driving away proctor said 
i lost count of the footage of video film i used but it was 
all worth it 
stratton 29 pleaded guilty to two charges of driving while 
disqualified and was sentenced in south londons croydon crown 
court on tuesday to nine months in jail he was also banned from 
driving for another year 
prosecutor peter finnigan said that tim proctor was killed in 
1982 and stratton was sent to prison in 1983 for nine months and 
banned from driving for 4 years for causing deaths by reckless 
driving he was again disqualified from driving for three years in 
1985 
finnigan said proctor heard stratton was still driving and 
tracked him for several months to gain the evidence he handed over 
to police 
the judge sir donald farquharson told stratton what is 
particularly distressing is that having caused the death of a young 
boy one would have thought that in those circumstances you would 
have been particularly careful not to get involved in driving 
offences again 
proctor said stratton should have got a longer jail term 
he is clearly a danger on the roads he said after the 
hearing

a new series of mistakes by air traffic 
controllers at ohare international airport has plagued one of the 
worlds busiest airports which already is the subject of a federal 
safety investigation officials say 
controllers at the airport made one error sunday and two friday 
bringing the number of recorded errors at ohare this year to 29 
officials said tuesday 
by comparison atlantas hartsfield international airport has 
had six errors this year and washingtons national airport two 
in one incident friday two air wisconsin jets came near each 
other when a controller apparently mistakenly gave one of them an 
order to descend from 14000 feet to 11000 feet a federal 
aviation administration spokesman said 
in the days other incident an american airlines jet and a 
delta air lines jet came within 400 feet vertically and a mile 
horizontally when the pilot of the american apparently failed to 
repeat an order to reduce speed and the controller did not seek 
confirmation the chicago tribune reported today 
on sunday two united airlines jets came within 500 feet of each 
other horizontally after the pilot of one plane apparently followed 
an order intended for the other the newspaper said 
the faa requires airplanes in the area to be separated a minimum 
of three miles horizontally or 1000 feet vertically 
the incidents occurred just two months after the national 
transportation safety board issued a report saying that chronic 
understaffing mandatory overtime outdated equipment and 
inadequate training had contributed to mistakes at ohare 
and now ntsb officials are worried that the trend has not been 
reversed said regional director carl dinwiddie 
the faa which has 90 days to respond to the ntsb report has 
not yet replied said an ntsb spokesman in washington 
both agencies are investigating the recent errors 
joe bellino regional representative of the national air traffic 
controllers association said ohares radar room on friday was a 
zoo 
with fridays 3842 takeoffs and landings 11 below the record 
set the day before there should have been 18 journeyman 
controllers and several developmental controllers on duty 
but bellino said there were only 14 controllers in both 
categories and the problem was made worse when the controllers who 
made the errors were temporarily relieved of their duties giving 
those who remained even more responsibilities 
we had airplanes all over the sky bellino said we were 
buried all day long 
the faa could not immediately say how many controllers were on 
duty friday but spokesman donald zochert said the total number of 
controllers working at the airport has risen from 87 last year to 
94 as of sept 1 there are now six new developmental controllers 
and one new journeyman

a story that refers to cruel conduct by a japanese 
soldier during world war ii was pulled from a high school textbook 
and replaced with an excerpt from my fair lady after 
politicians protested to the publisher 
sanseido co the publisher of the english textbook decided to 
replace the story after members of the governing liberal democratic 
party complained that it was inappropriate 
but the change has led to renewed charges that political and 
government influence is being used to gloss over textbook accounts 
of japanese atrocities during world war ii 
the fivepage lesson titled war in sanseidos first 
english series ii begins with a conversation among southeast 
asians 
which nation is the most cruel the germans no no the 
japanese the lesson says 
the lesson then tells a story about a japanese soldier in 
malaysia who grabbed a baby from its mother and threw the baby up 
into the air and ran his sword through it the baby died on the 
spot 
the lesson goes on to say war makes people cruel so we 
cannot say one nation is more cruel than another 
it also mentions the case of siamese twins from vietnam duc and 
viet whose deformity may have been caused by the defoliant agent 
orange used by the us military in vietnam 
these stories are sad but sometimes we have to face 
uncomfortable things to make our life better the lesson said 
fukuo ishinabe director of sanseidos school textbook 
department said the story was aimed at promoting understanding for 
international peace 
but he said the company agreed to replace the story with an 
excerpt from my fair lady the popular musical because any 
material that causes misunderstanding is not good 
liberal democratic party politicians claimed the story 
exaggerated japanese soldiers cruelty during world war ii and 
lacked historic and scientific background 
we thought no teacher should use such a textbook as this 
said iwao kudo of the education division of the partys policy 
research council 
the 120page textbook was approved by education ministry 
examiners in july all textbooks used in japanese schools must be 
approved by the ministry which often demands changes 
other asian nations have in recent years protested many of those 
changes including changing japans invasion of mainland asia 
to advance and the toneddown description of the nanking 
massacre in which japanese soldiers killed or raped up to 300000 
chinese 
history texts also fail to mention japans biological 
experiments on war prisoners in manchuria next year for the first 
time one of the 18 approved high school history texts will include 
japans chemical warfare activities during the war the ministrys 
textbook division said 
publishers cannot be forced to make changes once a textbook is 
approved except to correct errors but sanseido agreed to replace 
its war story said hiroyasu hasegawa of the ministrys textbook 
division 
shoju oba an official of the japan teachers union criticized 
the deletion 
authors should be able to publish textbooks with their own 
choice of materials free of government inspection in the first 
place he said in this respect the ldps claim and the 
decision of the ministry and the publisher could lead to something 
very dangerous 
mitsu kaneko a japan socialist party member of parliament 
called on the education ministry to restore the story to the text

on a rubblestrewn lot in a poor 
neighborhood officials dedicated a day care center for children 
with aids that will serve as the model for similar centers 
elsewhere 
we think this will be an exemplary project for other cities 
and counties said sydney j olson the assistant secretary of 
the us department of health and human services who attended the 
dedication tuesday 
the center is the first in the united states to operate with 
federal head start and state money similar centers will open soon 
in los angeles boston baltimore and alaska ms olson said 
poor children with a terrible disease are a very easy 
constituency to forget said gov thomas h kean this center 
with its head start background will help children turn trouble 
into opportunity 
ms olson said new jersey was chosen for the first center in 
part because of the states high number of aids cases 
we desperately need this program said state human services 
commissioner drew altman 
according to the federal centers for disease control new jersey 
has the secondhighest number of reported cases of children under 
age 13 with aids 163 new york has the most 364 
new jersey ranks fifth in the nation with 5130 reported cases 
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome behind new york 
california florida and texas according to the cdc there are a 
total of 74447 cases nationwide with 1185 of them among children 
under 13 
aids is transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids most 
commonly during intimate sexual contact or the sharing of 
hypodermic needles most children who have the disease contract it 
in the womb and are born to women who are intravenous drug users 
the head start center in a brick building in northcentral 
newark is the result of efforts by community groups businesses 
and local state and federal governments 
it will be operated by babyland nursery a neighborhoodbased 
organization that cares for more than 300 children at three centers 
and has programs for children who are abused or face family 
violence 
the center will open nov 5 with 10 children ranging from a few 
months to 3 years old and with about six staff members said mary 
smith executive director of babyland 
head start is a child development program that provides 
education health and social services for lowincome children 
mainly ages 3 to 5 
in addition to child care smith said the center will aim at 
educating the community about the need to give children with aids 
the same love as any child 
these kids will be kissed and hugged and treated in the same 
fashion as all our other babyland children she said 
she said caregivers will use no special protective wear since 
aids cannot be transmitted through casual contact 
when we first started this program we thought getting aids 
would be a real concern she said but actually we had 
caregivers from our other programs volunteering to do this 
program they have so much compassion for these children that they 
want to work in it 
the center eventually will serve up to 30 children who will be 
referred by state agencies working with aids victims the children 
will receive daily physical exams and regular treatment from

there is an upbeat mood in this northern 
italian fashion capital thanks to good weather good exchange 
rates at the bank and good clothes on the runway 
this optimistic feeling was apparent at monday evenings 
blacktie gala at milans famed la scala opera house in honor of 
the italian fashion industry 
highlight of the evening was a concert by italian soprano katia 
ricciarelli who sang arias from italys rich operatic repertoire 
sitting in the royal box was prince albert of belgium and his 
italian wife princess paola while the rest of the theater was 
packed with milans beautiful people from blueeyed silverhaired 
giorgio armani to one of film director federico fellinis favorite 
actresses sandra milo 
following the concert the glitzy crowd gathered in the foyer 
for a buffet supper a perfect opportunity to show off their 
evening finery 
the current look is short black velvet cocktail dresses with 
taffeta pouf skirts and sheer black embroidered stockings worn 
with spike heels 
however by next season these outfits will be relegated to the 
back of the closet to make room for the long languid skirts and 
pants that are the hits of the springsummer 1989 collections being 
presented this week 
the new look is in stark contrast to the short sexy numbers that 
were displayed at la scala pale creamy colors gossamer fabrics 
flat shoes and hemlines that graze the ankle make up the spring 
style 
theres nothing controversial about these clothes which should 
appeal to trendsetters and conservatives alike 
flamboyant gianni versace toned down his tough sexy style while 
krizia gave a new softness to her sleek mantailored suits and 
simplified her extravagant evening wear even the enfants 
terribles karl lagerfeld and franco moschino succumbed to the new 
calm mood 
the milan fashion vista is expanding thanks to laura biagiotti 
who was the first designer to bring italian clothes to china when 
she presented her collection in beijing in april 
celebrating her historic visit twenty chinese models returned 
the favor by appearing in her oriental inspired spring collection 
sitting in the front row was the chinese ambassador to italy du 
dong and a delegation of chinese trade officials 
there is talk that biagiotti a latter day marco polo may 
produce some of her famed cashmere creations in china

afghan guerrillas fired rockets into kabul today 
during morning rush hour killing 11 people and injuring 26 others 
in the capital city the tass news agency reported 
also today the communist party newspaper pravda reiterated 
soviet complaints that pakistan is to blame for violations of the 
un accord providing for the withdrawal of soviet troops from 
afghanistan 
all indications are that in islamabad they have a very flawed 
idea of international law statetostate relations and 
treatybased commitments the newspaper said 
the soviet union said last week it had halted the withdrawal of 
its troops from afghanistan citing violations of the accord 
pravda said the afghan government has registered more than 1500 
violations of the accord with un monitors 
tass said 23 rockets were fired from positions northwest of 
kabul during morning rush hour it said 11 people died and 26 
others were wounded 
under the accord signed april 14 the soviet union agreed to 
withdraw its 100000 soldiers from afghanistan in exchange for a 
pledge of noninterference by pakistan and other countries that 
have been aiding the guerrillas the guerrillas are not party to 
the agreement 
half of the soviet force in afghanistan was withdrawn between 
may 15 and aug 15 and the soviet union has until feb 15 to 
complete the pullout 
but the soviet union charges pakistan has not moved to shut down 
guerrilla camps on its territory and still serves as a conduit for 
ussupplied arms 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 replaced one 
prosoviet government with another and remained to fight the 
antimarxist insurgents more than 13000 soviet soldiers have been 
killed in that time and 35000 wounded

officials in several asian countries breathed a 
sigh of relief today after the us house failed to override a veto 
of limits on textile imports but they fretted over us 
protectionist sentiment that gave rise to the bill 
the textile bill is dead trumpeted hong kongs director of 
trade michael sze 
but he added the textile lobby is not going to give up it 
will be looking for ways to make protection for the textiles 
industry more palatable to us legislators this could seriously 
threaten hong kongs trading interests 
in the latest statistics available in hong kong the british 
colony exported 34 billion worth of clothing and accessories and 
116 million worth of textile fabrics to the united states in 1986 
the house voted 272152 in favor of overriding president 
reagans veto of the bill the tally fell 11 votes short of the 
twothirds majority needed to override the veto and impose the 
restrictions 
the bill would have frozen 1988 textile and apparel imports at 
last years level and limited growth to 1 percent annually 
beginning in 1989 it also would have capped imports of nonrubber 
footwear with no provision for future increases 
asian countries that sell billions of dollars worth of textiles 
and clothing to the united states had expressed alarm as the bill 
moved through congress criticizing it as protectionist and 
unwarranted 
our concern has been resolved as the effort by the house to 
override the presidential veto has failed mitsuaki hayashi a 
spokesman for japans ministry of international trade and industry 
said today 
japan exported 118 million worth of textiles to the united 
states in 1987 and the ministry had said earlier the us 
legislation violated international trade agreements and would hurt 
future accords 
the foreign ministry also said it welcomed the 
antiprotectionist efforts made by president reagan and his 
administration but a ministry statement also noted that nearly 
twothirds of the house had voted for a bill that contains very 
restrictive and discriminatory articles that are not compatible 
with free trade 
in thailand the foreign ministrys deputy spokesman 
prachyadavi tavedikul said both americans and thais would benefit 
from the upheld veto 
we favor free trade our people and americans will gain from 
lower textile prices tavedikul said

communist party chief stipe suvar 
has announced a plan to overhaul the party leadership perhaps 
replacing up to onethird of the 165member central committee 
suvar said on sarajevo television tuesday night that the ruling 
presidium would propose the changes to the central committee which 
is to hold a crucial session on oct 17 
very soon new people will be brought into the central 
committee of the league of communists and its presidium suvar 
said according to a dispatch from the official tanjug news agency 
he said at the forthcoming meeting the party presidium will 
strive to determine the criteria of possible responsibility of 
its members for yugoslavias economic and political crisis 
if it fails in this the central committee will assume this 
role and anyone who does not win twothirds of votes of the 
membership of the central committee will leave this body the 
party chief declared 
he added 43 members of the central committee and the presidium 
so far have been charged with lack of responsibility 
the replacement of onethird of the central committee is the 
maximum permitted by the party statute except at a party congress 
the party presidium has 23 members 
suvar announced that a similar overhaul was expected in the 
party leaderships of yugoslavias six republics and two autonomous 
provinces 
there have been increasing calls for toplevel personnel changes 
in the party leadership leaders have been blamed for failing to 
stop ethnic tensions between ethnic albanians and slavs in the 
restive kosovo province and the deteriotating economic and 
political situation 
yugoslavia is burdened with a 217 percent annual inflation a 15 
percent unemployment rate and a 21 billion foreign debt 
on tuesday about 5000 workers from the rakovica industrial

the embassy received no response to a note sent to the laotian 
foreign ministry asking about the status of the americans who were 
seized by authorities sunday

thousands of dollars down the mekong river offering the reward to 
any laotian cambodian or vietnamese who brought an american 
prisoner of war to the international red cross

boundarymarking river and advertise the award to local villagers

us rep kenneth buddy mackay said after 
winning the democratic senate runoff that he would try to heal 
wounds from the divisive race while looking ahead to a mainstream 
versus extreme contest with republican connie mack 
mackay said he would meet in tallahassee today with state 
insurance commissioner bill gunter the defeated democratic 
candidate who pledged to support mackay less than a week after 
accusing the thirdterm congressman of running the nastiest 
campaign in florida history 
unofficial returns from tuesdays runoff gave mackay 362234 or 
52 percent of the vote to gunters 330297 or 48 percent 
mack a former cape coral bank president and grandson of the 
baseball hall of fame manager is a wellfunded conservative whose 
candidacy is drawing national republican help mack and mackay will 
face each other on the november ballot for the seat held by 
democratic sen lawton chiles who is retiring after three terms 
we are the candidacy that can beat connie mack mackay said 
tuesday night i see this election as mainstream versus extreme 
mack agreed that voters faced an ideological decision 
i think the voters in florida are going to have a very clear 
choice between the liberal buddy mackay and the conservative connie 
mack he said 
the senate runoff climaxed twisting events that began last 
december when chiles 58 announced he wouldnt seek reelection 
saying he was burned out by the senate and didnt like the high 
cost of running for reelection 
popular former twoterm gov reubin askew then entered the race 
against mack but askew well ahead in all polls withdrew may 7 
saying he didnt like all the time spent raising funds 
gunter and mackay jumped in after askew pulled out and they ran 
onetwo in the sept 6 primary but neither received a majority 
making a runoff necessary 
mackay a lawyer from a wealthy landowning family was endorsed 
by askew 1986 democratic gubernatorial nominee steve pajcic 
thirdplace primary finisher rep dan mica and fourthplace 
finisher state sen patricia frank 
the runoff campaign was filled with negative advertising and 
sharp exchanges in debates and democratic officials worried that 
mack would face a crippled opponent in the general election 
mackay 55 attacked gunters integrity for his practice each 
election of using campaign contributions from the insurance 
industry he regulates including from two companies that later 
collapsed in corruption he also charged that gunter voted against 
desegregation 15 years ago 
gunter 54 charged that mackays congressional record betrayed 
israel social security and antidrug efforts and he claimed 
mackay was being supported by corrupt defense contractors 
mackay warned that the wellfunded mack could exploit gunters 
alleged ethics problems mack meanwhile went on the attack 
against mackay running television and newspaper ads charging 
hey buddy youre liberal 
gunter lost a 1974 democratic senate runoff and won a 1980 
senate runoff only to lose in the general election

slain aboard a hijacked twa jetliner said he hoped the hijackers 
would kill him instead of his married navy comrades a witness 
testified today 
diver robert stethem made the remark after two shiite moslem air 
pirates beat him so savagely he was in shock said rosemarie anne 
henderson a passenger aboard flight 847 
the young man stethem was crying he was unable to walk by 
himself said mrs henderson an australian who was traveling 
with her husband and daughter 
she said mohammed ali hamadi led stethem down the airplanes 
aisle told her husband to get out of his seat and put stethem next 
to her 
hamadi is on trial on charges of murder and air piracy in the 
june 1985 hijacking of the athenstorome flight in which stethem 
was killed and 39 americans were held captive for 17 days 
mrs henderson 52 said she later switched seats with her 
daughter and that her daughter talked to stethem at length 
he said to her that if anyone would have to be killed he 
hoped it would be him because the others the five fellow divers 
were all married mrs henderson said her voice breaking with 
emotion 
he was in shock he also had a bandage around his neck it had 
blood on it mrs henderson said 
he said he thought his knee was broken he told her he had 
been tied up and that when they finished beating him he was hit 
over the head with the pistol 
he was shaking mrs henderson said he said some of his 
ribs were broken 
motioning with her hands mrs henderson said stethem kept 
rubbing an injured hand 
he said he had no feeling in it mrs henderson said 
after the plane landed in beirut stethem 23 of waldorf md 
was shot and pushed out of the plane he died on the airport tarmac 
in testimony tuesday an american held during the hijacking 
testified that hamadi appeared proud of stethems slaying 
he looked like the fox that got the chicken he showed 
absolutely no remorse said stuart dahl a 34yearold us navy 
diver 
dahl also said he believed hamadi was the hijacker who shot 
stethem 
shaking his finger and pointing directly at hamadi he said i 
know he was the one that hit me on the back of the head although i 
did not see him i would say he was the one who did it shot 
stethem 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport in january 1987 after 
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage his trial 
began july 5 and is expected to last until december 
dahl stethems navy supervisor said that immediately not 
more than a minute after the shooting hamadi came to where he 
was sitting in the airplane and hit him on the back of the head 
with the butt of the gun 
he was very proud of his power he was very proud of what he 
had done said dahl 
witnesses have given conflicting testimony about who fired the 
shot that killed stethem 
dahls testimony echoed that of pilot john testrake who said he 
believed hamadi was the gunman other witnesses said they thought 
another hijacker shot him 
hamadi has admitted being one of the hijackers but has denied 
killing stethem 
a third diver 30yearold tony daniel watson testified tuesday 
that hamadi shoved a cocked pistol at his face and seemed ready to 
shoot before a flight attendant begged him to stop 
he had a chromeplated automatic pistol in his hand he 
pointed it directly in my face and pulled back the hammer 
i was very afraid i would be shot watson said

police have ruled out robbery in an 
attack on a wealthy financier and the daughter of the late john 
wayne but say the motive remains unclear 
these are notable people were dealing with we dont know 
whether the attack relates to their business or personal lives 
theres a lot of different possibilities here said police 
spokesman greg armstrong 
aissa wayne 32 and mortgage financier roger luby 52 were 
attacked by two men monday as the couple who have been dating for 
several months returned to lubys multimilliondollar mansion 
after jogging 
they grabbed her hair and beat her face against the 
concrete said ms waynes mother pilar widow of the late 
actor her wrists are getting black and blue and she breaks out 
crying every 10 minutes 
nothing was stolen and the attack lasted less than two minutes 
said detective sgt mike jackson 
obviously somebody hired these guys jackson said they 
went in did their thing and got out 
among the leads police are checking is a failed real estate 
deal involving a downtown los angeles building that forced luby 
and his estranged wife sandra into bankruptcy 
luby a former american express executive told police the 
attackers asked him if he was roger luby armstrong said then 
they pistolwhipped the two and cut lubys ankle knicking his 
achilles tendon 
the way the attack went down it looks like she wayne was in 
the wrong place at the wrong time jackson said it was meant 
as a message to him 
ms wayne said tuesday that one of the attackers said youre 
messing with the wrong guy next time well kill you 
luby and ms wayne whose hands and feet were bound behind them

president reagan signed intelligence 
authorizations in 1984 and 1985 giving cia agents broad 
antiterrorism powers that some administration officials saw as a 
license to kill according to a published report 
the authorizations deemed as lawful any covert actions 
including potentially violent ones taken in good faith by 
us intelligence agents against terrorists according to a report 
in todays editions of the washington post 
the language of the findings seemingly was ambiguous the post 
said actions taken in good faith and as part of an approved 
operation would be deemed lawful in advance but also they must 
be lawful sources told the post 
the newspaper quoted a former white house official whom it did 
not identify as saying the reagan orders were a goanywhere 
doanything authority 
the language of the findings caused disputes among 
administration officials the post said because actions that could 
be authorized under the findings might conflict with earlier 
presidential executive orders banning any direct or indirect 
involvement of us intelligence agents in assassinations 
the post quoted a source as saying the language was specifically 
designed to circumvent the assassination ban and protect cia 
agents who might take part in foreign strike teams 
white house spokesman bob hall told the associated press he knew 
nothing about the findings late tuesday night 
the post reported that unidentified white house officials said 
vice president george bush would have been given a copy of or would 
have had access to the findings 
a bush spokesman and bush campaign chairman james baker iii who 
was white house chief of staff at the time reagan signed the 1984 
finding had no comment the post said 
reagan signed the first finding on nov 13 1984 shortly after 
his landslide reelection victory the report said because us 
officials had become frustrated with carbombings at us 
facilities and the taking of american hostages 
congressional intelligence committees were not informed of the 
crucial language in the findings the report said 
the authorization was rescinded on april 10 1985 a month after 
a car bomb exploded killing 80 people in beirut near the residence 
of a leader of one faction of iranian fundamentalists 
the second authorization which included similar language was 
signed by reagan on aug 11 1985 two months after the highjacking 
of twa flight 847 in which american navy diver robert stethem was 
killed the intelligence panels were briefed after the signing of 
the second finding the post said

usvietnamese teams investigating the 
fates of american airmen shot down on bombing missions found two 
sets of human remains and the possible site of other remains 
officials said today 
we found partial human remains at two different locations 
said bill bell leader of the six us military experts neither 
us nor vietnamese forensic experts have had access to them at 
this point the vietnamese have pledged to immediately repatriate 
any remains so we expect to receive them in the near future 
the two teams of experts found the remains and pieces of 
aircraft wreckage in an eightday search of areas in five provinces 
around hanoi in the search which ended tuesday the investigators 
interviewed villagers and inspected sites were planes crashed 
during the vietnam war 
the teams focused on trying to determine what happened to six 
airmen shot down during bombing missions from 1965 to 1967 said 
nguyen can head of vietnams office for seeking missing personnel 
us officials said some of the six men were believed to have 
survived although there was no evidence they are still alive 
villagers led investigators to remains in lang son and ha nam 
ninh provinces said can he said the chances of identifying the 
remains was improved because teeth were found 
the remains will be sent to the united states after vietnamese 
experts examine them 
us investigators said the remains at lang son were found in a 
graveyard but they doubted the body was that of an american they 
also reported visiting sites in ha nam ninh and ha bac provinces 
that villagers said contained remains of americans 
the americans left hanoi today for bangkok thailand but were 
to return friday to review their findings and possibly discuss 
additional joint work including excavations of the crash sites 
foreign minister nguyen co thach of vietnam said tuesday his 
government agreed in principle to many more joint investigations 
over the next two months to resolve the 70 discrepancy cases 
including the six airmen that the united states considers top 
priority washington says there is evidence vietnamese authorities 
should have information on these cases which include airmen who 
were captured but never returned after us forces withdrew from 
vietnam in 1973 
the united states for years urged joint investigations but 
vietnam previously allowed only one previous joint field project 
the 1985 excavation of a crash site outside hanoi 
the us government lists 2393 americans as missing in action 
from the indochina war in cambodia laos and vietnam the three 
indochinese governments deny holding any live americans

you should have trust that we shall carry out our reforms the 
moment you lose the trust you should replace us

college students tested the stage and power 
saws whined in the background as workers transformed a sports arena 
into a giant television studio for tonights debate between lloyd 
bentsen and dan quayle 
organizers proclaimed the hall ready for business awaiting only 
minor adjustments after the two vice presidential candidates make 
personal visits today 
everything is coming together beautifully here said janet 
brown executive director of the bipartisan commission on 
presidential debates were a little ahead of schedule on the 
tasks that have to be performed 
the 10000seat omaha civic auditorium underwent a radical 
facelift in the days following a professional wrestling match on 
sunday sprouting network anchor booths hundreds of yards of 
patriotic bunting and miles of electrical cable snaking throughout 
the auditorium has been reconfigured to seat 2000 of which only 
100 seats are available to the public 
it even sported a redcarpeted spin valley where democrats 
and republicans were to be herded after the debate to present their 
side of the debate to reporters 
were attempting to turn a sports arena into a theater were 
also creating what is in effect a television studio said ed 
fouhy producer of the event we think weve got this hall turned 
into what we want and that is a debate hall 
as workers completed their tasks organizers brought in college 
students to play the role of debaters and panelists so technicians 
could perfect their camera angles 
some final details awaited the visits of the two candidates 
each has an hour to tour the hall and test such items as the 
lecterns which were set at 48 inches high for both 
an agreement between the two campaigns allows the lecterns to be 
lowered up to three inches so the two candidates would appear the 
same height on television with bentsen standing a couple of inches 
over six feet and quayle close at roughly six feet little 
adjustment is likely fouhy said 
many officials downplayed the arenas transformation saying the 
vice presidential debate was just one more show 
we do this every day of the year said terry forsberg 
building manager its not even as massive as some of the 
concerts we do were used to it 
the centerpiece the stage setting will be a familiar one to 
millions of american television viewers its the same stage that 
was used for last months debate between presidential contenders 
michael dukakis and george bush in winstonsalem nc 
workers turned the auditorium into a patriotic showcase with 
400 feet of blue carpet and 100 feet of red and white rope and 
for the human touch plants described as living green 
the preparations were halted temporarily tuesday afternoon when 
a transformer failure darkened half the building and cut power to a 
fleet of television trucks parked outside it was repaired quickly 
officials wired in about 500 telephone lines and had to go 
searching for extra electricity for the legion of television 
satellite trucks already dotting the streets outside the auditorium 
when you add the television city outside we had to bring in 
extra power forsberg said 
but after the effort officials were confident their handiwork 
was ready 
weve made it forsberg said we made it with plenty of 
time to spare 
we made it actually about two hours early fouhy said 
meanwhile omaha city officials were putting their best feet 
forward clearing parking garages around the auditorium for 
reporters and debate organizers and starting up a bus shuttle from 
the airport to downtown 
their zealousness drew fire from advocates for the homeless who 
charged they were clearing the homeless out of downtown to avoid 
embarrassment city officials rejected the charges

the states mental health commissioner has 
ordered an inquiry into his departments handling of the case of 
james william wilson the man accused in the greenwood school 
shooting spree last week that killed two children 
joseph bevilacqua said tuesday he could not yet assess whether 
the mental health department made errors in not committing wilson 
19 for treatment before his deadly visit to oakland elementary 
school on sept 26 
two children died and nine people including two teachers were 
wounded 
i of course have concerns where you have a situation of the 
magnitude of this case in regard to the disruption of the community 
and the lives that have been involved bevilacqua said 
he said a panel of outside experts and people from within the 
department will review wilsons files and interview people involved 
in the case

get an assessment of what happened in a very difficult situation 
and if we should make corrective actions we will in fact make 
the corrective action 
the department twice since 1986 had rejected attempts by 
wilsons relatives to have him involuntary committed to a state 
facility according to a retired probate judge who had been 
involved in the attempts 
the former judge rosemary m trakas told the greenville news 
that wilsons family twice filed affidavits seeking his commitment 
since 1986 she said he was evaluated on both occasions by the 
departments beckman mental health center in greenwood and that 
the petitions were rejected 
she said wilson had been involuntarily committed to the state 
hospital in columbia for a period of just a few months in 1983 
he is back in that hospital now undergoing a psyciatric 
examination ordered by a court after the shootings 
dr willie moseley of greenwood a private psychiatrist who had 
treated wilson said wilson checked himself into the mental health 
unit at self memorial hospital in greenwood for 15 days about six 
months ago 
he said after that wilson described by his family as 
hyperactive reclusive and fascinated with multiple killers was 
referred to the beckman center but that he never went there for 
treatment 
wilsons father james t wilson jr said his son was no longer 
covered by the family insurance policy when he turned 19 in april 
and that private psychiatric care was too expensive

nasa crews today prepared 
discovery for its piggyback ride atop a jet to florida and repaired 
minor damage suffered in the space shuttles 65 orbits of earth 
the crews are working and they will work round the clock 
until the orbiter leaves saturday said ted ayers deputy site 
manager for the national aeronautics and space administrations 
dryden flight research facility here 
the spacecraft which landed here monday had six heatshield 
tiles gouged by debris apparently during liftoff said john 
talone shuttle processing director 
workers also found some dings to a few of the hundreds of 
tiles that coat the shuttle but detected no damage to the 
orbiters brakes landing gear or tires talone said 
discovery sat inside the 100foottall matedemate device a 
shuttle garage where it is being serviced before its trip aboard a 
jet saturday to its florida launch site 
workers must deactivate fuel cells photograph tile damage and 
replace gouged tiles purge main engines and orbital maneuvering 
engines and attach locks to prevent control flaps from fluttering 
during the piggyback flight 
discoverys mission was americas first manned space mission 
since the challenger tragedy in january 1986 that killed seven crew 
members 
the vehicle looks beautiful talone said during a news 
conference tuesday it looks probably as good or better as any 
vehicle weve brought in here 
six tiles near the right wing must be replaced because of a 
12inchlong 6inchwide 1inchdeep gouge apparently caused by 
debris during the shuttles launch thursday talone said 
talone said officials werent yet sure if the debris was ice 
that formed on the outside of the shuttles external tank which 
contains supercold fuel 
theres a minor number of traditional dings on some other 
tiles caused by the impact of tiny particles during liftoff and 
landing he added 
after preliminary inspection found no damage the shuttles 
brakes were shipped to bf goodrich in ohio for a closer look he 
said the brakes were improved because of brake and tire damage 
during previous missions 
talone said nasa workers havent identified the cause of the 
trouble with discoverys flash evaporators a problem that made 
the astronauts endure temperatures in the 80s during their flight 
nasa plans for discovery to depart edwards early saturday 
arriving at kennedy space center in florida before dark following a 
single stop near san antonio texas talone said 
discoverys next mission is scheduled to start feb 18 three 
months after atlantis planned nov 17 liftoff with a classified

the central elections committee today branded 
rabbi meir kahanes antiarab kach party racist and antidemocratic 
and barred it from competing in the nov 1 election 
it was a political lynching kach candidate rahamim cohen 
said kahane vowed to appeal to the supreme court 
the committees head eliezer goldberg said the request for 
the barring of kach has been accepted it is still subject to 
judicial review 
in 1984 the supreme court overturned a similar committee 
decision that would have barred kach from competing in 
parliamentary elections that year since then parliament has 
passed a bill banning racism from political activity 
in 1984 we didnt have an antiracist law today we have and 
i hope kahanes appeal to the high court will not be 
successful said police minister chaim barlev 
barlev a leading member of the leftofcenter labor party 
told reporters his party supported the ban even though labor would 
gain if kach drew votes from the rightwing likud bloc 
the disqualification which was expected passed 285 with three 
abstentions the motion was brought by seven parties including 
likud and labor 
cohen rejected the charge that the party is racist and called 
the arabs a hostile population 
that is the source of our attitude towards them not the fact 
that they are part of another nation or are another color or 
practice another religion cohen said 
kach spokesman baruch marzel said the party is confident the 
supreme court will overturn the decision with the help of god

kahane who was born in new york city and founded the jewish 
defense league in the united states founded kach which means 
thus in hebrew it calls for the ouster of arabs from all 
israeliheld territory and opposes jewisharab marriages 
arguing for kachs disqualification leftwing legislators 
compared kahanes antiarab platform to the nazis antisemitic 
policies during world war ii 
when the jewish people become the dominant majority does it 
also mean they treat minorities as those other nations did that 
lost all shades of humanity said haim ramon of labor 
meanwhile labor and likud traded new allegations over an 
alleged wiretapping scandal dubbed the israeli watergate 
prime minister yitzhak shamir head of likud was quoted today 
in the daily yediot ahronot as saying labors alleged bugging of 
likud campaign headquarters was a shameful phenomenon 
shamir also was quoted as telling a closed forum of supporters 
that his party must shake the world and do anything to stop them 
labor from winning the election 
when i consider the possiblity that the likud may not win it 
drives me mad the maariv daily quoted him as saying they 
labor members are capable of anything they must be stopped 
likud has asked attorney general yosef harish to investigate 
labor on suspicion it bugged likud facilities and the home phone of 
campaign chairman moshe arens harish is considering the request 
asked about evidence of bugging likud spokesman danny naveh 
would say only that arens heard crackling in his line and his wife 
spotted prowlers in her yard last week 
foreign minister shimon peres head of labor belittled the 
charges this is puppet theater and i dont see any real person 
there on stage peres said tuesday during a campaign swing 
through industrial towns in northern israel 
likud and labor both claimed victory today in the first major 
test of the campaign the launching of crucial television ads 
tuesday night 
likud presented slick spots with an upbeat jingle flagwaving 
children and a statesmanlike shamir calling for a fair campaign 
labor and its policies were rarely mentioned 
labor took a more aggressive stand repeatedly contrasting its 
positions to that of likud a stern announcer hinted that likuds 
policies would lead to war 
both parties referred only briefly to the 10month palestinian 
uprising in the occupied territories although both have billed 
middle east peace as the crucial campaign issue 
shamir promised that once likud is in government it will 
immediately propose peace talks with israels arab enemies 
peres urged voters to give me the mandate to bring an end to war 
and ensure peace for our country

americans living east of the rocky mountains 
have a major earthquake in their future probably in the next two 
decades a panel of experts is warning 
terra firma is an illusion russell christesen chairman of 
the board of ebasco services inc said tuesday at a symposium 
called to discuss earthquake hazards and the federal response he 
said any portion of the nation can be affected by quakes 
the major problem is lack of awareness that there is a 
problem added robert l ketter director of the national center 
for earthquake engineering research at the state university of new 
york at buffalo 
the public is not concerned because people have not felt a 
quake in their lifetime this meeting is an effort to shake up 
that complacency ketter said 
ketter warned that a major earthquake is nearly certain to 
strike the eastern twothirds of the nation in the next 20 years 
threatening havoc in a region unprepared for such a disaster 
while he could not pin down a specific location for the temblor 
he said likely sites include the areas of memphis tenn 
charleston sc boston and new york city he also included a 
western area on the list salt lake city utah 
the probability of a destructive quake occurring at any 
particular spot is low ketter said 
however the probability of one occurring somewhere in the 
eastern united states before the year 2000 can be considered better 
than 75 percent to 95 percent before the year 2010 nearly 100 
percent 
unlike californians residents of the states east of the rocky 
mountains have paid little attention to the danger of quakes 
there are no building codes calling for quake resistant 
buildings in the east ketter said and little public notice of the 
danger 
and yet the strongest earthquakes ever to strike the united 
states occurred in the memphis tennnew madrid mo region in 
18111812 ketter noted in addition a disastrous quake shook 
charleston sc in 1886 and other strong quakes have been felt 
in the boston area and along the uscanadian border 
a tremor shook jamaica bay in new york in the 1800s he said 
that if repeated today would cause as much as 7 billion in 
damage in the brooklyn area 
while california in particular along the famous san andreas 
fault has been the subject of great attention quakes in the east 
are less well understood 
but when they do occur the rigid rock underlying the states 
east of the rocky mountains carries the shock to much greater 
distances than california temblors 
the 18111812 quakes in the missouritennessee border region 
caused church bells to ring as far away as boston 1000 miles 
distant ketter said 
those quakes are little remembered because the region was only 
sparsely populated at the time if they were repeated today the 
result would be havoc ketter and others reported 
ketter and robert chartrand of the congressional research 
service at the library of congress presented a scenario for a new 
memphisarea quake 
a tremor equivalent to one of the three major shocks of the past 
could be expected to kill as many as 200 people injure 8000 and 
leave an estimated 250000 homeless in the memphis vicinity 
chartrand estimated 
and ketter said the potential death toll could range from nearly 
700 to almost 5000 in the six cities nearest the center of the 
quake memphis paducah ky carbondale ill evansville ind 
poplar bluff mo and little rock ark 
near the epicenter most homes and buildings could collapse 
dams dikes and embankments would fail and there would be 
landslides farther away masonry houses could collapse frame 
houses shift on their foundations trees topple and cracks appear 
in slopes ketter said 
chartrands study forsees a bridge collapse over the mississippi 
river widespread flooding in the memphis area failure of gas 
electric water and sewer systems disruption of oil and natural 
gas pipelines passing through the region hospitals damaged and 
overwhelmed with patients transportation disrupted and other 
major problems

a turkish court has indicted a former 
teacher in the attempted assassination of premier turgut ozal four 
months ago the anatolia news agency reported 
kartal demirag was indicted tuesday by the state security court 
which charged him with attempted premeditated murder for shooting 
at ozal while the premier was delivering a speech to members of his 
governing motherland party 
the indictment which said demirag held neofascist views also 
charged him with carrying an unlicensed weapon and using a false 
identity according to the news agency 
one of the two shots demirag fired hit the microphone in front 
of the premier and the other struck ozals thumb bodyguards 
returned fire wounding 20 other people and the gunman 
demirag was sentenced last year to 10 years in prison for 
knifing a man in a coffeehouse brawl he escaped from jail in 
january and remained in hiding until the assassination attempt 
no trial date has been set 
turkish newspapers reported earlier that demirag was a member of 
the youth organization of the defunct neofascist national movement 
party 
the partys youth branch known as the gray wolves participated 
in terrorism that claimed about 5000 lives from 1978 to 1980 and 
that led to a military takeover in 1980 
the indictment said demirag had a grudge against ozal for not 
declaring an amnesty for rightwing activists after he was elected 
premier anatolia said 
mehmet ali agca the turkish gunman who shot and wounded pope 
john paul ii in rome in 1981 also allegedly belong to the gray 
wolves

thousands of troops guarded polling 
places today and voters stood in milelong lines to cast yes or 
no ballots on a proposal to extend president augusto pinochets 
15year rule to 1997 
power outages blamed on terrorist bombings plunged the capital 
and other cities into darkness late tuesday but the country was 
calm as polls opened at 8 am 
by midmorning thousands of voters lined up at santiago voting 
centers waiting patiently under a sunny cloudless sky in warm 
spring weather 
chiles 74 million registered voters are required by law to 
vote some voters said they arrived early for fear of trouble later 
in the day 
pinochet who voted downtown late this morning spoke 
sarcastically of the blackout by using the slogan of the 
opposition its the joy thats coming but the 72yearold 
army commander told reporters he heard no reports of incidents in 
the first hours of voting there are no problems he said 
the people are voting normally 
pinochet who campaigned hard across the country for a yes 
vote was asked about the outcome and said im always 
optimistic 
among early voters was patricio aylwin president o the centrist 
christian democratic party and leader of a 16party coalition 
campaigning for pinochets defeat 
its like returning to the times of the republic he 
declared after casting his ballot in chiles first presidential 
vote since 1970 
the downtown was virtually deserted with shops and offices 
closed for election day a national holiday 
radio reports also indicated a heavy turnout without serious 
problems in provincial cities and towns 
if a majority votes yes pinochet will assume a new 
eightyear term in march if most vote no an open election 
with two or more candidates will take place next year and the 
winner will assume the presidency in march 1990 
at least eight explosions were heard in santiago on tuesday 
night moments after the power outage affected a 1300mile stretch 
of the country 
police said terrorists bombed at least three electrical towers 
but said they had no reports of damage or injuries from the 
subsequent explosions indicating they may have been noise bombs 
intended to frighten but not harm 
the nations longidled election machinery was put back in place 
for the referendum on pinochet who lifted emergency rule and 
loosened his tight grip on the opposition in the months preceding 
the balloting 
the first unofficial returns are to be released about an hour 
after polls close at 5 am 
the opposition coalition distrustful of the interior ministrys 
tabulations planned a separate vote count the group says it will 
accept as official the results of the national electoral service 
which are to be disclosed on friday 
gen jorge zincke military commander of santiago said 
officials were ordered to provide access at polling places to an 
estimated 500 foreign observers we have nothing to hide he 
said 
about 150000 members of the armed forces and national police 
have been on barracks alert since sunday 
if pinochets new eightyear term is approved the military 
junta he leads which theoretically served as the legislative 
branch of his government will be disbanded a new congress would 
be seated in 1990 with twothirds elected and the remaining third 
appointed by pinochet 
whatever the outcome of the referendum congressional elections 
will be held in 1990 but the legislature will have limited 
authority it will be virtually powerless to amend a 1980 
constitution which gives the military autonomy and a supervisory 
role in national policymaking 
pinochet has pointed to an improved economy and the promise of 
growth and stability if he is retained as president his critics 
say the rich have benefited the most and that human rights abuses 
continue under his rule 
about 3 million of the 74 million voters were too young to vote 
in 1973 when pinochet led a bloody coup that toppled the elected 
government of president salvador allende a marxist allende died 
in the coup 
in 1978 pinochets military government won a vote of confidence 
and in 1980 it won passage the a new constitution 
but both ballots were loosely organized with no formal voter 
registration and few if any protections against fraud which 
opposition groups say was widespread this time the opposition has 
expressed satisfaction with the safeguards

the divorcefixing trial of former miss america 
bess myerson her lover and a judge is about money and greed and 
the abuse of power a federal prosecutor said 
but defense lawyers countered in opening statements tuesday that 
the case was unjustified contrived and ridiculous 
miss myerson 64 the citys former cultural affairs 
commissioner is on trial with carl andy capasso 43 and 
former state supreme court justice hortense gabel 75 who presided 
over part of capassos bitter divorce 
alan d scheinkman a matrimonial law expert from st johns 
university became the first person to testify today 
he explained the intricate workings of new yorks state court 
system in which the supreme court where mrs gable served is a 
lowlevel court where trials are held as a prosecutor passed out a 
list of legal terms to jurors scheinkman also gave the jurors a 
quick course in the jargon of divorce court 
the three defendants face five counts each of conspiracy mail 
fraud and briberelated charges for an alleged scheme to slash 
capassos weekly child support and alimony payments 
miss myerson is accused of giving a 19000ayear city job to 
mrs gabels daughter sukhreet who was then 34 shortly after 
became cultural affairs commissioner in 1983 to get the judge to 
reduce capassos temporary support payments to his wife 
miss myerson was named a corespondent in the capasso divorce 
she is also charged with obstructing justice for allegedly 
trying to keep sukhreet gabel from testifying truthfully before a 
federal grand jury 
this is a case about money and greed and the abuse of power 
assistant us attorney david lawrence told the jury tuesday it 
is about the use of secrets deceptions and lies to keep the truth 
from the public 
miss myerson who was miss america 1945 was forced by the 
scandal known locally as the bess mess to resign her city 
post last year 
describing her as one of the celebrities of new york 
lawrence said this case is about whether such privileged people 
are above the law 
but capassos attorney insisted it was the result of a scorned 
wifes accusations 
there was no fury as intense and meanspirited as that of 
nancy capasso defense lawyer jay goldberg said in a loud voice 
lawyers for miss myerson and mrs gabel attacked the 
governments case as purely circumstantial 
its contrived and ultimately one that is ridiculous said 
myerson attorney frederick hafetz 
hafetz disputed the governments contention that miss myerson 
schemed to fix capassos divorce because she needed his money the 
attorney said that at the time she was worth about 10 million 
capasso once a millionaire sewer and water contractor is 
serving a threeyear prison term for an unrelated tax conviction 
noting mrs gabels 40 years of public service her lawyer 
michael feldberg asked if it made sense for her to risk 
everything she had worked for for a job for her daughter 
he said there were no witnesses to or documents on the alleged 
bribery of the judge 
if convicted of all charges miss myerson would face up to 30 
years in prison and 513000 in fines capasso and mrs gabel each 
could get up to 25 years and fined 263000

kidding and flirting with the women on his staff but denied 
accusations that his behavior constituted sexual harassment 
i think ive kidded around and flirted around bates 
dcalif said tuesday i dont know if you could call them 
advances i think it was inappropriate from now on my behavior is 
going to be much more appropriate

on capitol hill in washington of mistreating his female staff 
members by making suggestive comments with sexual overtones and 
hugging them 
the publication the roll call quoted women on bates staff 
whose names were withheld at their request

female workers leg and swayed back and forth while asking about a 
legislative project but he said he regretted any actions that may 
have offended those who worked for him or have embarrassed his wife 
and family

challenger rob butterfield considered to be a longshot to upset

a former president of iran said an aide to vice 
president george bush negotiated this weeks release of a hostage 
held in lebanon and that iran received arms possibly in a deal to 
free the captive 
a campaign spokeswoman for bush the republican presidential 
nominee termed the remarks by abolhassan banisadr absolutely 
false 
banisadr said tuesday he did not know if the shipment of 
weapons was related to the release monday of mithileshwar singh a 
60yearold indian professor and legal us resident 
there has been a delivery of arms to iran he said does 
that have something to do with the release i dont know he gave 
no details of the purported arms transfer 
the disclosure of clandestine arms sales to iran aimed at 
securing the release of the hostages during 1985 and 1986 led to 
the irancontra affair it was the reagans administrations worst 
foreign policy controversy 
banisadr said that according to his information a man named 
richard lawless negotiated singhs release 
it seems he lawless has denied it banisadr said in 
paris where he lives in exile i am trying to verify it 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in washington 
there is a fellow named lawless he is over there what hes up 
to nobody knows but he doesnt represent the united states he 
does not represent the vice president or the president or anybody 
else 
his charges are not true from top to bottom fitzwater 
said today banisadrs full of beans 
the presidential spokesman also rejected for the second day in a 
row any government connection with lawless hes not operating 
under our instructions fitzwater said 
banisadr said the prior channel for contacts between the united 
states and iran no longer works and a new one has just been 
created he did not elaborate but said a new intermediary had just 
left for the united states 
he would not identify the intermediary either by name or 
nationality saying he did not want to ruin the chances of more 
hostage releases 
sixteen hostages including nine americans are believed held by 
moslem extremists loyal to iran 
banisadr said bush has been dealing since last february with 
hashemi rafsanjani speaker of the iranian parliament he said 
representatives of both bush and democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis have been in iran for talks 
dukakis spokesman dayton duncan said in washington thats not 
true its preposterous 
banisadr who fled iran in 1981 said intense efforts to free 
hostages were under way and that he has been told bush was trying 
very hard to work out the release of american hostages in early 
october 
bush campaign spokeswoman alixe glen said in washington those 
assertions are absolutely false absolutely no one is representing 
the vice president the office of the vice president or the 
campaign in any dealings with the hostages or any other dealings 
with iran 
the reagan administration has steadfastly denied that it has 
undertaken any talks directly with iranian officials to get the 
hostages released 
banisadr said iran wants the release of iranian assets frozen 
in the united states 
iran has filed claims before a joint usiranian claims 
tribunal for 12 billion in military equipment frozen as a result 
of the 1979 iranian revolution tehran also seeks release of 
billions of iranian funds frozen in us banks after seizure of 52 
hostages at the us embassy in 1979 
us officials say 9 billion in financial assets have either 
been returned to iran or paid to its creditors

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
oct 4 
tulsa okla world on the soviet leadership shakeup 
on friday it was announced that soviet communist party 
chairman mikhail gorbachev would succeed retiring old guardsman 
andrei gromyko as president 
there were other important changes in the leadership including 
the kgb all were calculated to advance gorbachev loyalists 
perhaps more important gorbachev anounced that the supreme 
soviet the nations nominal parliament would assume a greater 
role in everyday management of the country 
the soviets government councils also were promised more power 
obviously at the expense of the central communist party apparatus 
 
none of this means that the soviet union is turning democratic 
in the western definition of that word 
but it does mean that gorbachev plans to deal with the soviet 
unions severe internal divisions with some accommodation and 
negotiation 
the same is almost certainly true of the soviet unions foreign 
policy 
thats good news

the rapid city sd journal on americas return to space and 
star wars 
there were two recent developments in the united states that 
bode well for the future of man in space the successful launch of 
a space shuttle and the official recognition that star wars the 
strategic defense initiative is going to proceed at a much lower 
level once president reagan leaves office 
the space shuttle program was grounded for 32 months after the 
challenger blew apart in early 1986 when the shock of the 
explosion eased the nation discovered it had put too many space 
eggs in the shuttle basket 
in addition the announcement that air force lt gen james a 
abrahamson commander of the sdi program for the past five years 
was resigning his post was a milestone in recognizing reality 
for whether vice president george bush or gov michael dukakis 
wins the presidency the star wars program is phasing down 
although not out the only question is how deeply to cut 
the us is back in space but concerning the idea that a quick 
technological fix can protect the nation against nuclear war it is 
returning to earth

honolulu starbulletin on the us space program 
the flawless landing of the shuttle discovery at edwards air 
force base puts the united states space program back in business 
after 2 years of agonizing reappraisal following the challenger 
explosion the national aeronautics and space administration showed 
the world through the flight of discovery that it has regained its 
directions 
there is much lost time to be recovered in the space program 
and many decisions to be made 
but this painful experience has restored nasas caution without 
destroying its will to go on thereby strengthening it for the 
tasks ahead

the seattle postintelligencer on welfare reform 
despite rave reviews for the new federal welfare law from 
supporters in congress the poor should not raise their hopes too 
high 
the lukewarm endorsement of rep jim slattery dkan probably 
is an accurate appraisal 
slattery called the longawaited legislation strictly 
marginalits a coin flip as to whether it will work he 
said on a marginal basis i support this bill those who vote 
against it may have a better reason than i 
during the welfare debate there was a lot of highminded 
speechifying in congress about raising families out of the mire 
of poverty and such 
but political actions as always spoke louder than political 
talk congress will raise 375 million of its new 33 billion 
welfare bill by taking away from working parents of children 1214 
an income tax deduction for child care 
and while telling welfare mothers they must get jobs to support 
their families it refused to raise the minimum wage above 335 an 
hour

why did mike dukakis put on a helmet climb into a tank and ride 
around in it while the cameras clicked for the same reason george 
bush toured a flag factory 
pollsters told them to 
hey are those guys trying to manipulate us sure blatantly 
whenever the winds of public opinion shift the pollsters detect 
the change almost instantly and order a new course that keeps the 
campaigns custom tailored to the evershifting national concensus 
what do the candidates really think about the issues who knows 
but if you want to know what theyll say they think tomorrow 
about some piece of campaign business large or small just ask

the flint mich journal on the united nations peacekeeping 
activities 
it has been a remarkable year for peace and the united nations 
we have witnessed considerable progress in the persian gulf 
angola cambodia and elsewhere in large part because of un 
efforts 
but as un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar reminds 
us the recent achievements of the united nations have neither 
been sudden nor fortuitous but are the hardwon results of 
persistence and dedication over many years epitomized by the 
peacekeeping activities of the organization 
and so it is most fitting that this years nobel peace prize has 
been awarded to un peacekeeping forces it is as perez de 
cuellar so eloquently put it a tribute to idealism valor and 
sacrifice 
recognition is long overdue for the 500000 troops from 58 
countries including 800 killed in the line of duty who have 
helped keep peace and ease tensions in world hot spots since 1948 
for 40 years the world has owed them a debt of gratitude

palm beach fla post on trade restrictions 
the american consumer won a victory with president reagans veto 
of a bill that would limit textile and shoe imports 
trade restrictions hurt american consumers far more than they 
help the protected industries because they invite retaliatory 
countermeasures from other countries 
they allow uncompetitive industries to maintain a sheltered 
existence and force consumers to pay more for the products these 
industries produce than if the products had to compete with others 
from throughout the world

the news tribune woodbridge nj on steroid use at the 
olympics 
evidence of stanozol the anabolic steroid detected in a urine 
sample submitted by ben johnson the canadian sprinter cost 
johnson his medal and millions of dollars in endorsements 
athletes more than any other segment of our society have been 
singled out for their abuse of socalled recreational drugs 
wall street brokers presidential candidates and newspaper 
editors do not undergo the type of scrutiny now expected of 
thirdstring halfbacks in the national football league 
this treatment of athletes is unfair 
but steroids intended to enhance performance are a different 
story rather than abuse his body for a high an athlete abuses his 
body to gain a competitive edge compromising the sprit of 
competition 
ben johnson has become an embarrassment to the nation of canada 
and an object of scorn among clean athletes in the end 
however johnson is a fortunate man he was caught and presumably 
will stop this tragic drug abuse

columbia mo daily tribune on gun control 
sixteenyearold jason ivy will stand trial for shooting his 
stepsister with a 22 caliber pistol that his father kept under the 
mattress in his bedroom 
apparently jason got hopped up on heavy metal music and just 
decided to act out some of the fantasy that was spinning in his 
head a handgun was handy so he used it 
when will we wake up and realize the horrible mistake in 
allowing people to keep these small easily concealed handguns 
we ought to ban these small handguns and give police full search 
and seizure powers to confiscate them seizing handguns would be 
infinitely more beneficial to society than seizing marijuana plants

the chattanooga tenn times on congressional honorariums 
the decision by two major defense contractors mcdonnell douglas 
and general dynamics to suspend temporarily their practice of 
paying honorariums to congressmen for speeches is a welcome 
reaction to the current investigation of pentagon fraud its not 
enough however 
paying members of congress for speeches is at best a fraud a 
congressman shows up at a function sponsored by a military 
contractor makes a brief speech and pockets upwards of 
2000 true the house and senate have imposed some limits but 
that doesnt make it right 
usually the honorariums are paid to congressmen who serve on 
committees considering legislation in which the companies or 
organizations have an interest the likelihood of a conflict of 
interest on the part of a congressman is obvious 
at first it sounds plausible to argue that the limitation makes 
it unlikely a congressman will be influenced but many congressmen 
receive up to 2000 from each of several companies 
when members of congress take money from companies that do 
business with the government they are at least giving the 
impression that their votes are for sale the people deserve better

republican george bush implies an answer when he speaks of an 
america made better by a thousand points of light his way of 
referring to the voluntary efforts americans must make to help each 
other as government programs are reduced 
the opposite party likes to scoff at such talk and bushs 
opponent michael dukakis professes not even to understand it 
theres a strong argument in favor of letting churches and other 
groups of private citizens take over some of the frontline 
charitable duties that had been assumed in recent years by 
government 
if nothing else they are much closer than government to the 
problems they must deal with

members of congress took action last week that could provide 
the first major welfare reform in 53 years 
the compromise contains among its stipulations one that would 
require one adult in a twoparent welfare family to work receive 
onthejob training or perform community service at least 16 hours 
per week the equivalent of two eighthour work days 
this federally mandated work program coined workfare since

the albuquerque nm tribune on recyling garbage 
the federal environmental protection agency called on state and 
local governments the other day to step up programs for recycling 
of household wastes 
at present only 10 percent of american wastes are recycled 
compared to half in japan and some west european countries another 
10 percent is incinerated and most of the rest goes into landfills 
the federal agency has set a goal of having 25 percent of us 
wastes recycled 
since washington is limited in how far it can go to solve an 
essentially local problem the epa is undertaking a largely 
promotional campaign 
most people in americas throwaway society dont take to the 
idea of segregating household waste but the growing problem of 
disposing of it in an environmentally sound manner soon will 
require that state and local governments compel them to do it 
if washington can give the recycling process a nudge thats to 
the good

green bay wis pressgazette on chrysler negotiations 
a 250 million settlement from chrysler corp does not come 
close to replacing the 4900 jobs lost to wisconsin when the 
automaker decided to cut operations in kenosha 
the package is the best achievable under the circumstances 
said gov tommy thompson 
thats a good assessment 
there was talk when chrysler announced its pullout of two 
possible legal actions 
one was a lawsuit contending that the automaker broke a contract 
with the state the other was a restraining order or injunction 
ordering the firm to continue operations in wisconsin 
there is no guarantee either action would have been successful 
the courts do act oddly at times but it is hard to imagine a 
court telling a corporation that it must continue an inefficient or 
unprofitable operation

us rep kenneth buddy mackay won the 
democratic senate runoff and said he would try to heal wounds from 
the divisive race while looking ahead to a mainstream versus 
extreme contest with republican connie mack 
state insurance commissioner bill gunter who tuesday lost a 
runoff to mackay in his third try at the senate put on a mackay 
button today in tallahassee the state capital the two pledged to 
put behind what gunter had called one of the ugliest campaigns in 
state history 
weve had our differences were together now were going to 
go forward said mackay a thirdterm congressman 
unofficial returns from tuesdays runoff gave mackay 362234 or 
52 percent of the vote to gunters 330297 or 48 percent 
mack a former cape coral bank president and grandson of the 
baseball hall of fame manager is a wellfunded conservative whose 
candidacy is drawing national republican help he won the gop 
primary on sept 6 getting more than half the votes so that a 
runoff wasnt necessary 
mack and mackay will face each other on the november ballot for 
the seat held by democratic sen lawton chiles who is retiring 
after three terms 
we are the candidacy that can beat connie mack mackay said 
tuesday night i see this election as mainstream versus extreme 
mack agreed that voters faced an ideological decision 
i think the voters in florida are going to have a very clear 
choice between the liberal buddy mackay and the conservative connie 
mack he said 
the senate runoff climaxed twisting events that began last 
december when chiles 58 announced he wouldnt seek reelection 
saying he was burned out by the senate and didnt like the high 
cost of running for reelection 
popular former twoterm gov reubin askew then entered the race 
against mack but askew well ahead in all polls withdrew may 7 
saying he didnt like all the time spent raising funds 
gunter and mackay jumped in after askew pulled out and they ran 
onetwo in the sept 6 primary but neither received a majority 
making a runoff necessary 
mackay a lawyer from a wealthy landowning family was endorsed 
by askew 1986 democratic gubernatorial nominee steve pajcic 
thirdplace primary finisher rep dan mica and fourthplace 
finisher state sen patricia frank 
the runoff campaign was filled with negative advertising and 
sharp exchanges in debates and democratic officials worried that 
mack would face a crippled opponent in the general election 
mackay 55 attacked gunters integrity for his practice each 
election of using campaign contributions from the insurance 
industry he regulates including from two companies that later 
collapsed in corruption he also charged that gunter voted against 
desegregation 15 years ago 
gunter 54 charged that mackays congressional record betrayed 
israel social security and antidrug efforts and he claimed 
mackay was being supported by corrupt defense contractors 
mackay warned that the wellfunded mack could exploit gunters 
alleged ethics problems mack meanwhile went on the attack 
against mackay running television and newspaper ads charging 
hey buddy youre liberal 
gunter lost a 1974 democratic senate runoff and won a 1980 
senate runoff only to lose in the general election

police placed security around seven clinics that 
perform abortions today bracing for more demonstrations of the 
type that put more than 350 people in jail on tuesday 
demonstrators said authorities impounded one of their buses 
forcing a delay in the second day of what they called the siege 
of atlanta 
police did not immediately confirm the impoundment report but 
said they would continue the rough tactics that brought complaints 
from demonstration leaders and some civil libertarians they had 
announced last week that the relatively gentle tactics used on 
previous demonstrations would be discontinued 
i could not believe the level of brutality that was going on 
here protest leader randall terry said tuesday as police dragged 
or carried protesters who resisted arrest by crawling on hands and 
knees 
backers of the antiabortion group operation rescue tried but 
failed to close three clinics with sitins tuesday and said they 
would hit one today but did not identify it in advance 
police spokeswoman myrna may said she had no immediate details 
on the groups claim that a bus was impounded because she could 
not get in touch with the officers involved to check it out a 
spokeswoman for the demonstrators said the impoundment would delay 
this mornings planned demonstration until afternoon 
ms may said most of those arrested tuesday were charged with 
criminal trespass and that none had posted bail court appearances 
were scheduled to begin late this afternoon 
operation rescue spokesman bob nolte had complained tuesday 
evening that the protesters were not being processed properly or 
read their rights 
over the summer the new yorkbased group led demonstrations at 
atlanta clinics over several weeks during and after the democratic 
national convention resulting in 700 arrests three of the 700 
remain in jail 
most clinics followed their usual schedule tuesday said lynne 
randall executive director of one of the clinics 
most of those arrested were charged with criminal trespass and 
identified themselves as baby jane doe or baby john doe ms may 
said 
that identification tactic was used in earlier protests with 
protesters saying they were expressing solidarity with what they 
called the anonymous victims of abortion authorities have refused 
to release protesters who wouldnt give their real names 
at a rally tuesday night at st jude the apostle roman catholic 
church in suburbs north of atlanta terry urged about 600 people to 
join todays protests 
but only about 75 people said they would participate and 
remained for coaching on tactics 
protesters complained that police treated them with unnecessary 
harshness twisting arms and fingers and using pressurepoint holds 
just under the ears to force them off the street and into buses 
some screamed or cried as they were taken away 
police asked the protesters if they would walk to the buses 
before hauling them off when they refused 
gene guerrero executive director of the georgia chapter of the 
american civil liberties union said he asked the city to abandon 
pressurepoint holds 
however he said ive been to a lot of demonstrations and 
ive seen a lot of police brutality i havent seen that today 
guerrero who joined abortion rights advocates in helping escort 
women through the demonstrators to the clinics tuesday said 
operation rescue was going beyond the limits of free speech 
there is a real interference now he said 
protest organizers complained that the polices tactics which 
they had been warned about led to the injury of the rev doyle 
clark a demonstrator in his late 50s who is pastor of a church in 
hudson ind 
clark said he was dropped on his head as police carried him to a 
bus according to grady memorial hospital spokesman william breyer 
breyer said clark who was being kept in the hospitals detention 
unit would probably be treated and returned to jail 
in addition to trespass charges participants in this weeks 
protests face fines up to 500 for contempt of court if they 
violate a superior court judges order limiting the demonstrations 
the order bans demonstrators from coming within 5 feet of a 
clinics property lines and limits the number of pickets to 25 per 
clinic 
terry and others said they would ignore the order 
terry was arrested monday night on charges of conspiracy to 
commit a crime but was freed before tuesdays demonstration after 
an unidentified family posted 75000 bond

federal investigators said today some food 
prices have risen faster than warranted by the drought but a senate 
chairman said theres no proof so far of significant price gouging 
some price increases do appear higher than warranted by the 
drought alone sen patrick j leahy dvt told a hearing of 
his senate agriculture committee he said the higher levels were 
most notably in wheatbased food products such as pasta and 
bread and in some meats 
but in general there do not seem to have been excessive price 
increases across a broad range of products that use the drought as 
an excuse he said 
the hearing was held to unveil a report from the general 
accounting office on food price increases between july and august 
the report was requested by leahy and rep byron dorgan dnd in 
july amid speculation that the food industry would seize on the 
drought to hike prices 
a general accounting office official john harman told the 
committee some price increases found by the congressional 
investigative agency could not be explained by the drought he 
pointed to a 6 percent jump in pasta prices between the july and 
august checks that the agency made 
a rise of 34 percent would be warranted by the impact of the 
drought on durham wheat used to make pasta he said he added that 
cattle prices dropped as a result of the drought but that was not 
reflected by the cost of beef 
just why there were some unexplained increases was unclear he 
said 
it may have been because prices of packaging of food products 
went up significantly this year gao aide mary kenney told the 
panel 
there could have been some labor cost increases we dont 
know if there were harman said 
conclusive evidence of price gouging has not been found but 
there are some indications out there that suggest it could 
materialize in the future sen tom harkin diowa told the 
hearing packed with lobbyists from the nations 
multibilliondollar food industry 
my advice to consumers is to be comparative shoppers he 
said 
food processors and retailers need to know that we are all 
watching and they must be held accountable for any food price 
increases not directly attributable to higher costs leahy and 
dorgan said in a statement released tueslday night 
the study showed that the price of ground beef has increased 3 
percent while the price that livestock producers get for cattle 
actually has dropped 11 percent since april 
rising feed prices have accelerated the sale of cattle and thus 
created a buyers market 
fruit prices rose an average of 12 percent while bread prices 
increased 4 percent according to the gao 
the lawmakers stressed that the gao figures represented national 
averages and that there could be differences from one region to 
another 
two consumer organizations issued a report on monday saying 
there had been no price gouging in july and august but 
substantial increases in beef and some other agricultural goods 
in june 
the report was issued jointly by the consumer federation of 
america and washingtonbased advocacy group public voice on food 
health and policy

collided with a coal train and exploded according to witness 
accounts published wednesday

apartment buildings to rubble in the city 850 miles east of moscow 
reporter vladimir sanatin wrote in komsomolskaya pravda 
he wrote that he found a mother who had lived in one of the 
buildings wandering in the street and repeating i snatched him 
from under the plaster seryozha my son hes 5 years old and 
hes alive 
four people were killed and 500 sought medical care the 
newspaper sovietskaya rossiya reported of those 90 were 
hospitalized 
initial reports tuesday said 280 people sought medical care and 
that 87 were hospitalized 
the latest reports said 359 families were left homeless 
the explosions blasted a 30footdeep crater set fire to tanks 
of oil and gas and blanketed sverdlovsk with dark smoke the 
government paper izvestia said 
the explosions damaged 108 stores 86 restaurants and seven 
hospitals said sovietskaya rossiya glass was broken five miles 
away from the railyard komsomolskaya pravda said

dispatcher who ordered the freight train to halt at the wrong 
location on a track leading into the railyard the cars loaded with 
explosives became disconnected from the locomotive and started 
rolling away 
engineer v pimenov managed to reconnect the locomotive but

the reagan administration is studying 
prospects for seeking congressional approval for the release of 
165 million in military aid to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today 
we are analyzing that possibility fitzwater told reporters 
at his daily briefing a final decision has not been made 
the spokesman noted that language in the recentlysigned 
pentagon appropriations bill permits reagan to request a separate 
congressional vote on whether to release those weapons to the 
rebels 
there is 16 million of stockpiled military goods in honduras 
it was purchased with earlier money which has been frozen because 
of the peace process and ceasefire between two sides 
congressional leaders say chances for approval of such an 
maneuver would be a longshot at best 
the bill authorizes the release of 16 million in lethal 
material that had been purchased earlier but had not been delivered 
and it sets forth findings that the president would make in 
requesting that release the spokesman said 
fitzwater said that under the legislation the president must 
find that nicaragua has caused a crisis in central america must 
consult with the four central american democracies and must then 
justify the request to congress 
he said the presidents justification for the release of the aid 
must also meet two of three conditions cited in the legislation 
of the three fitzwater said the administration believed that 
two had been met continuing unacceptable levels of soviet aid and 
sandinista violations of the peace accords 
fitzwater said the third condition that the sandinistas have 
initiated an allout attack against the contras was an open 
question 
the status is its all under consideration and we havent 
made a formal decision the spokesman said 
although congressional leaders had once hoped to close their 
session by the end of september continued wrangling over such 
matters as antidrug legislation may keep lawmakers in washington 
until next week

mankind needs to begin considering how it will 
cope with a warmer climate in the future instead of just trying to 
figure out ways to head off the greenhouse effect on the 
atmosphere a scientist said wednesday 
one effect of warming could be to present us with a future 
that is remarkably different from the present said william e 
riebsame of the university of colorado 
we ought to be thinking as a society about how we can adapt 
to changes riebsame director of the natural hazards research 
and applications center at the school told a symposium sponsored 
by a consortium of colorado colleges 
we all know that climate has changed on this planet in the 
past and its likely to change again agreed thomas h vonder 
haar who heads cooperative institute for research in the 
atmosphere at colorado state university 
the hot dry summer of 1988 helped attract considerable 
attention to the greenhouse phenomenon scientists believe the 
effect occurs when increasing amounts of carbon dioxide and other 
gases trap the heat of the sun warming the planet although they 
are not sure if this summer was an example or was just unusually 
hot 
response to warnings about climate change have concentrated on 
legislation and international agreements seeking to reduce the 
gases involved in hopes of preventing the overheating of the earth 
that is a worthwhile effort riebsame said noting that the 
effort could also reduce acid rain and reduce fossil fuel use 
but some climate change is going to occur anyway he said 
the bottom line is it doesnt take much change to put you in 
new social conditions riebsame said small changes in means 
averages can bring large changes in extremes 
some researchers have estimated that the greenhouse effect could 
increase the planets average temperature by 2 degrees to 3 degrees 
celsius 32 to 48 degrees fahrenheit over the next few decades 
riebsame said 
that may not sound like much but the seemingly small numbers 
give a false sense of security he said 
for example the decade of the 1930s the dust bowl years that 
parched the nation in the worst heat and drought on record 
averaged only 12 degrees celsius above normal he pointed out 
im not saying were going to hell in a hand basket but we 
need an insurance policy said riebsame 
at the least he said we ought to be looking at past climate 
changes and asking ourselves what would we do if that happened 
today to come through with flying colors 
pinning our hopes on avoiding the greenhouse warming would be a 
mistake he said instead research needs to be done on adaptation 
new methods of agriculture forestry flexible planning for change 
and reconsideration of the policy of seeking a maximum sustained 
yield from the land 
warming will change crop growth patterns water availability and 
many other things riebsame noted this year for example low 
water disrupted transportation on the mississippi river 
a variety of potential threats have been reported by scientists 
looking into the greenhouse effect including a northward shift in 
the major grain growing areas drought in many areas and melting of 
the polar ice caps resulting in a rise in sea levels that could 
threaten coastal communities with inundation 
the planets average temperature has warmed about onehalf 
degree celsius in the last century riebsame noted a period when 
industrial development sharply increased the carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere

a dormitory for women workers has a ghost that 
steals boots and plays knockknock with some of the residents 
a newspaper reported wednesday 
the labor daily trud said the ghost was discovered three weeks 
ago by three young housepainters who live in the moscow dormitory 
it said they had learned to communicate with the specter by a 
code system of knocks one for yes and two for no 
when two trud reporters visited the dormitory the specter had 
stolen a boot according to the papers account the women asked 
several questions and got one knock for yes after asking whether 
the boot was behind a shelf 
trud said the painters became aware of the ghost in 
midseptember when it knocked loudly on a door and began making the 
door open and close one night 
although specialists are in no hurry to pronounce themselves 
definitively it seems more and more likely that in these and 
several other similar situations what is occuring is a rare natural 
phenomenon a poltergeist the report said 
a poltergeist is defined as a noisy and usually mischievous 
ghost held responsible for unexplained noises such as rappings 
although soviet society is officially materialist there is 
enormous interest here in flying saucers the bermuda triangle 
ghosts extrasensory perception and such real or imaginary monsters 
as the abominable snowman 
even the staid soviet academy of sciences has a commission on 
abnormal phenomena 
trud asked commission chairman v troitsky to comment on the 
dormitory ghost and quoted him as replying in our country the 
principle is still current that these things cant happen because 
they could never happen

a slow underground coal fire 
discovered by the children plunging sticks into the ground should 
be put out as soon as possible because it poses a threat to lives 
and property officials said wednesday 
state and local officials who surveyed the site on a wooded 
hillside overlooking a city street proposed that the us office of 
surface mining consider the fire an emergency to keep it from 
spreading 
the agency sent a representative to investigate 
the fire was discovered friday after parents of children who had 
been playing on the hillside notified the fire department 
they had been sticking sticks in the ground poking them down 
and when they pulled them back up they were on fire and they were 
really fascinated by that said tim baden fire chief in this 
southeastern ohio city of 5000 
when we arrived there were three or four trees on fire and a 
very hot spot on the ground 
the fire appeared to be in waste coal from a nearby unmapped 
mine believed abandoned since the 1920s said mitchell farley of 
the ohio department of natural resources division of reclamation 
the fire posed no immediate threat to two houses about 60 feet 
away but as many as 30 houses could be threatened if it spreads 
into the coal seam officials said baden also said there was a 
possibility of a brush fire 
bill miska of the office of surface mining in columbus said if 
his agency agrees there is an emergency it will begin a cleanup a 
decision could be reached by friday

afghan guerrillas fired rockets at 
kabul during rush hour wednesday and killed 13 people disproving 
claims that the rebels attack only military targets afghan media 
reported 
radio kabul monitored in islamabad said 34 people were wounded 
in the afghan capital 
it blamed the attack on criminal extremists a reference to 
the usbacked rebels who have been fighting the sovietbacked 
government in kabul for 10 years 
the broadcast criticized western media for claiming that the 
socalled mujahedeen are attacking military installations only 
commanders of the afghan guerrillas have said they attack only 
military targets not residential areas 
tass the official soviet news agency said 26 rockets 
exploded on the streets and squares of kabul as its four 
districts came under intensive shelling 
it quoted afghanistans official bakhtar news agency as saying 
16 shells hit kabul suburbs and that the insurgents increased 
pressure on the eastern city of khost it did not report casualties 
in those attacks 
the soviet news agency said rebels are subjecting khost to 
nearly daily massive rocket and artillery shelling 
tass also said afghan government forces killed 23 rebels and 
captured weapons in strikes at bases in paktia balkh and samangan 
provinces 
it reported continuing fighting among the rebels in kuhestan 
nejrab ghazni and arghandab and said about 50 insurgents were 
killed 
radio kabul said six people were killed in the eastern city of 
gardez in rocket attacks tuesday afternoon and wednesday morning 
gardez is 60 miles southeast of kabul 
the soviet communist party newspaper pravda reiterated soviet 
complaints that pakistan is to blame for violations of the un 
accord providing for the withdrawal of soviet troops from 
afghanistan 
all indications are that in islamabad they have a very flawed 
idea of international law statetostate relations and 
treatybased commitments the newspaper said 
the soviet union said last week it halted the withdrawal of its 
troops from afghanistan citing violations of the accord 
pravda said the afghan government has registered more than 1500 
violations with un monitors 
radio kabul charged that among the alleged violations pakistan 
is circulating forged afghanis the local currency in kabul the 
radio offered no details 
under the accord signed april 14 the soviet union agreed to 
withdraw its 100000 soldiers from afghanistan in exchange for a 
pledge of noninterference by pakistan and other countries that 
have been aiding the guerrillas the guerrillas are not party to 
the agreement 
half of the soviet force in afghanistan was withdrawn between 
may 15 and aug 15 and the soviet union has until feb 15 to 
complete the pullout 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 replaced one 
prosoviet government with another and remained to fight the 
antimarxist insurgents

house speaker jim wright formally denied to 
the ethics committee wednesday that he broke house rules by talking 
openly about a secret cia operation aimed at undermining 
nicaraguas leftist government 
wright in a letter to ethics chairman rep julian dixon said 
his sept 20 criticism of the cias purported secret efforts to 
provoke civil disturbances in nicaragua was based on publicly 
available information 
but the letter left several unanswered questions for the panel 
formally known as the committee on standards of official conduct 
to examine in its informal probe of the allegations against wright 
dixon dcalif called the investigation relatively simple 
particularly compared to the committees separate and complex probe 
into wrights finances its not that complicated a matter he 
said 
there are two basic elements what classified information the 
speaker may have received and what he said to the press 
it is against house rules to publicly disclose classified 
information given to the intelligence committee 
on tuesday the intelligence panel voted unanimously to grant 
limited access to its files and personnel for the ethics probe 
access that could enable investigators to determine whether wright 
could have based his comments on material disclosed in classified 
intelligence briefings 
the controversy began when wright told reporters in answer to a 
question that we have received clear testimony from cia people 
about the covert action which he described as intended to scuttle 
faltering peace talks between the sandinistas and the contra rebels 
in a followup interview the speaker said the spy agency had 
not volunteered specific information about its secret activity but 
had acknowledged it only under questioning from members of 
congress he later said he had been aware of the activity since 
august 1987 
but in his letter to dixon wright said his reference to clear 
testimony referred to 1985 testimony by cia personnel before 
the world court 
wright did not name the personnel in the letter but has 
previously referred to testimony by david macmichael a former cia 
analyst before the court in 1985 at the time macmichael had been 
dismissed by the cia and was regarded as a renegade according to 
intelligence committee members 
in wednesdays letter he also mentioned written testimony 
forwarded to the world court in 1985 by edgar chamorro a former 
contra leader who left the rebel movement and became a vocal critic 
of the cias handling of the rebels 
wright also said the cia may never have formally 
acknowledged an intent to provoke sandinista overreaction and 
arrests as wright charged in his comments to reporters in any 
of its testimony before the house intelligence committee and it is 
my impression that congress has never authorized such activities 
the intelligence committee chairman rep louis stokes dohio 
said in a statement issued late tuesday that the committee agreed 
to respond to the request and to make its members and staff 
available in connection with any information transmitted to 
the ethics committee 
stokes termed the ethics committees request for information 
very preliminary and added they havent even started a real 
investigation yet 
the action appeared at least for the moment to satisfy 
republicans bent on adding a new layer to the ethics probe already 
under way into wrights financial dealings 
our concerns i think have been satisfied said rep dick 
cheney rwyo a member of the intelligence panel 
wright has repeatedly defended his comments on several levels 
he has contended that the comments could have stemmed from publicly 
available information but also has said he has a moral obligation 
to speak out about actions of the administration which he views as 
wrong

the army said wednesday it will distribute gas 
masks to about 37000 israelis following reports that arab 
countries may resort to chemical weapons in a war against the 
jewish state 
the test program will be coupled with studies to try to 
determine if the reported use of chemicals in the persian gulf war 
has prompted israelis to take the threat seriously said an army 
spokesman 
the masks will be given to 3000 residents of the town of 
shelomi on the israelilebanese border and to about 34000 people 
in the tel aviv suburb of ramat hasharon the spokesman said 
speaking on condition of anonymtiy 
no exact date has been set for the distribution but the 
spokesman said it would take place in the near future 
there could eventually be a decision to distribute the masks 
nationwide he said but that would be real far off this is 
only a test case 
a 1988 middle east military balance report from tel aviv 
universitys jaffee center for strategic studies said chemical 
weapons are an integral part of military offensive strategies 
in arab countries 
it appears that chemical weapons are an important element 
in the concept of overall strategic parity with israel the 
report said chemical weapons are quickly and easily 
attainable 
the army spokesman said ramat hasharon and shelomi were chosen 
for the test because studies show them to be representative of the 
general population 
its possible people have become more aware of the threat of 
chemical weapons he said but without that awareness its 
pretty useless to give them the masks 
in august the army began equipping troops with newly developed 
pills that increase immunity to chemical weapons

the ageold war against marauding grasshoppers 
is being waged with some promising new biological weapons the 
agriculture department said wednesday 
in one development two commercial firms evans biocontrol inc 
of broomfield colo and bozeman bio tech of bozeman mont have 
adapted usda technology for producing and storing a parasite 
nosema lucustae department studies show the parasite kills 50 
percent to 60 percent of grasshoppers in three to four weeks 
the basic tests and development were done by the departments 
agricultural research service at the agencys rangeland insect 
laboratory in bozeman by je henry and colleagues 
henry said the parasite is available to homeowners and ranchers 
through regional agents and on contract to government agencies 
which use it on a large scale in the west grasshoppers cause an 
estimated 400 million in damage to grass and crops each year he 
said 
spores of the parasite are put on wheat bran flakes to form a 
bait after the insects eat the bait the organism attacks the 
pests fat cells and depletes its energy stores henry said in a 
report issued here 
the parasite remains in the grasshopper population because sick 
females pass it on to offspring and survivors eat dead relatives 
he said 
meanwhile another development involves an agreement with evans 
biotechnical to field test another natural killer grasshopper 
entomopoxvirus the agency said in laboratory tests the virus 
kills 20 percent to 30 percent of the grasshoppers right away and 
stunts the growth of an additional 20 percent to 30 percent 
doug a streett an entomoligist at the agencys bozeman 
laboratory said evans biocontrol plans to produce the virus and 
mix it with the parasite for tests on 1000 acres in the west 
streett said that in combination the two ingredients may work 
more rapidly to kill the grasshoppers

the supreme court heard arguments wednesday 
that programs to reserve some public works contracts for minorities 
cause reverse discrimination while proponents said they break down 
rigid racial barriers 
the justices explored the power of state and local governments 
to give preferential treatment to minorityowned businesses in a 
key affirmative action case from richmond va to be decided by 
july 
at stake could be setaside programs adopted by most states and 
some 190 local governments 
the richmond plan was intended to fight racial discrimination 
a scourge of our society said john payton a lawyer 
representing the city 
black participation in the construction trades had been close 
to zero he said the evidence is stark and dramatic that 
blacks were excluded systematically from entering and advancing in 
the industry 
other remedies had no impact they simply werent working 
he added 
but walter ryland representing building contractor ja croson 
co said setting aside part of the contracts for minorities is 
reverse discrimination 
if city officials wanted to attack societal discrimination 
they could do it by racially neutral means he said 
croson successfully challenged the setaside after the company 
lost a city contract for failure to include a minorityowned 
business as a subcontractor 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled in september 1987 
there is insufficient evidence that city officials discriminated 
against minorityowned businesses in the past and it said the 
plans quota appeared to be completely arbitrary 
richmond adopted the plan in 1983 to require that a prime 
contractor on any city building project subcontract at least 30 
percent of the value of the project to firms that are at least 
onehalf minority owned 
while the minorities named in the plan include hispanics 
orientals indians eskimos and aleuts the primary beneficiary 
would be blacks who make up around half of richmonds black 
population 
the supreme court has been closely divided on affirmative action 
disputes and wednesdays hourlong argument session provided few 
hints on the likely outcome of the richmond case 
justice anthony m kennedy the courts newest member and 
possibly the key to the outcome of the case pressed the lawyers on 
both sides to explain their positions 
is the setaside the most narrowly tailored remedy for 
racial bias he asked kennedy suggested that the quota could mean 
higher costs for city projects 
payton replied there is no real constitutional question 
posed by that possibility richmond can decide that is the cost 
of remedying past discrimination 
kennedy participating in his first affirmative action case 
since joining the court last february replaced justice lewis f 
powell who often cast the deciding vote on programs involving 
preferential treatment for minorities 
the richmond case also may help foretell the courts future 
approach to other forms of affirmative action and alleged reverse 
discrimination the justices in a recent string of decisions 
generally have upheld preferential treatment for minorities and 
women 
ryland challenged richmonds motives in adopting the setaside 
policy noting that the city council had a black majority and that 
the citys population is around 50 percent black he said the plan 
could be just a porkbarrel thing 
but chief justice william h rehnquist noted that the court in 
1980 upheld a similar 10 percent quota adopted by congress for 
federal building contracts 
congress also might adopt porkbarrel legislation rehnquist 
said but we give it a presumption of validity 
how richmond selected a 30 percent quota is one of the issues at 
the heart of the case 
ryland said the figure was pulled out of the air and was 
so high it can force a particularly serious impact on nonminorty 
firms 
but payton said 30 percent is a reasonable compromise in a city 
that is half black and where historically minorityowned businesses 
received less than 1 percent of the value of city contracts 
setaside programs also have caused some deep divisions and 
seemingly contradictory views within the reagan administration 
president reagan for example said in 1984 he favored 
channeling billions of additional contract dollars to 
minorityowned firms and the administration generally has looked 
upon public works setasides more sympathetically than other 
affirmative action quotas it sternly opposes 
but the justice department responding to an invitation from the 
supreme court in a case similar to the richmond dispute challenged 
the constitutionality of setasides

president reagan on wednesday signed a bill 
designed to ease administrative burdens on indian tribes in 
connection with a program to transfer some governmental powers from 
washington to the tribal governing bodies 
the bill amends a law enacted in 1975 that provides for tribes 
to contract for health housing social and government services 
that otherwise would be provided by the bureau of indian affairs 
the new legislation responds to requests from tribes who said 
the 1975 act imposed burdensome administrative requirements on them 
among other things the bill exempts tribal construction 
contracts from federal procurement rules and regulations and 
provides that money not spent in one fiscal year can be carried 
over to the next year 
the bill also contains a provision saying the secretaries of the 
interior and health and human services shall reduce funding to 
indian tribes if directed to do so by a member of congress in a 
statement accompanying a conference committee report 
reagan said this provision is unconstitutional because only the 
two houses of congress and the president can take actions altering 
the legal duties of executive branch officers however he said 
the rest of the bill remains valid despite the unconstitutional 
provision

a bank teller who mistakenly handed out 25000 
instead of 250 put police on the scent after realizing the 
customer smelled like a certain chinese restaurant police said 
the customer who turned out to be a busboy at the three 
happiness restaurant had been sent to lakeside bank on tuesday to 
get change for 500 half in coins and half in 1 bills 
the teller grabbed 100 bills by mistake put them in a counting 
machine and sent the man off with 250 in coins plus 25000 in 
bills said sgt john roberts 
when the mistake was discovered the teller was unable to name 
the person to whom she had given the windfall but her nose gave 
police the only lead they needed 
the young lady who made the error recalled the individual who 
came to get the change had a certain odor about him characteristic 
of one of the restaurants in chinatown roberts said 
the teller picked the exact restaurant telling police that the 
aroma came from the cooking oils used there police recovered the 
money from the unidentified busboy who had hidden it at a 
relatives home police said 
authorities were prepared to charge the busboy under laws 
governing theft of lost or mislaid property but the bank declined 
to prosecute to preserve good relations with customers in 
chinatown roberts said 
michael moy manager of the restaurant said wednesday that the 
25yearold busboy had been fired but that he was sympathetic 
toward the young man who undoubtedly considered his find lucky 
money 
the mistake was from the bank not from the boy moy said 
after the teller discovered her error she went to the 
restaurant to speak to the busboy but he denied any role and 
police were summoned roberts said 
jim porcaro a spokesman for the bank said of the teller he 
would not identify it was an oversight that was corrected

usvietnamese teams retrieved two sets 
of human remains in an unprecedented joint search of the 
countryside for airmen missing in the vietnam war officials said 
wednesday 
but us investigators said one of the sets of remains found at 
lang son province bordering china was found buried with the 
remains of vietnamese and probably is not american 
bill bell a us team leader said searchers found areas where 
other remains might be buried and recovered pieces of aircraft 
wreckage they finished their eightday search through five 
provinces near hanoi on tuesday 
the us specialists left wednesday for bangkok thailand but 
planned to return to hanoi on friday to discuss their findings and 
the possibility of more joint work including excavations of crash 
sites 
the teams trekked through steep leechinfested mountains in 
pouring monsoon rains to reach sites where six airmen were shot 
down during the war which ended in 1975 they interviewed 
villagers who witnessed the crashes 
villagers led investigators to two sets of remains in lang son 
and ha nam ninh provinces said nguyen can head of vietnams 
office for seeking missing personnel 
can said the remains will be given to the united states after 
preliminary analysis by vietnamese forensic experts he said 
vietnam does not have equipment for identifying the teeth the key 
part of both sets of remains 
the six airmen were downed while on bombing missions from 1965 
to 1967 can said us officials said some of the airmen were 
believed to have survived the crash but there was no evidence they 
remain alive 
in all the places we talked to people who witnessed the 
crashes but none of them reported seeing any live airmen 
involved in the six cases bell said 
bell said villagers turned over pieces of wreckage when they 
heard the americans were searching the area the teams used metal 
detectors to locate areas where possible wreckage was covered over 
he said 
us bombers struck north vietnam beginning in march 1965 and 
over the next four years dropped more than 605000 tons of bombs 
the joint project was a breakthrough because it was the first 
time vietnam allowed us experts to probe the countryside and 
because it may resolve some cases washington considers top priority 
among the 1757 missing in vietnam 
the six airmen are among 70 discrepancy cases that the 
united states says vietnamese authorities should have information 
on such cases include airmen the communists captured but never 
returned after us forces withdrew from vietnam in 1973 
vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach said tuesday that 
hanoi agreed in principle to many more joint investigations over 
the next two months 
the two countries agreed on the joint work in june but vietnam 
suspended cooperation after criticizing washington for refusing to 
take the first steps to establish diplomatic relations 
vietnam previously allowed only one joint field project the 
excavation of a b52 bomber outside hanoi in late 1985 
can said the americans paid all costs of the latest joint 
investigation and provided a computer and vehicles to help in the 
operation

the white house denied wednesday that 
intelligence authorizations signed by president reagan in the 
mid1980s gave cia agents latitude to use assassinations in the 
fight against terrorism 
but chief spokesman marlin fitzwater acknowledged that language 
in two intelligence findings in 1984 and 1985 subsequently was 
rescinded by the national security council though he wouldnt say 
why 
reagans spokesman took strong exception to a washington post 
report wednesday which said phrasing in the earlier documents 
amounted to a license to kill for intelligence agents 
fitzwater suggested that the post story was an attempt to 
embarrass the administration during the election campaign but he 
stopped short of saying precisely that telling reporters to make 
your own judgment 
i think this is an extraordinary cheap shot its not true 
he said 
fitzwaters harsh statements at the daily white house news 
briefing mirrored comments he made sept 28 1987 on a book by bob 
woodward assistant managing editor of the post for investigative 
reporting entitled veil the secret wars of the cia 
the book among other things described intelligence findings 
signed by reagan in 1984 and 1985 which contained language 
interpreted by some in the administration as providing a means for 
us spies to make an end run around a 1981 reagan executive order 
flatly prohibiting assassinations 
on september 1987 fitzwater responding to the revelations in 
woodwards book said reagan was never aware of never 
authorized any assassination efforts 
on wednesday he said this an old story being rehashed again 
interestingly timed but has no foundation woodward was a 
coauthor of the story that appeared in wednesdays editions of the 
post 
the authorizations deemed as lawful any covert actions 
including potentially violent ones taken in good faith by 
us intelligence agents against terrorists according to the 
report 
fitzwater denied that the intelligence findings could have been 
construed as sanctioning assassination in attempts to combat 
worldwide terrorism 
im not going to give you a specific definition of the 
phrasing in question because i dont know and because we 
wouldnt discuss it anyway he said but the purpose was to 
authorize counterintelligence activities to counter terrorism 
the point is they did not authorize assassinations period 
fitzwater added because theres an executive order in effect 
that said they didnt because the president said they didnt 
it was rescinded when a new terrorism finding was made in may 
of 1986 it was omitted but i dont know why and then when they 
intelligence findings were all reviewed again in may of 87 it 
was firmly and specifically omitted 
the post story said reagan signed intelligence authorizations in 
both 1984 and 1985 giving cia agents broad antiterrorism powers 
it reported that unidentified white house officials said vice 
president george bush would have been given a copy of or would have 
had access to the findings 
bush also denied the report wednesday saying if we werent 
in polite company id tell you what i thought about a report like 
that asked during an appearance in littleton colo if it were 
true bush said absolutely not to circumvent the law against 
assassinations is absolutely criminal 
reagan signed the first finding on nov 13 1984 shortly after 
his landslide reelection victory the post report said because 
us officials had become frustrated with carbombings at us 
facilities and the taking of american hostages 
congressional intelligence committees were not informed of the 
crucial language in the findings the report said fitzwater denied 
that wednesday saying there had been notification 
the authorization was rescinded on april 10 1985 a month after 
a car bomb exploded killing 80 people in beirut near the residence 
of a leader of one faction of iranian fundamentalists 
the second authorization which included similar language was 
signed by reagan on aug 11 1985 two months after the highjacking 
of twa flight 847 in which american navy diver robert stethem was 
killed the intelligence panels were briefed after the signing of 
the second finding the post said

an environmental group said wednesday it had 
sued the environmental protection agency seeking to force it to 
order a complete end to the use of chemicals that destroy the 
earths protective ozone layer 
the suit by the natural resources defense council challenges the 
adequacy of the partial cutbacks that epa ordered for five major 
chlorofluorocarbon compounds or cfcs on aug 1 
those regulations paralled provisions of the 1987 treaty by 
major producing nations pledging themselves to a 50 percent 
reduction in cfc output by 1998 
epa administrator lee m thomas last week said new analyses show 
that the 50 percent cut will not protect the ozone layer high in 
the stratosphere and the chemicals in question should be phased out 
the ozone layer reduces the amount of cancercausing ultraviolet 
rays from the sun that reach the earths surface the cfc 
compounds normally inert rise through the atmosphere to the ozone 
layer where those same ultraviolet rays break them apart and free 
chlorine to destroy the ozone 
cfcs are used as refrigeration fluids solvents and plastic 
foam blowing agents many countries still permit their use as 
aerosol propellants a use banned in the united states in 1978 
the united states is the single largest contributor to 
worldwide emissions of ozonedepleting chemicals responsible 
for about 30 percent of global use said david doniger an attorney 
for the council we have a responsibility to clean up our own 
house 
doniger argued that the united states leads best when it leads 
by example he said the epa could pressure other countries to 
follow suit by banning imports of products made with cfcs unless 
the importing country also was committed to ending cfc use 
he said epas refusal to go beyond the treaty in its regulations 
appears to reflect a deal struck within the administration last 
summer to placate a faction that believed no treaty was necessary 
epa spokesman dave cohen said donigers notion of a deal is 
untrue and silly 
our goal all along has been to get the nations of the world to 
the table and agree to the deepest reductions we could possibly 
get cohen said 
we feel only a global solution will truly help the ozone 
layer and unilateral us action could be counterproductive by 
leading other nations to conclude they could safely increase their 
use of cfcs as a result cohen said 
the suit was filed in the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia

communist party chief stipe suvar 
called for a shakeup in the ruling politburo and the 
policysetting central committee after weeks of ethnic and economic 
protests staterun media said wednesday 
about 5000 workers marched on parliament on wednesday for the 
second straight day workers have stepped up strikes and 
demonstrations over the communist governments failure to reduce 
217 percent inflation and unemployment which is at 15 percent 
radio belgrade said 140000 serbs attended two rallies in 
central serbia to push demands for greater serbian control over the 
autonomous provinces of kosovo and vojvodina where ethnic 
albanians outnumber serbs 
thousands more flagwaving serbs attended a similar rally in 
novi sad 42 miles north of the capital according to radio 
belgrade and the staterun tanjug news agency crowd estimates 
ranged from 30000 to 80000 
suvar said tuesday night that the 162member central committee 
probably will vote on personnel changes in the politburo on oct 17 
in a session expected to be a major showdown between factions in 
the party leadership state newspapers reported his comments 
wednesday 
he said the politburo will meet before oct 17 to determine 
the criteria of possible responsibility of its members for the 
countrys worst economic and political crisis since world war ii 
if it fails in this the central committee will assume this 
role and anyone who does not win twothirds of the committees 
votes will have to leave the presidium politburo he said 
as the top body of yugoslavias only political party the 
politburo is the most powerful institution in the country it has 
23 members but two resigned last week under mounting criticism 
suvar also said about onethird of the central committee 
membership will be changed by the end of the autumn 
very soon new people will be brought into the central 
committee of the league of communists and its presidium suvar 
said 
suvar announced that a similar cadre renewal was expected in 
the party leaderships of yugoslavias six republics and two 
autonomous provinces 
yugoslavs have become increasingly vocal in demanding toplevel 
personnel changes leaders have been blamed for failing to defuse 
tensions between the mostly christian serbian minority and the 
largely moslem albanian majority in kosovo 
in addition to high inflation and doubledigit unemployment the 
country has a 21 billion foreign debt 
yugoslav and foreign observers believe major personnel changes 
at the oct 17 meeting will be aimed at reducing tensions between 
different factions within the party 
senior leaders who have been denounced in public and are widely 
expected to be sacked during or before the meeting include stane 
dolanc the nations vice president from slovenia josip vrhovec a 
croatian member in the collective presidency and several officials 
from the autonomous provinces of vojvodina and kosovo 
among those who expect to emerge victorious from the meeting are 
hardline serbian officials and their supporters led by the 
serbian republics party boss slobodan milosevic 
milosevic riding a wave of popularity in the largest republic 
advocates more central control over the provinces 
on wednesday for the second straight day milosevic addressed a 
crowd of angry workers at parliament and promised reforms 
about 5000 workers booed two other communist leaders outside 
parliament on tuesday 
during the tv interview suvar rejected suggestions that the 
introduction of a multiparty system in this singleparty state 
would resolve the crisis 
he said that a type of a multiparty system already exists 
because each of the republics and autonomous provinces has its own 
communist party but that the system does not work

a woman gulped pills in an apparent 
suicide attempt during a break in a foreclosure proceeding where 
she risked losing a dairy farm that has been in the family for at 
least four generations authorities said 
just about everything bad that could happen to people happened 
to these people attorney ned nakles jr said wednesday of ida a 
depta and her family the woman got caught up in such a feeling 
of hopelessness 
mrs depta 48 of alverton took the prescription pills from two 
bottles in front of other people in a courthouse hallway tuesday 
afternoon 
that tells me she wasnt so much trying to kill herself as she 
was asking for help said nakles who represents the estate of 
mrs deptas late mother irene bowser 
mrs depta remained in westmoreland hospital officials withheld 
her condition and other details at the familys request 
nakles said he did not know what kind of pills she swallowed 
the incident occurred in the westmoreland county courthouse 
where negotiations were under way to settle an attempt by itt 
financial service to foreclose on the familys 100acre dairy farm 
in southwestern pennsylvania 
the lender sued in 1985 claiming mrs bowser and the deptas 
defaulted on a 111000 loan secured by the farms 1984 estimated

upset over her mom her brother is dying of cancer and the 
possible loss of the farm 
witnesses said the deptas 18yearold daughter was able to pull 
some of the pills from her mothers mouth 
misfortunes at the farm caused some of the deptas money 
problems 
eighteen dairy cows died of an udder disease and the deptas 
were forced to have water hauled to their cattle after the farms 
well was fouled around the time a gas well was drilled nearby

because of neck back shoulder and leg injuries from an auto 
accident in 1984 according to court documents depta also was

ten million americans suffer from urinary 
incontinence and most could be helped if doctors would apply proven 
treatments in more cases a national institutes of health committee 
concluded wednesday 
were not talking about rocket science here said dr john 
w rowe chairman of the 15member consensus development panel 
this is something we can do tomorrow 
the committee report calls for family physicians to pay more 
attention to incontinence problems in their elderly patients and 
educate themselves about threatment it also urges patients to be 
more assertive in expecting adequate treatment if they are 
incontinent 
and it called for more research into the causes of incontinence 
a field the experts said has largely been overlooked in the quest 
for answers to more exotic medical ailments 
their fundamental point however was that the existing 
treatments often do not get to the people who need them because of 
a widespread and erroneous belief even by many doctors that 
incontinence is a natural consequence of aging 
this is an issue we can no longer neglect rowe said at a 
news conference wrapping up the panels threeday meeting most 
cases can be cured or improved 
he said more than half of those suffering from the problem are 
not even evaluated let alone treated 
rowe a professor from the mount sinai school of medicine in new 
york city offered this hypothetical remark from doctor to 
incontinent patient as all too familiar well what do you 
expect my dear after all you are 82 
he said the patient should reply i expect to get responsible 
adequate medical care 
one specific recommendation was for legislation requiring the 
manufacturers of adult diapers to carry a label message emphasizing 
that most incontinence is treatable and that anyone suffering from 
it should get a full medical evaluation 
many people with incontinence turn prematurely to the use of 
absorbent materials without having their difficult properly 
diagnosed and treated the report said 
there are several treatments for the various causes of 
incontinence which is defined in the report as a symptom rather 
than a disease 
the condition can be treated with drugs surgery or behavioral 
techniques which include exercises and biofeedback

democrat lloyd bentsen said he was feeling 
great and ready for his primetime showdown wednesday night with 
republican dan quayle 
the texas senator preparing for the most important night of his 
vice presidential campaign appeared relaxed as he headed to the 
omaha civic auditorium for a lighting and microphone check a few 
hours before the 90minute debate with his gop counterpart 
what would he try to accomplish in the debate he was asked 
win he replied 
bentsen spoke by telephone with democratic nominee michael 
dukakis in boston we had a good visit bentsen said adding 
that dukakis advice was to just be myself 
dukakis and bentsen planned a reunion thursday at a steel plant 
rally near longview texas 
bentsen arrived in omaha on tuesday night after four days of 
intense preparations first in washington and then in austin 
texas he took time to spend with his wife and three children and 
planned to work out in the hotel gym to help him relax before the 
debate 
ba bentsen accompanied her husband to the private tour of the 
debate site wednesday afternoon afterward according to press 
secretary mike mccurry bentsen 67 picked up his wife and carried 
her off the stage she looked like she was willing to go with him 
anywhere he said 
much of his preparation was devoted to making bentsen 
comfortable with the format of the debate which limited the 
candidates to twominute answers and oneminute responses aides 
said 
its a matter of taking the language of the us senate and 
putting it in a form thats suitable for television mccurry said 
although his advisers admitted helping bentsen frame his 
answers mccurry said we have not armed him with a lot of cute 
oneliners thats not really his style 
i think well leave the oneliners to roger ailes and dan 
quayle said dukakis aide leslie dach referring to the 
republican media strategist who has been coaching the gop candidate 
bentsen and other democrats have tried to exploit public 
uneasiness about quayles qualifications for the job and public 
polls show quayle is a drag on the republican ticket a strong 
performance by the 41yearold quayle could turn that around 
i dont think people are going to judge this just by the fact 
he doesnt stumble dach said he said quayle needed an 
extremely strong performance to overcome the publics doubts

the central elections committee decided 
wednesday that rabbi meir kahanes antiarab kach party is racist 
and cannot run in the nov 1 parliamentary elections the party 
said it would appeal to the supreme court 
the committee acted after the rival labor and likud parties 
joined in condemning the americanborn rabbis party as racist and 
antidemocratic the committee is made up of members of the 
knesset israels parliament in proportion to each partys 
representation 
in another development attorney general yosef harish said there 
was insufficient evidence for him to investigate charges that labor 
bugged likud headquarters israel radio reported 
kach member rahamim cohen who defended his party before the 
committee said this was a political lynching i personally feel 
the supreme court will cancel this decision 
israels supreme court has upheld disqualification of a 
political party only once in 1965 when it ruled against a party 
called socialist list whose members allegedly belonged to an 
outlawed group pledged to destruction of israel 
in 1984 it overruled an elections committee decision to 
disqualify kach which had won a knesset seat occupied by kahane 
in the 1984 election 
after that committee decision the knesset passed a law barring 
racist parties from running for office 
the kach platform calls for expulsion of the 22 million arabs 
living in israel and the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
committee members voted 285 with three abstentions to ban 
kach the opposition came from three small religious parties 
kahane born in brooklyn ny established the jewish defense 
league in the united states before moving to israel and founding 
kach which means thus in hebrew 
his partys popularity has grown because of antiarab sentiment 
fed by the 10monthold palestinian revolt in the occupied lands 
recent polls indicated it could win up to three of the 120 knesset 
seats nov 1 
dan meridor of likud said of the election committee vote this 
was a difficult decision we are depriving the party of a 
fundamental right 
many references were made to the jews own past as a persecuted 
people during the committee debate which lasted nearly four hours 
now that the jewish people have become the majority will they 
treat people as did other nations which lost all semblance of 
humanity asked chaim ramon of labor the nazis started the 
same way with the same phrases 
cohen denied kach ideology was racist 
our attitudes toward the arab population do not stem from 
racist motives but from security considerations because the arab 
population is a hostile population orthodox jewish law obligates 
every jew to keep himself apart from the gentiles and not to 
assimilate 
kahane says his party platform is based on orthodox law

us rep kenneth buddy mackay and 
his defeated rival for the democratic senate nomination joined 
forces wednesday against the republican nominee after their 
bruising primary battle 
mackay who won tuesdays runoff against insurance commissioner 
bill gunter said he didnt think the divisive primary would harm 
the democrats chances in november to claim the seat being vacated 
by democrat lawton chiles 
mackay faces us rep connie mack the grandson of the hall of 
fame baseball manager of the same name in the nov 8 general 
election chiles is retiring after three terms 
were not going to lose this election because our partys 
divided mackay a threeterm congressman said after his 52 
percent to 48 percent victory over gunter 
though our experience had its pitfalls had its ups and downs 
and there was some pain it was a much better exercise in the 
democratic process than the performance of cardboard connie 
gunter said at a news conference before attaching a mackay sticker 
to his suit 
im proud to support him mackay and will do all that i can 
to ensure his election he added 
mack said he knew the democrats would nominate the most liberal 
candidate he adopted the tactic of gop presidential nominee george 
bush in painting democrats as liberals outside the mainstream 
i am conservative i am proud of being conservative mack 
said during a stop in tallahassee the state of florida is 
conservative i believe the things that i have talked about in the 
past year are in the mainstream and thats what the debate is 
about 
even before the runoff tuesday mack ran commercials going after 
mackay saying hey buddy youre liberal 
mackay cited macks support of former marine lt col oliver 
north who has campaigned for mack as an example of extremism he 
also brought up a zero rating assigned to mack by the national 
council on senior citizens who represent an important segment of 
floridas population and environmentalists criticism of mack

the senate voted 890 approval wednesday of 
legislation paving the way for the united states to join a 
centuryold agreement among 76 nations that grants global 
copyrights to literary and artistic works 
adherence to the convention will greatly benefit the united 
states said sen pat leahy dvt chairman of the senate 
judiciary committees subcommittee on patents copyrights and 
trademarks it will provide the guidelines which govern the 
copyright regulations between nations 
sen orrin hatch rutah ranking republican on the panel 
agreed our participation will provide benefits to american 
copyright holders and artists 
the bill would change us copyright law paving the way for 
senate consent to ratification of the treaty signed in berne 
switzerland on sept 9 1886 ratification will come on a separate 
vote 
the berne convention which has been signed by 76 nations 
spells out minimum copyright standards detailing what is protected 
and how long the protection lasts 
the pact prohibits member nations from discriminating against 
copyrighted works of other member nations it also provides for 
copyright protection to take effect in other countries 
automatically without the necessity of government formalities such 
as providing official notice of a copyright 
the chief dispute over the legislation involved how best to 
protect what are known as moral rights the authority of a 
writer or artist to guard the integrity of his work against what he 
thinks are damaging changes or misuse 
artists have generally argued for stiff coverage in us law of 
moral rights critics have said that strong coverage is 
unnecessary although they support the idea of protecting the 
artistic integrity of works 
american copyright law doesnt cover moral rights the berne 
convention requires signing nations to protect in law the right of 
an artist to ensure the integrity of his work however that 
protection doesnt have to be part of copyright law 
the bill approved wednesday sidesteps that issue providing that 
neither the measure nor adherence to the berne convention expands 
or contracts a copyright holders rights to object to any change in 
a protected work

a lawyer urged the supreme court on wednesday 
to strike down a new sentencing system for people convicted of 
federal crimes saying judges are supposed to stay out of 
political controversies 
washington lawyer alan morrison attacked federal sentencing 
rules that took effect last nov 1 because the sevenmember 
commission that issued them included three federal judges 
judges participating in a political process that could fairly 
be called horsetrading is unconstitutional because it impugns 
the federal judiciarys neutrality and impartiality morrison 
argued 
the job of passing laws about sentences for federal crimes 
belongs to congress and not to judges morrison said 
but solicitor general charles fried the governments top 
courtroom lawyer called the us sentencing commissions work a 
constitutionally acceptable attempt to resolve grave invidious 
and inexplicable disparities in the sentencing process 
at issue is the validity of the commission created by congress 
and the validity of the sentencing rules it issued 
more than 90 federal trial judges have refused to use the new 
sentencing rules declaring them and the commission 
unconstitutional but at least 60 of their colleagues have upheld 
the system imposing sentences under the new rules 
by the time the justices announce their decision expected by 
july thousands of defendants will be subject to resentencing 
regardless of which way the court rules 
if the justices uphold the system those defendants sentenced by 
judges who refused to apply the new rules will have to be 
resentenced if the justices invalidate the system those 
defendants sentenced under the new rules will have to be 
resentenced 
the commission estimated that by jan 1 more than 10000 
federal court defendants will have been subjected to the new 
sentencing system 
congress created the commission in the sentencing reform act of 
1984 legislation aimed at eliminating what some called unjustified 
disparities in sentences 
the law empowers the commission with its members appointed to 
sixyear terms by the president to tell federal judges what 
sentences should be imposed for various crimes 
the rules generally stiffened the prison time federal convicts 
were required to serve they also eliminated parole and curtailed 
credit for good behavior 
morrison representing a man who pleaded guilty in federal court 
to conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine argued that the 
laying down of broad rules causes the three commission member 
judges to be embroiled in political controversy 
judges appointed for life must maintain their neutrality and 
impartiality morris said 
fried acknowledged that having judges serve on the commission 
raises certain policy concerns but said those concerns have 
no grounding as constitutional prohibitions 
several members of the court most persistently justices anthony 
m kennedy and antonin scalia asked fried questions that appeared 
to challenge his assertion of the commissions constitutionality 
representing the commission chicago lawyer paul bator said the 
constitutionally required separation of the political branches does 
not bar congress from establishing an independent agency to make 
laws about sentencing 
he said congress could give the supreme court the same authority 
over federal sentencing without any constitutional violation 
the test case before the justices stems from the prosecution of 
john m mistretta who pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess and 
distribute cocaine after his arrest last year in kansas city 
before mistrettas sentence was imposed he challenged the new 
sentencing rules a trial judge dismissed the challenge and 
sentenced mistretta to 18 months in prison to be followed by a 
threeyear term of supervised release 
mistretta then appealed to the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals but the supreme court granted frieds request that it 
decide the constitutional issue while the case is pending before 
the appeals court 
the case is us vs mistretta 871904

a man charged with taking more than 110 
students and teachers hostage at a school feb 2 questioned jurors 
himself as his trial on 110 counts of kidnapping opened under 
extraordinary security 
james l harvey 43 of tuscaloosa served as his own attorney 
during jury selection a pool of 65 potential jurors awaited 
questioning 
those entering the courtroom had to pass through metal 
detectors and madison county chief deputy sheriff charlie norment 
said 17 deputies were on hand to protect the 104 schoolchildren 
subpoenaed as witnesses by harvey 
dressed in a light blue suit with a dark blue tie harvey 
brought his legal papers into the courtroom in a brown grocery sack 
wednesday he laid a redcovered bible on the defense table where 
he sat by himself 
he won the right to represent himself on monday after promising 
not to disrupt the trial 
harvey is accused in a 12hour takeover of the private west end 
christian school in tuscaloosa 
armed with two pistols and a rifle and wearing ski masks harvey 
and another man entered the school and held 110 students and 
teachers hostage saying he was trying to draw attention to the 
nations homeless and hungry 
no one was injured the standoff ended with harvey surrendering 
after viewing a bogus pardon videotaped by gov guy hunt 
harvey has been held on 84 million bail if convicted he 
could be sentenced to more than 10000 years in prison charges 
were later dropped against the other man who police said was 
forced to participate 
judge john m karrh ordered the trial moved to huntsville about 
160 miles away because of publicity 
harvey asked prospective jurors whether they knew anyone 
connected with what he called the incident whether they 
believed in the presumption of innocence for a defendant whether 
they had any relatives in law enforcement and whether they believed 
in statute law vs the constitutional law the moral law that we 
live under in a society 
district attorney charles freeman asked prospective jurors 
whether they would automatically consider someone insane just 
because he committed an illogical crime none said they would 
the prosecution subpoenaed no children instead summoning 
officers reporters the schools headmaster and teachers hunt 
who was subpoenaed by harvey will testify friday 
a hunt spokeswoman stacy rimer said the governor made it plain 
to harvey the day of the takeover that he had no power to grant a 
pardon 
he always felt he did what was right because the lives of all 
those students and teachers were at stake she said

a mother raccoon and her two babies 
who fell through a library ceiling were back in their attic nest 
wednesday after spending a day browsing through the reference 
section 
the dropin visitors discovered monday night when they set off 
a burglar alarm forced officials to close the library branch near 
here tuesday 
a sheriffs deputy answering the alarm discovered the curious 
family sitting on a desk among the literary reference books 
somewhere between greek and latin authors and the critical survey 
of long fiction 
they seem to prefer history and the reference department 
said circulation manager carol rouse they read a better class of 
literature than the average person 
the animals apparently had been nesting in the library for some 
time before breaking through the ceiling tiles 
on tuesday night animal control officials put a ladder covered 
with burlap up to the hole in the ceiling to entice the mother in 
part because they believed she might have other babies still in the 
roof 
the strategy worked and on wednesday the library was open again 
with the presumably wellinformed raccoons roaming above the 
ceiling ms rouse said

a proposal to ban the mailing of germs and 
dangerous toxins has drown vigorous opposition assistant 
postmaster general frank r heselton said wednesday 
as a result final action on the ban has been postponed until 
the issue can be more fully studied heselton reported to a house 
post office and civil service subcommittee 
and heselton said the postal service has contacted the federal 
centers for disease control and the department of transportation 
for assistance in developing safety standards for hazardous mail 
of 508 comments received after the proposed rule was made 
public only seven favored the ban heselton said opposition for 
various reasons came from doctors laboratories colleges and 
universities medical centers pathologists and biologists and 
state and federal health groups among others he said 
the plan to exclude germs and toxins from the mail was announced 
in june in the wake of reports that the military had increased 
shipments of such items 
the action was taken to ensure the safety and health of 
customers and employees the postal service said in announcing 
the decision the postal service is concerned that some customers 
are planning increased use of the mails for sending disease germs 
or hazardous toxins etiologic agents 
opponents of the restriction contended that there is no record 
of anyone ever being infected by handling mailed germs or toxins 
however 
they said the ban would increase the costs of shipping medical 
materials for testing purposes possibly slow down such testing and 
might lead mailers to improperly package and misidentify such items 
in order to mail them 
the postal service does not want to increase medical costs or 
have a negative impact on medical diagnosis or research heselton 
said but it must also be able to protect both its employees and 
the public 
it may be possible to reduce the risk by reducing the quantity 
permitted for medical purposes per parcel and requiring better 
packaging and more expeditious means of movement in the mail he 
said 
postal workers in kansas city last year expressed concern about 
blood and other medical samples mailed to a laboratory there for 
testing when some packages were found leaking mail handlers were 
supplied with gloves masks and other protective gear at the time 
and the packaging for the samples has since been improved 
postal regulations already prohibit the mailing of a variety of 
items including strikeanywhere matches explosives fuses many 
poisons most flammable liquids and certain chemicals 
many other items such as corrosives compressed gases 
herbicides pesticides and certain other poisons can be mailed 
only in certain types of packages and in specific quantities

but he said there are still tens of thousands maybe even 
hundreds of thousands of jews waiting to leave the soviet union 
and here as we lay this cornerstone and vow that the jewish 
people will never stand alone against tyranny i want to ask the 
soviet leaders a question where are those exit visas where are 
they he said 
you and i and all americans of good will are united in the 
challenge i propose to the soviet leaders today he said i 
say let these people go 
the president assisted by harvey m meyerhoff of baltimore 
chairman of the us holocaust memorial commission pulled a gold 
cord to reveal the chunk of pink north carolina granite that will 
stand at the corner of the museum 
the museum being built with private funds on land donated by 
the federal government is expected to open late in 1990 to 
commemorate th holocaust in which 6 million jews and other 
persecuted people were killed in europe by adolf hitlers nazis 
reagan said the museum will examine the nature and meaning of 
the continuing curse that is antisemitism 
i think all of us here are aware of those even among our own 
countrymen who have dedicated themselves to the disgusting task of 
minimizing or even denying the truth of the holocaust he said 
this act of intellectual genocide must not go unchallenged and 
those who advance these views must be held up to the scorn and 
wrath of all good and thinking people he said 
we know that the united nations whose peacekeepers were 
honored only last week for their service to the world has yet to 
repeal its infamous resolution equating zionism and racism the 
president said we know where such intellectual infamy can lead 
later the president met in the white house rose garden with 
emigres yury and tanya zieman and their daughter vera 12 the 
family arrived in the united states aug 12 after a wait of more 
than a decade for permission to leave the soviet union zieman is a 
mathematician and computer scientist and his wife is attending 
school they live in belmont mass

the state department accused the soviet union 
on wednesday of taking an unconstructive approach on a proposal 
by president reagan to expand air links to west berlin 
they must understand that progress in eastwest relations 
cannot bypass berlin spokeswoman phyllis oakley said she did 
not say whether the soviets had actually turned reagan down but 
she implied they had 
the problem has much to do with differing interpretations of 
the agreement governing the status of the city said another us 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the president in a speech at the berlin wall on june 12 1987 
urged the expansion of air service to berlin and promotion of more 
international conferences youth exchanges and sporting events 
there 
the city which was the capital of nazi germany in world war ii 
has been administered since then by the four allied victors the 
united states the soviet union britain and france 
while bonn is now the capital of west germany the three western 
countries keep trying to strengthen ties with west berlin which is 
110 miles inside east germany a soviet ally 
secretary of state george p shultz has called repeatedly for 
tearing down the berlin wall which effectively separates east and 
west 
we are disappointed by the soviets unconstructive approach to 
the initiative mrs oakley said they must understand that 
progress in eastwest relations cannot bypass berlin and that 
stability in and around the city can only be maintained over time 
by taking steps to meet the legitimate aspirations of berliners for 
positive change 
she said the united states would continue to press for progress 
on the initiative and its goals 
i am not going to get into the details of their communication 
this the spokeswoman said of the sept 15 soviet response 
obviously we feel that it was not forthcoming but were going 
to continue to press them on it

the reagan administration on wednesday urged 
soviet authorities to stop using violence to break up peaceful 
protests in the baltic republic of lithuania 
the united states government deplores the recent pattern of 
systematic violence by the soviet authorities directed against 
peaceful demonstrations in lithuania said state department 
spokesman ben justesen 
the unjustified and unprovoked attacks have injured more than 
a dozen individuals he said reading a prepared statement 
activists in lithuania and two other baltic states latvia and 
estonia have become increasingly restive under the policy of 
greater openness in the soviet union they have focused their 
protests against the 1939 nazisoviet pact under which germany 
annexed western poland the red army occupied the baltic states and 
eastern poland 
the us government does not recognize soviet authority over 
lithuania latvia and estonia 
soviet authorities have been cracking down on ethnic unrest 
most recently last week in the lithuanian capital of vilnius 
activists in vilnius told the associated press that riot police 
wielding truncheons dispersed tens of thousands of demonstrators 
the state department statement said that in the sept 28 
demonstration in vilnius more than 10 persons were injured by 
police to prevent the nonviolent expression of political views 
during the past weeks organizers of peaceful demonstrations 
have been injured by unknown persons in attacks believed to be 
officially sanctioned the statement said we call upon the 
soviet authorities to refrain from the use of force against 
peaceful marchers and to discipline those officials responsible

the environmental protection agency said 
wednesday it will ban manufacture of the coyotekilling compound 
used in baited collars for sheep a move expected to anger ranchers 
and state officials in the west 
the agency also said wednesday that it was ordering a temporary 
halt to sales of strychnine pesticide products which are used 
mainly against field rodents 
the agency said it will cancel the federal pesticide license of 
the only manufacturer of sodium fluoroacetate known as compound 
1080 which is put into baited sheep collars the producer tull 
chemical co of oxford ala failed to provide data requested by 
epa agency spokesman al heier said 
the federal agriculture department the wyoming agriculture 
department the montana livestock department and ranchers supply 
co of alpine texas have licenses to use and sell the product 
all will be permitted to continue distributing and using them but 
they will have to submit safety data on their use to epa 
agency spokesman al heier said the collars users are going to 
have to work like heck to get an alternate supply of the chemical 
heier said another manufacturer could attempt to win a license 
by providing the information the epa wants 
epa also said it was suspending all licenses for use of compound 
1080 against rodents in which it is dispersed in pellets 
the nixon administration banned the use of compound 1080 in 
1972 after its widespread use in baited carcasses by ranchers led 
conservationists to protest that it was killing eagles and other 
wildlife 
but pressure from ranchers prompted epa to reverse itself in 
1985 and permit compound 1080 to be used in closed collars on 
sheep coyotes puncture the collar and ingest fatal doses when they 
seize sheep by the neck 
the agency also announced wednesday that it was temporarily 
suspending all licenses for sale of strychnine products at the 
same time the agency said it had temporarily canceled licenses a 
more serious action for sale and aboveground use of all 
pesticides containing strychnine this temporary cancelation is 
effective immediately 
the suspension of strychnine products would halt the sale but 
not the use of the pesticide the temporary cancellation of 
licenses for use of aboveground strychnine halts that products 
use but allows the pesticide to be used below ground 
the squirrels can devastate otherwise productive land and the 
only alternative to strychnine sometimes applied from the air is 
manual application of poisonous phosgene gas in belowground 
burrows 
most strychnine licenses are held by state and local governments 
in the west and the us agriculture department 
the strychnine temporary cancellation complies with the order of 
a federal court in minnesota issued in april requiring the agency 
to halt aboveground use while it developed means to protect 
nontarget species the agency has appealed the order but has lost 
a request for a stay 
the suspensions are the result of failure of state and local 
governments to provide epa with safety data heier said 
except for the strychnine temporary cancellation all the 
actions are effective in 30 days unless license holders request 
hearings if those hearings are held the products may still be 
used

legislation to extend to senate staffers the 
same protection against job discrimination that most american 
workers received 24 years ago was introduced wednesday by sen john 
mccain rariz 
the bill is similar to a measure approved by the house for its 
employees on tuesday 
the house voted 40812 to give the protections of the civil 
rights act of 1964 to the 12137 people who work for house members 
committees or in various capitol offices 
it means that discrimination on the basis of race color 
national origin religion sex handicap or age will be illegal in 
the house 
in introducing the senate bill mccain said such action was 
long long overdue 
for too long the senate has operated under different rules 
from other employers mccain said for too long the senate has 
exempted itself from rules regarding discrimination we need to ask 
ourselves some questions are we fair to our employees is it 
really fair for them not to have the same safeguards that all other 
citizens throughout the country enjoy

the spread of electronic data systems poses 
the need for congress to improve the way the government distributes 
information the congressional office of technology assessment said 
wednesday 
the report said existing laws and the governments methods for 
information dissemination established by congress largely during 
the preelectronic era have been overtaken by technology 
the government is at a crucial point where opportunities 
presented by the information technologies such as productivity and 
costeffectiveness improvements are substantial the agency said 
bibliographic reference statistical and scientific and 
technical information produced by the federal government is 
particularly wellsuited to electronic formats 
but the major federal information systems the government 
printing office document sales program the depository library 
program and the national technical information service are 
limited largely to paper and microfiche 
full use of electronic technologies could help these agencies 
ota said 
what ota tells us in their report is that the methods we 
depend on to transmit information have reached their limits and 
that new technologies are waiting to change the way government 
communicates said rep robert roe dnj chairman of the house 
committee on science space and technology

four americans said wednesday they will 
float dollar bills down the mekong river to spread news of a 24 
million reward for us prisoners of war they say are alive in the 
black hole of laos 
two other americans also from the national steering committee 
for american war veterans were arrested this week while on a 
similar mission 
laotian authorities on sunday arrested donna long 45 of 
jacksonville nc and james copp 43 a vietnam war veteran from 
hampstead nc after they crossed the mekong river in a rented 
boat and landed in a village in laos the river forms the boundary 
with thailand then flows to cambodia and vietnam 
the six four of whom are vietnam war veterans have said they 
hope to trace american prisoners of war they believe are still 
being held in the communist countries of laos cambodia and vietnam 
we call laos the black hole of the mia issue said committee 
chairman ted sampley a former green beret from kingston nc 
the other members of the group are william sullivan of 
jacksonville nc a marine corps veteran of the vietnam war lynn 
hampton of winter haven fla who served in the war as a nurse 
and bruce adams a dentist from laramie wyo 
on thursday the four plan to travel to the northeastern thai 
city of ubon and drop 2000 into the mekong river at the same spot 
from which their colleagues left for laos 
long and copp carried about 3000 as well as other currency 
they planned to drop into the river or give to laotian villagers 
each dollar bill was stamped with the reward offer and wrapped in a 
plastic bag 
the members of the new expedition who say they will not attempt 
to cross the mekong river said long and copp had apparently gone 
above and beyond what we asked them to do 
were not rambo types we did not come over here in any kind 
of militant mode said adams whose brother stephen was declared 
missing in action in laos 22 years ago i dont want my brothers 
bones back i want the flesh and blood that goes with the man 
the us government lists 2393 americans as missing in action 
in cambodia laos and vietnam the three governments deny holding 
any live americans 
but the group which claims the us government has neglected 
the issue says its convinced there are still american pows in 
laos based on reports by refugees of having seen americans and 
other evidence 
sampley said the money the group brought with them was pledged 
by 21 congressmen private individuals and corporate donors 
the group of six were to have traveled together sampley said 
but airline reservations problems forced long and copp to arrive in 
thailand before the others 
ross petzing the us embassy spokesman in bangkok said 
tuesday that long and copp were being held at ban sing samphan in 
the southern laotian province of champasak he could not confirm 
whether they were still in the village or had been moved to the 
capital vientiane 
pornthipa vajarabukka a thai hotel manager said she visited 
long and copp on tuesday in a small house in the village but was 
not allowed to speak to them she said authorities told her monday 
the two would be released within three days 
pornthipa added that she felt responsible for long and copp 
who speak neither thai nor lao because the americans had 
contacted the hotel before their trip across the river 
it was not known if long and copp had floated money down the 
river and details of how they were arrested were not available 
a us embassy official in laos who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said wednesday that the laotian government has not 
responded to an official query about the two americans

iran has agreed to stop searching ships in 
international waters of the persian gulf which it suspects of 
carrying war cargo to iraq sources in the united nations said 
wednesday 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity also said iraq 
agreed to postpone discussing ownership of the disputed 
shattalarab waterway iraqs only outlet to the gulf iran has a 
long gulf coastline with numerous ports 
breakthroughs on these two issues could help end the stalemate 
in the iraniraq peace talks that began aug 25 in geneva the two 
neighbors in the oilrich gulf at war for eight years agreed on 
aug 20 to a unsponsored truce 
the sources said un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
proposed the compromises during talks that began last week with the 
foreign ministers of iran and iraq those talks ended wednesday 
under the proposals iran will no longer stop vessels flying a 
neutral flag in international gulf waters and the strait of hormuz 
and iraq consented to discuss its claims to shattalarab later in 
the negotiations the sources said 
both parties will begin arranging a withdrawal of their forces 
to the internationally recognized border and will discuss 
repatriation of prisoners of war they added 
no announcement of the compromise will be issued until peace 
talks resume in geneva later this month because iraq wants to wait 
and see if tehran honors the agreement the sources said 
in addition perez de cuellar and the iranian and iraqi 
diplomats agreed not to discuss details of their talks while 
progress is being made in negotiations between their lowerranked 
representatives 
iraqs insistence that shattalarab be cleared of sunken ships 
and dredged to remove silt has blocked progress in the talks 
to be taken up later in the peace talks is the issue of whether 
both nations share rights to the waterway under a 1975 treaty or 
whether iraq has sovereignty over the whole passage and both its 
banks the sources reported 
baghdad also complained that irans searching of ships for 
iraqbound war cargo violated a un security council resolution 
calling for the parties to discontinue all military activities on 
land at sea and in the air 
iran held that searching for war cargo was a right that nations 
at war generally are recognized to have 
the iraniraq war broke out in september 1980 when iraqi forces 
invaded western iran after weeks of border skirmishes 
more than 1 million casualties are estimated to have resulted 
from the war

president mikhail s gorbachev cautioned visiting 
romanian leader nicolae ceausescu on wednesday that his maverick 
policies may discredit socialism and the entire east bloc 
gorbachev who has headed the soviet communist party since 1985 
said the notion of socialism will be formed on the basis of 
evaluating the combined experience of socialist nations the 
success of each of them will be a common ideological achievement 
but the failure of any can alas mean a common setback too 
in reply ceausescu lauded the traditions of cooperation and 
revolutionary solidarity between his country and the soviet 
union but asserted romanias right to chart its own political 
course 
one should always bear in mind the fact that the revolutionary 
process is unfolding in each country in different conditions 
ceausescu who heads romanias communist party said 
their remarks at a kremlin luncheon were reported by the 
official soviet news agency tass ceausescu accompanied by his 
wife elena and by romanian officials arrived in moscow on tuesday 
for talks with the soviets 
ceausescu has balked at following gorbachevs social and 
economic reform program known by its russianlanguage name of 
perestroika or restructuring 
gorbachev noted that all the socialist countries have their 
own distinctive features but said common action by the soviet 
union and its allies was necessary 
it is the initiative and identity shown by each fraternal 
country in its contribution to achieving the objectives of their 
concerted policies that broaden the range of socialisms influence 
on international processes he said 
gorbachev also made a pitch for his own economic political and 
social reforms which he said were becoming part of soviet life 
although not as fast as had been hoped 
we see this as the best proof that perestroika will definitely 
succeed he said 
ceausescu has stirred a storm of protest in hungary and 
elsewhere over his plan to raze up to 7000 villages including 
about 800 ethnic hungarian communities and resettle the population 
in socalled agroindustrial centers 
romania has also drawn fire for stalling the 35nation review 
conference on security and cooperation in europe in vienna over 
human rights provisions to be included in a final document 
gorbachev did not refer directly to those disputes but 
mentioned the need for respect for the rights and freedoms of 
each citizen and for the observance of legality and of the 
rule of law 
on his visit to romania in may 1987 gorbachev implicitly 
criticized in a televised speech the nepotism and personality cult 
ceausescu promotes in that country 
he also demanded higherquality goods to be delivered from 
romania where widespread food and energy shortages make life 
difficult for the countrys 25 million people 
ceausescu admitted in a speech monday that romanian industry has 
failed to meet export targets for this year 
one issue likely to be discussed during ceausescus visit is 
romanias desire to obtain more soviet crude oil and raw materials 
in return for romanian wheat meat and agricultural products

chers boyfriend was charged with reckless 
driving and malicious mischief wednesday over a confrontation june 
27 in which his car crashed into a photographers outside the home 
he shares with the actress 
the misdemeanor offenses are less serious than the felony charge 
of assault with a deadly weapon on which rob camilletti 24 was 
booked 
there was insufficient evidence of any attempt of assault 
based on the statements of witnesses said mike qualls spokesman 
for the city attorneys office 
camilletti was driving chers black ferrari when it hit a car 
belonging to peter brandt a photographer for the entertainment 
tabloid star camilletti was released on 2000 bail 
the bagel maker and aspiring actor said he lost control of his 
car while trying to swerve into the driveway to avoid the 
photographers brandt accused camilletti of trying to kill him and 
sued the couple for unspecified damages 
im very pleased that the city attorney understood that i 
never tried to hit the tabloid photographer camiletti said in a 
statement its true that i broke the guys camera and telephone 
after the accident and i intend to reimburse him for that 
with this decision not to file any felony charges i am now 
hopeful that cher and i can get back to some degree of normalcy 
with our lives camilletti said 
i think he should have been charged with assault with a deadly 
weapon no im not pleased with these charges said brandt i 
guess the city attorney thought it was an accident but im glad 
they filed something 
reckless driving carries up to 90 days in jail and a 1000 
fine and the two counts of malicious mischief could bring up to 18 
months in jail and 6000 in fines

tuesday he had signed a contract with stephen mernick of toronto to 
buy the ministrys assets for 115 million benton had identified 
other potential buyers but had not previously gotten to the 
contract stage 
charlotte nc attorney joseph kluttz said his client mernick 
will pay 50 million at closing for the deal and pay the 65 
million balance over five years 
mernick has not said what he plans to do with heritage usa but 
wrote in a sept 15 letter to benton that he would consider 
preserving or enhancing the christian orientation even though 
he is an orthodox jew 
ptl must sell its assets to pay creditors as soon as possible 
under an order from us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds in 
columbia 
bakker who left the now crumbling evangelical empire in march 
1987 amid a sexandmoney scnadal said he would not consider the 
ramifications of a ptl sale until i hear the final gavel of the 
judge 
it still has to be ratified by the judge by the creditors 
and then its still subject to the condition upon transfer of the 
satellite contract which is a nontransferrable contract so 
that has to be approved bakker said 
then mr mernick has 30 days to just walk away with no 
penalties if he wants to bakker said 
that to me is not as strong a deal as i would have liked to 
have seen anybody who can just walk away without losing something 
has a pretty good deal on his side 
benton has said other bidders may present offers directly to the 
bankruptcy court but he said his recommendation gives mernicks 
offer a strong upper hand reynolds is expected to hold a hearing 
on the sale about a month from now 
bakker proposed a 172 million plan to buy the ministrys 
assets but his bid lost credibility last month when he could not 
come up with a 3 million down payment 
convinced he still can put together a deal and eventually 
restore his television ministry bakker has assembled a staff that 
shares his faith 
we know jim and tammy will be restored we just dont know 
what route god will use to accomplish that said lin robertson 
who was answering one of the many phones ringing at the information 
center 
and when they get back to heritage it will be done in such a 
way that everybody will know it was done by the hand of god not by 
the hand of man ms robertson said 
god is moving on jims behalf said joyce lebaron referring 
to the bakkers hopedfor return to television 
were really not concerned about mr mernick were not upset 
about it at all said peggy licata its just an interim 
thing

a student who failed an economics test 
twice but made good class grades is suing the university of central 
florida to either receive a masters degree in business 
administration or get her 5000 tuition back 
after paying all my dues and having a good average i just 
feel abused said nora roth 48 i really dont want their 
money i just want what i earned which is a masters degree 
the dean of the schools college of business clifford eubanks 
defended the test format that requires students to review all the 
material they have learned finance management marketing and 
economics 
after passing the three other parts of the test mrs roth 
failed the economics section she hired a tutor crammed for 
another semester and took the test again but failed once more 
mrs roth who commuted 100 miles roundtrip for two years from 
cocoa beach to the orlando school for classes filed suit last week 
with the help of her husband kenneth who is a lawyer 
she alleged the test is unfair because each of the business 
schools economics professors hold different theories and place 
emphasis on different facets of the subject her test was prepared 
by a professor she did not study under and included material she 
had never studied she contended 
eubanks said tuesday the comprehensive test is common at 
colleges across the country 
most of the schools mba candidates are parttime students 
eubanks said and they spend up to five years earning the degree a 
comprehensive test ensures that students retain the material they 
learned at the beginning he said 
eubanks said it was not uncommon for students to fail the test 
several times and that mrs roth can take it again

in the soviet union a theft is committed every 40 
seconds on the average one rape every hour and a premeditated 
murder every 90 minutes the government newspaper izvestia reported 
wednesday 
izvestia made the figures public in an article marking the 70th 
anniversary of the ministry of interiors criminal investigation 
department in charge of tracking down crime suspects 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs campaign for 
glasnost or openness more is becoming known about crime a 
subject once virtually taboo in the staterun media 
as one example radio moscow revealed in march that 9000 people 
were murdered in the country in 1987 
extrapolating from the figures printed by izvestia which the 
paper said came from the criminal investigation department 2160 
thefts 24 rapes and 16 murders take place in the soviet union on 
an average day 
on a yearly basis that would total 788400 thefts 8760 rapes 
and 5840 premeditated murders for the nation as a whole 
detailed crime incidence reports are still not made public in 
the soviet union but officials in moscow maintain that violent 
crime is far less of a problem than in the united states they cite 
the small number of privately owned firearms as one major reason

slightly better lead 
both surveys found many voters expressing concern about bushs 
running mate sen dan quayle of indiana

voters had an error margin of about four points 
in the other survey a harris poll conducted last week the 
republicans won support from 49 percent of 1235 likely voters to 
46 percent for the democrats it also was a dead heat given the 
threepoint margin of error 
a harris poll early last month put the race a bit wider at 
5044 with bush and quayle ahead similarly a cbs newsnew york 
times poll released tuesday put the race at 4846 tightened from

the state department on wednesday dismissed as 
pure fantasy an assertion by an iranian opposition leader that 
the reagan administration secretly negotiated with tehran for the 
release of american hostages in lebanon 
there have been no negotiations no direct contacts between 
the united states and iranian officials said spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley there may be private individuals who misrepresented 
themselves as speaking on behalf of the us government they are 
not 
former iranian president abolhassan banisadr said tuesday in 
paris that richard lawless a former us official had negotiated 
on behalf of vice president george bush with a representative of 
iranian parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
in reply mrs oakley said we have flatly denied anyone is 
speaking on behalf of the us government 
lawless president of a washingtonbased trade investment firm 
known as usasia denied through a business partner that he had 
engaged in any talks with iranians about the hostages 
in a statement lawless relayed through partner therese shaheen 
he said i categorically deny and state for the record that i 
am involved either directly or indirectly in any discussions or 
negotiations with any party related to attempts to secure the 
release of hostages in lebanon 
ms shaheen said lawless can produce passport and charge card 
travel records that prove he was not in that part of the world 
during the time that banisadr says he was involved lawless is a 
former state department employee who served in seoul south korea 
vienna austria and tokyo japan ms shaheen said 
the new york times and the washington times quoting sources 
they did not identify reported wednesday that lawless worked for 
the cia at the us embassy in seoul in the 1970s during the same 
period bushs national security adviser donald gregg served with 
the cia in korea 
in addition the new york times quoted an unidentified former 
government official as saying that lawless had worked in the cias 
operations directorate until several years ago 
the state departments biographic register said in its 1974 
edition that lawless had worked as an area analyst for the 
pentagon and the state department 
mrs oakley said the united states had urged other governments 
to use their influence to secure the release of the nine americans 
held in lebanon by proiranian bands 
but she said none of the messages exchanged between the us and 
iranian governments through other countries dealt specifically with 
releasing the hostages 
that would involve dealings negotiations the spokeswoman 
said there have been no negotiations on this issue 
asked if lawless or any other private individual had negotiated 
with iran mrs oakley said i dont know of anybody who has done 
that but that doesnt exclude the possibility that there may be 
somebody out there as we speak who says im speaking for the 
us government im just trying to be very prudent and cautious 
but i dont know of any names of anyone who is doing this 
she added only us government officials are authorized to 
speak on this matter and none have 
her immediate comment on banisadrs assertions were two blunt 
words pure fantasy 
with the arrival of mithileshwar singh a freed indian hostage 
at the us military hospital in wiesbaden west germany and a 
lack of indications the nine americans would be released a state 
department task force set up monday to deal with the situation was 
disbanded tuesday evening 
president reagan talking to reporters said he has heard 
nothing to indicate other hostages might soon be set free we 
desperately are hoping continuing to try he said 
but he also said ive never been able to explain the 
iranians what their strategies are and what they do but obviously 
we could not do any negotiating with them unless and until the 
hostages are released 
mrs oakley said singh a legal us resident would travel to 
the united states after a thorough medical examination in 
wiesbaden but his plans had not jelled 
she said a preliminary checkup in damascus where he had been 
taken by syrian forces after his release monday in beirut 
confirmed he had previously known problems of diabetes 
hypertension and possible coronary artery disease and had lost a 
considerable amount of weight and muscle mass during his 20month 
captivity 
he was treated with appropriate medicines is in good spirits 
and has traveled well mrs oakley said of the 60yearold 
chairman of the business administration department at the beirut 
university college 
singh had been held by the islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine nine americans three britons an irishman an italian 
and a belgian remain in captivity in lebanon according to the 
state departments office for counterterrorism three of the 
americans are believed held by the group that freed singh

going blind waiting for permission to legally use marijuana and a 
federal official acknowledged wednesday that the application 
procedure is complicated 
elvy musikka was tried in august on charges of growing marijuana 
plants in her back yard she and her physician successfully argued 
that using the drug was the only way to relieve glaucomas pressure 
on her eyes 
after her arrest she applied to the food and drug 
administration for a federal program to receive pot legally for 
medical treatments 
that was six months ago tuesday she said she is already blind 
in the right eye and slowly losing the remaining sight in her left 
eye waiting for her application to be processed 
faye peterson a spokeswoman for the fda in washington said by 
law she cannot discuss details of ms musikkas case but she noted 
that even the drug enforcement administration is involved in 
clearing applications 
it not only involves this agency it involves the dea and the 
national institute on drug abuse she said its not just a 
simple matter of saying fda give us permission 
appearing with ms mussika at her news conference was 
stockbroker irvin rosenfeld who suffers from a rare disease that 
causes tumors to grow in his bones marijuana enhances the 
medication he takes and helps ease the pain he is one of only two 
broward residents permitted to use the drug legally 
i know how many hours it takes to fill out the paperwork 
said rosenfeld this is how they put me off for 5 years 
since her acquittal by broward circuit judge mark polen ms 
musikka said she has been getting marijuana when she can from 
friends its either that or lose her remaining sight she said 
anyone thats helping me now is breaking the law she said 
theyre human people compassionate people who care 
bob randall is president of the alliance for cannabis 
therapeutics a washingtonbased organization that helps people 
legally get marijuana for medical purposes 
we are publicly watching a human being go blind because of an 
unresponsive federal government said randall who won the legal 
right to use marijuana to treat his glaucoma 12 years ago 
he said it could take a lawsuit against the fda to force action 
on ms mussikas application 
ms musikka was born with congenital cataracts and developed 
glaucoma as she grew up glaucoma the leading cause of blindness 
in the united states increases pressure on the eyeball and optic 
nerve and causes a progressive loss of sight

a comprehensive settlement in central 
america will be impossible to achieve without an understanding 
between the united states and soviet union the foreign minister of 
honduras said wednesday 
carlos lopez contreras said a major defect of the central 
american peace plan signed aug 7 1987 is its assumption that the 
five nations involved could solve their own problems 
the minister termed this view as simplistic and said in an 
interview the only reason honduras endorsed the plan was to avoid 
being portrayed as an obstacle to peace 
lopez contreras made his statements one day after he spoke to 
the un general assembly and urged the creation of an 
international peace force to evict the usbacked contra rebels 
from honduran territory 
thousands of rebels have settled in the border area since 
congress ended military aid to the contras earlier this year 
the foreign minister proposed that military units from spain 
canada and west germany carry out the evacuation using force if 
necessary 
his proposal appeared to represent a break with reagan 
administration policy but the state department said it was 
reviewing the plan with an open mind 
we will give the honduran proposal serious consideration 
said state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said in 
washington 
even if a peacekeeping force is agreed to such a force only 
would represent a partial solution lopez contreras said 
we cannot stop the soviets from supplying arms to the 
sandinistas he said that is an issue that has to be addressed 
by the united states 
if there is not a minimum of understanding between them it is 
going to be absolutely impossible to reach any kind of settlement 
in central america lopez contreras declared 
he said international organizations such as the united nations 
cannot expect honduras by itself to resolve a problem created in 
part by superpower policies 
the soviet position reiterated in talks in washington last 
month is that the kremlin would cease arms deliveries to nicaragua 
if the united states suspends lethal aid to its allies in central 
america the reagan administration has rejected that proposal 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze of the soviet union said 
after his talks in washington on sept 23 that the gap between the 
two countries positions had not narrowed 
assistant secretary of state elliott abrams is expected to hold 
additional discussions with soviet officials on central america 
later this month

republican dan quayle and democrat lloyd 
bentsen prepared wednesday for their primetime debate each man 
eager to aid his presidential ticket and trade in his senate seat 
for the vice presidency 
debate sponsors looked for a television audience in the 
millions presidential standardbearers george bush and michael 
dukakis among them 
for the 67yearold bentsen and the 41yearold quayle the 
stakes couldnt be higher in a presidential campaign that remained 
too close to call one poll suggested that the indiana senators 
presence on the republican ticket was working against bush 
republicans hoped quayle could reassure voters that he has the 
maturity and qualifications to serve as vice president democrats 
looked to bentsen to attract undecided moderate and conservative 
democrats to dukakis side 
bentsen and quayle both spent the day in final preparations 
taking a close look at the stage where they would face off for 
their 90minute televised encounter 
were ready said quayle youre going to see dan quayle 
as he really is 
bentsen said he was feeling great asked what he would try 
to accomplish in the debate he replied simply win 
the 10000seat omaha civic auditorium was condensed into a 
2000seat theater decorated in red white and blue for the debate 
just 100 of the seats were available to the public the rest 
reserved by the campaigns 
the two camps flew dozens of highprofile supporters to omaha to 
provide immediate postdebate partisan analysis of the encounter 
including many senate colleagues of bentsen and quayle 
bush campaigning in colorado declared he was not worried a 
bit about quayles performance dukakis spent the day at the 
statehouse in boston and said the public would see a very strong 
thoughtful mature senator lloyd bentsen a slap at quayles 
youthfulness 
the vice presidential confrontation was the second of three 
planned debates in the fall campaign dukakis and bush squared off 
late last month in north carolina and are expected to meet again 
late next week at a site to be determined probably los angeles 
with the republicans owning a slight edge in the polls in the 
race for the white house quayle was hoping to use the debate to 
reassure the voters that his youth is not a liability bentsen and 
the democrats have sought to depict the indiana senator as an 
inexperienced young man illequipped to be a heartbeat away from 
the presidency 
polls have indicated quayle is a drag on the republican ticket 
a cbs poll released earlier in the week suggested that bush had a 
slightly larger lead over dukakis when voters were queried only 
about the top of the ticket 
a pair of surveys released wednesday reiterated those concerns 
an abc newswashington post survey conducted from sept 28 through 
tuesday put the race at 5144 with the republican ticket in the 
numerical lead 
a harris poll conducted last week gave the republican ticket a 
4946 lead 
however the abcpost survey showed that 40 percent of the 
people believed quayle to be qualified to become vice president 
compared with 67 percent for bentsen the harris survey said a 
third believed quayle to be qualified to be president if that 
became necessary and bentsen beat quayle 5937 when voters were 
asked their preference for vice president 
the abcpost survey of 1196 had an error margin of about four 
points the harris survey sept 2429 of 1235 likely voters had an 
error margin of three points 
while quayles youth and his vietnamera service in the national 
guard have made him a controversial candidate bentsen has had to 
fend off questions about the numerous differences between his own 
moderate views and those of dukakis 
quayle has said he was eager to prove himself to the viewing 
voters 
the american people dont know me he said tuesday as he 
traveled to omaha with a host of top bush strategists including 
media adviser roger ailes they have a lot of questions they 
dont have any details of who dan quayle is 
both men prepared carefully for the encounter reading thick 
briefing books enduring sessions with their handlers and 
participating in mock debates 
oregon republican sen bob packwood played the role of bentsen 
in quayles practice sessions rep dennis eckart of ohio played 
the role of quayle for bentsens workouts 
while presidential debates have become more or less a familiar 
landmark on the campaign trail televised vice presidential 
encounters are rare 
only two previous such confrontations have been held the first 
one in 1976 between democrat walter f mondale and gop bob dole 
and the second one four years ago between bush and democrat 
geraldine ferraro 
as the two vice presidential candidates squared off the ad wars 
continued 
a new set of 30second dukakis ads to be aired nationally 
starting wednesday made a more direct attack on bush and his record 
on drug enforcement education the environment and social 
security the four ads said the administration dealt secretly with 
manuel antonio noriega the panamanian drug lord bush 
personally weakened environmental regulations personally 
cast the tiebreaking vote to cut social security and sat by 
while college loans for working families were cut

a former state department employee denied 
emphatically wednesday an iranian opposition leaders assertion 
that he was involved in negotiating a release of american hostages 
in lebanon 
in a statement released by the coowner of his trade and 
investment consulting firm here richard lawless said i 
categorically deny and state for the record that i am involved 
either directly or indirectly in any discussions or negotiations 
on the nine hostages 
former iranian president abolhassan banisadr said tuesday in 
paris that lawless had negotiated in behalf of vice president 
george bush with a representative of iranian parliament speaker 
hashemi rafsanjani in an attempt to get american hostages 
liberated 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater and state department 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley both denied that anyone had been engaged 
in such negotiations with iranians or iranian government figures 
under us auspices or that lawless is a government employee 
hes not operating under our instruction or direction or 
anything like that fitzwater said of lawless what is private 
status is i dont know 
lawless was in his office wednesday but therese shaheen a 
coowner of the business spoke on his behalf in an interview 
she said they felt lawless reputation had been harmed by 
banisadrs allegations made after hostage mithileshwar singh an 
indianborn us resident was released from 20 months of captivity 
by proiranian forces 
lawless said in the statement that i have never in my entire 
life had any direct or indirect contact with any iranian government 
officials or any iranian nationals claiming to represent the 
iranian government or any iranianrelated interests 
banisadr had said lawless was attempting to negotiate the 
release of the hostages on bushs behalf last week an israeli 
newspaper the nation said us government officials were engaged 
in secret talks with iranians in geneva aimed at setting the 
hostages free and improving relations between the united states and 
iran 
banisadr also said a shipment of arms furnished by the united 
states was destined for iran 
those charges are not true fitzwater said banisadr is 
full of beans 
president reagan and other administration officials have 
repeatedly denied that any such direct talks are taking place or 
have taken place 
lawless president of the consulting firm usasia also said 
i deny that i have any active relationship with anyone on the 
staff of vice president bush or the bush campaign organization 
which relates in any way to this or any similar issue 
i have maintained this position in numerous discussions he 
said 
lawless worked for the cia at the us embassy in seoul south 
korea between 1973 and 1975 the same years that bushs national 
security adviser donald gregg served for the cia at that mission 
the washington times reported wednesday 
gregg however has seen lawless fewer than a halfdozen times 
since 1975 and only in social settings the newspaper quoted its 
sources as saying 
the new york times which also reported wednesday that lawless 
had served in the us embassy in south korea when gregg was there 
quoted an unidentified former government official that lawless had 
worked in the cias operations directorate until several years ago 
spokesmen for bush the republican presidential nominee have 
said that lawless has no relationship with bush or with the 
election campaign 
we never confirm or deny cia allegations of employment said 
bill devine a spokesman for the intelligence agency 
ms shaheen said that we showed richards passport plane 
tickets and so forth in an attempt to dissuade cbs news from 
reporting his purported activities on behalf of the hostages but 
the network broadcast the report earlier this week 
he couldnt possibly have been there taking part in any 
discussions about the hostages she said of lawless so banisadr 
said he lawless knows a couple people in the bush campaign 
it was like two and two make a thousand we think it is 
politically inspired by iran 
lawless is a former state department employee who was described 
as an area analyst beginning in june 1972 he went to seoul in 
1973 according to a biographic register published by the 
department 
ms shaheen said lawless also had assignments at the us 
embassies in vienna and tokyo before founding the consulting 
business 
primarily our business is in the far east she said 90 
percent of it 
the story here is why are the iranians fabricating this 
story she said because that is the story here because they 
have nothing to prove their allegations 
its the biggest hoax since whatever she said

nicaragua expressed strong interest 
wednesday in a honduran proposal for creation of an international 
peace force to oversee the removal of nicaraguan rebels from 
honduran territory 
nicaraguas foreign minister miguel descoto told the 
associated press in an interview that he requested an urgent 
meeting with un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and 
honduran foreign minister carlos lopez contreras to discuss the 
proposal 
lopez contreras recommended in a speech to the general assembly 
tuesday night that military forces from canada spain and west 
germany be sent to honduras to carry out the proposed mission 
lopez contreras said the peace force would be asked to evict 
salvadoran rebels from honduras as well as the ussupported 
nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
we would like to give him the benefit of the doubt descoto 
said adding that honduras has made such proposals before but never 
followed up on them 
at least 10000 nicaraguan insurgents have settled along the 
honduran side of the countrys border with nicaragua since the us 
congress suspended military aid to the rebels last february they 
depend on us assistance for their survival 
in washington state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
the administration will give the honduran proposal serious 
consideration 
the contras use of honduran territory as a springboard for 
attacks inside nicaragua has produced numerous crossborder clashes 
between the two countries over the years 
descoto said he canceled plans to leave new york thursday 
morning so he can pursue the honduran initiative he said he is 
willing to remain until a viable and acceptable request is made 
to the united nations by the secretarygeneral 
he said lopez conteras made a similar proposal to the 
organization of american states last november but that honduras did 
not press the matter 
the reagan administration has said for years that military 
pressure by the contras is necessary to ensure democracy in 
nicaragua the dismantling of the contras would almost certainly 
lead to the consolidation of the leftist sandinista government and 
to an escalation of its efforts to undermine its neighbors the 
administration has maintained 
descoto said nicaragua has long favored establishment of a 
verification commission to ensure that each central american 
country does not interfere with its neighbors 
lopez contreras said in an interview with the ap earlier 
wednesday that even if a peace force is agreed to it would 
represent only a partial solution 
he said one main source of honduran concern is continued soviet 
military aid to the sandinista government which us officials 
have estimated at 400 million for the first eight months of 1988 
we cannot stop the soviets from supplying arms to the 
sandinistas lopez contreras said that is an issue that has to 
be addressed by the united states 
he said that without a minimum of understanding between the 
superpowers it is going to be absolutely impossible to reach any 
kind of settlement in central america

the government has tentatively settled a 
lawsuit charging the cia used nine canadians as human guinea pigs 
in mindcontrol research that included heavy doses of lsd lawyers 
in the case said wednesday 
the tentative outofcourt settlement negotiated by attorneys 
for the canadians and the justice department was announced on the 
eve of trial at a hearing before us district judge john garrett 
penn who has presided over the case for eight years 
neither side would discuss the amount of the proposed 
settlement which is still subject to final approval by toplevel 
justice department officials but sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the cia agreed to pay the plaintiffs a total of 
750000 
the proposed settlement amounts to a statement that every part 
of our government is under the law that no part of our government 
is above the law said james turner the plaintiffs lead 
attorney 
this is a case of principle and that principle has been won 
here he added 
the 9 million lawsuit claimed that ciafinanced research into 
mindcontrol left permanent psychological or emotional damage on 
the nine patients who underwent treatment in the late 1950s at the 
allan memorial institute of mcgill university in montreal 
the research conducted by the institutes director the late dr 
ewen cameron included weeklong sleep induced by drugs doses of 
lsd and unusually intense electroshock therapy 
only two of the plaintiffs were given lsd during the period the 
cia financed camerons research but cameron gave the drug to 
several others during other visits to the institute 
all the patients underwent treatment that yale university 
psychiatrist robert jay lifton described in a deposition as 
deviating from the standard and customary psychiatric therapies 
of the period 
the treatments also included sensory deprivation and what 
cameron called psychic driving the repeated playing of 
recorded messages into a patients ear for 16 hours 
other experts deposed by lawyers in the case questioned the 
effectiveness and safety of the treatments but the government has 
contended that camerons work was well within the accepted bounds 
of professional conduct 
the cia began researching the effects of lsd and other 
mindaltering substances in 1953 under project mkultra to counter 
brainwashing techniques believed to have been developed in the 
soviet union and china 
lsd was not then a wellknown drug in the west and cia officials 
feared that communist bloc nations would use it to alter the 
behavior of american diplomats 
the 1953 suicide of dr frank olson who was among a group of 
cia and army scientists who were given afterdinner liquors laced 
with lsd prompted the agency to conduct further research with 
unwitting subjects under stricter medical controls 
two years later the cia founded the society for the 
investigation of human ecology as a front to finance medical 
research on unsuspecting subjects cameron received nearly 60000 
from the organization between 1957 and 1960 
stanford university psychiatrist harvey weinstein said his 
82yearold father still remains a shadow of the man he was 
when he sought treatment for anxiety at camerons clinic 
once a very dynamic successful montreal businessman lou 
weinstein came home from the hospital as somebody who doesnt 
know who he is or what he is or where he is the son said in a 
telephone interview 
the man who came out of the hospital was a stranger dr 
weinstein said 
the elder weinstein gradually improved but not until after he 
sold his dress manufacturing business said the psychiatrist whose 
book father son and cia was recently published in canada 
the government contended in court papers that cameron did not 
know he was receiving cia money though the plaintiffs argue that 
he was aware of cia interest and sought the research grants 
an internal cia investigation of project mkultra in 1957 
concluded that some of the research activities are considered to 
be professionally unethical and in some instances border on the 
illegal 
but the plaintiffs contend that the officials who supervised the 
project were allowed to continue their work unsupervised and 
unreprimanded despite this finding 
the lawsuit was originally filed by nine plaintiffs but earlier 
this year penn dismissed the claim of dr mary morrow because she 
had filed her claim too late 
but turner said morrow would receive a share of the settlement 
with the remaining plaintiffs morrow was placed in the treatment 
program after she had applied to cameron for a research fellowship 
at the institute 
during the brief hearing before penn assistant us attorney 
john o birch stressed that the settlement was still subject to 
negotiation pending final justice department approval 
we are going to make a recommendation in the very near 
future birch told penn who granted a request by both sides to 
postpone thursdays start of the trial to give the justice 
department time to review the details of the tentative deal 
its a not over til the fat lady sings situation and she 
hasnt sung birch said 
but turner told penn to say that it is till in negotiation is 
not my understanding of the posture the lawyer later told 
reporters that he was assured that it was very unlikely the justice 
department would reject the settlement 
turner praised cia director william websters very important 
role in reaching the agreement to settle the case

military street patrols killed seven more 
looters in rangoon and mandalay bringing the number of people 
slain since the sept 18 military coup to about 440 the state 
radio reported wednesday 
rangoon radio said the shootings occurred tuesday it and other 
official media have described most of those killed since the coup 
as looters or other destructive elements 
soldiers are imposing strict rules against public gatherings and 
looting vendors gamblers and others who once crowded the 
sidewalks of rangoon have disappeared 
civil servants and factory workers reported to their jobs for 
the third day but many left by early afternoon apparently because 
of a lack of work in ministries and state enterprises crippled by a 
long general strike all government employees were ordered back to 
work monday under threat of dismissal 
two new youth organizations the peoples youth federation and 
the all burma united youth organizations registered as political 
parties wednesday with a commission that is to supervise elections 
the political leanings of the two groups were not immediately known 
three main opposition political parties have registered the 
democracy party national league for democracy and peoples 
democracy party but have not said whether they will participate 
in the elections 
burmas most powerful party widely believed to be backed by the 
new government has not registered because of its complicated 
position party sources said wednesday 
the national unity party under another name was the only legal 
party for 26 years of repressive military rule and operated with 
government funds it has been ordered to divest itself of 
government assets like all other parties 
party sources said this would prove difficult because the 
organization formerly called the burma socialist program party 
had substantial holdings in real estate and other fixed assets 
acquired all or in part from government funding 
under a sept 27 decree political parties that use state funds 
vehicles and other property cannot apply for registration 
financing for the burma socialist program party included 10 
million to 133 million annually in government funds 
western diplomats say gen saw maung and his new government back 
the national unity party but are observing legal requirements in an 
attempt to quiet antigovernment feelings

police torpedoed a planned second day of sitins 
and arrests at abortion clinics wednesday by impounding a bus and 
increasing security at clinics where 343 were arrested a day 
earlier 
fourteen protesters were arrested and at least three were 
dragged to police vans most demonstrators however limited 
activities to praying and singing hymns 
city solicitor raines carter said the 14 arrested wednesday were 
charged with giving a false name unlawful assembly and refusing to 
obey a police officer 
some of the protesters arrested tuesday began posting bond 
wednesday after identifying themselves protest organizers have 
encouraged those arrested to call themselves only baby john doe 
or baby jane doe and remain in jail 
the bus was impounded as it took demonstrators from a silent 
vigil at one clinic to a demonstration at another 
the officer determined the bus to be unsafe for operation 
when it was stopped there was smoke coming out and it was crowded 
with too many people said police spokeswoman myrna may she said 
she did not know how many were aboard 
protesters on tuesday complained that police treated them with 
unnecessary harshness twisting arms and fingers and using 
pressurepoint holds just under the ears to force them into buses 
some screamed or cried as they were taken away and four were 
treated for apparently minor injuries 
george napper atlanta commissioner of public safety said he 
believed there were isolated arrests in which police could have 
acted more gently but that he thought the overall reaction was 
justified 
demonstrators on wednesday arrived gradually at the feminist 
womens health clinic where police arrested one for trying to jump 
a barricade and two others for assaulting a woman trying to enter 
the clinic maj ww holley said 
about 50 police including several on horses were posted at the 
small clinic 
on tuesday night about 75 people at an antiabortion rally 
stayed behind for tactical training and said they would take part 
in wednesdays action and face arrest but fewer than that were in 
evidence at the clinic 
joseph foreman a leader of operation rescue which is 
organizing a week of attempts to close atlanta abortion clinics 
said demonstrators would try to cross police lines only if we see 
a woman preparing to go in and kill her child 
he claimed the police lines kept women out so there is no 
need for us to risk arrest he said 
lynne randall the clinic director denied that the 
demonstration is stopping abortions and said the protesters were 
acting like thugs 
she said several patients had arrived at the clinic they 
might postpone it she said our appointment numbers are the 
same they are just distributed differently she said the clinic 
usually sees 10 to 50 patients a day 
around midday at least two women were ushered into the clinic 
foreman contended both were actually employees trying to give the 
impression that the clinic was operating 
police announced last week that they would use rougher tactics 
on demonstrators this week than they did during the democratic 
national convention in july when operation rescue first organized 
protests in atlanta 
during those demonstrations and several that followed during the 
summer more than 750 people were arrested hundreds refused to 
identify themselves making it impossible to free them on bond and 
causing crowded jails 
many of the 360 jailed tuesday used similar tactics 
napper said wednesdays rougher arrests and an injunction 
limiting demonstrators activities were partly responsible for 
wednesdays low turnout 
he said the department has had to pull officers from other 
assignments and close the police academy and put recruits on the 
job to protect the clinics

a prison warden and his wife 
escaped an ira assassination attempt wednesday because a bomb 
planted in the undercarriage of their car failed to explode 
the attempt on thomas murtaghs life was made a day after brian 
armour 48 vice president of the prison officers association was 
killed by an ira bomb that blew up his car as he drove through 
protestant east belfast 
in a statement released to local media the outlawed irish 
republican army said a 2pound bomb did not explode as planned 
while murtagh 46 and his wife drove away from their home in 
lisburn 7 miles southwest of belfast 
it said when the murtaghs parked the car in a shopping center 
lot attempts to detonate the explosive were abandoned to avoid 
any danger to civilians 
today murtagh was lucky the statement said he and his 
cohorts will not always be so lucky 
the ira accused murtagh of repressive measures against irish 
nationalist prisoners and said he was responsible for the 
stripsearching of female inmates when he ran armagh prison in the 
early 1980s 
police would not confirm that murtagh now warden of the 
hydepark center for young offenders in belfast was the target of 
wednesdays bomb a spokesman said only that the latemodel honda 
belonged to the wife of a prison officer 
murtagh and his wife were in a shopping center department store 
at midday when a telephone caller told a radio station about the 
bomb the police spokesman said 
a british army bomb squad destroyed the device in a controlled 
explosion about 2 hours later he said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the terrorists must have been aware when they planted the 
device that the vehicle could have been used by any member of the 
family the police spokesman said 
the ira is fighting to drive the british from northern ireland 
and unite the predominately protestant province with the irish 
republic which is predominantly roman catholic 
its statement claimed guerrillas got through tight security 
around murtaghs home to plant the bomb the house is about 150 
yards from a british army barracks 
according to the ira the bombs planted tuesday and wednesday 
contained an explosive made in czechoslovakia called semtex 
police believe the ira obtained the lightweight odorless 
explosive through libya the explosive has featured prominently in 
attacks this year on security forces and commercial targets

a 3yearold boy who shot and killed his father 
as the man beat the childs mother said afterward he would have 
done it again 
i killed him the boy reportedly said afterward now hes 
dead if he would have hit my mother i would have shot him again 
prosecutors said tuesday they wont take any legal measures 
against the child who wasnt identified because he couldnt have 
acted intentionally 
we feel that this is an act that a 3yearold cannot 
contemplate ron schigur head of the wayne county prosecutors 
office juvenile division said tuesday i mean he cant form any 
kind of intent 
there just doesnt seem to be any reason to pursue it 
the boys mother who spoke tuesday on condition neither she nor 
her son be identified said it was an accident it just 
happened 
the boy now 4 shot and killed sherwood cannon 47 on june 18 
the decision on what to do about the case was delayed pending the 
results of toxicology tests said assistant prosecutor david wolock 
the tests showed cannon had a blood alcohol level of 008 
percent at the time of the shooting just above michigans legal 
level of impairment 
detroit homicide detectives at first refused to believe the 
youngster could have fired the gun but they said gunpowder residue 
tests showed the child was the only one in the room who did fire a 
gun 
the citys top homicide investigator inspector gerald stewart 
said it would be unusual for a toddler to have the strength to pull 
a trigger stewart said detectives gave the boy the weapon 
unloaded asking him to show how he used it 
we checked to see if that was possible stewart said it 
was 
according to the police report cannon and his 25yearold 
girlfriend the boys mother were having a barbecue at their home 
when the woman changed a musical tape cannon had been playing 
cannon became angry saying she was making a fool out of him 
the report said he began grabbing and pushing the woman and went 
and got a 25caliber automatic he kept hidden from the children 
the 3yearold was among at least four children in the house who 
were watching the latenight fight the report said 
cannon walked into the room with the gun but set it on a table 
saying he didnt need it he then grabbed his girlfriend threw her 
to the floor and held her down as she yelled he was hurting her 
a shot was fired and cannon asked who got shot 
then he said its me 
cannon fell over mortally wounded in the back 
two other adults and three of the children in the room told 
police the boy had picked up the gun aimed it at his father and 
fired 
the boys mother said tuesday he had cried a little after the 
shooting and then fell asleep for a while that night at police 
headquarters the boy smiled and posed for a polaroid photo that 
homicide detectives often take of suspects a detective let the boy 
keep one 
his mother said she considered counseling for her son 
especially after his preschool teacher said he had been having 
crying spells but she didnt get around to it because the family 
moved after the shooting

nearly 1000 kurdish refugees returned to 
iraq on wednesday as the deadline neared for a government amnesty 
two months after they fled to turkey claiming iraq dropped chemical 
bombs on their settlements 
the 966 kurds were taken by bus and truck from a tent city in 
yuksekova to a border post in habur and then across a bridge over 
the tigris river into iraq 
they were among 60000 kurds who flocked to five tent cities in 
southeastern turkey last august during an army offensive against 
kurdish rebels in the mountains of northeastern iraq 
regional gov hayri kozakcioglu told a news conference another 
group of kurdish refugees numbering 1500 was due to be 
transferred to iraq thursday he said iraq assured the turkish 
government the refugees will be safely settled back in the villages 
iraq on sept 6 proclaimed a general and comprehensive 
amnesty for the kurds at the urging of turkey iraq has said that 
thousands accepted the amnesty but only a few were confirmed to 
have returned 
the deadline for the amnesty is thursday evening foreign 
ministry spokesman inal batu said turkey is trying to persuade iraq 
to extend the amnesty period 
batu told reporters in ankara the kurdish refugees signed papers 
saying they were returning home voluntarily under terms of the 
amnesty 
returning refugees said that when they left their villages the 
danger was very real 
when the iraqi planes came to our villages dropping chemical 
bombs we had no other chance but to escape said eyup seydu a 
38yearold refugee but i decided to go back after the amnesty 
i am not afraid i have done nothing wrong 
iraq has denied it used chemical weapons against the kurds 
though it has acknowledged using such weapons in its 8yearold war 
with iran 
suleyman fettah 61 who was returning to his village of rekani 
in northern iraq with his 14member family said he never wanted to 
leave his village and that kurdish guerrillas forced us to flee 
the wednesday group included 501 children and 245 women the 
refugees carrying a few belongings such as blankets or mattresses 
looked exhausted after the 20hour trip to the border aboard 16 
buses and four trucks 
turkey initially asked the international red cross to supervise 
the kurds return but the red cross declined after iraq refused to 
grant its request for further guarantees on behalf of the refugees 
the kurds 20 million people living in a region where the 
borders of turkey iran and iraq converge have been fighting for 
independence for the past century 
the latest rebellion led by massoud barzani president of the 
kurdish democratic party in alliance with jamal talabanis 
patriotic union of kurdistan tried to take advantage of the 
iraniraq war 
but after an aug 20 ceasefire in the war iraq sent seasoned 
troops against the kurds

clarence carnes a career criminal who 
gained notoriety for a failed escape attempt from alcatraz in 1946 
that resulted in seven deaths has died in prison here he was 61 
officials at the medical center for federal prisoners said 
wednesday that a preliminary autopsy revealed complications 
relating to kidney problems that could have led to carnes death 
monday 
at age 18 carnes who had the nickname choctaw kid became 
the youngest prisoner ever incarcerated at alcatraz the nowclosed 
federal prison on an island in san francisco bay in 1945 
the next year he was drawn into a daring escape plot that 
quickly went awry two guards were killed and several were wounded

one cell house 
marines on their way home from okinawa helped prison guards from 
as far away as leavenworth kan retake the prison 
when it was over three prisoners were dead two others miran 
edgar thompson and sam shockley were later executed carnes was 
spared the death penalty because he refused to murder several 
guards he was assigned to kill 
carnes spent the next six years in a cell adjoining robert 
stroud the birdman of alcatraz stroud had donated 200 to the 
defense fund for carnes shockley and thompson from royalties from

holdup 
carnes was released to federal parole on dec 21 1973 he lived 
in the kansas city area after that but his parole was revoked

transplant after collapsing during rigorous training was showing 
signs of emerging from a coma his family said wednesday 
pittsfield mayor ann everest wojtkowski said the family of 
timothy shepard told her the 25yearold pittsfield police cadet 
had been able to recognize his mother and pregnant wife and respond 
to questions by shaking his head 
asked whether he was out of the coma sisterinlaw becky 
shepard told the associated press its hard to say its a slow 
process coming out of a coma she added there are signs that 
hes coming out though 
spokesmen at the pittsburgh hospital where shepard is being 
treated would only say that shepard remains in critical condition 
after undergoing a liver transplant last week 
the mayor said doctors have been able to remove shepard from a 
respirator for brief periods 
a total of 16 cadets were hospitalized for dehydration and 
exhaustion after shepard collapsed on the first day of training 
sept 19 
the agawam academy was closed on the third day of training and 
classes were moved until the drinking water could be checked it 
was found untainted and all the cadets except shepard have since

academies as is a special 11member state house committee 
john callahan a former district attorney and past president of

the supreme court cleared the way 
wednesday for democratic elections to be held in pakistan on nov 
16 
benazir bhuttos opposition pakistan peoples party is widely 
expected to win at least a simple majority in any freely held 
elections 
the court removed the last hurdle in the way of scheduled 
elections this november by blocking a move to reconvene the 
national assembly dissolved by the late president mohammad zia 
ulhaq 
in a unanimous decision it upheld a lower court ruling last 
week that zias move in may was unconstitutional but also found no 
grounds to restore to power the old muslim league government of 
prime minister mohammed khan junejo 
the high court said in a statement that while its findings might 
imply that the junejo government stands revived we are not 
unmindful of the fact that the whole nation is geared up for 
elections and we do not propose to do anything which makes 
confusion which would be the result if the vital process of 
election is interrupted at this juncture 
mohammed khan naqshbandi a spokesman for the muslim league 
said junejo and other party leaders would abide by the decision and 
would drop their demands to reinstate the former cabinet and 
reconvene the legislature 
our position has been vindicated that zias decision to 
dissolve the national assembly was unconstitutional illegal and 
uncalled for he said 
it was the second time this week that the high court ruled 
against the late military strongman zia and several of his top 
generals were killed in a plane crash on aug 17 
the supreme court ruled sunday in favor of a petition by ms 
bhutto challenging zias july decree that the elections in november 
be on a nonparty basis the court said the constitution guaranteed 
that candidates could run on party tickets rather than as 
individuals under zias plan 
the last democratic elections held in 1973 swept ms bhuttos 
father zulfikar ali bhutto into power as pakistans first 
popularly elected prime minister 
bhutto was deposed by zia in a military coup in 1977 zia had 
him hanged two years later 
zia ruled under martial law until 1985 when he allowed 
elections on a nonparty basis the opposition boycotted the voting 
and candidates favoring the prozia muslim league swept the 
elections 
zia shared power with the junejo government for three years 
then stunned the nation by abruptly firing the prime minister and 
his cabinet on may 29 and dissolving the national assembly zia 
accused them of corruption incompetence and of failing to 
implement his program of islamization 
junejo denied the charges and called zias move illegal and 
arbitrary 
zia scheduled elections for midnovember on a nonparty basis 
after his death zia senate chairman ghulam ishaq khan assumed 
the presidency and pledged that the elections would proceed on 
schedule he left it to the courts to decide whether the polls 
should be open to political parties 
the federal election commission has announced that voting for 
the national assembly will be held nov 16 and for provincial 
assemblies three days later 
the commission estimates that about 46 million of pakistans 107 
million people are eligible to vote

federal officials acted wednesday to reduce peak 
air traffic at ohare international airport in reaction to a report 
that mistakes by controllers there this year are already more than 
double the number in 1987 
controllers at ohare made two errors friday another sunday and 
another tuesday bringing the number of recorded mistakes at ohare 
this year to 30 said don zochert a spokesman for the federal 
aviation administration in chicago 
in all four cases planes were allowed to get too close to each 
other officials said no one was injured 
atlantas hartsfield international airport has had six errors 
this year and washingtons national airport two officials said 
in 1987 there were 12 errors by air traffic controllers at 
ohare which has been the subject of an investigation by the 
national transportation safety board zochert said the airport is 
one the worlds busiest 
i cant explain the reason for the errors zochert said 
thats the question everybody wants the answer to and if there 
was an easy solution wed have it 
late wednesday the faa called a news conference to say flights 
to chicago would sit on the ground in the cities where they 
originate when there is too much traffic over ohare spokeswoman 
barbara dettmer said 
during peak periods usually between 445 pm and 915 pm 
the maximum number of planes allowed to depart and land would be 
reduced to about 155 per hour from 180 ms dettmer said 
the latest incidents came just two months after the safety board 
issued a report saying that chronic understaffing mandatory 
overtime outdated equipment and inadequate training had 
contributed to mistakes at ohare 
despite the rise in mistakes ohare remains a safe airport 
zochert said 
michael benson a spokesman for the ntsb in washington said the 
board met with faa officials wednesday to discuss the new rash of 
operational errors we got a positive feeling the faa will be 
taking steps 
in tuesdays incident a united airlines jet and a smaller 
simmons airlines plane came within 500 feet of each other while 
approaching ohare he said 
on sunday two united jets came within 500 feet of each other 
after the pilot of one plane apparently followed an order intended 
for the other 
on friday two air wisconsin jets came near each other when a 
controller apparently mistakenly gave one of them an order to 
descend the faa said 
in a second incident friday an american airlines jet and a 
delta air lines jet came within 400 feet vertically and a mile 
horizontally when the pilot of the american jet apparently failed 
to repeat an order to reduce speed and the controller did not seek 
confirmation the faa said 
the faa requires airplanes in the area to be separated a minimum 
of three miles horizontally and 1000 feet vertically 
joe bellino regional representative of the national air traffic 
controllers association said ohares radar room on friday was a 
zoo 
with fridays 3842 takeoffs and landings just below the 
alltime record of 3853 set the day before there should have 
been 18 journeyman controllers and several developmental 
controllers on duty developmental controllers have fewer 
responsibilities than the journeymen 
but bellino said there were only 14 controllers working and the 
problem was made worse when the controllers who made the errors 
were temporarily relieved of their duties giving those who 
remained even more responsibilities 
the faa could not immediately say how many controllers were on 
duty friday but zochert said the number of controllers working at 
the airport has risen from 87 last year to 94 as of sept 1

the new soviet chief ideologist appeared to chart 
a middle course in the first major speech since he was elected to 
the ruling soviet politburo voicing support for reform as well as 
for strong central authority 
vadim a medvedevs speech to an international conference on 
contemporary socialism was made tuesday and reprinted wednesday by 
the government newspaper izvestia the speech appeared to show some 
slight differences from the beliefs of president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
medvedev a political economist was named a member of the 
politburo on friday by the policymaking central committee he also 
was named to head a party commission on ideology indicating he 
also assumed the ideology portfolio once held by yegor k ligachev 
ligachev is widely believed to favor a more conservative 
approach to social problems than gorbachev medvedevs speech 
appeared to stake out a middle ground balancing the need for 
reform with maintenance of political authority 
we proceed from the fact that the socialist economy is 
impossible without the strong role of the center medvedev 59 
told the conference 
he also seemed to say the criticism allowed by gorbachevs drive 
for greater openness or glasnost had gone too far 
unfortunately there have been some irresponsible attempts to 
cast a shadow over lenins inheritance over the basic values of 
socialism medvedev said 
and how else can those statements appearing in the press be 
interpreted that claim that the commandadministrative system 
resulted from lenin those attempts to deny the socialist nature of 
our system that even doubt the rightness of our choice for 
socialism 
medvedev did however say socialism now faces the need for 
deep qualitative rejuvenation 
in his 3 years since becoming communist party chief gorbachev 
has often mentioned the common interests of the west and the 
socialist camp medvedev however said it was outdated to 
maintain capitalism and socialism were developing on a parallel 
course 
certainly there could not be any merging any convergence of 
the two systems the new politburo member said each will 
develop in accordance with its own rules

leander perez jr the former district 
attorney who lost his fathers legacy of power in plaquemines 
parish in fights with his brother died wednesday of a heart 
attack he was 68 years old 
he was brought into the meadowcrest hospital emergency room by 
ambulance in critical condition and he died at the hospital said 
hospital spokeswoman ann wilder 
perez who lived in new orleans apparently suffered the heart 
attack during a business meeting at idlewild plantation the family 
estate in belle chasse said ar johnson a close friend of perez 
perez was a son of the fervent segregationist who built one of 
the most dominant political machines in southern history ruling 
plaquemines for more than four decades first as district attorney 
and later as commission council president 
before he died in 1969 judge leander perez so known because 
he had briefly held an appointed federal judgeship at the start of 
his political career saw leander jr anointed as district 
attorney and his other son chalin as council president 
leander jr who first became district attorney in 1960 did not 
run in 1984 he never announced his decision or said why he made 
it he reportedly had been hospitalized that year for circulation 
problems 
perez also had serious political troubles since he and chalin 
had begun feuding in the late 1970s and in 1979 leander perez 
began investigating the parish council 
a grand jury indicted chalin perez in 1981 on charges of misuse 
and abuse of parish property and finances the panel was dismissed 
later that year just as it was about to indict the district 
attorney and the familyowned delta development corp on charges of 
stealing millions of dollars in mineral royalties from parishowned 
lands 
perez and former state district judge eugene leon were indicted 
on malfeasance charges because of that dismissal but were 
acquitted in february 1986 
chalin perez was ousted as parish president in 1983 the same 
year that a lawyer unearthed an old legal document revealing that 
judge perez had secretly acquired control of parish lands in the 
1930s 
the parish sued the perezes but two courts ruled that the 
parish had filed its lawsuit 33 years too late 
those courts eventually were overruled by the state supreme 
court and the parish dropped 80 million in claims against the 
family in september 1987 for about 12 million and control of the 
oilrich lands on which it expects to earn 3 million a year 
perez is survived by his wife aphra whom he married after the 
death of his first wife catherine four children and their 
children

here is the text of wednesday nights debate 
between vice presidential candidates sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
and sen dan quayle rind 
moderator good evening on behalf of the commission on 
presidential debates i am pleased to welcome you to this vice 
presidential debate im judy woodruff of pbss macneillehrer news 
hour and frontline my colleagues on the panel are jon margolis of 
the chicago tribune tom brokaw of nbc news and brit hume of abc 
news 
the importance of tonights debate is underscored by two facts 
both george bush and michael dukakis said their selection of a 
running mate would reveal a lot about themselves and based on the 
history since world war ii there is almost a 5050 chance that one 
of the two men here tonight will become president of the united 
states the candidates are senator dan quayle the republican 
nominee and senator lloyd bentsen the democratic nominee for the 
next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates following a 
format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two 
campaigns however there are no restrictions on the questions that 
my colleagues and i may ask this evening by prior agreement 
between the two candidates the first question goes to senator 
quayle and you have two minutes to respond 
senator you have been criticized as we all know for your 
decision to stay out of the vietnam war for your poor academic 
record but more troubling to some are some of the comments that 
have been made by people in your own party just last week former 
secretary of state haig said that your pick was the dumbest call 
george bush could have made your leader in the senate your leader 
in the senate bob dole said that a better qualified person could 
have been chosen other republicans have been far more critical in 
private why do you think that you have not made a more substantial 
impression on some of these people who have been able to observe 
you up close 
quayle the question goes to whether i am qualified to be vice 
president and in the case of a tragedy whether im qualified to 
be president qualifications for the office of vice president or 
president are not age alone we must look at accomplishments and 
we must look at experience i have more experience than others that 
have sought the office of vice president now lets look at 
qualifications and lets look at the three biggest issues that are 
going to be confronting america in the next presidency those three 
issues are national security and arms control jobs and education 
and the federal budget deficit on each one of those issues i have 
more experience than does the governor of massachusetts 
in national security and arms control you have to understand the 
relationship between a ballistic missile a warhead what 
throwweight what megatonnage is you better understand about 
telemetry and encryption and you better understand that you have 
to negotiate from a position of strength these are important 
issues because we want to have more arms control and arms 
reductions 
in the area of jobs and education i wrote the job training 
partnership act a bipartisan bill a bill that has trained and 
employed over three million economically disadvantaged youth and 
adults in this country on the area of federal budget deficit i 
have worked eight years on the senate budget committee and i wish 
that the congress would give us the lineitem veto to help deal 
with that and if qualifications alone are going to be the issue in 
this campaign george bush has more qualifications than michael 
dukakis and lloyd bentsen combined 
moderator senator bentsen senator bentsen im going to 
interrupt at this point and ask once again that the audience please 
keep your responses as quiet as possible we know that many of you 
here are for one candidate or another but you are simply taking 
time away from your candidate and more likely than not youll be 
causing the partisans for the other candidate to react again on 
when their candidate speaks so please senator bentsen you have 
one minute to respond 
bentsen this debate tonight is not about the qualifications 
for the vice presidency the debate is whether or not dan quayle 
and lloyd bentsen are qualified to be president of the united 
states because judy just as you have said that has happened too 
often in the past and if that tragedy should occur we have to 
step in there without any margin for error without time for 
preparation to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in 
the world that of running this great country of ours to take 
over the awesome responsibility for commanding the nuclear weaponry 
that this country has no the debate tonight is a debate about 
the presidency itself and a presidential decision that has to be 
made by you the stakes could not be higher

q senator bentsen a question for you and you also have two 
minutes to respond what while this is not so much your 
qualifications but your split on policy with governor dukakis he 
has said that he does not want a clone of himself but you disagree 
with him on some major issues aid to the nicaraguan contras the 
death penalty gun control among others if you had to step in to 
the presidency whos agenda would you pursue yours or his 
bentsen well im delighted to respond to that question 
because we agree on so many things and the vast majority of the 
issues we agree on the fact that we have to cut this deficit and 
governor dukakis has been able to cut that deficit ten budgets in a 
row in the state of massachussetts while he lowered the tax burden 
on their people from one of the highest to one of the lower in the 
united states that is a major sense of achievement and i admire 
that and im just delighted to be on the ticket with him governor 
dukakis and i agree that we ought to have a trade policy for this 
country that weve seen this administration more than double the 
national debt that theyve moved this country from the number one 
lender nation in the world to the number one debtor nation in the 
world under their administration that they have not had a trade 
policy that theyve let trade be a handmaiden for the foreign 
policy objectives of the country that this country has exported 
too many jobs and not enough products 
and as i worked to pass a trade bill through the united states 
senate they threw roadblocks in the way every step of the way but 
we passed a trade bill that has this premise that any country that 
has full access to our markets were entitled to full access to 
their markets now that means that were going to stand tough for 
america and were going to protect those jobs and were going to 
push american products and were going to open up markets around 
the world well show leadership in that respect and turn this 
deficit in trade around thats the sort of thing that michael 
dukakis and i will do to bring about a better america for all of 
our people 
q senator quayle a minute to respond 
quayle as you noticed senator bentsen didnt tell you very 
much about what governor dukakis would do governor dukakis one 
of the most liberal governors in the united states of america the 
one thing he tried to point out about governor dukakis is that hes 
cut taxes the fact of the matter is senator bentsen hes raised 
taxes five times he just raised taxes this last year and thats 
why a lot of people refer to him tax hike mike thats why they 
refer to the state of massachusetts as taxachusetts because every 
time theres problem the liberal governor from massachusetts raises 
taxes i dont blame senator bentsen for not talking about governor 
michael dukakis hes talking more about his record if i had to 
defend the liberal policies of governor michael dukakis i wouldnt 
talk about it either

us rep robert dornan said his wifes 
mistaken public statement that her brother suffered from aids was 
prompted by worry and imagination according to a newspaper report 
published wednesday 
dornan and his wife sallie are very relieved and obviously 
extremely happy that her estranged brother doug hansen doesnt 
have the disease dornan told the orange county register in an 
interview 
the comments from dornan a republican who has been critical of 
the gay lifestyle apparently did little to end an unusual and 
highly public family feud 
at a public meeting sept 18 mrs dornan vividly described the 
plight of a brother dying of aids as she was apologizing for 
shouting shut up fag to a gay activist in the crowd asked 
who the brother was she said dougie 
dornan criticized his brotherinlaw a 51yearold landscape 
architect from san diego for discussing the matter with the news 
media 
hansen in interviews denied that he is gay and that he suffered 
from the fatal malady the congressman said his wife believed it 
wrong for her brother to go public with his rebuttal of her 
assertions 
she thinks doug owes her an apology for going to the press 
instead of her dornan said 
dornan seeking reelection to a third term in congress said 
the description stemmed from his wifes worries about her brother 
and from pictures she had seen of aids victims 
shed been worrying and it came out as a reality instead of a 
fear thats the one mistake sallie made dornan said 
sallie is just a walking heart dornan said i think she 
had imagined this so often she thought she had seen them 
hansen later called reporters to deny he had aids though he has 
friends who are homosexual he said he belives the gay lifestyle 
is wrong 
hansen tested negative for the aids virus in a test arranged by 
the los angeles times 
hansen said he hadnt seen his sister since their mothers 
funeral in 1983 and dornan said he has seen hansen only once in 30 
years

george bush on wednesday proposed a 39 billion 
invest in our children plan focusing on school programs and 
environmental and qualityoflife issues bush said will foster 
stronger children through a family that functions and an 
environment that motivates 
the package including some proposals bush has made before 
would be aimed at helping poor people through tax code revisions 
and medicaid efforts and would also include anticrime and 
antigang sections as well as efforts to remove toxic substances 
from school environments 
a 32page summary released by the republicans presidential 
campaign also includes proposals to require medicaid coverage for 
poor children and to give the states 10 million for developing 
programs against hazardous radon gas 
bush called for a national survey of schools in 1990 to detect 
and get rid of radon and also for strict standards covering 
manufacturers who use lead in development of consumer products 
although bush said in a remark at a arapahoe high school that 
i dont see this problem in terms of money campaign adviser 
deborah steelman said the entire package would cost about 39 
billion in federal money for the first year of a fiveyear plan 
included in that figure is a previously announced 22 billion 
tax credit program for child care steelman said the new medicaid 
proposals would amount to some 300 million 
why are some children still in trouble after 50 years of 
liberal programs aimed at helping them bush asked because 
liberalism didnt help it often made the problem worse 
the vice president took some time out from his campaign duties 
to telephone running mate dan quayle and wish him well in his 
debate wednesday night with democrat lloyd bentsen according to 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller 
during the 10minute conversation bush told quayle relax i 
know it will go well 
bush has been favorably impressed with quayle fuller said 
when the american people get a chance to see the dan quayle we 
know they will all be favorably impressed fuller said 
the vice president watched the debate from fort worth texas 
hes doing good good opening right out of the ball park the 
canseco of american politics bush said referring to oakland as 
baseball player jose canseco in describing quayles response to the 
first question of the debate to a group of reporters he had invited 
to watch the opening of the event he hit it the first answer 
home run 
bush also traveled wednesday to oklahoma city where the oil 
industry is struggling through tough times 
youre back bush told a rally oklahoma is coming 
strong 
promising to decontrol natural gas bush said dukakis is an 
opponent of the energy industry but is now trying to fool the 
american people by acting like he cares about the energy industry 
at the high school in the denver suburb of littleton bush said 
our future will be as strong tomorrow as our children are today 
and our children will be as strong as their education allows their 
eduction will be as strong as their schools but something more is 
required a family that functions and an environment that 
motivates 
included in the plan is a call to phase in affordable medicaid 
coverage for pregnant women and infants with incomes up to 185 
percent of the poverty level bush also would expand on current 
medicaid coverage for children of families with incomes below the 
poverty level by providing healthcare education for those families 
the proposals were an elaboration on bushs remarks in his first 
debate with democratic rival michael dukakis that he wanted to 
allow the poor to buy into medicaid said steelman 
bush said he would also expand the maternal and child health 
block grant program to provide health and medicaid information for 
pregnant women and provide case management as an essential 
component for high risk in teenage pregnancies that are likely to 
result in low birth weight 
he also called for mandatory medicaid coverage of functionally 
disabled children who would have to be in a hospital or other 
institution without such coverage for home care 
in other areas he called for 
mandatory child support levels and enforcement and a 
nationwide parent locator system to track down delinquent 
parents 
case management and counseling to teach parents about health 
care and nutrition 
encouraging states to make drug testing a condition of bail 
probation and parole 
a focus on crime in the schools with creation of a justice 
department antigang unit to work with local jurisdictions 
legislation to give the federal government concurrent 
jurisdiction over juveniles committing federal crimes so that the 
federal government can act if the state fails to vigorously 
prosecute juveniles 
housing vouchers to get assistance to lowincome families a 
system he said would provide three times as much assistance as 
building housing for the same price 
in giving spending projections for the newly announced programs 
steelman said the antigang unit portion would run about 50 
million new medicaid for mothers and infants at 185 percent of the 
poverty level would be 300 million with another 80 million for 
case management in medicaid 
the radon and lead programs would cost 30 million and a 
program to help turn over subsudized housing to tenants would cost 
80 million she said

a judge ordered an eastern airlines 
jetliner impounded wednesday when nearly 20 pounds of cocaine were 
found aboard but an airlines spokeswoman said the plane was later 
allowed to take off 
the lockheed l1011 was preparing to leave bogota for miami and 
new york wednesday morning when police found the cocaine during a 
routine search colombias civilian aeronautics administration said 
a judge ordered the plane impounded until the national drug 
board a part of the ministry of justice can decide whether the 
plane should be seized or the airline fined 
in miami eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said the plane was 
allowed to leave after a hearing wednesday and flight 505 left four 
hours behind schedule 
the plane was confiscated but it was returned to us ms 
ceremsak said she said she did not know if eastern had posted a 
bond 
ms ceremsak said ground workers found the cocaine in a closet 
but that company officials could not immediately determine when the 
drug was placed in the plane 
it was found by a cleaning crew in the rear of the aircraft 
near the lavatories in the cabin she said 
the plane arrived in bogota tuesday and had spent night at the 
airport after arriving from miami on tuesday the spokeswoman said 
the impoundment appeared to be in reaction to us customs 
officials having impounded jets belonging to avianca airlines of 
colombia several times in the last three years after cocaine was 
found aboard them in miami 
four months ago avianca said it would no longer haul cargo from 
bogota to miami because of the millions of dollars in fines it has 
had to pay in the united states as a result of cocaine being found 
in its cargo especially in flower shipments 
a few hours before the cocaine was found aboard the eastern 
plane wednesday police searching cargo on the tarmac of bogotas 
el dorado international airport found 836 pounds of cocaine in 
boxes of carnations bound for boston they were to be loaded aboard 
a plane flown by aerosel a colombian cargo airline

moderator john margolis a question for senator bentsen 
q sen bentsen you have claimed that vice president bush and 
the republicans will raid the social security trust fund and you 
have vowed to protect it but as chairman of the senate finance 
committee you must know that there is something to the argument of 
your fellow democrat bob strauss that some restraint on social 
security growth may be needed or at least some decision to tax 
most social security benefits as regular income in fact you once 
voted for and spoke for a sixmonth delay on costofliving 
adjustment increases for social security senator arent you and 
gov dukakis using this issue politically rather than dealing with 
it responsibily 
bentsen well i must say i hate to disappoint my good friend 
bob strauss but we have a contract with the american people on 
social security and social security is an issue where sen quayle 
voted eight times to cut the benefits on social security 
quayle interjecting thats wrong 
bentsen continuing when this administration came in and tried 
to cut the benefits the minimum benefits 122 a month for 
widows for retirees tried to cut the benefits for 62yearold 
retirees by 40 percent tried to do an endrun on social security 
when they first came in after promising not to cut it to cut it by 
some 20 billion and while we were working together to reform the 
social security system and to be certain that that money was going 
to be there for people when they retired at that point they tried 
a 40 billion endrun to cut social security now the record is 
clear 
and we saw vice president bush fly back from the west coast to 
break a tie in the united states senate he doesnt get to vote 
very often in the senate but he made a special trip to come back 
and vote against a cost of living increase now when you talk 
about social security the people that are going to protect it are 
the democrats who brought forth that program and i think its very 
important that we now see these kinds of endruns by this 
administration when they talk about the fact that theyre going to 
continue to cut this budget i know too well what their track 
record is and we should be concerned about that kind of an effort 
once again after the election is over 
moderator sen quayle your response 
quayle sen bentsen you know that i did not vote to cut social 
security benefits eight times what i have voted for and what sen 
bentsen has voted for is to delay the costofliving adjustments 
sen bentsen two times in the united states senate voted to delay 
the costofliving adjustment the governor of massachusetts at a 
governors conference supported a resolution to delay the 
costofliving adjustment 
and jon youre right they use this for political advantage 
what they try to do time and time again is to scare the old people 
of this country thats the politics of the past in 1983 
republicans and democrats dropped their political swords and in a 
bipartisan effort saved the social security system republicans 
and democrats banded together because we know that this program is 
not a republican program its not a democrat program its a 
program for older americans and that program is actuarially sound 
to the turn of this century

moderator jon a question for senator quayle 
q senator since coming to the senate you have voted against 
environmental protection legislation about twothirds of the time 
these include votes against pesticide controls the toxic waste 
superfund and health and safety protection from nuclear wastes 
senator do you consider yourself an environmentalist and if you 
do how do you reconcile that with your voting record 
quayle i have a very strong record on the environment in the 
united states senate i have a record where i voted for the 
superfund legislation i have a record where i voted against my 
president on the override of the clean water act i have voted for 
the major pieces of environmental legislation that have come down 
and been voted on in the united states senate this administration 
and i support this administration in its environmental effort has 
moved in the area for the first time to deal with the ozone 
problem we now have an international treaty a treaty that is 
commonly referred to as the montreal treaty for the first time we 
are talking about the impact of co2 to the ozone layer thats 
progress for the environment we are committed to the environment 
i take my children hiking and fishing walking in the woods in the 
wilderness believe me we have a commitment to preserving the 
environment 
if you bring up the environment you cant help but think about 
the environmental policy of the governor of massachsetts he talks 
about being an environmentalist let me tell you about his 
environmental policy the boston harbor the boston harbor which is 
the dirtiest waterway in america tons of raw sewage go in there 
each and every day what has the governor of massachusetts done 
about that virtually nothing then he has the audacity to go down 
to new jersey and tell the people in new jersey that hes against 
ocean dumping this is the same governor that applied for a license 
to dump massachusetts sewage waste off the coast of new jersey 
who has the environmental record who has the environment 
interests george bush and i do 
moderator senator bentsen 
bentsen well this late conversion is interesting to me when 
they talk about boston harbor and he says he hasnt done anything 
the facts are he has a 6 billion program underway on waste 
treatment and it was this administration their administration 
that cut out the money early on to be able to clean up water and 
made it impossible to move ahead at that time on boston harbor 
were the authors the democratic party of clean air of clean 
water of the superfunding im one who played a very major role in 
passing the superfund legislation and every environmental 
organization that i know every major one has now endorsed the 
dukakisbentsen ticket and im one who has just received the 
environmental award in texas for the work ive done to clean up the 
bays to clean up the water off the coast of texas now i think we 
know well whos going to help clean up this environment the record 
is there the history is there and dukakis and bentsen will be 
committed to that

moderator tom brokaw a question for senator quayle 
q thank you judy senator quayle theres been a lot of talk 
during this course of this campaign about family it was the 
principle theme as i recall it in your acceptance speech in new 
orleans tonight id like to ask you about the 65 million american 
children who live with their families in poverty id like for you 
to describe to the audience the last time that you may have visited 
with one of those families personally and how you explain to that 
family your votes against the school breakfast program the school 
lunch program and the expansion of the child immunization program 
quayle i have met with those people and i met with them in 
fort wayne indiana at a food bank and you may be surprised tom 
they didnt ask me those questions on those votes because they were 
glad that i took time out of my schedule to go down and to alk 
about how were going to get a food bank going and making sure that 
a food bank goes to fort wayne indiana and i have a very good 
record and a commitment to the poor to those that dont have a 
family want to have a family this administration and a george 
bush administration will be committed to eradicating poverty 
poverty hasnt gone up in this administration it hasnt gone down 
much either and that means that we have a challenge ahead of us 
but let me tell you something what we have done for the poor what 
we have done for the poor is that we in fact the homeless bill 
the mckinney act which is a major piece of legislation that 
deals with the homeless congress has cut the funding that the 
administration recommended 
the poor and poverty the biggest thing that we have done for 
poverty in america is the tax simplification act of 1986 six 
million working poor families got off the payroll six million 
people are off the taxpaying payrolls because of that tax reform 
and theyre keeping the tax money there to help the poor well 
have a commitment to the programs and those programs will go on 
and we are spending more in poverty programs today than we were in 
1981 that is a fact the poverty program we are going to 
concentrate on is creating jobs and opportunities so that everyone 
will have the opportunities that they want 
q senator bentsen your response 
bentsen i find that very interesting because he has been of no 
help at all when it comes to passing the most major welfare reform 
bill in the history of our country one where were working very 
hard to see that people can get off welfare break that cycle take 
a step up in life doing the kinds of things that we did there to 
let them have medicaid for a year thats a positive thing thats 
done what also frustrates me with the kind of report that i just 
heard here is the kind of votes hes cast against child nutrition 
programs the fact that he has voted against money that we needed 
for further immunization the denial of polio shots to kids where 
the parents couldnt afford to get that kind of a shot now i dont 
really believe that is identifying with the concerns of people in 
poverty

moderator tom brokaw a question for sen bentsen 
q sen bentsen id like to take you back to the question that 
judy woodruff asked you about your differences with michael 
dukakis on contra aid after all contra aid is one of the cutting 
issues of foreign policy of this country in the last eight years 
you and michael dukakis seem to be diametrically opposed on that 
i have been told that in a closed session of the us senate 
you made one of the most eloquent and statesmanlike speeches in 
behalf of contra aid that anyone had made in the eight years of the 
reagan term that in fact you alluded to the threat the 
sandinista regime could pose to your own state of texas gov 
dukakis on the other hand has described the contra aid policy as 
immoral and illegal is he wrong 
bentsen gov dukakis and i have disagreed on the contra program 
no question about that but my big difference with this 
administration is they look at the contra aid program as the only 
way to resolve that problem the concentrate on that and i really 
think we have to give peace a chance and thats why ive been a 
strong supporter of the arias plan a plan that won the nobel prize 
for president arias the president of costa rica i believe that 
you have to work with the leaders of those other central american 
countries to try to bring about the democratization of nicaragua by 
negotiation by pressure by counseling by diplomatic pressure 
that we ought to be trying that first 
but in concentrating so much just on the contras this 
administration has not paid enough attention to the rest of central 
america the concern i have is that we have a country with 85 
million people sharing a 2000mile border with us with half of 
those people under the age of 15 a country that has had its 
standard of living cut 50 percent in the last six years now we 
ought to be concerned about that and we ought to be involved i was 
born and reared on that mexican border i speak their language i 
spent a good part of my life down there gov dukakis speaks 
spanish too hes spent a good deal of time in central and south 
america 
and we believe that we ought to be working together with a new 
alliance for progress bringing in other countries to help bring 
in europeans the spanish who have a real affinity for that area 
bringing in the japanese who have a great capital surplus now and 
looking for places to invest it those are the policy things i 
think we could do to bring about peace in that area to help raise 
that standard of living and give them the kind of stability where 
democracy can proceed and can prosper and bloom 
those are the kinds of things that wed be committed to in a 
dukakisbentsen administration to try to make this world a better 
place in which to live 
moderator sen quayle your response 
quayle theres no doubt in a dukakis administration that the 
aid would be cut off to the democratic resistance in nicaragua and 
that is unfortunate the reason it is unfortunate because it is 
beyond me why its okay for the soviet union to put in billions of 
dollars to prop up the communist sandinistas but somehow its 
wrong for the united states to give a few dollars to the democratic 
resistance 
theres a thing called the monroe doctrine something that the 
governor of massachusetts has said has been superseded i doubt if 
many americans agree with that i think they believe in the monroe 
doctrine sen bentsen talked about the entire central america 
theres another issue that michael dukakis is wrong on in central 
america and thats grenada he criticized our rescue mission in 
grenada according to a upi report criticized that yet 85 
percent of the american people supported our rescue mission and we 
turned a communist country into a noncommunist country the 
governor of massachusetts is simply out of step with mainstream 
american

moderator brit hume a question for senator bentsen 
q good evening senator bentsen senator quayle im sort of 
the cleanup man in this order and ive been asked by my 
colleagues to try to deal with anything thats been left on base 
senator i have a followup question for you senator quayle but 
senator bentsen i first want to ask you a question about pac 
money something im sure youre prepared to talk about governor 
dukakis has tried to make ethics a major issue in the campaign and 
he has you as a running mate a man who leads the league at last 
count in the receipt of pac money that being the money raised by 
the special interest organizations that is the kind of campaign 
financing which governor dukakis finds so distasteful that he has 
refused to accept any of it do you find that embarrassing senator 
bentsen no i dont find it embarrassing at all because you 
have to remember that pac money is the result of the last campaign 
reform bill one that talks about employees have greater 
participation and what ive done in pac money is just what my 
opponent in my campaign has done in his campaign he has hes been 
raising pac money too so what you have to do is comply with the 
laws as they are whether youre paying taxes or youre playing a 
football game whether you like those laws or not you comply with 
them 
now i have been for campaign reform and have pushed it very 
hard i believe that we have to do some things in that regard but 
ive noticed that the senator from indiana has opposed that 
campaign reform and voted repeatedly against it the things we have 
to do i believe that will cut back on soft money for 
example which i look on as frankly one of those things that we 
have had to do because the republicans have done it for so long 
but i think its a loophole frankly 
but campaign reform changing the rules of the game is 
something we tried repeatedly in this session of the congress but 
only to have the republicans lead the charge against us and defeat 
us and i wish that senator quayle would change his mind on that 
particular piece of legislation and give us the kind of a campaign 
reform law that i think is needed in america 
moderator senator quayle your response 
quayle senator bentsen is the number one pac raiser as a 
matter of fact he used to have a 10000 breakfast club a 10000 
breakfast club it only cost highpaid lobbyist special interests 
in washington to come down and have breakfast with the chairman of 
the senate finance committe the one that oversees all the tax 
loopholes in the tax code 10000 im sure they werent paying 
to have corn flakes 
well ill tell you the kind of campaign reform im supporting 
senator bentsen i think its time that we get rid of pac money 
support our legislation where we totally eliminate contributions by 
special interests and political action committees and lets have 
the individual contribute and the political parties contribute 
thats the kind of campaign reform that republicans are for they 
want to get rid of this special interest money and rely on the 
individuals and also the political parties

moderator brit your question for senator quayle once again 
let me caution the audience please keep your reaction as quiet as 
possible brit 
q senator i want to take you back if i can to the question 
judy asked you about some of the apprehensions people may feel 
about your being a heartbeat away from the presidency and let us 
assume if we can for the sake of this question that you become 
vice president and the president is incapacitated for one reason or 
another and you have to take the reins of power when that moment 
came what would be the first steps that youd take and why 
quayle first id say a prayer for myself and for the country 
that im about to lead and then i would assemble his people and 
talk and i think this question keeps going back to qualifications 
and what kind of vice president and this hypothetical situation if 
i had to assume the responsibilities of the president what i would 
be and as i have said age alone although i can tell you 
after the experience of these last few weeks on the campaign ive 
added 10 years to my age age alone is not the only 
qualification youve got to look at experience and youve got to 
look at accomplishments and can you make a difference 
have i made a difference in the united states senate where i 
served for eight years yes i have have i made a difference in the 
congress that i served for twelve years yes i have as i said 
before looking at the issue of qualifications and i am delighted 
that it comes up because on the three most important challenges 
facing america arms control and national security jobs and 
education and budget deficit i have more experience and 
accomplishments than does the governor of massachusetts 
i have been in the congress and i have worked on these issues 
and believe me when you look at arms control and trying to deal 
with the soviet union you cannot come at it from a naive position 
youy have to understand the soviet union you have to understand 
how they will respond sitting on that senate armed services 
committee for eight years has given me the experience to deal with 
the soviet union and how we can move forward that is just one of 
the troubling issues thats going to be facing this nation and i 
am prepared 
q senator bentsen 
bentsen well i cant leave something on the table that hes 
charged me with so lets get to that one when you talk about the 
breakfast club as you know that was perfectly legal and i 
formed it and i closed it down almost immediately because i 
thought the perception was bad but its the same law its the 
same law that lets you invite highpriced lobbyists down to 
williamsburg and bring them down there and entertain them playing 
golf playing tennis and bringing republican senators down there 
to have exchanged for that contributions to their campaign 
its the same kind of law that lets you have honorariums and 
youve collected over a quarter of a million dollars of honorariums 
now speaking to various interest groups and theres no control 
over what you do with that money you can spend it on anything you 
want to you can spend it on golf club dues if you want to do 
that now thats what ive seen you do in this administration and 
thats why we need campaign reform laws and why i support them and 
you in turn have voted against them time and time again

farm but escaped to thailand in 1979 and from there joined his 
family in the united states 
dith prans ordeal and that of his people were the focus of 
the film the killing fields 
cambodias un delegation called wednesday for vietnams 
withdrawal from their country and said a political solution to the 
nations troubles must be based on national reconciliation among 
all parties including the khmer rouge which ruled until 1979 
but son sann prime minister of the governmentinexile fighting 
the hanoiinstalled government in phnom penh said an international 
conference should adopt measures to prevent vietnams return or the 
illegal and violent seizure of power by one of the parties a 
reference to the khmer rouge 
an estimated 2 million of cambodias 8 million people died from 
khmer rouge executions famine and civil unrest before vietnam 
invaded the country in late 1978 and ousted pol pots khmer rouge

church bells rang in this modernistic 
capital wednesday as brazil enacted its eighth constitution 
consolidating the switchover from military rule to civilian 
government that began in 1985 
the 559 legislators who for 19 months battled over the 
245article document cheered and shouted brazil is changing 
as the president of the constituent assembly ulysses guimaraes 
declared law the new document 
i declare enacted the constitution of liberty of dignity of 
democracy and social justice guimaraes 72 said in a voice that 
struggled above thunderous applause may god help us enforce it 
brazils new democratic charter leaves behind the old 
authoritarian document that was handed down by military generals in 
1969 
the enactment was the last step in brazils return to fully 
democratic rule begun in march 1985 when jose sarney became 
brazils first civilian president since a 1964 rightwing military 
coup 
we have created a new brazil a new social and economic 
order dante de oliveira of the governing democratic movement 
party said after the ceremony we have taught the world an 
important lesson peacefully overturning an authoritarian regime 
the new document a mixture of leftleaning conservative and 
nationalistic articles that touch almost all aspects of life from 
land reform to interest rates granted none of the arbitrary powers 
used by the repressive military government during 21 years to rule 
the country 
the new charter bans censorship removes the presidents power 
to simply decree law and outlaws torture which in the past was 
used against the military governments political opponents 
but many of the articles were confusing several such as a 
reduced work week more maternity leave and extra pay for overtime 
immediately became law 154 would need complimentary legislation to 
become effective 
one such confusing article limited real interest rates to 12 
percent though no one knows what real interest rates in 
inflationridden brazil are inflation in brazil is averaging more 
than 350 percent over the last 12 months 
one of the most controversial articles fought over by 
legislators who shouted each other down in daylong debates and 
often resorted to physical violence set presidential elections in 
november 1989 brazilians havent voted for president since 1960 
representatives from 21 latin american and portuguesespeaking 
nations watched legislators enact brazils eighth constitution 
since the country gained independence from portugal in 1822

moderator jon margolis question for sen quayle 
q sen quayle in recent years the reagan administration has 
scaled back the activities of the occupational safety and health 
administration prompted in part by vice president bushs task 
force on regulatory relief the budget for the agency has been cut 
by 20 percent and the number of inspections at manufacturing 
plants have been reduced by 33 percent 
this has had a special effect in this area where many people 
work in the meatpacking industry which has a far higher rate of 
serious injuries than almost any other injury a rate which appears 
to have been rising although were not really sure because some of 
the largest companies have allegedly been falsifying their reports 
would you acknowledge to the hundreds of injured and maimed people 
in nebraska iowa and elsewhere in the midwest that in this case 
deregulation may have gone too far and the government should 
reassert itself in protecting workers rights 
quayle the premise of your question jon is that somehow this 
administration has been lax in enforcement of the osha regulations 
and i disagree with that and ill tell you why if you want to ask 
some business people that ive talked to periodically they 
complain about the tough enforcement of this administration 
and furthermore let me tell you this for the record when we 
have found violations in this administration there has not only 
been tough enforcement but there have been the most severe 
penalties the largest penalties in the history of the department 
of labor have been levied when these violations have been found 
there is a commitment and there will always be a commitment to 
the safety of our working men and women they deserve it and were 
committed to them now the broader question goes to the whole 
issue of deregulation and has deregulation worked or has 
deregulation not worked in my judgment deregulation has worked 
we have a deregulated economy and we have produced through low 
taxes not high taxes through deregulation the spirit of 
entrepreneurship the individual going out and starting a business 
the businessman or woman willing to go out and risk their 
investment and start up a business and hire people we have 
produced 17 million jobs in this country since 1982 
deregulation as a form of political philosophy is a good 
philosophy its one that our opponents disagree with they want a 
centralized government but we believe in the market we believe in 
the people and yes theres a role of government and the role of 
government is to make sure that those safety and health and welfare 
of the people is taken care of and well continue to do that 
moderator sen bentsen 
bentsen i think you see once again a piece of democratic 
legislation thats been passed to try to protect the working men 
and women of america and then youve seen an administration that 
came in and really didnt have its heart in that kind of an 
enforcement a good example of that is the environmental protection 
laws that we were talking about a moment ago this administration 
came in and put in a james watt and anne gorsuch now thats the 
bonnie and clyde really of environmental protection and thats 
why its important that you have people that truly believe and 
trying to represent the working men and women of america most 
employers do a good job of that but some of them put their profits 
before people and thats why you have to have osha and thats why 
you have to have tough and good and fair enforcement of it and 
thats what a democratic administration would do to help make this 
working place a safer and a better place to be employed 
moderator jon margolis another question for senator bentsen 
q sen bentsen since you have been in the senate the 
government has spent increasing amounts of money in an effort to 
protect the family farmer but most of the subsidies seem to go do 
go to the largest and richest farmers who presumably need it 
least while its the smaller farmers who are often forced to sell 
out sometimes to their large farmer neighbor whos gotten more 
subsidies to begin with 
despite the fact that i believe you sir are rather a large 
farmer yourself do you believe its time to uncouple the subsidy 
formula from the amount of land a farmer has and target federal 
money to the small and mediumsize farmer 
bentsen well ive supported that i voted for the 50000 
limitation to get away from the million dollar contributions to 
farmers you know of the four that are on this ticket im the 
only one that was born and reared on a farm and still involved in 
farming so i think i understand their concerns and their problems 
now i feel very strongly that we ought to be doing more for the 
american farmer and what weve seen under this administration is 
neglect of that farmer 
weve seen them drive 220000 farmers off the farm they seem to 
think the answer is move em to town but we ought not to be 
doing that what you have seen them do is cut farm assistance for 
the rural areas by over 50 percent were seeing rural hospitals 
close all over the country because of this kind of an 
administration weve seen an administration that has lost much of 
our market abroad because they have not had a trade policy we saw 
our market lost by some 40 percent and thats one of the reasons 
that weve seen the cost of the farm program which was only about 
25 billion when they took office now go to about 25 billion 
now we can bring that kind of a cost down and get more to market 
prices if well have a good trade policy 
i was in january visiting with mr takeshita the new prime 
minister of japan i said youre paying five times as much for 
beef as we pay for in our country pay for it in our country 
six times as much for rice you have a 60 billion trade surplus 
with us you could improve the standard of living of your people 
youre spending 27 percent of your disposable income on food we 
spend 14 or 15 percent when you have that kind of a barrier up 
against us thats not free and fair trade and we dont believe 
that should continue 
we would be pushing very hard to open up those markets and 
stand up for the american farmer and see that we recapture those 
foreign markets and i think we can do it with a dukakisbentsen 
administration 
moderator sen quayle 
quayle sen bentsen talks about recapturing the foreign 
markets well ill tell you one way that were not going to 
recapture the foreign markets and that is if in fact we have 
another jimmy carter grain embargo jimmy jimmy carter grain 
embargo jimmy carter grain embargo set the american farmer back 
you know what the farmer is interested in net farm income every 1 
percent of increase in interest rates a billion dollars out of 
the farmers pocket net farm income increase inflation another 
billion dollars 
another thing that a farmers not interested in and thats 
supply management the democratic platform talks about but the 
governor of massachusetts he had the farm program he went to the 
farmers in the midwest and told them not to grow corn not to grow 
soy beans but to grow belgium endive thats what his thats 
what he and his harvard buddies think of the american farmer grow 
belgium endive to come in and to tell our farmers not to grow 
corn not to grow soy beans thats the kind of farm policy youll 
get under a dukakis administration and one i think the american 
farmer rightfully will reject

moderator tom brokaw a question for senator bentsen 
q senator bentsen you were a business man before you entered 
the us senate let me offer you an inventory if i may lower 
interest rates lower unemployment lower inflation and arms 
control deal with the soviet union now two guys come through your 
door at your business and say wed like you to change 
without offering a lot of specifics why would you accept their 
deal 
bentsen you know if you let me write 200 billion worth of hot 
checks every year i could give you an illusion of prosperity too 
this is an administration that has more than doubled the national 
debt and theyve done that in less than eight years they have 
taken this country from the number one lender nation in the world 
to the number one debtor nation in the world and the interest on 
that debt next year on this reaganbush debt of our nation is 
going to be 640 dollars for every man woman and child in america 
because of this kind of a credit card mentality so we go out and 
we try to sell our securities every week and hope that the 
foreigns will buy them and they do buy them but every time they 
do we lose some of our economic independence for the future 
now theyve turned around and theyve bought 10 percent of the 
manufacturing base of this country they bought 20 percent of the 
banks they own 46 percent of the commercial real estate in los 
angeles theyre buying america on the cheap now when we have 
other countries that cant manage their economy down in central and 
south america we send down the american ambassador we send down 
the international monetary fund and we tell them what they can buy 
and what they can sell and how to run their economies the ultimate 
irony would be to have that happen to us because foreigners finally 
quit buying our securities 
so what we need in this country is someone like mike dukakis who 
gave 10 balanced budgets in a row there and was able to do that 
meet that kind of a commitment set those tough priorities we need 
an administration that will turn this trade policy around and open 
up those markets stand tough with our trading partners to help 
keep the jobs at home and send the products abroad 
moderator senator quayle 
quayle senator bentsen talks about running up the debt well 
the governor of massachusetts has run up more debt than all the 
governors in the history of massachusetts combined going back to 
the days of the pilgrims i dont believe that thats the kind of 
policy that we want the question went to the heart of the matter 
tom you asked the question that why would we change well we have 
changed since 1980 weve got interest rates down we got inflation 
down people are working again america is held in respect once 
again around the world but were going to build on that change 
and as we made those positive change of lower interest rates 
lower rate of inflation the governor of massachusetts fought us 
every step of the way we are proud of the record of accomplishment 
and the opportunities and the hope for millions of americans hope 
and opportunity of these americans is because of the policies that 
we have had for the last eight years and we want to build on that 
and change it for even the better 
moderator tom a question for senator quayle 
q senator quayle as you mention here tonight you actively 
supported the invasion of grenada which was the military operation 
to rescue some american medical students and to rescue an island 
from a marxist takeover if military force was necessary in that 
endeavor why not use the military to go after the south american 
drug cartels and after general noriega for that matter on a 
surgical strike since drugs in the minds of most americans pose a 
far greater danger to many more people 
quayle youre absolutely right youre absolutely right the 
drug problem is the number one issue 
q but would you please address the military aspect of it 
quayle i will address the military aspect if i may respond the 
military aspect of the drug problem is being addressed as a matter 
of fact we are using the department of defense in a coordinated 
effort on reconnaissance but i dont believe that were going to 
turn the department of defense into a police organization we are 
using our military assets in a prudent way to deal with 
interdiction and weve made some success in this area seventy 
tons of cocaine have been stopped 
but you know when you look at the drug problem and it is a 
tremendous problem and there are no easy solutions to it its a 
complicated problem and its heading up the effort to try to 
create a drugfree america which is a challenge and a goal of all 
of us not only will we utilize national defense and the department 
of defense but weve got to get on the demand side of the ledger 
weve got to get to education and education ought to begin at 
home and it ought to be reinforced reinforced in our schools 
and theres another thing that will be more important than the 
premise of this question on a hypothetical of using troops well 
use military assets were not going to well use military assets 
but we need to focus on another part of this problem and that 
problem is law enforcement and heres where we have a major 
disagreement with the governor of massachusetts he is opposed to 
the death penalty for drug kingpins we believe people convicted of 
that crime deserve the death penalty as does the legislation 
thats in the congress thats supported by a bipartisan group 
including many democrats of his party he also was opposed to 
mandatory drug sentencing for drug dealers in the state of 
massachusetts you cannot have a war on drugs you cannot be tough 
on drugs and weak on crime 
moderator senator bentsen 
bentsen its interesting to see that the senator from indiana 
when we had a resolution on the floor of the united states senate 
sponsored by senator dole that this government would make no deal 
with noriega that the senator from indiana was one of the dozen 
senators that voted against it its also interesting to see that 
one of his campaign managers thats trying to help him with his 
image was also hired by noriega to help him with his image in 
panama 
what we have seen under this administration we have seen them 
using eight cabinet officers 28 different agencies all fighting 
over turf and thats one thing wed correct under the 
dukakisbentsen administration wed put one person in charge in 
the war against drugs and wed commit the resources to get that 
job done now mike dukakis has been able to do that type of thing 
in the state of massachusetts by cutting the drug use in high 
schools while its going up around the rest of the country by 
putting in a drug educational program that the drug enforcement 
agency said was a model for the country wed be doing that around 
the rest of the country thats a positive attack against drugs

moderator brit hume a question for senator quayle 
q senator i want to take you back to the question that i asked 
you earlier about what would happen if you were to take over in an 
emergency and what you would do first and why you said youd say a 
prayer and you said something about a meeting what would you do 
next 
quayle i dont believe that its proper for me to get into the 
specifics of a hypothetical situation like that the situation is 
that if i was called upon to serve as the president of this 
country or the responsibilities of the president of this country 
would i be capable and qualified to do that and ive tried to list 
the qualifications of 12 years in the united states congress i 
have served in the congress for 12 years i have served in the 
congress and served eight years on the senate armed services 
committee 
i have traveled a number of times ive been to geneva many 
times to meet with our negotiators as we were hammering out the inf 
treaty ive met with the western political leaders margaret 
thatcher chancellor kohl i know them they know me i know what 
it takes to lead this country forward and if that situation 
arises yes i will be prepared and ill be prepared to lead this 
country if that happens 
q senator bentsen 
bentsen well once again i think what were looking at here is 
someone that can step in at the presidency level at the moment if 
that tragedy would occur and if thats the case again you have to 
look at maturity of judgment and you have to look at breadth of 
experience you have to see what kind of leadership roles that 
person has played in his life before that crisis struck him and if 
you do that type of thing then youll arrive at a judgment that i 
think would be wise one and i hope that would mean that you say 
were going to vote for mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen 
moderator brit a question for senator bentsen 
q senator i want to take you back if i can to the 
celebrated breakfast club when it was first revealed that you 
had a plan to have people pay 10000 a plate to have breakfast 
with you you handled it with disarming not to say charming 
candor you said it was a mistake and you disbanded it and called 
the whole idea off and you were widely praised for having handled 
it deftly the question i have is if the washington post had not 
broken that story and other media picked up on it what can you 
tell us tonight as to why we should not believe that you would 
still be having those breakfasts to this day 
bentsen laughs well i must say brit i dont make many 
mistakes but that one was a real doozie and i agree with that 
and as you know i immediately disbanded it it was perfectly 
legal and you have all kinds of such clubs on the hill and you 
know that and but i still believe that the better way to go is 
to have a campaign reform law that takes care of that kind of a 
situation even though its legal the perception is bad so i 
would push very strong to see that we reform the entire situation 
id work for that end and thats what my friend from indiana has 
opposed repeatedly vote after vote 
moderator senator quayle 
quayle he disbanded the club but hes still got the money he 
is the number one receiver of political action committee money 
now senator bentsens talked about reform well let me tell you 
about the reform that were pushing lets eliminate political 
action committees to special interest money theres legislation 
before the congress to do that that way we wont have to worry 
about breakfast clubs or whos the number one pac raiser we can go 
back and get the contributions from the working men and women and 
the individuals of america we can also strengthen our twoparty 
system and it needs strengthening and rely more on the political 
parties than we have in the past thats the kind of campaign 
reform that im for and i hope the senator will join me

chambers has resigned as marlows parttime police chief a job 
he held three years 
the sentinel said it interviewed wentworth 36 as well as 
investigators whom it did not identify and many of the people 
interviewed by police in their investigation 
not long after beans death his wife sylvia and her three 
children moved in with chambers whom wentworth had left several 
months earlier with chambers two sons sylvia bean and chambers 
subsequently married though she moved out and filed for divorce 
after beans body was dug up 
according to the paper sylvia then married to bean said 
robert chambers and her husband went out drinking and partying 
constantly until she finally told bean it had to stop she said he 
agreed but that on sept 15 1978 bean left with chambers around 
6 pm 
according to wentworth and sources familiar with her grand jury 
testimony wentworth hitchhiked with suitcases to chambers rural 
home that evening chambers and bean arrived a few minutes later 
and when chambers saw her he got angry and called her vulgar names 
bean tried to come to her defense she told the paper but 
chambers pushed her toward bean saying he could have her an 
apparent reference to an affair bean and wentworth had had earlier 
wentworth told the paper that when bean stepped between her and 
chambers chambers picked up a hatchet and hit bean several times 
in the head and once in the chest 
she told the sentinel that chambers then forced her into his 
truck threw her suitcases in back and drove her the short 
distance to newell pond where he beat her again threatened her 
and left again a motorist picked her up 
if i can find whoever picked her up i hope wentworth told 
them something sgt richard rondo chief state police 
investigator in the case told the sentinel 
police investigated beans disappearance but closed the case 
assuming bean abandoned his family

moderator jon margolis a question for sen bentsen 
q senator weve all just finished most america has just 
finished one of the hottest summers it can remember and apparently 
this year will be the fifth out of the last nine that are among the 
hottest on record no one knows but most scientists think that 
something were doing human beings are doing are sic 
exacerbating this problem and that this could in a couple of 
generations threaten our descendents comfort and health and 
perhaps even their existence 
as vice president what would you urge our government to do to 
deal with this problem and specifically as a texan could you 
support a substantial reduction in the use of fossile fuel which 
might be necessary down the road 
bentsen well i think what you can do in that one and which 
would be very helpful is to use a lot more natural gas which 
burns a lot cleaner and what mike dukakis has said is that hell 
try to break down those regulatory roadblocks that you have in the 
regulatory agency that denies much of the passage of that natural 
gas to the northeast where you in turn can fight against acid 
rain which is another threat because its sterilizing our lakes 
its killing our fish 
and its interesting to me to see in the resume of sen quayle 
that he brags on the fact that hes been able to fight the acid 
rain legislation i dont think that thats a proper objective in 
trying to clean up this environment but the greenhouse effect is 
one that has to be a threat to all of us and we have to look for 
alternative sources of fuel and ive supported that very strongly 
the department of energy is one that has cut back substantially 
on the study of those alternative sources of fuel we can use other 
things thatll help the farmer we can convert corn to ethanol and 
i would push for that very strong so absolutely ill do those 
things that are necessary to put the environment of our country 
number one because if we dont protect that well destroy the 
future of our children and we must be committed to trying to clean 
up the water clean up the air and do everything we can not only 
from a research standpoint but also in the applied legislation to 
see that thats carried out 
moderator sen quayle 
quayle vice president george bush has said that he will take on 
the environmental problem he has said further that he will deal 
with the acid rain legislation and reduce millions of tons of the 
so2 content that legislation wont get through the congress this 
year but it will get through in a george bush administration a 
george bush administration that is committed to the environment 
now the greenhouse effect is an important environmental issue it 
is important for us to get the data in to see what alternatives we 
might have to the fossil fuels to make sure that we know what 
were doing and there are some explorations and things that we can 
consider in this area the drought highlighted the problem that we 
have and therefore we need to get on with it and in a george 
bush administration you can bet that we will 
moderator a question for sen quayle 
q senator as vice president your most important contribution 
would be the advice you gave the president one of the most 
troubling facts thats going to face the new administration is the 
fact that the united states has now become the worlds largest 
debtor nation in 1987 foreigners underwrote our debts to the tune 
of about 138 billion 
last week a top official of the japanese economic planning 
agency bragged that japan now is in a position to influence the 
value of the dollar of our interest rates and even our stock 
prices and he warned that one day maybe theyd do just that if 
you were vice president of the united states and japan did that 
what would you tell the president to do 
quayle when you look at dealing with this total problem not 
just with the japanese but the underlying question on this total 
world debt problem you have got to see why are we a debtor and 
what is attracting the foreign investment into our country today 
whether its the japanese or others 
i would rather have people come over here and to make 
investments in this country rather than going elsewhere because by 
coming over here and making investments in this country we are 
seeing jobs do you realize that today we are producing hondas and 
exporting hondas to japan we are the envy of the world 
the united states some of sen bentsens supporters laugh at 
that they laugh at that because they dont believe that the 
united states of america is the envy of the world well i can tell 
you the american people think the united states of america is the 
envy of the world 
moderator sen bentsen oh im sorry go ahead 
quayle we are the greatest nation in this world and the 
greatest economic power now theres been some talk in congress 
about forgiveness of debt forgiveness of debt is wrong 
forgiveness of international debt would be counterproductive and 
id like to see those that talk about forgiving debt senator 
bentsen to go out and talk about the farmer thats in debt that 
doesnt have his forgiven thats not the kind of policy george 
bush will have 
moderator sen bentsen 
bentsen well ive told you what id do about trade and trying 
to help turn that situation around but we also should do is get 
them to give us more burdensharing when it comes to national 
defense we have a situation today where on a per capita basis 
people in western europe are spending about one third as much as we 
are in our country and then when you go to japan where were 
spending 6 percent on defense of the democracies theyre spending 
1 percent 
i met with some of the japanese business leaders talking to 
them about it and i said you know we have 50000 troops here 
in japan protecting the democracies of asia and it costs 35 
billion a year youre the number two economic power in the world 
you ought to measure up to that responsibility and carry some of 
that cost 
i said if we were not doing what were doing wed have a big 
budget surplus and i said youd have chaos because you get 
55 percent of your oil from the persian gulf and you wouldnt have 
the us navy down there to take care of that now the senator 
from indiana when we passed a resolution in the united states 
senate to ask for burdensharing on that cost to keep those sea 
lanes open from the japanese he voted against that i dont 
understand that

moderator tom brokaw a question for senator quayle 
q senator quayle i dont mean to beat this drum until it has 
no more sound left in it but to follow up on brit humes question 
when you said that it was a hypothetical situation it is sir 
after all the reason that were here tonight because you are 
running not just for vice president and if you cite the experience 
that you had in congress surely you must have some plan in mind 
about what you would do if it fell to you to become president of 
the united states as it has to so many vice presidents just in the 
last 25 years or so 
quayle let me try to answer the question one more time i think 
this is the fourth time that i have had this question and 
q third time 
quayle three times that ive had this question and ill try to 
answer it again for you as clearly as i can because the question 
youre asking is what kind of qualifications does dan quayle have 
to be president what kind of qualifications do i have and what 
would i do in this kind of a situation and what would i do in this 
situation 
i would make sure that the people in the cabinet and the people 
and advisors to the president are called ill talk to them and 
ill work with them and i will know them on a firsthand basis 
because as vice president ill sit on the national security 
council and ill know them on a firsthand basis because im going 
to be coordinating the drug effort ill know them on a firsthand 
basis because vice president george bush is going to recreate the 
space council and ill be in charge of that i will have daytoday 
activities with all the people in government 
and then if that unfortunate situation happens if that 
situation which would be very tragic happens i will be prepared to 
carry out the responsibilities of the presidency of the united 
states of america and i will be prepared to do that i will be 
prepared not only because of my service in the congress but 
because of my ability to communicate and to lead it is not just 
age its accomplishments its experience i have far more 
experience than many others that sought the office of vice 
president of this country i have as much experience in the 
congress as jack kennedy did when he sought the presidency i will 
be prepared to deal with the people in the bush administration if 
that unfortunate event would ever occur 
moderator senator bentsen 
bentsen senator i served with jack kennedy i knew jack 
kennedy jack kennedy was a friend of mine senator youre no jack 
kennedy what has to be done in a situation like that applause 
in a situation like that is to call in the joint 
moderator please please once again youre only taking time 
away from your own candidates 
quayle that was really uncalled for senator 
bentsen youre the one that was making the comparison senator 
and im one who knew him well and frankly i think youre so far 
apart in the objectives you choose for your country that i did not 
think the comparison was well taken 
moderator tom a question for senator bentsen 
q since you seem to be taking no hostages on the stage let me 
ask you a question about the american nine still in brutal 
captivity in the middle east senator bentsen you have been 
critical of the irancontra affair but tell me does the 
dukakisbentsen ticket have any realistic plan for getting the 
american hostages being held in the middle east released in any due 
time 
bentsen tom thats one of the toughest problems that any chief 
executive will face because you cant help but have the sympathy 
for that family and for those hostages in themselves but the one 
thing we ought to have know by now is that you cant go out and 
make secret deals with the ayatollah you cant trade arms for 
hostages when you try to do that theres no question but what you 
just encourage more taking of hostages and thats been the result 
by this dumb idea that was cooked out cooked up in the white house 
basement 
and i want to tell you that george bush attending 17 of those 
meetings and having no record of what he said if lloyd bentsen 
was in those meetings you would certainly hear from him and no 
one would be asking where is lloyd because i would be making 
i would be saying thats a dumb idea and now lets put an end to 
it and i would speak up on that type of thing so all you can do 
on that is to continue to push use every bit of diplomatic 
pressure you can what you can do in the way of economic pressure 
in addition to that and thats what you strive to do to have a 
successful release finally of those hostages but not to 
encourage more taking of hostages 
moderator senator quayle 
quayle theres no doubt about it that arms for hostages is 
wrong and it will never be repeated we learn by our mistakes but 
there have been a number of successes in foreign policy in this 
administration but the question goes to a very difficult one how 
do you do it no one has the answer if they did wed wed 
certainly do it but we wont keep trying well keep trying well 
keep the doors open and hopefully some day iran and others who 
control those hostages will want to return to civilized 
international community and they can do that starting now by 
releasing those hostages that are held illegally

one question asked time and time again 
towered over all others in wednesday nights vice presidential 
debate between dan quayle and lloyd bentsen could the indiana 
senator allay doubts about his qualifications for the office 
the question showed quayle at his most prepared looking 
straight into the camera his gestures under control citing his 
12year record in congress 
i have more experience and accomplishments than does the 
governor of massachusetts he said referring to democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis 
as the debate progressed the qualifications question came up 
again and again and quayle responded each time without an obvious 
misstep you could almost hear george bush sigh with relief 
did you see anything that made you wince bush campaign chairman 
james a baker iii was asked immediately after the debate i 
didnt see anything that made we wince when you think about what 
might have happened we have to be pretty happy he said 
if the winner of this debate were determined by advance 
expectations quayle had a claim to victory 
he walked on stage with both his supporters and opponents 
wondering if he would stumble badly he disappointed those who 
hoped he would 
but it was not clear whether quayle eliminated the doubts that 
may not be known until americans vote on nov 8 
how he came across to the millions of tv viewers could be 
critical in determining which ticket gets the support of the large 
number of undecided voters 
poll after national poll indicated that voters had questions 
about quayles qualifications by contrast few americans 
questioned bentsens ability to assume the presidency if called 
upon 
when quayle compared his experience to that of john f kennedy 
it precipitated the sharpest clash of the 90minute debate 
jack kennedy was a friend of mine said bentsen looking at 
his 41yearold opponent senator youre no jack kennedy 
that was uncalled for senator retorted quayle 
the format helped all the questions were asked by a panel of 
four journalists the candidates had no opportunity to question 
each other directly 
but the panel kept the focus on the qualifications issue four 
times quayle was asked to cite his qualifications or say what he 
would do if suddenly he became president 
i dont mean to beat this drum until it has no more sound 
said nbc anchorman tom brokaw as he raised the question once again 
obviously prepared for the question the indiana senator looked 
straight into the camera and declared that age alone is not the 
only qualification 
he cited his involvement in congressional debates on defense and 
arms control his authorship of job training legislation and his 
service on the senate budget committee 
during his minute to respond to the same question bentsen 
sought to up the stakes to turn the question not to qualifications 
for the no 2 job 
the debate tonight is about the presidency itself he said 
bentsen took some heat himself on the question of his 
differences with dukakis on several major issues such as aid to the 
contra rebels in central america gun control abortion and the 
death penalty 
the texas senator was asked whose agenda he would follow if he 
became president 
he never responded to that question 
instead bentsen gave his stock answer saying that we agree 
on so many things on the vast majority of the issues 
the texan also had to respond to questions about his breakfast 
club a shortlived fundraising device under which lobbyists 
paid 10000 for the privilege of having breakfast with the 
chairman of the senate finance committee 
when the existance of the club was publicized bentsen dropped 
it

moderator brit hume a question for senator bentsen 
q senator much of the dukakis and bentsen campaign of late has 
been devoted to the notion that senator quayle isnt ready for the 
vice presidency and perhaps the presidency and certainly nothing 
that you have said here tonight suggests that you think otherwise 
i wonder if you think its really fair for you to advance that view 
in light of the fact that you ran for the presidency not the vice 
presidency in 1976 having not yet completed one full term in the 
senate and having previously served three terms in the house almost 
a quarter of a century earlier when in fact your time in 
washington was about equal to what he has now 
bentsen well i think what you have to look at is the record of 
a man who has served his country served his country in war 
headed up a squadron in combat a man who built a business knew 
what it was to meet a payroll create jobs and then serve in the 
united states senate and one who has been able to bring about some 
of the kinds of legislation that ive been able to bring about in 
my service there 
i must say i didnt do a very good job of running for the 
presidency and im well aware of that but what were looking at 
today is trying to judge once again the breadth of experience and 
the maturity of someone taking on this kind of a task thats the 
judgment that has to be exercised by the people of america its a 
presidential decision that youre facing and its a very important 
one because were talking about whos going to lead this country 
into its future and you cant have a more important responsibility 
than that one 
q senator quayle 
quayle when you look at qualifications you look at 
accomplishments as well as experience and one of the 
accomplishments that im proudest of is the authorship of the job 
training partnership act that has trained and educated and employed 
over 3 million young people and adults that are economically 
disadvantaged 
and we did it in a way that we got the private sector to involve 
itself with the public sector on private industry councils 
throughout america that serve over the service delivery areas we 
have 51 percent of that private industry council that are 
businessmen and women we have members of unions we have 
communitybased organizations we have education leaders and what 
weve been able to do is establish a program thats working thats 
putting people back to work that is an accomplishment and that is 
an accomplishment that i will take with me into the white house 
moderator brit a question for senator quayle 
q senator i want to ask you a question and it may be a little 
off the subject of politics its aimed to get more at the question 
of what sort of person you are i hope that senator bentsen if 
you choose to you might choose to answer the same question in your 
rebuttal time senator can you identify any work of literature or 
art or even a film that you have seen or read or experienced 
anywhere in the last two years that has had a particularly strong 
effect on you and tell us why 
quayle in the last six months i think there are three very 
important books that i read that have had an impact the three 
books are one richard nixons victory in 1999 richard 
lugars senator richard lugars letters to the next 
president bob masseys alexandra nicholas and alexandra 
which deals with the fall of the russian empire and the coming of 
leninism in 1917 
those three books which i read over the last spring vacation 
and early summer had a very definite impact because what former 
president nixon and senator richard lugar were talking about was a 
foreign policy as we move toward the 21st century and the 
historical book of the downfall of the czar and the coming of 
leninism combining those three books together gave me a better 
appreciation of the challenges that we have ahead of us in senator 
lugars book he talks about the advancement of human rights around 
the world he talked about his leadership effort in the philippines 
and south africa where we now see human rights and advancement of 
the reagan agenda 
former president nixon talked about what were going to do after 
detente and arms control and how were going to pursue new arms 
control with the soviet union he talked a little bit about how we 
deal with the soviet union and this is one of the differences 
between george bush and michael dukakis because george bush 
understands to deal with the soviet union and to get progress you 
must deal from a position of strength and the governor of 
massachusetts doesnt understand that i understand it and a 
george bush administration will pursue that policy 
q senator bentsen 
bentsen i think reading pardon me i think reading winds 
of war and guns of august back to back i think that really 
shows you how we make the same mistakes too often over and over 
again and it seems to me that the senator from indiana is 
beginning to do that one as i look on the progress thats been 
made toward disarmament and cutting back on nuclear weapons and 
see what ronald reagan has been able to do with the inf treaty 
and i think he deserves great credit for that one i see a 
situation where the senator from indiana has now jumped off the 
reservation when we talk about building on what ronald reagan has 
done and opposes what ronald reagan wants to do the joint chiefs 
of staff and the secretary of defense and says lets go slow on 
doing further disarmament and trying to get to the next treaty i 
think thats a mistake 
i think that you have to deal with the russians from strength 
and we have to understand that you have to have a strong modernized 
nuclear deterrent but i think we can make substantial progress 
and we ought to take advantage of it i think hes arrived at a 
very dangerous judgment in the question of war and peace and it 
concerns me very much because i saw him also try to sabotage the 
inf treaty when it was on the floor of the united states senate 
with what he was doing there hes listening once again

organizers scorned criticism of the staging 
of wednesday nights debate between dan quayle and lloyd bentsen as 
a lot of nonsense which ignores the reality that the event is 
essentially a television show 
ed fouhy executive producer of the 90minute confrontation 
between the two vice presidential candidates says its his 
business to fret about such seemingly trivial details as camera 
angles and the height of lecterns on the stage of the omaha civic 
auditorium 
this is a television program and weve got some of the best 
production people in the world doing it fouhy said 
sharing fouhys concerns are the democratic and republican 
contenders campaign managers who were eager to exploit the tv 
format to best advantage in the past week of mock debates and 
briefings for the candidates the medium was truly the message 
bentsen for example who is accustomed to the leisurely pace of 
senate debate spent days struggling with limited success to 
distill his debating points into those punchy quotable sound 
bites that tv demands 
about an hour into their debate bentsen unleashed what he had 
learned when quayle summoned up the name of former president john 
kennedy bentsen stared and him and said sternly youre no jack 
kennedy 
the two warmed up with mildbycomparison jabs over campaign 
finances but in general the two candidates stuck to carefully 
scripted performances from the moment they strode onto the red 
white and blue decorated stage 
mike mccurry press secretary for the 67yearold democratic 
senator from texas said before the debate that bentsen was having 
trouble observing the strict time limits specified for the debate 
twominute answers to questions and oneminute rebuttals 
the red light goes off frequently mccurry said 
quayle 41 seems more comfortable in a tv setting has been 
coached by gop nominee george bushs media mastermind roger ailes 
deflecting reporters questions about his debate strategy the 
indiana senator said confidently that they should tune in and 
find out 
during the debate quayle stood casually with one foot propped 
on the podium his face occasionally tightening when the audience 
laughed at a defense of his environmental record and during several 
tough questions tossed at him by panelists 
the league of women voters withdrew as sponsors of the second 
scheduled debate between bush and democratic nominee michael 
dukakis in los angeles in midoctober complaining that campaign 
strategists had turned the event into a charade by grabbing 
tight control of the mechanics of tv coverage 
fouhy told reporters that restrictions demanded by the two 
campaigns were minor he said the biggest was the decision not to 
show the audience of 2000 people in the hall during the debate 
except for fuzzy over the shoulder shots 
a lot of nonsense has been spoken and written about the 
shots fouhy said thats simply wrong you direct a television 
program so people watching at home have a good idea whats 
happening 
janet brown executive director of the bipartisan debate 
commission sponsoring the quaylebentsen clash said its natural 
that both sides will fight hard for any advantage in a closely 
fought presidential race 
im very pleased with all the arrangements ms brown said 
its been a helpful exchange a productive exchange its been a 
very honest exchange from all three parties 
fouhy noted that the first bushdukakis debate on sept 25 was 
viewed by an estimated 35 million households he said details of 
the staging are crucial because millions of people are going to 
watch this debate on television 
the intense interest in this years campaign has put the 
smallest details of the debates under scrutiny debate rules for 
example allow only a threeinch variation in the height of the 
candidates lecterns the final decision is made after each 
candidate makes his allotted onehour visit to the hall closed to 
reporters a few hours before the debate begins 
little appearing on camera has been left to chance even the 
journalists on the debate panel nbcs tom brokaw jon margolis of 
the chicago tribune and abcs britt hume drew lots to determine 
the order in which they asked questions 
fouhy said moderator judy woodruff of public broadcastings 
macneillehrer newshour will use gentle persuasion rather than 
cutting off the microphones of any candidate who talks beyond his 
time limit 
though the main floor of the civic auditorium was turned into a 
large tv studio for the debate the scene was much more informal 
one level below where most of the 1500 reporters covering the 
debate could watch on tv monitors

moderator jon margolis a question for sen quayle 
q sen quayle i want to go back to the matter 
of qualifications which i think for most people is more than 
just 
more than just your how long youve been in the senate 
quayle jon we cant hear you 
q you can hear now 
i want to go back to the question of qualifications which i 
think for most people is more than just how long youve been in the 
senate and how long youve been in public life theres also a 
question of candor and of consistency and several of the things 
youve said both here and earlier i think have raised some 
reasonable questions 
each of them alone might seem rather trivial but i think 
together they create a pattern that needs to be asked youve 
talked a few times today about the job training partnership act 
which you authored in fact i believe you coauthored it with 
another senator whom you almost never name earlier in the 
campaign when you were asked why you got a very a desk job in 
the national guard after being trained as a welder you said at 
the time you had a very strong background in journalism which at 
that time was summer jobs at your familyowned newspaper about 
which you have not been very forthcoming about what they were as 
you have not been very forthcoming about your college record now 
youll have to say you have at least the males on this panel 
have earlier agreed that your record was probably comparable to 
ours 
but nonetheless these examples of sort of overstatement and 
exaggeration and not being forthcoming this is what has led a lot 
of people to question this part of your qualifications not your 
not your experience but your character would you like to set some 
of these things straight now as to what you did in your summer 
jobs in college what your grades were like and would you like to 
identify your cosponsor of the job training partnership act 
quayle all in two minutes 
q sure 
quayle let me let me start with the underlying premise that 
somehow i havent been straight forward and i have and lets go 
right to the very first question the job training partnership 
act i was the author of that the coauthor in the united states 
senate was sen kennedy i was the chairman of the employment and 
productivity subcommittee chairman of the committee write sic 
that legislation chairman of the committee write sic the 
legislation and then they go out and get cosponsorship and when 
you are the chairman of the committee and you sit down and you 
write the legislation you are the author of that 
and im proud to have been the author of that because you know 
what we had we had a ceta program that spent 50 billion dollars 
from about 1973 through 1982 and when we concluded that program 
when we concluded that program unemployment was higher than 
when it began it was a program that didnt work and the job 
training partnership act does work 
now the issue of releasing all of my grades i am and i stand 
before you tonight as the most investigated person ever to seek 
public office thousands of journalists have asked every professor 
ive had all my teachers and they know and ive never 
professed to be anything but an average student i have never said 
that i was anything more than that but its not whether youre an 
average student its what are you going to do with your life and 
what am i going to do with my life i have committed it to public 
service since i was 29 years of age elected to the house of 
representatives elected to the united states senate when i was 33 
and now 
moderator senator sen bentsen 
bentsen i have absolutely no quarrel with sen quayles 
military record but i do strongly disagree with him on some of the 
issues you make great patriotic speeches and i enjoy them but i 
dont understand your vote on veterans issues sen quayle has one 
of the worst voting records in the united states senate on 
veterans issues and one of them that particularly bothers me 
sponsoring legislation to put a tax on combat pay and disability 
pay for veterans for fighting men and women of america tax on 
disability pay when lying there in the hospital people who have 
sacrificed for our country i think you ought to explain that to 
the people of america and you ought to explain it tonight 
moderator jon a question for sen bentsen 
q senator youre chairman of the senate finance committee and 
youre generally considered rather an orthodox conservative on 
fiscal matters meaning someone who would be very concerned about 
the budget deficit with everybody in politics afraid even to 
mention taxes or social security cuts or even very much restraint 
in defense spending would you now list a few specific programs 
which would reduce or eliminate which you would reduce or 
eliminate to cut the deficit by about 50 billion the deficit 
which is expected to be about 135 billion this fiscal year 
bentsen one of them that id work on and i do this as a 
farmer id try to turn the situation around where we have seen the 
subsidy payments go from two and a half billion to ten times that 
under this administration and the way i would accomplish that was 
with a tough trade policy opening up those markets getting 
those prices back up to market prices we can do that if we have an 
aggressive trade policy for our country if we make trade a number 
one priority and not trade it off for some foreign policy objective 
of the moment that means we have to stand up for the american 
farmers and that cuts back on the regulation on american farmers 
thats a positive way to accomplish that in addition to that 
wed do some of the things that i think have to be done insofar as 
doing a better job of procurement particularly when were talking 
about some of our military things that we should buy i know that 
ive fought very hard to put in an independent inspector general 
for the defense department but the senator from indiana opposed me 
on that 
but we were finally able to put that into effect and we saved 
over a quarter of a billion dollars this year almost enough to 
buy a squadron of f16s those are the kinds of things that id work 
on and one of the things i learned in business is that you can 
expect what you inspect so wed be doing a much tougher job of 
auditing to try to get rid of some of these kickbacks to 
consultants on military contracts to be much more aggressive on 
that in addition those types of things would bring the interest 
rate down id try to turn this trade deficit around and that too 
would help us and help us very substantially 
and id get rid of some things like these planes that youre 
going to have that the administration wants that will fly from new 
york to tokyo and take those investment bankers over there in four 
hours i dont think we can afford a piece of technological 
elegance like that id strike that sort of thing from the ticket 
i dont know how many people have ridden the concorde not many 
but i voted against it and said it would be a financial disaster 
and its been just that so those are the types of things that i 
would work on 
moderator sen quayle 
quayle the way were going to reduce this budget deficit and 
it is a challenge to make sure that it is reduced is first to 
stick to the grammrudman targets the grammrudman targets have 
worked weve reduced the federal budget deficit 70 billion 
senator bentsen voted against grammrudman the very tool that 
has been used to bring the federal budget deficit down 
were going to need all the tools possible to bring this federal 
budget deficit down we need the tools of a lineitem veto a 
lineitem veto that 43 governors in this country have but not the 
president of the united states the president of the united states 
needs to have a lineitem veto when congress goes ahead and puts 
into appropriations bills unrequested and unecessary spending let 
the president put a line through that send it back to the 
congress and the let the congress vote on it again congress has 
got to help out in reducing this budget deficit as much as the 
executive branch

moderator tom brokaw a last question for senator bentsen 
q senator bentsen id like to ask you about your split 
personality during this election year youre running on a ticket 
with michael dukakis a man who is opposed to the death penalty a 
man who is in favor of gun control and at the same time youre 
running for the united states senate in the state of texas where 
your position on many of those same issues is well known and 
absolutely opposed to him how do you explain to the people of 
texas how you can be a social conservative on those cutting issues 
and still run with michael dukakis on the national ticket 
bentsen michael dukakis wasnt looking for clone i think its 
part of the strength and the character of this man that he reaches 
out and that he wants someone that will speak up and that ill do 
ive seen many chief executives come into my office and say 
theyre going over and tell the president of the united states off 
theyre going to pound the desk and go into that office and turn 
to jello now i dealt with many a president and i dont hesitate 
for a minute to speak up 
but when youre talking about something like the death penalty 
where michael dukakis and i do disagree what you really ought to 
get to is whats being done against crime and what kind of progress 
hes been able to make in the state of massachusetts he has the 
homicide rate down to the lowest of any industrial state its 
substantially ahead of the national average hes been able to do 
that with a educated program for the people of that state by adding 
some 15hundred new police officers hes done it in turn by the 
leadership that i think he will bring to the ticket when he becomes 
president of the united states and fighting drugs hes taken it 
down some 4 percent in the high schools of that state while its 
gone up around the rest of the nation 
but you would see him as president of the united states being 
very aggressive in this fight against crime and having that kind of 
a successful result and thats one of the reasons im delighted 
and proud to be on the ticket with him sure we have some 
differences but overall we have so many things we agree on this 
situation of a trade policy of cutting back on the deficit those 
are positive plus things and major issues facing our nation 
moderator senator quayle 
quayle one of the things that they dont agree on is in the 
area of national defense national defense and how were going to 
preserve the freedom in this country michael dukakis is the most 
liberal national democrat to seek the office of presidency since 
george mcgovern 
he is for he is against the mx missile the midgetman cutting 
two aircraft carriers he is opposed to many defense programs that 
are necessary to defend this country thats why former secretary 
of defense and former energy secretary in the carter administration 
jim schlesinger in an open letter to time magazine asked governor 
dukakis are you viscerally antimilitary jim schlesinger 
never got an answer and the reason he didnt is because the 
governor of massachusetts doesnt want to answer former secretary 
jim schlesinger on that very important question 
moderator tom a last question for senator quayle 
q senator quayle all of us in our lifetime encounter an 
experience that help shapes our adult philosophy in some form or 
another could you describe for this audience tonight what 
experience you may have had and how it shaped your political 
philosophy 
quayle there are a lot of experiences that ive had that have 
shaped my adult philosophy but the one that i keep coming back to 
time and time again and i talk about at commencement addresses i 
talk about it in the high schools i talk about it when i visit the 
job training centers and its the advice that my maternal 
grandmother martha pulliam whos 97 years old we are a 
modernday fourgeneration family the informa the advice that 
she gave me when i was growing up is advice that ive given my 
children and ive given to a number of children a number of 
people and its very simple its very common sense and she says 
you can do anything you want to if you just set your mind to it 
an go to work 
now the dukakis supporters sneer at that because its common 
sense they sneer at common sense advice midwestern advice 
midwestern advice from a grandmother to a grandson important 
advice something that we ought to talk about because if you want 
to you can make a difference you america can make a difference 
youre going to have that choice come this election everyone can 
make a difference if they want to 
moderator senator bentsen 
bentsen i think being born and reared on the rio grande to 
have spent part of my life seeing some of the struggles that have 
taken place in one of the lowest per capita incomes in the united 
states and thats one of the reasons ive worked so hard to try to 
assist on education and when i found that the bankers in that area 
found that they could not handle the loans because of some of the 
detail and the expense couldnt make a profit on it i went down 
there and helped form a nonprofit organization to buy up those 
loans from them and to manage them and do it in a way where theyd 
continue to make those loans 
now they have and theyve educated more than 20000 of those 
students loaned out over 100 million and it hasnt cost the 
taxpayers of this country one cent its one of the reasons ive 
worked so hard to bring better health care to the people because 
what ive seen in the way of poverty down there in that area and 
the lack of medical attention and trying to see that thats turned 
around why i worked so hard on the welfare reform bill to give 
them a chance to break these cycles of poverty the chance for a 
step up in life

michael dukakis on wednesday accused george bush 
of politically exploiting one tragic case involving a 
massachusetts furlough program said campaign momentum has shifted 
to him and promised five long tough aggressive weeks up to 
the election 
the democratic presidential nominee also praised the performance 
of his running mate lloyd bentsen in the vice presidential 
nominees debate wednesday night with republican dan quayle 
the most important qualification for the vice president is 
that hes ready at a moments notice to assume the presidency of 
the united states dukakis told a rowdy rally with supporters 
shortly after the debate tonight lloyd bentsen demonstrated that 
he was the only one on that stage whos ready 
dukakis who spoke to bentsen immediately after the debate said 
the democrats performance should tell the american people about 
how i make presidential decisions and the way george bush makes 
presidential decisions 
tonight that was no contest he said 
earlier dukakis used the debate to joke about the beginning of 
the american league playoff series between the boston red sox and 
the oakland athletics 
our campaign is picking up steam dukakis told a news 
conference at the massachusetts statehouse where he spent a day 
off the campaign trail catching up on gubernatorial duties you 
can sense it you can feel it and i think its because the 
american people want to move forward 
republican nominee bush has made his criticism of a 
massachusetts furlough program a staple of his campaign and on 
wednesday night aired a new television ad accusing dukakis of 
running a revolving door prison system at the center of bushs 
attacks is a case in which an inmate on furlough raped a maryland 
woman and assaulted her fiance 
dukakis who earlier this year signed legislation tightening 
eligibility requirements for the program said bush was exploiting 
that case despite a comparable federal program 
the vice presidents record on crime and the fight against 
drugs is pathetic dukakis said its been a failure and in my 
judgment this is an effort to use the one case with a tragic 
occurrence for political reasons the vice president knows that the 
federal government has a very extensive furlough program knows 
that governor reagan in california in the 70s had a very extensive 
furlough program and tragedies as a result of that 
that answer came in response a question about suggestions by 
texas democrats that dukakis was trailing in that key state despite 
have a texan running mate because he had not responded forcefully 
enough to bushs attacks on crime gun control and other issues 
dukakis promised he would return the salvos soon and aides said 
they would come as soon as thursday when dukakis planned to visit 
texas with bentsen 
we have five long tough aggressive weeks to go and believe 
me well be tough and aggressive in texas and across this country 
and i think were going to beat them in texas dukakis said 
dukakis also defended his new ads portraying bush as an 
issueless candidate controlled by advisers 
i wanted to express the very strong feeling that i have and 
that i think many have that the bush campaign is essentially a 
packaged candidacy and its important for people to understand 
that said dukakis 
a new set of 30second ads to be aired nationally starting 
wednesday made a more direct attack on bush and his record on drug 
enforcement education the environment and social security the 
four ads said the administration dealt secretly with manuel antonio 
noriega the panamanian drug lord bush personally weakened 
environmental regulations personally cast the tiebreaking 
vote to cut social security and sat by while college loans for 
working families were cut 
the governor also rejected assertions by a former iranian 
official that the democratic nominee had an emissary seeking to 
establish a line of communication with iran and said he hoped the 
former officials assertion that bush had an aide involved in 
hostage negotiations was untrue 
i would hope that and i believe that these efforts to 
release the hostages have nothing to do with this campaign 
dukakis said these families and these hostages have been through 
too much pain and too much agony and too much tragedy as it is 
certainly nobody representing me or someone authorized by me is 
engaged in those kind of discussions 
as for the debate dukakis opened his news conference by saying 
it was a day that weve been waiting a long time for 
dukakis seemingly discussing the debate said he was a little 
nervous and that he had been told by aides to try to lower 
expectations 
im rejecting the advice of my staff dukakis said as 
reporters leaned forward for his prediction the red sox are 
going to win 
his prediction proved wrong the red sox lost 21 
on a more serious note dukakis said he expected bentsen to do 
himself and the democratic ticket proud

for three decades serious mishaps at the 
savannah river nuclear weapons plant were kept secret for national 
security reasons and in some cases not reported to washington 
according to federal officials who are trying to change that 
attitude 
one senior energy department official has compared the approach 
to safety at the savannah river plant near aiken sc to that 
which led to the explosion of the shuttle challenger on jan 28 
1986 
and one member of congress says the facility which has been 
closed since august should not be allowed to reopen until the 
situation improves 
an energy department spokesman will callicott said that since 
the federal government began making atomic weapons in world war ii 
there has always been a mind set a culture that we are doing 
work that is important for national security and perhaps that may 
override any obligation toward public accountablility

a simple urine test that detects bladder cancer 
at a treatable stage may be used to help diagnose prostate and some 
of the other cancers that afflict nearly a million americans 
annually researchers say 
the test detects a protein associated with the spread of tumors 
said dr raouf guirguis of the national cancer institute the 
protein also has been found in patients with kidney cancer 
prostate cancer and a nervous system cancer called neuroblastoma 
it seems to be in all the cancers we have screened guirguis 
said 
existing tests to diagnose bladder cancer involving removal of 
tissue pose risk are often painful and sometimes do not detect 
the cancer until it has spread and can no longer be cured the 
cancer institute said 
but guirguis elliott schiffman and colleagues whose study is 
published in todays journal of the national cancer institute said 
their test can identify bladder cancer at an early treatable stage

supporters of a bill to impose tougher 
restrictions on textile imports after failing to override 
president reagans veto promise to renew their efforts when 
congress returns next year 
well be back sen ernest f hollings dsc said tuesday 
after the house voted 272152 to override reagans veto but fell 11 
votes short of the twothirds needed to enact the measure over his 
objections 
the action appeared to close the book on the battle for textile 
legislation this year with two weeks at most remaining before 
lawmakers adjourn to campaign full time 
the bill designed to protect american industry from foreign 
competition would freeze current textile and apparel imports at 
1987 levels and limit future increases to 1 percent annually the 
same would apply to nonrubber footwear except that no future

a congress split by economic and regional

only once since the clean air act was enacted in 1970 has 
congress been able to agree on major amendments to strengthen the 
basic law and that occurred 11 years ago 
two years ago environmentalists in the house and senate renewed 
the campaign to escalate the battle against urban smog acid rain 
caused by coalburning factories and power plants and toxic fumes 
from chemicals 
on tuesday they tossed in the towel vowing to try again next 
year 
there has not been sufficient willingness to compromise

will do nothing 
mitchell citing this summers smog alerts around the country 
said the technology exists to control air pollution all we lack

since 1981 cbs simon amp simon has led a 
charmed life or a starcrossed one depending on how you look at 
it 
its the eighth season for this oddcouple detective series the 
shows been up down and around it was a flop its first time out 
and cbs renewed it only at the eleventh hour then it became a hit 
until it ran into the cosby show and nbcs thursday night 
juggernaut 
there was even a brouhaha a few years ago when cbs tried to move 
the shows locale from san diego to los angeles san diego still 
smarting over the loss of harry o mounted a postcard campaign 
that caused cbs to back down 
theyve been beating on us for eight years said gerald 
mcraney who costars with jameson parker as brother detectives 
they cant get us down for the count i think the show has 
survived for the most part because weve got good scripts and we 
dont take ourselves too seriously 
the relationship between the brothers and the notion of a 
family make it work that would have worked in elizabethan theater 
loyalty and integrity people like to see those values reaffirmed 
simon amp simon which returns saturday tells the story of 
two brothers who are unalike yet supportive of each other mcraney 
is rick rough eccentric laid back whod rather pluck his guitar 
and have fun parker is aj conservative a snappy dresser whose 
ambition and hard work keeps their detective agency on track 
a lot of detective shows steer clear of comedy said 
mcraney that makes us one of the few onehour comedy shows on 
the air we do a few serious episodes but we have a sibling 
rivalry and thats what makes it fun 
from the beginning jameson and i participated in shaping the 
show we werent just hired help the creator philip deguere 
wanted us to be a part of it ive directed five shows and written 
one we read through the scripts every week and our suggestions are 
listened to seriously 
the show was originally set in florida and was called pirates 
key that was before miami vice and neither universal 
television nor cbs was too keen on filming it in florida the 
locale was changed to san diego although most of the show is 
filmed in los angeles 
mary carver who plays mother to the pair is still with the 
series but other cast members have come and gone as the show has

in 1969 like thousands of other bright 
young indian professionals naresh trehan went abroad to further 
his education 
in less than two decades he was one of the top heart surgeons 
in new york city with an income of 15 million a year an 
apartment on fifth avenue a beachfront house on long island and 
two cars in the garage 
he wanted to come home to bring his wife and two children back 
to their own country but his professional achievements and 
aspirations had reached too high during exploratory trips back to 
india he found no place where he was willing to work 
so he set out to fulfill a new dream a worldclass heart 
hospital in india equipped with stateoftheart computers and 
staffed with indians who had set career goals their country could 
not accommodate 
his indian dream became a reality when the 170bed escorts heart 
institute and research center opened in new delhi in midseptember 
its like climbing a new mountain the 42yearold trehan 
said its a passion for me to come back and train others 
in new york trehan performed heart bypass operations and heart 
transplants he was director of cardiovascular surgery at the 
manhattan veterans administration hospital and he remains an 
assistant professor of surgery at new york university 
some years at least 10 percent of his patients were fellow 
indians trehan reasoned that wealthy indians who go abroad for 
heart surgery would pay comparable prices for the same quality of 
treatment at home while saving the cost of air fare and the 
hassle of travel 
their fees would help offset free or subsidized treatment for 
others 
trehan enlisted a wealthy industrial family to help bankroll the 
new hospital whose startup cost was budgeted at 20 million and 
according to trehan will probably rise news of the project spread 
by word of mouth among indian doctors working in the united states 
and western europe 
i was always thinking that we could do it here said dr 
sunil sharma who quit a job at george washington university 
hospital in washington dc to become the escorts centers chief 
bacteriologist and infection control officer 
sharma 33 declined to disclose present salary but said it is 
about onetenth of what he made in washington 
the main attraction he said was the chance to live and work 
among his own people 
the standard of living is so high abroad but we are more 
emotionally attached to our patients here sharma said in the 
states everybody is afraid of malpractice suits but here we 
treat from the core of our hearts 
of the 30 doctors now on staff at escorts 12 have returned from 
abroad 
there were more mundane problems to deal with in establishing 
the new heart center 
this hospital is going to be 100 percent flyproof trehan 
declared as he strode across the polishedstone lobby to the front 
door where a powerful downdraft of air from the ceiling thwarts 
entry of flies and mosquitos 
flies seem to be a standard part of hospital life in india 
along with families who camp in the courtyards and hallways cook 
meals and try to keep track of a noisy assortment of halfnaked 
children 
at jp narain hospital one of new delhis largest it is 
possible to walk in off the street and wander through corridors and 
wards without being questioned people lie on the floors and 
barefoot women in tattered saris flail the hallways with twig 
brooms that stir up dust without sweeping it away 
at the escorts center security guards check visitors for passes 
we are training our staff to a totally different level 
trehan said and for the first time we have introduced a 
housekeeping service similar to that in hotels 
a formula was reached with the government under which 40 percent 
of all outpatients and 10 percent of all inpatients would be 
treated free of charge about 25 percent of the rest would be given 
subsidized rates while the rest would pay full costs 
trehan as the centers executive director will still perform 
surgery and plans to work for free if patients cant afford his 
bill the other doctors had to agree to do the same 
one of the hospitals first patients was santosh rani arora a 
46yearold widow a bout with rheumatic fever 22 years ago left 
her with a severe aortic disease that causes her heart valves to 
leak 
surgery in 1970 and 1983 failed to solve the problem according 
to her sons sunil and anil both government civil servants 
the sons expressed concern about being able to afford escorts 
charges but trehan told them they could pay 352 for an 
angiography test that normally would cost about 463 
later when the family had left trehan said he expected to 
perform surgery on mrs arora 
i can forgo my fee he said i expect that we can help 
them out with the rest and they can come up with whatever they can 
so we can recover the cost of some of the consumables supplies and 
medicine

scottish nationalists are counting on 
a widely unpopular reform of property taxes to lift them out of a 
decadelong spell in the cold 
they talk of a scottishstyle boston tea party and while the 
tax is not the trigger that will blast scotland out of the united 
kingdom it is helping to stoke what the scotsman newspaper calls 
a creeping resurgence of nationalism 
the poll tax as the sweeping reform is known is central to 
prime minister margaret thatchers crusade against socialism and 
highspending leftwing local governments in britain but to many 
scots it is a highhanded edict from a thoroughly english prime 
minister who they believe has no mandate north of the border 
the scottish national party which seeks outright independence 
for the 52 million scots is organizing a nonpayment campaign 
the tax also is a springboard for the more broadly based movement 
seeking devolution limited selfgovernment under an elected 
scottish parliament 
scotlands yen to end the 281yearold union with england has 
always ebbed and flowed in the mid1970s it was powerful enough to 
force a referendum on devolution but collapsed when the referendum 
failed to deliver a change 
the scottish nationalist party plummeted from 11 seats in the 
650member house of commons in london to just two but last year it 
gained an extra seat and made significant advances in the may 
local elections and while it has never commanded a plurality of 
scottish votes polls consistently indicate that threequarters of 
scots favor selfgovernment 
the 1970s surge was prompted by a sense that scotland wasnt 
getting enough revenue from its offshore oil boom 
now its the poll tax or community charge as the government 
calls it which takes effect in scotland in april and will spread 
to the rest of britain a year later 
basically it shifts local taxation from property to people 
requiring each local authority to calculate its expenses and 
accordingly set a uniform sum to be paid by every resident over age 
18 
the government says it is fairer simpler and makes local 
government more accountable because municipalities will no longer 
be able to use funds collected from middleclass homeowners to 
finance generous social programs for those who pay little or no tax 
while replacing the property tax the poll tax expected to 
average about 260 pounds 340 a year per adult is in addition to 
the national income tax that scots and all others in britain must 
pay 
but the poll tax provides for 80percent rebates for those with 
low incomes 
the government estimates onethird of scots will receive 
rebates but a recent opinion poll reports 70percent disapproval 
of the poll tax with 52 percent of scots believing they will be 
worse off and only 18 percent expecting to benefit 
judging by election results scotland doesnt share mrs 
thatchers distaste for socialism her conservative partys share 
of the scottish vote has fallen from 50 percent in 1955 to 24 
percent in last years general election and the party holds only 
10 scottish seats in parliament compared with the socialist 
opposition labor partys 50 
scottish national party lawmaker alex salmond calls nonpayment 
the greatest moral and political challenge that the tory 
government has yet faced in scotland 
but the labor party risks being upstaged by the nationalists 
because it has voted not to espouse civil disobedience fearing it 
would appear unfit for government 
a dozen of labors scottish members of parliament in london are 
defying party policy and one of them denis kanavan has already 
been fined 50 pounds 85 for refusing to register for the poll 
tax 
its not good enough for labor to tell people to stop the tax 
through the ballot box kanavan said in an interview we tried 
that and won last year in scotland but we failed to stop it 
but opinion polls indicate that only 24 percent of scots are 
likely to refuse payment and more than 90 percent have registered 
for the tax 
the litmus test is likely to come sometime this autumn or next 
spring when glasgows govan district holds a byelection to fill a 
vacant parliamentary seat 
the polls favor victory for labor whose candidate bob 
gillespie is one of the rebels refusing to pay the tax but 
anything less than a crushing labor victory will be seen as a boost 
for the scottish nationalist party which is fielding jim sellars 
a former laborite 
the nationalists scotlandwide support has risen from 17 to 23 
percent in recent polls and they believe that once poll tax 
assessments start reaching scottish households that support will 
soar

despite watergateinspired curbs on election 
spending millions of dollars are pouring into republican and 
democratic campaign treasuries from fat cat contributors this fall 
and its all legal 
documents made available to reporters recently show that both 
political parties are avidly courting the kind of bigmoney 
donations that were tarnished by revelations of watergateera 
abuses and then supposedly curtailed by election law reforms of the 
1970s 
the biggest republican contributor is nicholas salgo former 
us ambassador to hungary who was listed as giving more than 
500000 to his party the democrats say a couple of unidentified 
unions are giving 200000 each 
both parties are going after individuals willing to give 
100000 or more the gop claims it has 115 such givers so far in 
the 1988 campaign the democratic national committee counts 100 fat 
cats with a goal of doubling the number 
these funds are known as soft money because federal law 
prohibits unions and corporations from making direct contributions 
to federal election campaigns and limits individuals to giving 
1000 in presidential primaries only 
in the general election the presidential nominees are forbidden 
to accept any private donations because each receives 461 million 
from a treasury fund supported by the voluntary 1 checkoff on 
individual income tax returns plus 83 million from his party 
so millions of dollars in soft money are funneled through the 
parties to finance political activities at the state and local 
level which are not subject to federal regulation even at that 
level the parties have no trouble finding ways to use soft money 
for activities such as voter registration and tv commercials that 
clearly benefit their presidential candidates 
what is happening in 1988 is its becoming clearer and 
clearer that soft money is making a joke of the campaign finance 
laws said ellen miller director of the center for responsive 
politics a research organization that advocates tightening 
campaign finance laws 
the list of soft money receipts released by the democrats which 
covers only june and july included 48 million of about 15 
million the party has raised in soft money so far 
no public accounting of soft money is required and the 
democrats say they will make no further fundraising disclosures 
until after the nov 8 elections 
robert farmer fundraising chief for democratic nominee michael 
dukakis and head of the victory fund says the party has a 50 
million goal this year with about 20 million coming from 
bigspending individuals 
the gop files showed 10 million in soft money raised through 
midseptember but did not include details of an additional 16 
million raised by a victory 88 operation and slated for 
separate accounts in each state 
party officials say the victory 88 goal is to raise 25 million 
in the states while another soft money program team 100 will 
bring in about 15 million 
vice president george bush the republican nominee frequently 
attends glittery fundraising events in banquet halls or private 
homes to help bolster the gops victory 88 effort farmer 
mines the telephone network of wealthy democratic donors and 
concentrates on bigticket galas featuring dukakis 
while raising millions of dollars in soft money the two major 
parties are stretching the rules to the limit but they nonetheless 
are acting legally under guidelines which the federal election 
commission is under court order to tighten up 
despite the federal ban on direct contributions to the 
candidates party officials make support for bush or dukakis a big 
part of their pitch to potential donors 
we make it quite clear that they are not contributing to 
michael dukakis said don sweitzer finance director for the 
democratic national committee michael dukakis is on the 
democratic ticket and therefore he benefits indirectly from these 
funds theyre inspired by the head of the ticket to support the 
entire ticket 
florida developer joe zappala cochairman of republicans team 
100 group of 100000 donors said that when you talk about 
george bush people are fairly receptive 
zappalas tactic goes like this you apprise people of the 
cost to run an election its expensive we tell them we are 
running behind in fund raising we dont want to lose an election 
because we are running out of money 
the democrats traditionally the fundraising underdogs say 
they have collected 38 million toward their 50 million goal this 
year of that sum sweitzer said about 15 million is in soft 
money 
contrary to the ominous warnings in zappalas pitch the gop 
national committee boasts 67 million in overall receipts so far 
this year 
of that total 13 million is soft money being raised in state 
accounts toward a goal of 25 million plus nearly 10 million that 
has come from fat cat donors pricey galas and the partys 
eagle program of 10000peryear givers 
both parties say its not easy persuading individuals to give 
100000 or more but there seem to be plenty of willing donors 
people are surprised they can give that much zappala said 
theres been a lot of concerns about the federal legal limits we 
explain to them it is legal

the republicans received 18650 from southern air transport of 
miami which figured in the irancontra affair as the carrier used 
by former white house aide oliver norths secret network to ferry 
arms and supplies to the nicaraguan contras 
not all members of the gop team 100 group of 100000 givers 
are reflected in the records because some may have given money

analysts say the outlook for crude oil futures 
prices remains negative despite recent stability 
the november contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude rose 1 cent tuesday to settle at 1307 a barrel on the 
new york mercantile exchange 
the contract skidded 86 cents over friday and monday to 1306 a 
barrel the lowest close for a nearterm wti contract since august 
1986 
concerns about oversupply of crude have brought prices down by 
about 2 a barrel over the past five weeks those concerns were 
heightened monday by saudi arabias threat to step up its crude 
output unless other members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries abide by their opec production quotas 
oil prices opened higher tuesday amid rumors that opec would 
move its ministerial meeting scheduled for november up to later 
this month said john azarow a trader with shearson lehman hutton 
inc 
an early meeting raises speculation over the prospect of an 
agreement among opec members to rein in the cartels production 
but the rally which analysts said was based on technical 
factors soon ran out of steam the november crude contract went as 
high as 1330 a barrel before slipping back 
were still in a bear market said jim fiedler a trader 
with edampf man international futures inc the market was 
expecting a rally of up to the 1370 level and they havent been 
able to get it 
besides opec rumors there was no news to affect trading 
analysts said 
the main thing goes back to the concerns about the saudi 
overproduction fiedler said 
among refined products traded on the mercantile exchange the 
november contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 087 cent to 
4111 cents a gallon while home heating oil rose 039 cent to 
3817 cents a gallon 
azarow said some of the movement in refined products was due to 
seasonal factors such as a decline in driving that lowers demand 
for gas and the onset of cooler weather that increases heating oil 
use

kohlberg kravis roberts amp co hasnt yet 
launched a formal hostile takeover of kroger co but in sweetening 
its buyout proposal for the supermarket giant it has outlined plans 
to keep stepping up the buyout pressure 
kohlberg kravis late tuesday offered to pay 64 a share in cash 
and securities for each of krogers 786 million outstanding 
shares an indicated total of 503 billion and repeated its 
request to meet with the kroger board 
the amount of the latest proposal topped not only the buyout 
firms previous offer of 5850 a share or about 46 billion but 
also the proposed 46 billion restructuring plan that krogers 
board of directors approved last month to thwart any outside 
takeover 
furthermore kohlberg kravis indicated that if kroger decided to 
go through with the restructuring the firm was willing to buy the 
surviving company and it hinted kohlberg also might be willing to 
take its offer directly to kroger shareholders 
we have come forth with what we believe is an exceptional 
offer for your companys shareholders and we are confident that if 
given the opportunity your shareholders would embrace it 
kohlberg kravis said in a letter to the board of cincinnatibased 
kroger 
kohlberg kravis announced its sweetened offer after the close of 
stock trading tuesday in new york kroger shares dipped 87 cents 
to 5537 a share in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange 
the kroger companys management legal and financial advisers 
are reviewing the second unsolicited proposal from kkr paul 
bernish a spokesman for kroger said late tuesday he said the 
company had no further comment 
kroger has been resisting overtures from kohlberg kravis and the 
haft family of maryland which had offered 432 billion or 55 a 
share for kroger 
kohlberg kravis specializes in leveraged buyouts purchases 
made with mostly borrowed money that is repaid with funds from the 
target companys operations or the sale of its assets 
the firm rarely has engaged in an outright hostile takeover 
partly because the success of its deals often depends on having 
existing management remain with the target company 
but as its coffers have bulged with money from investors anxious 
to participate in buyouts kohlberg kravis has an estimated 56 
billion warchest that can be used as equity to leverage about seven 
times that amount pressure has mounted for the firm to be more 
aggressive in creating deals 
kohlberg kravis sweetened offer includes 50 in cash 11 in 
debt securities and 3 in stock of the new company that kohlberg 
kravis would create from kroger the investment firms earlier 
offer contained the same cash portion of 50 but only 850 in 
securities 
krogers restructuring announced sept 13 would pay stockholders 
a special dividend of 40 a share in cash securities valued at 8 
plus stock in the surviving company valued at 5 to 10 a share 
kohlberg kravis said that if kroger undertook the plan kohlberg 
would be willing to acquire the stock in the restructured company 
for 1350 a share 10 in cash and 350 a share in debentures 
as such kroger stockholders would realize a total of 6150 a 
share in cash and securities from both parties 
the investment firm noted the alternative postretructuring 
buyout would be for 250 a share less than its upfront offer and 
said the difference reflected its estimates of financing fees 
kroger would have to pay under the restructuring plan plus 
kohlbergs added costs in financing kroger debt incurred in the 
restructuring 
krogers restructuring also includes layoffs and the sale of 
operations in order to streamline the company and cut costs 
kroger operates more than 1300 supermarkets 935 convenience 
stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states the company also 
processes food products for sale in its stores and to outside 
customers

in launching a 517 billion bid for 
pillsbury co britains grand metropolitan plc is proposing to 
strip pillsbury of a division that has helped make the company 
vulnerable to a takeover 
grand metropolitan said in a filing with the securities and 
exchange commission that if its 60ashare bid begun tuesday 
succeeds it would sell pillsburys steak amp ale and bennigans 
restaurant operations 
the underperforming fullservice restaurant division was 
restructured in january resulting in a 91 million charge that has 
dragged down earnings the restructuring also precipitated 
management changes including the hiring of former general foods 
corp chairman philip l smith as its own new chairman in july 
grand metropolitan indicated it would sell steak amp ale and 
bennigans because of state laws prohibiting a company from owning 
both alcoholic beverage makers and retailers 
pillsbury is using that issue to challenge the takeover bid 
although by tuesday it had not actually or approved of the offer 
in a statement issued late tuesday smith said pillsbury had 
sued to block the acquisition in 13 states contending a buyout by 
grand met would violate liquor laws prohibiting producers from 
owning liquor retailers 
courts in texas oklahoma new mexico michigan kansas 
pennsylvania and missouri have issued temporary restraining orders 
enjoining grand met from acquiring any pillsbury stock and a 
delaware court has rejected grand mets effort to stop those 
actions pillsbury said 
grand met a 10 billion a year diversified company is one of 
the worlds biggest wine and spirit makers with brands that 
include smirnoff vodka jampb scotch gilbeys gin watney and ushers 
ale and almaden wines 
in a separate statement pillsbury said that its board would 
review the offer at an appropriate time 
smith said at the companys annual shareholders meeting in 
september that one of his chief goals was keeping the company 
independent but on tuesday industry analysts doubted pillsbury 
could defend itself against the takeover bid and remain independent 
pillsbury stock soared by 1850 a share to 5750 on the new 
york stock exchange tuesday the first trading session after grand 
met made its offer 
its going to be a bid that pillsbury management is going to 
have difficulty defending against said john m mcmillen an 
analyst for prudentialbache securities inc in new york i think 
theyll fight it initially attempt to fight it but i think its 
a losing battle 
ian a martin grand metropolitans chief executive for us 
operations said tuesday in minneapolis that he is very 
interested in doing this thing in a gentlemanly manner 
pillsburys struggling restaurant division which includes the 
burger king fastfood chain provides about half pillsburys 62 
billion in annual revenue martin said grand metropolitan would 
keep burger king but would sell distron pillsburys inhouse 
distribution system for burger king 
londonbased grand metropolitan also owns hotels the alpo pet 
food company pearle vision centers and a chain of betting offices 
in england and ireland 
analysts speculated grand metropolitan was most interested in 
pillsbury for its green giant vegetable haagendazs ice cream and 
van de kamps frozen fish operations 
martin said there were good prospects for marketing pillsburys 
food products overseas especially its microwavable foods further 
grand metropolitan proposed in a letter to smith that minneapolis 
become the headquarters of a grand met international foods group 
martin who met with a number of state officials while waiting 
for a response from pillsbury said grand metropolitan decided to 
move aggressively with a tender offer because pillsbury officials 
had indicated that if anyone came near the drawbridge they would 
have a real catanddog fight 
grand metropolitan filed suit on monday in delaware chancery 
court to invalidate pillsburys poison pill takeover defense 
which would make a hostile merger prohibitively expensive 
pillsbury is incorporated in delaware 
pillsbury also might seek protection from minnesota lawmakers 
who met in special session last year to pass legislation protecting 
minneapolisbased dayton hudson corp from a possible hostile 
takeover bid by the haft family

ltv steel co of cleveland a subsidiary of 
dallasbased ltv corp plans to sell its ohiobased steel bar 
division as part of the parent companys reorganization under 
federal bankruptcy laws 
the company had indicated several months ago that it did not 
intend to reorganize with what it considered marginally profitable 
operations said joseph coyle director of the united steel 
workers of america district 27 
ltv corp has hired shearson lehman hutton inc to help find a 
qualified buyer for the division 
shearson also recently helped ltv steel find a buyer warren 
consolidated industries inc for its warren mill and its republic 
drainage products plant in canton 
ltv steels bar division employs about 5400 salaried or hourly 
workers and the union represents about 4200 with 3200 at ohio 
operations in canton and massillon 
company representatives met tuesday in canton with public and 
union officials 
theres always uncertainty and some apprehension the company 
assured us its their intention to sell to a purchaser with a 
commitment to keep it profitable and more profitable in the 
future coyle said 
j peter kelly ltv steel executive vice president said at a 
news conference following the meeting there was no deadline set for 
a sale 
the process will necessarily take a considerable period of 
time kelly said precisely what that will be is impossible for 
us to forecast but it is nothing that is going to happen tonight 
next week or even next month 
separate management marketing sales customer service 
engineering and research operations already exist in the bar 
division ltv steel president david h hoag said in a statement 
the bar division is well positioned and prepared to operate 
apart from ltv steel hoag said he described the division as a 
leading producer of high quality carbon and alloy steel bars 
raymond a hay ltv chairman and chief executive officer said 
the steel segment is trying to focus on flatrolled and tubular 
products 
we have concluded that ltv steel must focus its resources on 
its large modern flatrolled facilities in order to maintain a 
leadership position in production of highquality valueadded 
steels for critical engineering applications hay said in a 
statement issued from dallas

nbc says it will offer buyouts to as many as 140 
engineers and technicians in an effort to trim at least 40 
employees from its work force 
dom giofre a spokesman for the television network said the 
buyout offer was prompted by the recent sale of nbcs radio 
operation and by the winding down of 1988 political coverage 
i dont think this really comes as a real surprise to 
anyone said michael sherlock nbc president of operations and 
technical services 
he said only employees in new york are involved 
nbc has has dramatically reduced its payroll since it was 
acquired by general electric co two years ago 
about 400 people in the news division have lost their jobs and 
another 110 are scheduled to go before the end of the year 
the engineers and technicians were scheduled to be notified 
beginning today in a series of meetings with supervisors 
if all 140 people accept they will pay it although they are 
aiming to cut only 40 positions said paul mcelroy a spokesman 
for local 11 of the national association of broadcast employees and 
technicians 
workers will have until nov 10 to accept the voluntary offer 
those who accept will continue to receive regular paychecks as 
well as health and other benefits through the end of the year the 
balance of the severance would be paid in a lump sum on jan 2 
sherlock said 
currently nbc employs about 1000 technicians down by 300 
since a 118day strike in 1987

americas growing love affair with light trucks 
towed the auto industry to its thirdbest year on record as car 
makers reported selling 156 million vehicles in the 1988 model 
year 
the 07 percent increase over the 155 million vehicles sold 
during the 1987 model year was fattened by strong sales of 
usmade light trucks including pickups minivans and sports 
utility vehicles 
the overall increase came despite a slight dip in sales of cars 
the automakers reported tuesday 
foreign and domestic car makers reported car sales slipped 14 
percent to about 104 million cars in the model year ended last 
friday from about 105 million cars sold during the year before 
but sales of light trucks rose 42 percent to 51 million in 
1988 from 49 million in the 1987 model year 
leading the way were usmade trucks rising to 44 million 
vehicles this year compared just less than 4 million last year an 
112 percent increase sales of light trucks made outside the 
united states tumbled 249 percent to 724584 vehicles in the 1988 
model year from 961465 in the year before 
there has been a lot of competition for trucks on the domestic 
and foreign side said jeannette garretty of the bank of america 
in san francisco that hasgiven the appearance and the 
actuality that you can swing a good deal in that market 
but overall car sales have drooped industry leader general 
motors corp was the only loser among the big three in the 1988 
model year with sales of about 36 million usmade cars between 
oct 1 1987 and sept 30 1988 down 49 percent from the 
3719267 domestically made cars it sold the year before 
ford motor cos sales rose 29 percent to 214 million cars in 
1988 from 207 million in 1987 chrysler corp sales rose 3 percent 
to about 105 million cars in 1988 from 101 million during the 
year before 
overall sales made it a strongerthanexpected model year which 
analysts had anticipated would see sales of about 15 million 
vehicles or less 
i think its particularly surprising in light of what the 
initial expectations were postoct 19 of last year when the 
stock market crashed said analyst douglas laughlin of bear 
stearns amp co of new york 
i was looking more for 14 million in that period i had to 
consistently raise it through the period he said 
the model year ended on a downturn for the automakers as 
september sales of imported cars and trucks fell to 268362 
vehicles down 166 percent from the 321656 vehicles sold during 
the same month last year 
sales of usmade cars and trucks dipped 22 percent in 
september to 895861 vehicles from 916410 vehicles during 
september 1987 
gm showed the largest car sales decline in the sept 2130 
period dropping 15 percent to 116028 cars this year from 136483 
during the same period last year 
fords late september sales fell to 70813 cars down 143 
percent from 82606 during the period last year

a getty petroleum corp executive says a bidding 
war has erupted over bankrupt clark oil amp refining corp a leading 
midwest discount gasoline marketer 
stephen salzman gettys senior vice president said tuesday 
that his company plans to submit a bid for clark and other assets 
of apex oil co that will top the 650 million offered by 
torontobased horsham corp 
salzman said gettys proposal will be filed in us bankruptcy 
court in st louis by late monday getty is based in jericho ny 
bruce walter a horsham vice president promised a battle for 
the company 
it had been our intention to acquire clark oil he said 
weve invested a significant amount of time and money in 
developing and structuring this transaction he said we will 
not give up the fight easily 
clark acquired by clayton mobased apex oil in 1981 owns 
about 958 gas stations in 12 states as well as a dozen fuel 
terminals and two small factories in illinois 
under terms of a plan submitted in bankruptcy court five weeks 
ago a horsham subsidiary would acquire clark and other apex 
properties including a colorado ski resort for cash and the 
assumption of debt at a discount 
among horshams partners in the deal is samuel zell the chicago 
investor whose burgeoning business empire includes itel corp 
zell said recently that he and horsham want clark because they 
believe the refining and marketing business will be a steady 
moneymaker during a period of anticipated low oil prices 
under the timetable set by the bankruptcy court the rival bids 
will be reviewed next week a full hearing on the purchase will be 
held oct 31 when the judge could approve one of the proposals

a new 50 million agreement between scandinavian 
airlines system and texas air corp is designed to strengthen the 
competitive positions of both companies officials say 
separately a report published today said texas air is holding 
discussions to sell its east coast air shuttle to developer donald 
trump according to unidentified sources quoted by the wall street 
journal the pricetag on the threecity shuttle is in the 200 
million range 
as evidence the shuttle is up for sale journal sources noted 
that planes and lounge areas have been refurbished and attendants 
are getting new uniforms the service is run by eastern airlines 
texas air declined comment on the journal report said mark 
johnson a spokesman for the airline company representatives of 
trump werent immediately available for comment 
some say trump might use the shuttle which operates between 
washington new york and boston to help draw people to his hotel 
and casino properties in atlantic city nj 
trump already operates a helicopter service between new york and 
atlantic city 
under texas airs agreement with sas the scandinavian airline 
will lease airport gates in the new york area and have the right to 
buy up to 10 percent of texas airs stock on the open market 
the accord signed tuesday also includes provisions for 
coordinating marketing reservations and scheduling and the 
companies will establish a joint training program for airline 
workers 
texas air the largest us airline company owns continental 
airlines and eastern airlines which have been hurt by financial 
losses labor problems and complaints about service 
sas renowned for service but weak in scheduling connections to 
the united states has been seeking ways of positioning itself to 
exploit the era of european deregulation that will begin in 1992 
our aim is to maximize efficiency and provide the best 
professional service to business travelers anywhere in the world 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo told reporters at a new york press 
briefing 
under the agreement sas will pay continental 15 million to 
lease three gates at newark international airport in new jersey 
beginning next spring sas will pay eastern 10 million for a 
similar lease arrangement at new yorks john f kennedy 
international airport in 1991 
sas also will pay texas air 25 million 
sas will have the right to buy up to 10 percent of texas airs 
stock on the open market and sas officials said they intended to 
make the purchases within six months 
texas air stock was the most actively traded issue tuesday on 
the american stock exchange declining 12 cents to 1425 the 
company has 399 million shares outstanding 
jan carlzon sas president and chief executive officer will 
become a member of texas airs board of directors 
the marriage of a financially pressed us airline company and a 
serviceoriented european carrier makes sense for both analysts 
said 
sas will get the access to us routes that it is seeking while 
texas air will get cash that it needs noted anthony hatch an 
analyst for argus research corp 
the agreement is not unprecedented but it combines elements of 
existing arrangements in a new way united airlines the biggest 
us carrier signed an agreement with british airways late last 
year setting up a worldwide marketing partnership 
but unlike the accord between sas and texas air the 
unitedbritish airways combination doesnt include an equity stake 
sas equity stake in texas air helps them cement the alliance 
hatch said 
as european deregulation approaches similar accords between 
major airlines in the united states and europe are likely to crop 
up said andrew geller an airline analyst for provident national 
bank in philadelphia 
in another case ansett transport industries ltd an australian 
conglomerate owned 5050 by media tycoon rupert murdoch and 
transportation company tnt ltd has a 20 percent stake in america 
west airlines based in tempe ariz the two do not have a 
cooperative agreement 
officials of sas and texas air said they began discussions for 
such an alliance about nine months ago at lorenzos initiative 
sas has similar arrangements with thai international airways of 
thailand and recently purchased a stake in argentinas national 
carrier 
continental currently has services from newark international 
airport to london and paris and from miami to london sas heavily 
used by business travelers flies between scandinavia and four us 
cities new york chicago los angeles and seattle 
the scandinavian flag carrier 50 percent owned by the 
governments of sweden denmark and norway has tried to develop 
what its management calls a global axis strategy to provide 
travelers with the most convenient connections through a network of 
cooperation pacts with other carriers

acid rain is more widespread than 
earlier believed with more than half of europes lakes and rivers 
contaminated according to a report to an international conference 
which ended wednesday 
the report to the unsponsored convention on longrange 
transboundary air pollution said the extent of the damage could be 
much worse since the research was mainly based on information 
provided by the countries concerned 
in some cases it is too late to do anything said kaarle 
kenttamies head of the finnish environment ministry team which 
conducted the survey commissioned by the nordic council of 
ministers 
in other countries particularly the peripheral regions such 
as scandinavia and southernmost europe there is still hope 
kenttamies said 
but many small lakes and rivers especially in central europe 
are dead and only a 100 percent drop in sulphur emissions can save 
them he said dumping a heavy dose of lime also helps reduce 
acidity he said 
the yearlong research showed nearly all smaller bodies of water 
in central europe can no longer be used as sources of drinking 
water kenttamies said 
the conference which drew participants from the united states 
the soviet union and nine west european nations urged the economic 
commission for europe to adopt stricter measures to fight pollution 
caused by nitrogen and sulphur emissions 
ecemember countries have decided to start a joint transboundary 
pollution monitoring project in 1989 to study environmental changes 
caused by acid rain 
the research is aimed at an indepth study and classification of 
data as well as creating an integrated monitoring system on 
acidification across europe and northern america 
despite certain opposition to such research particularly in 
the united states and great britain we can safely say that 
acidification is one of the worst pollution problems of the 
1980s kenttamies said 
kenttamies rejected as nonsense the argument that no 
conclusive evidence exists that fossil fuelfired power stations 
are a main contributor to acid rain 
whatever people say ive seen enough reports and been to 
enough conventions like the one here today to know that we have 
such conclusive evidence he said 
the high cost of fighting acid rain is a problem for countries 
which rely heavily on fossil fuels britain and poland both heavy 
coal users are the only european nations which refused to join the 
thirty percent club whose aim is to reduce 1980level sulphur 
emissions 30 percent by 1993 
acid rain in scandinavia mostly from industrial centers in 
eastern and western europe also has contaminated lakes and forests 
finns were recently shocked to learn of heavy pollution in what 
had been considered virgin lapland in northern finland caused by 
massive soviet copper and nickel works from industries in the kola 
peninsula according to reports 
a joint commission currently meeting in yalta was set up by 
the finns and the russians to study crossborder pollution which 
is threatening the livelihood of northern finns dependent on 
reindeer husbandry

an aide to drexel burnham lambert incs 
highyield bond financier michael milken recently was compelled to 
testify before a federal grand jury investigating the securities 
firm the aides lawyer said wednesday 
james dahl was forced to appear before the grand jury in the 
last few weeks under a compulsion order obtained by the manhattan 
us attorneys office dahls lawyer peter fishbein told the 
associated press 
the wall street journal characterized dahls appearance as a 
breakthrough for the government in its extensive probe into the 
business affairs of milken and drexel who are fighting securities 
and exchange commission charges of securities fraud and could face 
possible criminal indictments soon 
but it was unclear from the journal account how dahls 
appearance represented a breakthrough the content of his remarks 
to the grand jury were not disclosed 
dahl is not a cooperating witness fishbein said he was 
compelled to do that by a court order if he didnt testify he 
would have been put in jail 
fishbein said the order contained a provision for immunity from 
prosecution which is specified in the federal law for obtaining 
such orders the attorney declined to comment on what dahl may have 
told the grand jury 
officials at the manhattan us attorneys office did not 
immediately return telephone calls for comment their policy 
however is to refrain from commenting on grand jury matters 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said the firm doesnt comment on 
grand jury proceedings but he said drexels lawyers had advised 
the firm that grants of limited immunity were not unusual in such 
investigations 
dahl who is still employed by the firm works in drexels west 
coastbased highyield bond department headed by milken 
the journal said dahl was the first drexel official to break 
ranks and cooperate with the governments inquiry since the sec 
filed its civil charges against the firm and milken sept 7 
accusing them of insider trading stock manipulation defrauding 
clients and other violations 
those charges denied by the defendants stem largely from 
claims by nowimprisoned speculator ivan f boesky who turned 
states evidence after paying a record 100 million fine to the 
government two years ago for insider trading federal investigators 
have been working to substantiate boeskys assertions with other 
evidence but there are indications they have been frustrated in 
obtaining supporting testimony from others 
lawyers for drexel and milken meantime have been fighting 
aggressively to obtain whatever evidence the government has to 
prepare their defense they also have challenged the objectivity of 
the federal judge assigned to the case milton pollack on grounds 
his wife has an interest in a drexelfinanced deal 
in a related matter another federal judge ruled the government 
has the right to freeze funds of innocent partners in an unindicted 
investment partnership when other partners are accused in a 
racketeering case 
the tuesday decision by us district judge robert carter is 
significant because the case involving princetonnewport partners 
a small partnership based in princeton nj represents the first 
time the government has brought racketeering charges against 
securities professionals 
carters ruling apparently gives the government broad authority 
to tie up a firms legitimate businesses even when it isnt 
accused of a crime the implication is enormous for drexel if any 
of its employees are similarly accused of racketeering by a grand 
jury

now that such former best sellers as stocks and 
mutual funds have fallen out of favor financial institutions are 
busy these days pushing a hot new idea certificates of deposit 
not just plain vanilla cds mind you though you can certainly 
still get those stodgy oldtimers if you want them 
what were dealing with now are risingrate cds floatingrate 
cds cds with no set maturity dates even cds that effectively let 
you make a legal bet on your favorite sports team or the outcome of 
the november election 
all this hasnt happened just by chance the stock market crash 
last fall and the wide swings in interest rates over the past 
several years have brought big changes in the marketplace where 
brokers and bankers sell their merchandise 
i choose to think of it as a rebirth of investor prudence 
says william brennan a valley forge pa adviser on tax and 
investment planning 
todays low tax rates and market turmoil have reinstated 
preservation of principal as a justifiable objective for personal 
planning 
in this environment cds are a natural choice for financial 
marketers to seize upon thanks to todays high level of real 
interest rates as compared with the inflation rate they can 
offer a reasonable return with the backing of federal deposit 
insurance 
and thanks to financial deregulation the oncerigid format of a 
certificate of deposit has become very flexible 
in general financial advisers say that is a plus for savers 
and investors but they caution that it takes a lot of care to 
distinguish the substance from the sizzle in the new generation of 
cds 
there is no real harm for instance in buying a cd whose yield 
will vary depending on the outcome of the super bowl or the 
election as long as you have enough financial leeway to play that 
kind of game with your money 
a little nononsense calculation may cool your enthusiasm for 
such a deal which dont really offer much of a payout or loss 
with one presidential cd now on the market the newsletter 
100 highest yield calculates if the candidate of your choice wins 
with 59 percent of the popular vote the amount president reagan 
got in his 1984 landslide you would receive an extra 1013 over 
the next four years on a 1000 deposit 
if you opt to shop purely for yield and safety the choices are 
still bewilderingly large 
newsletters like 100 highest yields in north palm beach fla 
and income amp safety in fort lauderdale fla compile lists of 
topyielding cd offerings by banks and savings institutions around 
the country 
even with federal deposit insurance it makes sense these days 
to check out the status and prospects of some faraway institution 
before you mail off a large deposit check 
alternatively you can do your cd shopping at brokerage firms 
which may have certificates from a wide variety of insured 
institutions to offer 
brokerage houses not only seek out the highestpaying 
institutions to provide cds for their customers but they also 
frequently negotiate special package deals that lead to higher 
rates than the same banks offer directly to the public says the 
income amp safety newsletter 
it may be possible to liquidate a cd investment bought from a 
broker before maturity without paying a penalty since most brokers 
endeavor to maintain a continuous secondary market in the cds 
they sell 
you probably wont have to pay a commission when you buy or 
sell but if you are thinking of selling before maturity check 
into the spread the difference between the brokers bid and 
asked prices 
just possibly the spread might be as large as or larger than 
the early withdrawal penalty

workers who promise not to sue smithkline 
beckman corp over their layoffs will receive a sweetened severance 
package the philadelphia inquirer reported wednesday 
in a threepage letter last week to about 3000 workers in the 
philadelphia area smithkline said those who sign a waiver will 
receive more severance pay career counseling and extended health 
benefits 
henry wendt chairman and chief executive officer said in the 
letter a similar package for voluntary resignation in designated 
areas will be announced later this year 
workers who dont sign the waiver will be eligible for the 
standard severance package and some longtime workers will be 
eligible for an enhanced pension whether they sign a waiver or not 
smithkline announced last week it would eliminate 1600 jobs 
mostly in philadelphia as part of a 400 million restructuring 
that will include the public sale of 17 percent of its beckman 
instruments division 
bernard shaeffer vice president for research for hayhuggins 
co inc a philadelphia benefitsconsulting firm said companies 
commonly ask employees to sign a waiver in return for enhanced 
separation benefits 
the company said employees who earn a weekly paycheck 
including most production workers and secretaries would receive 
two to three times as much as they would under the standard plan 
if they sign the waiver 
for example a 17year employee earning a weekly paycheck would 
normally get 18 weeks of severance pay under the enhanced plan 
that worker would receive nearly 56 weeks of pay 
workers paid twice a month including managers and supervisors 
would get 25 percent more than the normal severance 
for example a 10year veterans severance pay would last six 
months and a week instead of the standard five months 
the career counseling will be available to all who sign the 
waiver normally such transition assistance is only offered to 
upperlevel employees a company spokesman said 
smithkline will continue to pay its share of health benefits for 
six months after termination instead of three months 
a company spokesman said employees would be encouraged to review 
the severance package for at least 10 days before deciding whether 
to sign the waiver

federal regulators estimated today it will 
cost between 45 billion and 50 billion to clean up the ailing 
savings and loan industry increasing earlier projections by more 
than a third 
m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
which regulates the nations 3000 sampls told congress this summer 
the cost would be 31 billion 
today he revised his figure upward to bring it more in line with 
other government estimates including the 45 billion to 50 
billion projection of congress general accounting office but the 
figure is still far short of private estimates ranging from 75 
billion to 100 billion 
noting that the bank board has resolved 122 cases so far this 
year at a cost of 20 billion wall said it would cost an 
additional 249 billion to 299 billion for the work that remains 
to be done 
wall said that cost could be covered by the current resources of 
his agency but only if a special assessment on healthy thrift 
institutions is extended over the next 30 years 
sampls currently pay 21 cents a year in regular and special 
assessments to the bank board to insure every 100 in deposits 
nearly double the 8 cent per 100 regular assessment paid by 
commercial banks 
the special assessment for thrifts had been scheduled to be 
phased out when wall suggested earlier this summer that the 
assessment would have to continue over 10 years he unleashed a 
flood of protests from industry lobby groups 
the bank boards new estimate comes at a time of rising debate 
over whether taxpayers will be required to rescue the thrift 
industry senate banking committee chairman william proxmire 
dwis said last month that taxpayers likely will have to 
contribute 20 billion to fixing the problem 
however wall who spoke with reporters in advance of testimony 
scheduled today before the senate budget committee said some 
institutions would not survive under a continuing special 
assessment but he added i dont think were to a taxpayer 
bailout yet 
the updated estimate reflects industry losses during the 
apriljune period of this year and the bank boards cost of 
resolving cases through september which have been greater than 
originally anticipated wall said 
moneylosing institutions posted red ink of 51 billion in the 
second quarter that was only partly offset by 15 billion in 
profits made by 71 percent of the industry 
wall said it is difficult to calculate the effect of the higher 
costs of the federal budget deficit because only certain kinds of 
government assistance count toward the deficit 
however bruce steinberg an analyst with merrill lynch 
estimates that the budget deficit will be inflated by nearly 15 
billion a year over the next three years under a cost estimate of 
50 billion 
meanwhile the house banking committee today is considering 
legislation sponsored by rep john j lafalce dny to expand 
the bank boards authority to borrow money by selling bonds from 
the 108 billion authorized last summer to 15 billion 
wall said he opposes the legislation because it places emphasis 
on the bond sales which are not obligations of the federal 
government and are thus more expensive than the bank boards 
preferred method of issuing promissory notes to shore up troubled 
institutions

asked in a survey to name five companies they 
associate with quality products 1005 americans most often named 
general electric general motors ford ibm and sears 
nothing really surprising in that or in the second five atampt 
sony chrysler rca a ge subsidiary and procter amp gamble 
because they wouldnt be so big unless they were doing something 
right 
what is surprising is that the characteristic most often cited 
in determining product quality is how well the name is known 
outranking such considerations as workmanship price performance 
durability and style 
the response to a gallup survey for the american society for 
quality control suggests how difficult it is to evaluate the mind 
of the american consumer in dealing with manufactured products 
but if it is difficult to measure attitudes toward the most 
tangible of products it is even more so in dealing with services 
which are produced in even greater abundance in the american 
economy 
how for example do you measure the quality of an insurance 
policy when you do not even understand its contents you know when 
an automobile runs well you might never know how well your policy 
performs until you have an accident 
cost comparisons are more difficult too some life insurance 
policies actually provide better coverage and higher cash value at 
a lower price than others but only geniuses or actuaries are 
likely to know the difference 
as a result the perception of service quality is more likely to 
be on the basis of interaction with specific individuals such as 
insurance agents 
price for example ranked sixth as a service quality determinant 
in the gallup poll behind courteous polite treatment the 
satisfaction of needs past experience recommendations and 
promptness 
high on the list were such determinants as attitude and 
helpfulness of personnel friendliness and personal atttention far 
down the list was company name a factor that seemed to play a 
large role in rating product quality 
unlike the product quality survey gallup didnt rate individual 
companies in a survey on service instead it limited responses to 
perceptions of quality in segments of the service industry with 
these results 
on a scale of 1 to 10 or worst to highest banks received the 
highest evaluation with a 54 percent majority ranking their 
service at 8 or better it was the only one to exceed 50 percent 
ranked second were hotels at 44 percent followed by hospitals 
airlines and insurance companies a tie automobile repairs and 
local government compared with a similar survey in 1985 banks 
hotels auto repairs and local government services improved 
insurance companies hospitals and airlines fell 
featured on the down list were airlines which provoked the 
observation from the gallup folks that since 1985 the one 
service which experienced the greatest decrease in high quality 
ratings is the airlines 
for the airlines it was the equivalent of a downdraft in the 
1985 survey 47 percent of those interviewed perceived airline 
quality as rating no lower than an 8 on the 10level scale in 
1988 only 32 percent rated airlines that high

the government kept silent wednesday about 
britains move to slash kuwaits stake in british petroleum co 
plc but many business people said kuwait should consider ending 
all investment in britain 
britain ordered the kuwait investment office on tuesday to 
reduce its 2168 percent stake in british petroleum to 99 percent 
within a year saying the holding threatened the interests of the 
britian public 
british financial analysts said the investment office which is 
owned by the kuwaiti government could lose hundreds of millions of 
dollars 
the kuwaiti government which said tuesday that it was 
extremely dissatisfied with the ruling withheld further 
comment as officials considered the implications of the order 
but the thrust of opinion in economic circles was that britain 
should be dropped as investment market 
oilrich kuwait has an estimated 85 billion invested abroad 
mainly in the united states britain france west germany and 
other western european countries 
recent investments have been made in asia including china 
through the kuwait investment office which is based in london 
the staterun radio and television network ignored the british 
decision in news broadcasts although progovernment newspapers 
published the report on their inside economic pages 
the stateowned kuwait petroleum corp which owns the stake in 
british petroleum declined comment so did the office of kuwaits 
oil minister sheik ali khalifa alsabah 
in london michael walter a lawyer with the law firm stephenson 
harwood which is representing the kuwait investment office said 
we havent decided what we are going to do nor have we ruled out 
any possible course of action 
one of the things i am looking at is whether the commissions 
finding is open to a court challenge he said 
the kuwait investment office announced last nov 18 that it had 
purchased 10 percent of british petroleums shares the holding was 
gradually increased to 2168 percent after the british government 
put its remaining onethird stake in the oil company up for sale on 
the stock market 
the british mergers and monpolies commission said tuesday that 
kuwaits holding in british petroleum may be expected to operate 
against the public interest and recommended it be cut 
lord young britains trade secretary accepted the findings and 
told the kuwait investment office to reduce the british petroleum 
stake 
leading kuwaiti economists and investment decisionmakers 
strongly criticized the british move labeling it unjustifiable 
and a mistake 
its the worst reaction on the part of a country that promotes 
a free market economy and deals a blow to this ideology especially 
as the decision is taken when a conservative government which 
supports the policy of privatization and capitalization is in 
office said jassim alsaadoun chairman of the shell economic 
consultancy bureau 
its an unjust decision and impairs economic freedom he 
said 
alsaadoun predicted kuwait would respond by reducing its 
investment in britain or by asking the british government to buy 
part of kuwaits holding or extend the 12month deadline 
ziad taqi head of the economic department at the national bank 
of kuwait said its a bad and annoying decision which has an 
adverse impact on the local market 
if britain wanted to remain a free market economy that attracts 
both private and government institutions it should not have dealt 
such a blow to kuwait he said 
taqi said the british government should have stepped in earlier 
to express its opposition since kuwait gradually built up the 
british petroleum stake 
i think the british decision will prompt the kuwaiti 
government to reconsider its investment in britain he said

four luxury hotels have opened in downtown 
chicago in the last year and three more are set to open over the 
next 18 months but some industry officials fear a glut of 
highpriced rooms could turn the citys hotel boom into a bust 
since last october the nikko the fairmont the swiss grand and 
the hotel 21 east have opened their doors adding 2000 more rooms 
three more hotels the four seasons the intercontinental and the 
hyatt suites are set to open by march 1990 with 1000 more rooms 
all are priced at the upper end of the market with room rates 
starting at 160 a night 
obviously its going to have a serious impact on the hotel 
industry in the chicagoland area said arnold karr executive 
director of the hotelmotel association of illinois which 
represents 260 hotels throughout the state 
the market is not capable of absorbing all the new rooms he 
said that doesnt mean the new hotels wont succeed but there 
may be a shakeout among the other hotels 
karr said there was little new hotel construction in the city 
between 1981 and 1987 but the expansion of the mccormick place 
convention center in 1986 helped spur the current boom 
he said the citys hotel industry would be able to handle a 
normal 4 to 5 percent yearly increase in the number of rooms but 
the recent boom has suddenly caused a 16 percent increase from 
about 18000 before 1987 to 21000 at present 
occupancy rates were about 70 percent last year and could drop 
by 2 percent this year due to the hotel expansion karr said he 
estimated that it would take three to four years for the market to 
absorb the new rooms 
he said the new hotels should have some staying power 
because they are part of major chains with strong financial backing 
and extensive reservations and marketing systems 
but he said the glut could hit older downtown hotels as well as 
suburban hotels which previously could count on spillover bookings 
when the downtown hotels were fully booked 
jerry roper president of the chicago convention and visitors 
bureau conceded that some older or suburban hotels could suffer 
some fallout but denied there was any glut 
i dont see it as a glut he said i see it as an 
opportunity for economic development in the city for providing new 
jobs because we do have the demand 
the new hotel rooms would make it easier for chicago to attract 
new business said mark albian the convention bureaus market 
research manager 
unlike new york chicago has a lot of potential left for 
tourism and corporate business he said 
meanwhile around chicago hotel managers are gearing up for the 
increased competition 
don deporter regional vice president for the hyatt corporation 
said it is normal for a new hotel to lose money for the first two 
to five years as it tries to find its market niche 
but he said i dont think its going to be a bust because 
the city has been starving for rooms he said its only a glut 
if we dont do anything about it 
deporter said hyatt would try to book more small group business 
into its suburban hotels to make up for the expected lost bookings 
at the swiss grand hotel which opened in august general 
manager costas vafopoulos said its links to swissair should help 
generate business and the hotel would offer europeanstyle 
service catering to international travelers 
we see great prospects and opportunities in the downtown 
chicago area he said we feel the competition is healthy 
victor t burt general manager of the 67yearold drake one of 
chicagos oldest luxury hotels said he expects the recently 
refurbished hotel will hold its own because it has a loyal 
clientele 
i think next year is a big question mark he said no one 
really has the answer to whether chicago can support all these new 
hotels

union carbide corps legal charges that 
seven japanese companies manipulated the price of a raw material 
for computer chips are utterly baseless one of the defendants 
claims 
union carbide sued monday in us district court asking for a 
jury trial and an order prohibiting the seven from fixing prices 
and controlling the export to japan of polysilicon the raw 
material for silicon wafers 
the lawsuit seeks damages for the losses union carbide suffered 
as a result of the alleged conspiracy 
the defendants are komatsu electronic metals co its parent 
firm komatsu ltd mitsubishi metal co ltd mitsubishi 
subsidiary nippon silicon co ltd osaka titanium co ltd 
shinetsu handotai co ltd and tokuyama soda co ltd 
komatsu electronic metals co together with its parent komatsu 
ltd issued a joint statement calling the charges baseless 
although union carbide calls it an antitrust suit its 
complaint is really part of an ongoing contract dispute with kem 
arising out of uccs unfounded interpretation of its contract with 
kem it said 
the statements said union carbide is trying to recoup 
selfinflicted losses resulting from its own flawed business 
decisions at the expense of a japanese company that has adhered 
fully to the letter and the spirit of its contractual obligations 
the suit by danbury connbased union carbide claimed komatsu 
electronic and other companies that purchased the material and 
produced silicon wafers formed a polysilicon buyers cartel in 
1983 
according to the lawsuit the japanese companies arranged to 
deplete inventories to refrain from bidding against one another 
for fixed supplies in order to minimize open market price increases 
and otherwise set purchase prices 
union carbide said several us polysilicon manufacturers have 
been forced to exit the merchant market because of the defendants 
action 
the defendants and other japanese companies banded together and 
pose as a siliconwafer industry study group however they 
secretly exchanged information about business costs pricing 
supply and demand and strategic plans to the detriment of 
nonjapanese companies the suit said

the european economic community 
commission wednesday proposed eecwide patent legislation to 
protect biotechnology inventions in the 12nation trade bloc 
national patent laws differ so much from one eec nation to the 
next that lack of legal certainty and lack of sufficient 
protection is commonplace in the community in this field the 
commission said 
eec scientists are at a disadvantage compared to their 
colleagues in the united states and japan whose laws offer 
considerably more protection through patentability that is 
currently available in europe the commission said 
the us patent and trademark office has already granted a 
patent on a manmade mouse from harvard university japan is

illinois farmers who received 
controversial drought insurance coverage have begun to receive 
payments but for those involuntarily left without policies the 
legal fight continues officials said wednesday 
richard carlson assistant director of the state insurance 
department said the chubb group has mailed checks for more than 5 
million to illinois farmers who received the insurance coverage 
chubb a new jerseybased insurance group has estimated that 
1058 illinois farmers applied for coverage but only 263 of them 
received drought insurance policies another 715 farmers accepted 
the companys doublepremium refund offer 
agents in the droughtstricken cornbelt advertised the insurance 
and accepted premium payments late this spring when many farmers 
already suspected it would be a very dry growing season 
when underwriters realized that 10 times the 30 million 
intended issue had been sold they raised the issue to 40 million 
and issued policies only if applications were made by june 15 
those who received insurance coverage were guaranteed payments 
if the rainfall in their counties from june through august was 
below certain levels 
carlson said most payments to illinois farmers are in the 
800020000 range however he said two farmers at sheldon in 
iroquois county received 128000 and 177000 respectively 
carlson said chubb so far has made drought insurance payments to 
five farmers in ford county 29 in iroquois county 32 in kankakee 
county 54 in livingston county and one each in champaign and 
mclean counties 
but many other farmers still hope to receive the drought 
insurance they thought they purchased and the payments that would 
boost their income significantly 
one farm family told the champaignurbana newsgazette that they 
paid an 18000 premium but did not receive a policy instead they 
said chubb refunded twice that amount as a goodwill gesture 
however the family said what they want is the insurance and the 
payment they would be due under the coverage more than 160000 
farmers who paid premiums all over the country are party to a 
classaction suit in federal court in cincinnati that seeks to 
force chubb to extend the coverage to anyone who paid a premium and 
still wants the insurance 
the state insurance department is trying to determine how many 
illinois farmers paid premiums and did not receive policies so it 
can calculate how much chubb would owe to farmers in the state 
carlson said his department then is likely to file charges 
against chubb focusing on the fact that the company did not clear 
the policy with state officials before offering it for sale 
our bottomline interest is protecting state farmers and 
forcing the company to satisfy our farmers said carlson

more than twothirds of americans surveyed want 
to see the rich pay more taxes while an increasing number of 
people are growing disenchanted with the new tax law according to 
a poll released wednesday 
the sixth annual money magazine survey on americans and their 
money also found many respondents expect the economy to run into 
problems in the coming months but those surveyed dont expect to 
see their own financial situations worsen 
the findings of the survey conducted by lieberman research 
inc were based on questionnaires completed by 2370 adults 
nationwide the survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points 
the survey conducted last spring was the first taken after 
taxpayers had their initial encounter with filing returns under the 
new tax law 
thirtyfive percent of the respondents said the new law was less 
fair than the old statute while 17 percent said it was more fair 
15 percent said it was as fair and 33 percent said they did not 
know 
in contrast in a poll taken in october 1986 22 percent of the 
respondents said the new law was less fair while 30 percent said 
it was more fair 11 percent said it was as fair and 37 percent did 
not know 
asked whether they thought they would pay more or less taxes 
under the new law 37 percent said they thought they would pay more 
taxes 14 expected to pay less and 26 percent said they thought 
their taxes would remain the same twentythree percent said they 
did not know 
the survey indicated that most americans want to see the wealthy 
taxed more heavily 
sixtynine percent of the respondents said they would be more 
likely to vote in this election year for a candidate who supported 
higher taxes for people earning more than 100000 a year nine 
percent said they would be less likely to vote for such a 
candidate while 22 percent said this campaign stance would not 
affect their vote 
respondents were generally not sure over whether they thought 
they would be better off financially under a republican or 
democratic administration 
nearly half of those surveyed 46 percent had no opinion on 
the matter twentyeight percent said they would be better off 
under a democratic administration while 26 percent said they would 
be better off under the gop 
a majority of respondents expected the economy to run into 
obstacles such as doubledigit inflation unemployment and a 
serious recession 
fiftythree percent of those surveyed said they expected the 
united states to have serious economic problems during the next 
year while 47 percent said they do not expect the economy to have 
serious troubles 
but most of the respondents did not expect economic problems to 
worsen their own financial situations fortyseven percent expected 
their financial situations to be better in one years time 
fortythree percent said they expected their financial situations 
to be the same while 10 percent expected their situations to get 
worse 
asked how comfortable their standard of living was 59 percent 
of respondents said their standard of living was comfortable while 
41 percent said their standard of living was not comfortable that 
breakdown was unchanged from the 1987 and 1985 surveys and little 
different from the 1986 poll 
respondents view of their standard of living increased along 
with their income levels for example 83 percent of respondents in 
upper income households said their standard of living was 
comfortable compared with 27 percent of those in lowerincome 
households 
upperincome households were defined as those with annual 
incomes over 50000 while lowerincome households earned under 
15000 a year 
the survey was taken more than six months after the october 1987 
stock market crash 
as a result of the crash 28 percent of the total respondents 
and 48 percent of the stockholders said they had made changes in 
the way they handle their finances such as making more 
conservative investments or saving more 
seventytwo percent of the total sample and 52 percent of the 
stockholders said they had made no changes

a bid to merge two of the nations largest cruise 
lines was thwarted wednesday when a norwegian partner in royal 
admiral cruises ltd bought 70 percent of the companys stock for 
561 million heading off a similar offer by carnival cruise lines 
inc 
the surprise announcement was made in oslo norway by royal 
admiral minority stockholder arne wilhelmsen he divulged that his 
company the anders wilhelmsen amp co group has exercised its right 
of first refusal to purchase the balance of royal admirals shares 
this transaction will give royal admiral the flexibility and 
opportunity to boldly move ahead with royal admirals expansion 
plans wilhelmsen said 
he also announced his company is negotiating the formation of a 
joint venture with an entity related to the pritzker family the 
owner of the hyatt and hyatt international chain of 144 hotels 
royal admirals chairman and chief executive officer richard d 
fain said that under the proposed deal with the pritzkers 
wilhelmsen would turn around and sell them 50 percent of the cruise 
companys stock 
i think were pleased that the situation has been clarified 
and the uncertainty has been eliminated fain said 
wilhelmsens decision to exercise his right of first refusal 
ended carnivals identical 561 million offer for the 70 percent of 
royal admirals stock not already owned by wilhelmsen the two 
cruise lines are based in miami 
carnival president micky arison was cautious about the 
announcement saying only that we understand wilhelmsen now has 
30 days in which to close the transaction 
carnival spokesman tim gallagher said the company would have no 
further comment until it had studied the deal 
royal admiral is the holding company for both royal caribbean 
cruise lines and admiral cruises 
royal admiral has eight large cruise ships including the 
worlds largest the 2300passenger sovereign of the seas and is 
building a new 1600passenger vessel in france carnival has about 
the same number of ships rccl spokesman rich steck said 
pretty soon were going to be announcing that we are building 
one or two sister ships for sovereign of the seas steck added 
wilhelmsen beat a deadline of october 10 to exercise his option 
and in the past month has arranged for financing for the purchase 
through christiania bank og kreditkasse and bank of nova scotia 
wilhelmsen was one of the three original partners in rccl when 
it was founded in 1970 earlier this year he and another partner 
formed royal admiral by joining it with admiral cruises steck said

some food prices climbed above levels 
explainable by the summer drought but no widespread price gouging 
of grocery shoppers has been found thus far congressional 
investigators said wednesday 
some price increases do appear higher than warranted by the 
drought alone senate agriculture chairman patrick j leahy 
dvt said after receiving the report from the general accounting 
office 
after weighing the congressional investigative agencys 
findings however he told a hearing of the committee that in 
general there do not seem to have been excessive price increases 
across a broad range of products that use the drought as an 
excuse 
retail pasta prices increased 104 percent cereal 71 percent 
and white bread 82 percent from january through june gao 
officials told the agriculture committee they said 43 percent of 
the pasta and cereal price rise and 57 percent of that for white 
bread came before june 
pasta cereal and white bread prices rose more between june and 
august than they did in the same period last year the gao said 
the fierce summer heat and shortage of rainfall which surfaced 
as an urgent problem in june wrought some of its worst damage in 
the northern grain belt where durum wheat used to manufacture pasta 
is produced 
farm prices for durum as well as hard red spring wheat a 
primary ingredient in white bread did increase this year in 
contrast to 1987 but alone would not have explained the rise at the 
retail level 
as drought scorched feed and pasture lands livestock producers 
increasingly sold cattle for slaughter creating a buyers market 
and driving down prices the decrease however was not reflected 
in any savings for consumers at the supermarket the investigators 
said 
just why some prices rose beyond levels explainable as a 
byproduct of the drought remains something of a mystery gao 
officials said 
it may have been because prices of packaging of food products 
went up significantly this year mary kenney of the gao told the 
committee 
there could have been some labor cost increases we dont 
know if there were said john w harman associate director of 
the gaos resources community and economic development division 
senators said it would be unjust to put the blame for 
unwarranted price increases on farmers who receive only a minor 
portion of the price that consumers pay for food 
the price of farm commodities accounted for 30 percent of the 
price of all food products last year the bulk of the price tag 
reflects transportation processing packaging advertising and 
other marketing expenses 
after hearing the data sen tom harkin diowa said that 
conclusive evidence of price gouging has not been found but there 
are some indications out there that the problem could develop 
next year 
the agriculture department has been trying to calm concerns 
about unwarranted price increases it estimates that the drought 
will tack 1 percent onto the consumer price index for food this 
year and perhaps 2 percent next year prices would be affected next 
year because the drought has reduced stockpiled surpluses of some 
crops which drives up their prices 
sen kent conrad dnd said he did not rule out that price 
increases prior to june were related to the drought he said he had 
been expecting a hot dry summer and that the food industry 
with its excellent sources of intelligence might have done the 
same 
steven d maurer director of the ohio department of 
agriculture appealed to the committee not to condemn farmers for 
any increases 
the farmers share of the food market dollar has remained 
relatively constant he said 
food wholesalerretailer richard f bondareff president of 
bonfeld inc said that his virginiabased food stores have fought 
to hold the line on prices and in some cases kept them level 
despite increases charged by suppliers for fear that higher price 
tags would give competitors an edge 
we try to do the right thing because of the competitive nature 
of the business he told the committee

corn and soybean futures prices edged downward 
while wheat prices advanced wednesday at the chicago board of trade 
in a sluggish market under the influence of good harvesting 
conditions and limited demand 
profittaking among corn and soybean traders after tuesdays 
rallies pressured prices held down by an outlook for favorable 
harvesting weather for the next several days in the corn belt 
an anticipated overnight frost in southern missouri and other 
key soybeangrowing regions that would have threatened crops failed 
to materialize and helped keep the lid on buying enthusiasm in the 
bean pit said cathy leow assistant vice president at thompson 
mckinnon securities inc in new york 
wheat gained support from continued expectations that signing of 
the ussoviet grain pact is near she said 
anticipation is that once the usrussian agreement is 
signed the soviets are likely to be given credit and once they 
get their credit theyll be in the market to buy ms leow said 
but she said activity in the grain and soybean pits remained 
slow 
when youve got good harvesting conditions and limited demand 
the markets going to be pretty sluggish she said 
at the close wheat was 3 cents to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 426 a bushel corn was 
cent to 2 cents lower with december at 293 a bushel oats were 
1 cent to 2 cents lower with december at 246 a bushel and 
soybeans were 3 cents to 8 cents lower with november at 824 a

employees of scandinavian airlines 
system in denmark reacted angrily when they heard that sas had 
signed a cooperation deal with houstonbased texas air corp 
newspaper reports said wednesday 
texas air corp is owned and managed by francisco lorenzo who 
is notorious in the aviation world the entire existence of the 
company is based on a poor product and unethical and often illegal 
treatment of the employees sas unions said in a statement 
the labor groups branded texas air chairman lorenzo a union 
buster and a strongly antiunion employer the copenhagen 
newspaper berlingske tidende said 
in the deal announced in new york tuesday sas will get leases 
on airport gates in the new york area and the right to buy up to 10 
percent of texas airs stock on the open market 
sas will pay texas air 50 million under the accord which also 
includes provisions for coordinating marketing reservations and 
scheduling as well as training of airline personnel 
of all partners sas president jan carlzon has chosen the 
worst possible flight attendants union chairman per espersen was 
quoted as saying in the tabloid ekstra bladet 
lorenzo is a bandit whose contempt for humanity in this world 
was exceeded only by former ugandan dictator idi amin espersen 
was quoted as saying 
the allegations against frank lorenzo and texas air are no 
doubt correct but our danish employees should realize that 
american trade unionism has a completely different style than it 
does here sas vice president frede eriksen was quoted as saying 
sas which is 50 percent owned by the governments of sweden 
denmark and norway has tried to develop what its management calls 
a global axis strategy to provide travelers with the most 
convenient connections through a network of cooperation pacts with 
other carriers

the chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board said wednesday that his agency can no longer cover the cost 
of rescuing ailing savings institutions without placing an 
exceedingly heavy burden on the industry 
m danny wall whose agency regulates the nations 3000 sampls 
told the senate budget committee it will cost 45 billion to 50 
billion to clean up the industry boosting an earlier projection by 
more than onethird 
in july wall said it would cost 31 billion an increase in 
turn from a previous estimate of 22 billion 
noting that the bank board has resolved 122 cases so far this 
year at a cost of 20 billion wall said it would cost an 
additional 25 billion to 30 billion for the work that remains to 
be done 
as much as 10 billion of the cost remaining could be spent 
between now and the end of the year to rescue dozens of additional 
institutions he said 
sen lawton chiles dfla chairman of the committee 
complained that walls shifting estimates offer little 
reassurance to the taxpayer and said we could be hearing about 
a 100 billion problem just in time for christmas 
chiles also said the bank board by issuing promissory notes 
that are counted toward the federal budget deficit was spending 
billions of dollars without congressional authorization that he 
said would result in other programs such as antidrug efforts 
being squeezed 
walls projections now are in line with other government 
estimates including the 45 billion to 50 billion projection of 
congress general accounting office private analysts have put the 
price tag as high as 100 billion 
however while the gao said its cost estimate meant congress 
will have to appropriate taxpayer dollars wall said his agencys 
resources could cover the cost but he said that would place an 
exceedingly heavy burden on the thrift industry 
currently the boards fund insuring deposits in sampls up to 
100000 gets all of its money from healthy institutions which pay 
a special assessment amounting to more than double the regular 
assessment paid by competing commercial banks for deposit insurance 
wall said the only way the bank board can get by without 
additional funding would be to abandon plans to phase out the 
special assessment and continue it for 30 years a move sure to 
provoke an outcry from sampl lobbyists 
rep stephen neal dnc speaking at a separate session of the 
house banking committee argued that forcing the industry to pay 
more could push healthy sampls into insolvency 
the house committee voted 2922 to approve a bill sponsored by 
rep john lafalce dny that would increase from 108 billion 
to 158 billion the bank boards authority to borrow through 
bonds the board has so far issued 375 billion of the 30year 
bonds which are in turn paid off through the industry assessment 
the committee chairman rep fernand j st germain dri said 
the bill could come before the full house as soon as thursday he 
said the senate would be hard put to reject the bill since it 
had supported 15 billion in bond authority last summer when 
congress authorized the 108 billion 
la falce said his bill was intended to give the agency a way to 
raise money without resorting to promissory notes that ultimately 
could have to be paid off by taxpayers 
but neal said if we burden the healthy thrifts with billions 
of more dollars in interest payments we run the risk of making the 
problem worse 
rep henry gonzalez dtexas said a taxpayer bailout will be 
needed sooner or later and that lafalces bill is just a ploy to 
show we are trying to do something before the election 
the bill also requires the bank board to provide congress with 
all documents on its rescue deals within 15 days legislators have 
complained that the agency has kept so much information private 
that they have no way of judging the deals or estimating their 
impact on the budget deficit 
in a related matter the full house postponed until thursday 
action on a bill creating a commission of experts to study the sampl 
crisis and recommend solutions early next year the senate passed a 
similar bill last month

a new york investment companys latest offer 
to buy the kroger co for 503 billion may force krogers 
management to accept the bid and abandon an effort to remain 
independent analysts say 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co a new york citybased company 
known for corporate takeovers improved its offer tuesday to 64 a 
share for the cincinnatibased supermarket giant 
the new offer may outweigh krogers proposed corporate 
restructuring plan and force krogers management to give way so 
that stockholders can get a better deal analysts said 
krogers management declined wednesday to make a public 
statement on the newest offer all weve said is were reviewing 
their proposal kroger spokesman paul bernish said 
kohlberg kravis offer is its second since it entered the kroger 
bidding war two weeks ago with a 46 billion bid offering 5850 
per share 
i think the purpose of this is a preemptive strike to keep 
kroger from wasting more time said security analyst gary giblen 
of the houston investment company rotan mosle inc theyre trying 
to give kroger an offer that is so demonstrably superior to 
anything they kroger can offer that theyll be forced to 
capitulate 
the haft family of landover md which controls dart group 
inc opened the bidding sept 19 with an unsolicited offer of 55 
per share or 432 billion 
ryan mathews senior editor of the trade publication grocery 
marketing said kohlbergs new bid intensifies pressure on krogers 
management because of managements fiduciary duty to stockholders 
they cant reject it out of hand mathews said 
analyst elizabeth shiels of hilliard lyons inc in louisville 
ky said a better offer still could be made 
i dont find it as compelling as i would have expected from 
kkr she said of kohlbergs new offer i think kroger has done 
enough public education on the value of the company that this isnt 
a handsdown winner 
the new offer proposes paying 50 in cash 11 in debentures and 
a continuing equity interest in the company valued at 3 for each 
of krogers 786 million shares 
the offer tops by 7 a share krogers own offer to shareholders 
in its boardapproved restructuring plan which would force kroger 
to lay off an undetermined number of employees at its headquarters 
the company also would sell some supermarkets convenience stores 
massmerchandising stores and real estate 
the restructuring plan offers shareholders a 40 cash dividend 
a debenture with an 8 trading value and equity or stub stock 
estimated at 9 per share for a total value of 57 
kohlberg kravis also presented an alternative offer in the 
event kroger proceeds with its restructuring to buy all of 
krogers stub shares for 1350 each 10 in cash and 350 in 
debentures 
kohlberg kravis said that would give the shareholders 6150 per 
share the 40 cash dividend from kroger 10 from kohlberg and 
1150 in debentures 
the 250pershare difference in kohlbergs two proposals 
represents the estimated cost of additional financing fees kroger 
would have to pay if it proceeds with restructuring plus 
kohlbergs costs in refinancing the added debt kroger would incur 
we trust you will agree that this extra 250 per share in 
value should be paid to your shareholders and not to your 
lenders kohlberg kravis partner george r roberts wrote in a 
letter to kroger chairman lyle everingham 
kohlberg kravis said in its first offer that it would keep 
krogers headquarters in cincinnati if it buys the 105yearold 
company the privately held kohlberg kravis has controlling 
interests in about 30 companies including beatrice cos 
owensillinois safeway stores duracell holdings and stop amp shop 
cos 
fortune magazine estimated the combined 1987 revenues of 
kohlbergs companies at 38 billion 
dart group has not said whether it would keep krogers 
headquarters in cincinnati 
in response to kohlbergs newest offer dart executive robert 
haft said we would be interested in working with kroger 
management to enhance their restructuring program by providing 
additional equity he did not elaborate

grand metropolitan plc the british company 
bidding to take over pillsbury co isnt terrifying state 
officials lawmakers and charitable organizations as dart group 
corp did when it tried to seize dayton hudson corp last year 
i think its certainly not a similar situation in many 
respects senate minority leader duane benson irlanesboro said 
wednesday 
it doesnt appear to be a situation in which grand 
metropolitan may come into the community plunder and leave when 
theyre done 
both pillsbury and dayton hudson are minneapolisbased companies 
that have earned favoriteson status for their high levels of 
charitable giving and general community dogooding 
last year minnesotans were horrified when dart controlled by 
the haft family of maryland tried to acquire dayton hudson in a 
hostile takeover 
the hafts with a reputation as corporate raiders who made 
millions from profits on the sale of stock acquired from companies 
they tried to take over were considered poor corporate citizens 
the minnesota legislature rode to the rescue and swiftly acted 
on dayton hudsons request to pass tough antitakeover legislation 
in a oneday special session 
but because pillsbury is incorporated in delaware the new 
minnesota antitakeover laws offer no help to the food conglomerate 
and because grand metropolitan has quickly presented itself as 
a responsible company that would do little to upset the status quo 
benson said the state may not be as hasty to help pillsbury as it 
was to help dayton hudson 
its going to be tough to do for them pillsbury because 
theyre incorporated in delaware not here benson said it 
would have to be pretty specific legislation 
house speaker robert vanasek dflnew prague agreed 
im not too excited about seeing a minnesotabased company 
being taken over by one thats headquartered outside the united 
states but i dont think theres really anything we could do about 
it vanasek said 
still he said the dart group has a terrible reputation when 
it comes to being raiders and at least grand met seems to be a 
pretty solid company 
vanasek benson and other state leaders including gov rudy 
perpich met with grand metropolitan officials tuesday the day 
they officially made their 517 billion bid for pillsbury 
ian martin chief executive of grand metropolitans us 
operations who had asked for the meeting said the company wasnt 
seeking political favors only a level playing field in dealing 
with pillsbury 
i thought after having gone through the whole dayton hudson 
situation this was strange benson said it was a reversal 
dart certainly didnt come to talk to us 
but benson thought the presentation was helpful 
i think it certainly gave us a chance to understand their 
point of view and what their attempts are he said 
i got the impression that theyre not a corporate raider if 
theyre successful at taking pillsbury over theyll keep that high 
community identity 
state commerce commissioner michael hatch said corporate 
takeovers have changed since the dayton hudson deal now companies 
like grand metropolitan quickly approach politicians and the news 
media to fend off negative publicity 
what they grand metropolitan were trying to do was to 
communicate the sincerity of their offer and that they do have a 
background as a good corporate citizen said hatch who also 
attended tuesdays meeting 
not only has grand metropolitan handled the situation 
differently than dart hatch said but pillsbury has handled it 
differently than dayton hudson which acted immediately after dart 
started its takeover attempt 
pillsbury in a statement tuesday said its board would review 
the grand met offer at an appropriate time company officials 
refused to make further comment on wednesday

futures prices of cocoa surged wednesday at the coffee sugar amp 
cocoa exchange in new york on reports that the ivory coast the 
worlds largest producer would not be lowering farmer cocoa 
prices 
the expected move would come at a time when world cocoa prices 
are at a 13year low and traders took the reports as an indication 
that the ivory coast will continue to withhold cocoa from the world 
market analysts said 
in other markets oil prices plummeted cattle futures prices 
were mixed hog prices were mostly lower frozen pork bellies 
declined corn and soybeans slid wheat prices advanced and gold 
and silver prices rallied 
the surge in cocoa prices comes at a time when world stocks are 
at record level and the ivory coast is about to begin harvesting 
their new crop said sandra kaul an analyst with shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york 
talk that the african nation wont lower prices paid to cocoa 
famers was taken as a sign by the market that the ivory coast 
may perhaps continue their very limited sales policy and that 
could turn the surplus into a deficit she said 
cocoa prices were 39 to 61 higher with the contract for 
delivery in december at 1228 a ton 
at the new york mercantile exchange reports of burgeoning 
supplies and rumors about opec defections sent oil futures prices 
plunging 
the november contract for west texas intermediate dropped 47 
cents to settle at 1260 a barrel in heavy hectic trading the 
benchmark us crude traded as low as a 1228 barrel during the 
session 
crude oil was 12 cents to 47 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in november at 1260 a barrel heating oil was 41 cent 
to 52 cent lower with november at 3776 cents a gallon and 
unleaded gas was 55 cent to 167 cents lower with november at 
3944 cents a gallon 
profittaking among corn and soybean traders after tuesdays 
rallies pressured prices at the chicago board of trade 
an outlook for favorable harvesting weather for the next several 
days in the corn belt added pressure analysts said 
an anticipated overnight frost in key soybeangrowing regions 
that would have threatened crops failed to materialize and helped 
keep the lid on buying enthusiasm in the bean pit said cathy leow 
assistant vice president at thompson mckinnon securities inc in 
new york 
wheat gained support from continued expectations that signing of 
the ussoviet grain pact is near she said 
wheat prices settled 3 cents to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 426 a bushel corn was 
cent to 2 cents lower with december at 293 a bushel oats were 
1 cent to 2 cents lower with december at 246 a bushel and 
soybeans were 3 cents to 8 cents lower with november at 823 a 
bushel 
there were few outside influences at the chicago mercantile 
exchange where the cattle market was undergoing some shortterm 
liquidations after reaching new contract highs in feeder cattle 
on tuesday said paul hare a chicago analyst with linnco futures 
inc 
hog traders were hedging their positions in anticipation of 
lower prices this fall he said 
live cattle prices settled 40 cent lower to 35 cent higher 
with the contract for delivery in october at 7202 cents a pound 
feeder cattle were 43 cent lower to 15 cent higher with october 
at 8172 cents a pound live hogs were 50 cent lower to 33 cent 
higher with october at 4020 cents a pound and pork bellies were 
10 cent to 75 cent lower with february at 4945 cents a pound 
trading was lackluster with few fundamental factors at the new 
york commodity exchange and volume was thin as traders protected 
their positions analysts said 
gold was 260 to 270 higher with october at 40080 a troy 
ounce silver was up 5 cents in all contract months with october 
at 6298 a troy ounce

the navy said wednesday it is rejecting life 
rafts made by a west virginia company and has hired bf goodrich 
co to finish the job 
allegations were made earlier this summer about the quality and 
reliability of mark 6 rafts produced by rubber crafters inc of 
grantsville wva said navy spokesman lt ken ross 
in light of these allegations we are in the process of 
testing the rubber crafters rafts we have in the fleet to make sure 
there are no defective rafts there he said 
the navy signed a 99 million contract with goodrich to produce 
850 of the same type of life rafts that are the subject of an 
investigation according to ross the new contract calls for the 
rafts to be delivered to the navy by april 1990 although they may 
be ready sooner 
rubber crafters had been building the mark 6 rafts since 1984 
he said the company is being investigated by the defense 
department and the fbi 
federal agents raided the companys plant and offices aug 8 
according to the pittsburgh press 
we have stopped accepting rafts from rubber crafters we have 
a need for additional rafts in the fleet so we let the contract to 
bf goodrich ross said 
rubber crafters had delivered 2200 rafts and was under contract 
to deliver another 1300 he said the company won the contract by 
outbidding goodrich 
the press quoted a federal affidavit as saying rubber crafters 
used inferior materials covered up defects falsified test results 
and altered boat serial numbers

texas banks lost 29 billion in the six months of 
1988 more than three times what they lost the first half of 1987 
says a report released wednesday by texas banking commissioner 
kenneth littlefield 
the report indicates continuing financial difficulty for texas 
banks said a release by the department of banking 
first republicbanks 19 billion provision for possible loan 
losses contributed greatly to the loss according to the report 
first republicbank now is under north carolina national bank 
texas banks equity capital declined 35 billion total assets 
decreased 147 billion and total deposits declined 12 billion 
between june 30 1987 and june 30 1988 littlefield noted 
what it does show is that there are still problems in the 
texas banking industry said mark r largent the financial 
analyst who prepared the report 
although the state has problems not all the problems are 
equally troubling in all areas or for all size banks he said 
average bank performance generally deteriorates the larger the 
institution the report said the bigger banks generally have an 
increasingly greater share of problem credits and foreclosed real 
estate as a percentage of total assets loans and primary capital 
it said 
the 38 banks with assets of more than 500 million accounted for 
27 billion of the 29 billion loss with firstrepublic banks 
representing a 22 billion loss

the navy on wednesday awarded the general 
dynamics corp a 6174 million contract for a new trident missile 
submarine slashing more than 266 million off the price it paid 
last year 
navy officials said the award demonstrated they had been right 
in pressing a virginia shipyard to compete against general dynamics 
more than a year ago even if general dynamics ultimately succeeded 
in protecting its monopoly on the huge subs 
it shows the benefits of competition said lt ken ross a 
navy spokesman that previous competition is still bearing 
fruit 
the contract awarded wednesday represents the first of two 
options in a contract initially awarded by the navy in january 
after competitive bidding between general dynamics and the newport 
news shipbuilding amp drydock co 
the award to general dynamics electric boat division in groton 
conn covers the one trident submarine authorized by congress in 
the fiscal 1989 budget and will be the 16th in the line 
the fixedprice contract specifies the trident should be 
delivered by october 1994 the navy has said it wants to order at 
least 20 tridents and possibly more 
with the exception of nuclearpowered aircraft carriers the 
trident program was the last major navy shipbuilding program to be 
opened to competition newport news shipbuilding a division of 
tenneco inc enjoys a monopoly on the construction of aircraft 
carriers in part because no other shipyard has the massive 
facilities required to build that type of ship 
in november 1987 newport news accepted a navy request that it 
compete against general dynamics in the trident program it 
submitted a bid for the fiscal 1988 sub as well as option bids on 
the two additional boats expected to be purchased in fiscal 1989 
and fiscal 1990 
general dynamics did the same and last jan 5 the navy 
announced general dynamics had succeeded in preserving its monopoly 
by underbidding newport news the navy awarded the firm a 644 
million contract for the fiscal 1988 submarine without revealing 
what either company had bid for the two option years 
ross said wednesday the navy believes it will save roughly 100 
million over the life of the contract if the second option is also 
exercised 
the spokesman said the latest award reverses what has been a 
spiraling price for the huge vessels the fiscal 1986 submarine 
cost the navy about 587 million the price climbed to 615 million 
in fiscal 1987 then rose again in january to 644 million 
this contract is cutting more than 26 million off that fiscal 
1988 buy ross said 
the 560foot trident submarines also known as the ohio class 
are considered the most survivable leg of americas nuclear 
arsenal each of the vessels can carry 24 longrange multiwarhead 
nuclear missiles and remain submerged for months at a time 
each of the subs when completely outfitted with nuclear 
reactors and governmentfurnished equipment cost more than 14 
billion eight of the submarines are already commissioned on active 
duty and a ninth the uss tennessee will soon join them

eastern airlines on wednesday announced the recall 
of 300 furloughed flight attendants which follows the recent 
layoffs of more than 3000 employees to streamline the moneylosing 
carriers operations 
the furloughed flight attendants are being recalled effective 
oct 21 because of the popularity of a longterm leave of absence 
program said eastern spokesman robin matell 
the program was offered as a way of minimizing the impact of 
furloughs and more volunteers were attracted than had been 
anticipated matell said more than 500 flight attendants took the 
leave offer 
now 300 fired flight attendants will be recalled on the basis of 
seniority matell said 
last week a federal appeals court in washington struck down a 
lower court judge who had barred eastern from carrying out the 
furloughs the us circuit court of appeals rejected the unions 
contention that the layoffs were part of a unionbusting campaign 
by easterns parent texas air corp and its chairman frank lorenzo 
along with the furloughs which took effect sept 10 and 
represented easterns largest layoff plans in its 60year history 
the carrier eliminated service to 14 cities and closed its kansas 
city hub 
easterns recall coincides with a seasonal increase in flights 
to core markets along the east coast and into the caribbean and 
latin america 
matell said additional employees also may be recalled 
we have to evaluate staffing needs and determine whats 
what he said

a senior un official said wednesday he is 
pleased with the initial response from the international community 
to a proposal that commercial lenders write off 30 percent of their 
loans to 15 highly indebted third world countries 
but kenneth dadzie secretary general of the un conference on 
trade and development made clear that consensus on how to cope 
with the debt crisis is far away 
in a press statement however he voiced confidence that the 
proposal outlined in unctads 1988 report last month served as 
a catalyst for a rethinking of positions and will continue to do 
so 
the countries targeted by the unctad plan account for about 60 
percent of third world debt totaling some 500 billion they are 
argentina bolivia brazil chile colombia ivory coast ecuador 
mexico morocco nigeria peru the philippines uruguay 
venezuela and yugoslavia 
dadzie said that while the plan called for 30percent cut of 
commercial bank debt our calculations can perhaps be improved 
in either and upoward or downward direction 
he saiid it is increasingly obvious that largescale debt 
reduction cannot be accomplished by credit markets acting on 
their own but that it required concerted action by creditors 
dadzie said recent statements by france japan and the director 
oof the international monetary fund suggest that the need for 
official action is gaining acceptance 
the form of the support however remains unclear he added 
speaking of a highly complex situation dadzies statement was 
issued at the end of a twoweek session of unctads 131nation 
governing body the trade and development board

zenith electronics corp agreed to hand 
over a list of its stockholders to a group of dissident 
shareholders wednesday and said the groups attempt to wage a proxy 
fight against zenith management would not trigger the companys 
takeover defense 
zenith agreed to give the list to brookhurst partners just 
before a hearing in delaware chancery court over the groups 
attempt to wage a proxy battle to pressure the company into putting 
itself up for sale 
just 20 minutes into the hearing zenith also surrendered on the 
issue at stake in the proceeding whether brookhursts proxy 
solicitation would trigger zeniths poison pill takeover 
defense 
stephen herrmann zeniths attorney declared that the consent 
solicitation of sept 14 would not trigger the rights plan even if 
15 percent of the shareholders proxies were obtained by brookhurst 
partners 
this means brookhurst is now free to solicit shareholder support 
in its efforts to replace some company directors and sell zenith 
brookhurst which owns 61 percent of zeniths stock is 
proposing to reduce the board from 10 members to six and replace 
three of the six with its own candidates 
zenith the only remaining us television maker is 
incorporated in delaware but based in glenview ill north of 
chicago 
the company has indicated its desire to remain independent and 
until wednesday had resisted giving the shareholder list to 
brookhurst 
zenith has been fighting a losing battle against lowpriced 
imported televisions despite the success of its highly regarded 
computers zenith suffered losses over the past three years 
including a 191 million loss last year on sales of 236 billion

a california supermarket chain that pulled 
tobacco and cigars from its shelves to comply with a new state law 
on product labeling hinted wednesday that all its food and drug 
suppliers face a similar fate if they dont comply with the statute 
vons cos revealed it had given its suppliers 45 days notice 
that they must either certify their products as free of dangerous 
chemicals or label the products in keeping with californias 
proposition 65 
vons which has 345 supermarkets in southern california pulled 
pipe tobacco and cigars from its shelves this week because they 
dont carry health warnings as do packages of cigarettes and 
chewing tobacco 
proposition 65 an initiative approved by california voters in 
1986 requires warning notices in stores the workplace and other 
areas where people might be exposed any of 242 substances 
including tobacco on a state list of chemicals known to cause 
cancer or birth defects 
vons notified 2000 manufacturers suppliers and brokers they 
must either certify their products as free of chemicals on the list 
or label the products spokeswoman vickie sanders said wednesday 
that notice in letters mailed sept 21 gives the suppliers 45 
days to comply she said 
while the letter doesnt specifically threaten to remove 
unlabeled products from the shelves the tobacco action underlines 
the chains emphasis on labels 
safeway stores inc lucky stores inc and alpha beta co have 
mailed similar notices spokesmen for the grocers said although 
alpha betas letters dont specifically threaten to pull unlabeled 
tobacco from the shelves 
one of the authors of the toxins initiative hailed vons move as 
the start of a wide trend toward product labeling but the author 
david roe of the environmental defense fund contended the el 
montebased grocery chain did so only under threat of a lawsuit 
what you see vons doing is enforcing the law against the 
manufacturers roe said from the funds oakland office theyre 
saying dont stick us with the warning 
previously he said california markets had resisted labeling 
and contended that an industryfunded tollfree telephone 
information number on chemicals in food constituted sufficient 
warning to consumers under proposition 65 
two tobacco lobbying groups the cigar association of america 
and the pipe tobacco council contended the industry has met the 
laws requirements by sending stores warning signs that can be 
posted on shelves distribution of those signs and a program of 
periodic media advertisements on the hazards of cigars and pipe 
tobacco began in february said norman sharp who is president of 
both washington dcbased groups 
the antitoxins law sets penalties of 2500 per violation per 
day for failure to post warnings of hazardous chemicals rather 
than designating a state agency as enforcer the measure allows 
citizens or the state attorney general to sue businesses which 
dont comply 
the grocers notices to their suppliers all followed an 
announcement aug 2 by several environmental groups that they were 
prepared to sue seven supermarket chains and a drugstore chain over 
tobacco labeling on friday state attorney general john van de 
kamp took up the case from the environmental groups and filed suit 
in state court against vons lucky alpha beta safeway ralphs 
raleys albertsons and thrifty drugs

unions at eastern airlines reacted angrily 
wednesday to a report that texas air corp was discussing the 
possible sale of its east coast air shuttle to developer donald 
trump 
the pilots union warned it would seek a court order to block any 
such deal and the head of the machinists union suggested his union 
would do the same 
the unions successfully blocked an attempt earlier this year by 
texas air to transfer the shuttle operation from eastern to a new 
subisidiary 
according to unidentified sources quoted by the wall street 
journal the pricetag on the threecity shuttle was in the range of 
200 million 
texas air spokesman mark johnson said the company had no comment 
on the journal report trump and his representatives also declined 
comment 
the new york times in its thursday editions quoted trump as 
saying he was close to agreement on a deal and a contract could be 
signed by next week the newspaper also quoted unidentified 
executives it said were close to the deal as saying trump would pay 
more than 300 million cash for the shuttle 
trump was dealing directly with texas air chairman frank lorenzo 
in the deal the times quoted its sources as saying 
the report came a day after texas air signed an agreement with 
scandinavian airlines system giving the european carrier leases on 
airport gates in the new york area and the right to buy up to 10 
percent of texas airs stock on the open market 
sas will pay texas air 50 million under the accord which also 
includes provisions for coordinating marketing reservations and 
scheduling as well as training of airline personnel 
in miami eastern pilots union spokesman ron cole said the union 
will take whatever steps are necessary to legally protect eastern 
from the sale or transfer of any more of its assets 
the leader of the machinists union said eastern employees 
probably would challenge any sale of the shuttle 
we stopped the spinoff to texas air its something we will 
have to look at as it relates to our ongoing litigation said 
charles e bryan head of the machinists union at eastern 
the machinists filed a federal suit earlier this year to block 
the plan to make easterns shuttle a separate subsidiary of texas 
air texas air later dropped that effort 
while stressing they did not know if the report was true some
