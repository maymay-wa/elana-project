suzie azar became the first woman mayor in el 
paso history saturday with a landslide victory over fellow city 
council member ed elsey in a runoff election 
im thrilled to death im ready to go to work mrs azar 
said one hundred seventeen years is a long time for el paso to 
wait and im glad they waited for me 
the final but unofficial totals showed that mrs azar captured 
65 percent of the votes or 29961 to only 35 percent or 16218 
for elsey 
when you get a margin like 65 percent thats a mandate from 
the people that theyre willing to work with you mrs azar said 
the successor to mayor jonathan rogers who by law had to step 
down after four consecutive twoyear terms will face problems 
posed by widespread poverty and rapid growth unlike most texas 
cities el paso has a strongmayor form of government with no city 
manager

the new mayor is expected to grapple with a high cartheft and 
house burglary rate a growing youth gang problem shockingly high 
rates of hepatitis and tuberculosis in outlying areas doubledigit 
unemployment and a steady influx of mexicans many of whom work 
illegally for low wages 
nonetheless the runoff was almost devoid of issues until two 
weeks ago when elsey brought up the matter of mrs azars finances 
mrs azars husband dick leases business property from the 
cityowned airport and elsey said he wanted to know how much the 
azars made from businesses on the property 
at elseys prodding mrs azar released a statement showing that 
she and her husband had a net worth of about 37 million elsey 
owner of a medical supply business has a net worth of about a 
tenth as much 
the two city council members defeated four other candidates in 
the may 6 general election to make it to saturdays showdown 
before the may 6 election the sixcandidate campaign focused on 
taxes police protection and economic development but elsey and 
mrs azar held similar views and elsey chose to stress personal 
wealth as a campaign issue 
el pasos elections are nonpartisan and there are no party 
primaries elsey is a republican and mrs azar is a democrat

tens of thousands of students formed a huge 
procession sunday and left tiananmen square to march through 
central beijing to press their demands for democratic reforms 
march leaders said students from up to 300 schools and 
institutes would join the march at various points around the 
capital 
one student from beijing normal university said the goal of the 
march is to have chinese from throughout the world unite in 
demanding that the government grant greater political freedom 
many carried signs demanding the resignations of premier li 
peng who declared martial law in beijing on may 20 and senior 
leader deng xiaoping 
authorities did not try to stop the marchers as they set out 
unlike demonstrations last week that drew up to a million people 
to sprawling tiananmen square including thousands of workers 
there appeared to be few people who were not students in sundays 
procession 
student leaders said workers would probably stay away 
factories are now taking economic measures against workers who 
participate one student leader said some he said have had 
their pay docked 
however thousands of people lined the streets and crowded onto 
overpasses to cheer on the marchers 
dont stop some in the crowd yelled we wont let you 
down students shouted back 
 
 
on saturday student leaders proposed that demonstrators hold a 
climactic rally tuesday to celebrate our great victory and then 
end their historic twoweek occupation of tiananmen square 
the call came as hardliners expanded their purge of moderates 
whose sympathy for the students triggered the fiercest power 
struggle since the leftist ideological purges of the cultural 
revolution 
student leaders said it was time to change tactics in their push 
for greater freedom and an end to official corruption but they 
said protesters in tiananmen square whose numbers had fallen 
sharply to about 10000 would have the final say on ending the 
sitin 
top student leaders wuer kaixi wang dan and chai ling held a 
news conference at the square and called for a citywide march 
tuesday to culminate the protest movement that began april 15 
also saturday president li xiannian made the first public 
acknowledgement that china was experiencing a power struggle 
accusing some communist party leaders of plotting to create 
confusion in the country 
sources said officials in the media the party and the army 
suspected of participating in the protest movement were being told 
to write reports detailing their activities the reports could 
be used against them the sources said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the developments came two days after communist party leader zhao 
ziyang was reportedly stripped of power and placed under house 
arrest zhaos fall signaled a victory for the 84yearold deng and 
other leaders who oppose political reform 
zhaos ouster must be confirmed by a meeting of the central 
committee of the communist party which is expected soon party 
officials from provinces and cities were gathering in beijing to 
prepare for the meeting sources said 
sources said zhao has been accused of heading an antiparty 
clique 
one diplomat referred to the clique as a new gang of four a 
reference to ultraleftist radicals who ruled china during the last 
years of the cultural revolution of 196676 they were purged by 
deng when he took power in 1978 
included with zhao are politburo member hu qili vice premier 
tian jiyun and defense minister qin jiwei chinese sources said 
chinese and diplomatic sources said qin used his influence to 
keep troops in beijing from enforcing martial law 
millions of people have taken to the streets in defiance of 
martial law and beijing residents put up blockades to prevent 
troops from entering the city 
students waiting saturday at the beijing railroad station to go 
home said they would bring their message out to the countryside 
we have to tell the people to arise including peasants 
workers intellectuals and others from every walk of life said a 
24yearold student from wuhan who asked not to be identified 
tens of thousands of students have occupied tiananmen since may 
13 when they began a hunger strike but over the past week 
thousands have returned to their schools in beijing and elsewhere 
and the capital has returned to normal 
we just feel the movement is ready to take a new form said 
one student we are ready to print newspapers and conduct 
speeches 
the student leaders called for april 27 to be made into a 
holiday commemorating their movement on that day hundreds of 
thousands marched in beijing to protest a peoples daily editorial 
denouncing the student movement 
in the first public acknowledgement of a power struggle former 
president li xiannian accused certain people in the leadership of 
the communist party of creating confusion in china an apparent 
reference to zhao 
these people have an organization a plan and a plot li was 
quoted as saying on television news if they succeed china will 
be thrown into a deep disaster 
in another blow to zhaos faction staterun media said wan li 
chairman of the standing committee of the national peoples 
congress had thrown his support to conservatives during a visit 
to the united states last week wan made statements expressing 
sympathy for the students 
after i had time to study the situation wan was quoted as 
saying in a letter i realized that a small minority was behind a 
plot to cause turmoil in society

nearly 300 people were kept from 
their homes saturday while investigators tried to find out why an 
underground gasoline pipeline blew up in the same spot where a 
train derailed two weeks earlier 
two people and possibly a third were killed in the explosion 
which enveloped a suburban neighborhood in a cauldron of gasfed 
flames thursday morning 
we are still searching still investigating the area said 
police spokeswoman bernita joyner 
an angry city official meanwhile said the owner of the 
pipeline had proposed to move the rebuilt line closer to homes that 
survived the rupture and explosion rather than farther away as the 
city has urged 
this has to be one of the most callous examples of corporate 
greed in the united states of america city attorney james penman 
said after killing those people they are going to move the 
pipeline closer to the survivors 
penman said calnev officials decided that the citys proposal to 
move the 14inch pressurized fuel line to the far side of the 
railroad tracks about a mile away from any homes is going to 
cost them too much money 
charles p diamond an attorney representing calnev said the 
company wants to move the pressurized fuel pipeline only about 3 
feet east of its existing route to obviate any safety concerns 
whatsoever to the existing pipe 
although the citys proposal for relocating the pipeline was 
discussed diamond said i told him that he lives in a hopelessly 
unrealistic world and that every major regulatory agency agrees 
that the pipeline should remain where it is 
calnev also planned to ask a federal judge to issue an order 
prohibiting penman and other city officials from interfering with 
calnev employees working in the area penman allegedly threatened 
to order san bernardino police to shoot calnev employees if they 
try to dig a new trench diamond said 
william pugh an investigator from the federal national 
transportation safety board declined to comment on the dispute at 
a news conference saturday evening 
ten homes were destroyed and five were damaged in the eighthour 
fire seventy homes were evacuated and ms joyner said it was 
unclear when the 270 displaced people would be be allowed to return 
home 
the area was barricaded to keep out the curious and there was a 
roundtheclock watch at this point there is no danger of fire 
or explosion ms joyner said 
the death toll from official sources has fluctuated rising to 
three then reduced to two on saturday the city police spokeswoman 
said there were three dead a woman another adult and a child but 
deputy coroner jim sedgwick said as far as he knew the san 
bernardino county coroners office had received two bodies 
the explosion occurred just days after experts assured city 
officials and residents that calnevs underground pipeline had 
escaped damage from the may 12 train wreck 
the southern pacific freight train flew off curving tracks atop 
an embankment and smashed a row of homes on duffy street two 
trainmen and two boys in a home were killed the train fell atop 
the ground where the pipe is buried 
the cause of the blast remained under investigation but calnev 
manager ken seal has said the pipe might have been damaged by the 
wreck 
after the blast pieces of metal were found in the ground near 
the pipe and were identified as pieces of a locomotive and a brake 
assembly from one of the runaway trains cars said jim kolstad 
acting chairman of the ntsb 
what ignited the fuel also remained unknown a train passed over 
the tracks 10 minutes before the blast but no connection was 
immediately drawn 
the city and an attorney for more than 100 residents announced 
plans to file lawsuits against the pipeline company the residents 
also plan to sue the city and the rail line southern pacific 
the american red cross provided vouchers for food clothing and 
lodging to the evacuees 
the residents are still in the motels and they will remain 
there until they get with southern pacific and decide what they 
will do said bonnie parker spokeswoman for the red cross 
the pipeline carried gasoline diesel and jet fuel from a tank 
farm in colton several miles from the blaze site to southern 
nevada supplying the las vegas valley with 90 percent of its fuel 
the flow of fuel through the pipeline was shut off when an 
automatic alarm signaled a drop in pressure said jed robinson 
calnev general manager in san bernardino however up to 12000 
gallons of gasoline burned 
the explosion was expected to cause a fivecent increase in las 
vegas gasoline prices over the memorial day weekend suppliers 
reported the price hike was prompted by the cost of having to ship 
gasoline and diesel fuel by tanker truck rather than the pipeline

atampt and unions representing about 160000 
workers were near agreement on new contracts early sunday 
resolving disputes over medical benefits and wages in a frenetic 
day of bargaining saturday and working through the night on a few 
remaining details 
disputes over certain jobclassification titles and exact 
contract language covering some areas of agreement blocked a 
settlement but believing an agreement was at hand the two unions 
agreed to bargain overnight and terms of contracts due to expire 
just before midnight saturday were extended until further notice 
its a speck we expect to work out a company official said 
of the final dispute we think well have it done by daybreak 
sunday a union official said 
in the overall agreement being worked out by american telephone 
amp telegraph and the unions was a wage and profitsharing package 
that should bring workers raises of more than 10 percent over three 
years a source said it is the first time atampt has offered profit 
sharing to its union workers 
the source speaking on the condition of anonymity said the 
unions had fought off atampts demand that workers pay more up front 
for health care costs the issue that dominated the talks from 
their outset in march 
atampt won concessions allowing it to amend certain job titles and 
thereby expand the duties of certain workers the source said 
also included was a package of parental family and eldercare 
leave provisions the family and eldercare provisions would allow 
workers to take six months off to care for a sick parent spouse or 
child without losing seniority the source said atampt would 
continue health insurance during the leave the source said 
and in a proposal atampt offered on the final day in hopes of 
brokering a settlement the company agreed to create a fund to 
support new and existing child care centers the companyunion fund 
reportedly would total 5 million 
if the remaining disputes are resolved union and company 
officials plan a joint news conference sunday afternoon 
an agreement would avert a possible holiday weekend strike by 
atampts union workers although the unions had not been expected to 
immediately call a strike even if there were not an agreement 
saturday 
the new contracts would be subject to rankandfile ratification 
and would replace contracts with the communications workers of 
america and the international brotherhood of electrical workers 
that expired at 1159 pm edt saturday 
it appeared as late as saturday afternoon that no agreement 
would be reached by the deadline as sources on both sides reported 
little movement on the health insurance fight 
but by early evening there was renewed optimism spawned by 
progress made in a series of private meetings between atampts top 
negotiator and two ranking union officials 
those sessions led to progress at the formal bargaining 
sessions and as the existing contracts entered their final hours 
both sides said an agreement before the deadline was possible 
but both sides girded for a possible walkout nonetheless 
atampt had several thousand managers on alert their bags packed 
in case they were dispatched around the country to replace strikers 
the unions used computer networks with locals across the nation 
to update members on the status of the talks and plans for 
implementing a nationwide labor boycott of atampt long distance had 
union leaders in the event no agreement was reached picked that 
strategy instead of an immediate strike 
a strike would have been the third against atampt in nine years 
ibew workers did not honor cwas 1986 strike allowing atampt to keep 
half its manufacturing plants open the two unions negotiated 
jointly for the first time this year 
the talks the largest singleemployer collective bargaining 
session this year took on added significance because they will 
affect negotiations later this year for nearly 500000 union 
workers at regional phone companies also major corporations 
seeking to curb soaring health care costs were eager to see whether 
atampt could pass some of the bill to workers 
the unions were determined to prevent the company from slicing 
its 1 billion annual medical bill at the union workers expense 
and from the start of the talks demanded expanded benefits while 
promising to work with atampt on costcontrol measures they said 
would save millions of dollars 
job security was the third major issue behind health insurance 
and wages and atampt made a significant concession in that area on 
friday by offering to limit its use of temporary workers 
that and other developments brought the first reports of 
significant progress with little more than 24 hours remaining in 
the existing contracts 
negotiators returned to the bargaining table at a washington 
hotel saturday after just a few hours of sleep 
overshadowing their work were periodic private meetings among 
cwa president morton bahr thomas hickman a top aide to ibew 
president john barry and atampts top negotiator raymond williams 
the companys vice president for labor relations those sessions 
were the key to breaking the impasse over health insurance 
atampts initial wage package presented formally on monday 
included base wage increases and lump sum payments for both 
operating and manufacturing employees and the companys first 
profitsharing plan for union workers 
included in that proposal was the companys demand that 
employees be required to pay 20 percent of doctors and hospital 
bills up to 1000 a year in addition to deductibles and 25 
percent of the premiums for dependent care atampt employees do not 
currently pay for dependent care and pay only annual deductibles 
ranging from 150 to 300 for medical care atampt said it needed the 
increased worker contribution to cut an annual medical bill of 1 
billion 
according to company estimates the negotiations affected about 
21500 longdistance operators 35500 inhouse and field 
technicians 37000 manufacturing employees and 54000 other 
personnel in clerical administrative sales and other positions

two dozen rightwing demonstrators vaulted 
barricades and briefly halted president bushs motorcade sunday as 
he traveled to a roman catholic mass in this seacoast city south of 
rome 
some protesters standing along the presidents route tossed 
handbills headlined anzio 1945 were they liberators or 
invaders at bushs motorcade while others formed a human pyramid 
in the road the motorcade was stopped for about three minutes 
until the protesters were removed by police 
the demonstrators made no attempt to reach the presidents 
limousine and secret service spokesman bob snow said bush was 
never in danger 
the president was well back he was never involved and never 
in danger snow said he was never threatened 
a few of the demonstrators who said they belonged to a group 
known as destra nazionale msi were arrested associated press 
photographer ron edmonds was injured slightly when a plainclothes 
officer hit him in the face with edmonds camera 
destra nazionale msi stands for national right italian social 
movement a neofascist political party 
bush was on his way to attend mass in st francis roman catholic 
church before he spoke at a cemetery for nearly 8000 americans 
slain in world war ii the cemetery is situated near the site of a 
britishamerican amphibious landing in 1944 
the demonstrators handbills objecting to the ceremony said 
the american president bush decided to give an emphasis and a 
propagandistic depiction that has nothing to do with an obligatory 
remembrance of the soldiers fallen in combat 
the brochures said americans would like to continue to 
present themselves as the only wall of defense of democratic 
liberties

president bush paid tribute sunday to 
americans slain in world war ii and said their sacrifices 
demonstrate that the west needs a strong military deterrent to 
preserve freedom and democracy 
on the eve of a nato summit threatened by discord over nuclear 
weapons policy bush appealed to the postwar generation of 
americans and europeans to remain vigilant against military threats 
he spoke at a memorial day weekend ceremony in a grassy cemetery 
on italys west coast where nearly 8000 americans are buried from 
world war ii and then paid a surprise visit to the us aircraft 
carrier guadalcanal which was anchored in nearby waters 
we only had 10 minutes we wanted to show the flag bush 
told capt john mckay of virginia beach va as he arrived aboard 
the carrier by helicopter 
the president returned to rome and flew to brussels belgium at 
midday for the twoday summit of western allies which begins 
monday seeing him off were italian foreign minister giulio 
andreotti and outgoing us ambassador maxwell rabb 
accompanied by his wife barbara the president flew here by 
helicopter from rome to lay a wreath and attend mass at st francis 
church which has only six pews seating about 70 people 
on his way to the church bushs motorcade was halted briefly by 
rightwing demonstrators who threw handbills and formed a human 
pyramid in the road the road was quickly cleared by police and a 
secret service spokesman said the president was never in danger 
bush who arrived in rome late friday night planned to travel 
to brussels later in the day for mondays opening of the 16nation 
nato summit 
in remarks prepared for delivery at the cemetery bush said the 
white crosses and stars of david marking the graves here and around 
the world were a silent tribute to americas battles for freedom 
in this century 
as i reflect on this scene and anticipate the dynamic and 
forwardlooking europe of the 1990s i think of generations of 
young people on both sides of the atlantic who have grown up in 
peace and prosperity 
with no experience of the horror and destruction of war 
bush said it may be difficult for them to understand why we need 
to keep a strong military deterrent to prevent war and to preserve 
freedom and democracy 
the answer is here among the quiet of the graves the 
president said 
the remarks echoed the sentiment he voiced last sunday in a 
speech at boston university when he said he was concerned about a 
growing complacency throughout the west 
as we gather today bush said it is dawn in america 
memorial day weekend 
and as the sun rises and the summer begins the images both 
here and at home are of countries that are prosperous and secure 
countries confident of their place in the world and aware of the 
responsibility that comes with that place he said 
meanwhile in brussels nato leaders already have started 
gathering for mondays summit 
the atmosphere of the meeting has been marred by a dispute 
largely between west germany on one side and the united states and 
britain on the other 
amid a tide of disarmament sentiment west german chancellor 
helmut kohl has demanded that the west open negotiations soon with 
the east to reduce shortrange nuclear missiles in central europe 
most of the weapons are based in germany and if used would 
fall on german soil 
kohl also is resisting plans to modernize the missiles to make 
them faster and increase their range 
the united states has opposed negotiations about the missiles 
arguing they are needed to offset the big advantage in conventional 
forces by the sovietled warsaw pact 
there also are fears in washington that any negotiations to 
reduce the number of missiles would create public pressure to 
eliminate them entirely

moslem rebels have launched a new 
offensive to capture the embattled eastern afghan city of 
jalalabad but there were conflicting reports sunday of their 
success 
rebel sources said the mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
began attacking communist government positions from all four sides 
saturday 
they claimed to have captured several government military posts 
and killed or wounded at least 70 communist troops rebels losses 
were put at about 10 dead 
however official radio kabul monitored in islamabad said 
government forces repulsed the attack and gained new territory 
around the city it said 55 enemy elements were killed and 46 
were wounded 
both sides of the afghan civil war often make exaggerated claims 
that contradict each other and usually cannot be verified 
independently 
the mujahedeen backed primarily by pakistan and the united 
states have fought unsuccessfully for jalalabad since march 6 the 
battle began about three weeks after soviet troops pulled the last 
of their troops from afghanistan ending nine years of military 
support for the marxist government 
afghan forces still hold the countrys major cities but the 
guerrillas reportedly control more than 90 percent of the 
countryside 
communist troops have withstood relentless rebel rocket and 
artillery attacks on jalalabad where they still control the city 
center and the military airport to the east 
guerrilla leaders earlier predicted that the kabul government 
would fall within weeks or months of the soviet troop withdrawal 
however president najib has said his forces tenacious defense 
of jalalabad proves the guerrills cannot win a military victory in 
afghanistan 
he has made repeated overtures for peace talks with the 
insurgents but they have refused 
mujahedeen leaders blame the ruling peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan for inviting the soviet military intervention they 
demand a complete capitulation of the kabul government and the 
establishment of an islamic republic of afghanistan 
fighting since the soviet pullout has concentrated on jalalabad 
42 miles west of the pakistan border and most recently khost a 
garrison town to the south 
rebel commanders also say they are preparing an allout assault 
on kabul 
guerrilas during the weekend claimed to have overrun at least 
three government posts around khost killing 50 soldiers and 
capturing four officers since thursday they said 18 rebels were 
killed 
radio kabul however claimed saturday night that 173 mujahedeen 
were killed and 32 were wounded 
foreign observers estimate that some 15 million afghans have 
died in the past 11 years of civil war more than 5 million 
afghans about onethird of the countrys prewar population of 15 
million live as refugees in pakistan and iran

the people of burma who saw their own 
dreams of democracy brutally crushed last year are gaining 
inspiration from the student uprising in neighboring china 
defying an army ban on demonstrations 12 students rallied 
outside the rangoon university campus one day last week and shouted 
slogans supporting the students in china a western diplomat 
reported 
tin oo chairman of the main opposition party the national 
league for democracy said friday that authorities detained six 
activists who pasted posters on trees in the capital proclaiming 
support for the chinese students he said the activists sought 
legal advice from him 
millions in burma last year followed university students and 
marched in the streets shouting for an end to decades of 
repression they forced the resignation of three presidents and 
ended the oneparty system but today they still live under a 
militaryrun government 
the burmese governments response to the protests was much 
harsher than chinas troops shot to death thousands of peaceful 
demonstrators and in september the military reestablished control 
and banned protests 
at least the chinese government has some respect for the 
students said moe thi zun a 24yearold student leader who fled 
to the thai border to escape arrest for organizing demonstrations 
in burma the students were just shot down in the streets 
before fleeing he was head of the democratic party for a new 
society the main studentled political party in burma 
at rallies this month aung san suu kyi the other leader of the 
national league for democracy contrasted the chinese governments 
attitude with the burmese leaders adamant refusal to make any 
contact at all with dissidents she was campaigning in the central 
city of mandalay for a general election that the government has 
promised for may 1990 
we started with a students movement so everyone has strong 
feelings for what is happening in china said tin oo reached by 
telephone in the burmese capital rangoon 
he was refering to the countrys tradition of student activism 
beginning with the campaign that led to burmas independence from 
great britain in 1948 
burmas staterun press has carried nothing on the events in 
china and the government has made no official comment but people 
have been following developments on the british broadcasting corp 
and the voice of america 
the uprising in china has boosted the morale of some of the 
3000 students who remain along the border with thailand after 
fleeing last years military crackdown in the cities they are 
living in harsh conditions in the malarial jungles where ethnic 
groups are fighting a 40yearold war for greater autonomy 
it makes them realize they are not alone moe thi zun said 
they can see there are people like them struggling for 
democracy 
but he said many students are upset that the world press that 
once ran the burma uprising on its front pages now gives it little 
coverage it is particularly sad as the students in burma went 
through even greater hardships than those in china now it is not 
worthy of page one even though there are many still suffering

in a land where people must wait decades 
for an apartment or telephone and pay inflated prices for scarce 
goods how does a party in power for nearly half a century run on 
its record 
such is the dilemma facing the polish united workers party as it 
prepares for the june 4 elections to parliament polands first 
somewhat democratic balloting since world war ii 
the communists are being challenged by a wellorganized 
emotionally driven opposition led by the newly legalized solidarity 
labor movement solidarity with the luster of novelty and the aura 
of idealism is awash in campaign contributions and volunteers 
at a converted coffee house in warsaws constitution square the 
headquarters of the solidarity citizens committee workers almost 
trip over each other to get out campaign literature deliver 
placards sign up poll watchers and instruct citizens on voting 
procedures 
a few blocks away in a stateowned department store the 
partyled coalitions campaign headquarters is almost empty one 
campaign workers is on duty his piles of leaflets sitting idle and 
unread 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski who ordered the 
crackdown that led to solidaritys suppression in 1981 and 
initiated the conciliation that resulted in its legalization this 
year has said the communist party must be prepared to face the 
electoral test 
party spokesman jan bisztyga said despite polands dire economic 
problems the party can point to some achievements during its 45 
years in power 
we had 45 years of peace at all our borders we had 
friends it means something he said we changed the classes in 
our country we had a majority of peasants 
now a majority has moved to an urban life and we have a huge 
intelligentsia 
all this took tremendous economic social and political 
effort he said so it is very unjust to enter the political 
campaign looking for errors and defeats 
more important than the past is the future he said the party 
is campaigning on the premise that it is the best bet for ensuring 
political and economic reform of all the political forces in the 
country he said the party is in the strongest position to 
guarantee that reforms actually will be carried out 
to say that the reforms just started now it is not true 
he said always in our party the communist party it was a trend 
to adopt our policy to the actual situation in poland 
the party pitches itself as pragmatic and practical implying 
solidarity is not banners around warsaw say with us its 
surer and we have a realistic program 
missing is any reference to the communist party itself instead 
of the partys polish initials pzpr posters bear a logo with a 
red mermaid a city symbol used by the warsaw coalition of 
party candidates and those of allied groups 
at stake in all of this are 460 seats in the existing 
parliament the sejm and 100 seats in the newly created senate 
the opposition is allotted only 161 seats in the sejm with the 
rest reserved for the communists but the race for the senate is 
wide open 
the new system was one of the agreements that came out of two 
months of talks between the government and the solidarityled 
opposition 
jaruzelskis regime agreed to the talks after a series of 
crippling labor strikes last year it is seeking solidaritys help 
in putting in place unpopular measures to overhaul the nations 
sickly economy 
in return among other things solidarity was made legal again 
and elections were made freer 
the solidarity citizens committee has named just one candidate 
for each of the parliament races it can enter 
the partys slate is less clearly defined for example there 
are more than 30 candidates on the ballot for three senate seats 
from warsaw three represent solidarity but the party has never 
clearly announced which of the others it supports 
wojciech szymborski a party propaganda department employee 
manning the coalitions warsaw campaign center says that is 
because the party wanted to let the people decide 
some opposition leaders have suggested the partys strategy 
includes trying to confuse voters candidate names are to appear on 
lengthy and complicated ballots with no indication of affiliation 
although the party has been in power since the reestablishment 
of a polish government after world war ii and claims a membership 
of 2 million about 5 percent of the population it has been 
trailing the opposition in opening campaign offices announcing a 
platform and putting up posters 
if you are talking about visual propaganda for certain we 
were behind the solidarity side szymborski conceded saying the 
party was slower to pick its candidates 
but he said the party is dealing more specifically with the 
issues 
solidarity first of all is basing its campaign on its name and 
its sign and our campaign is more complicated and wider he 
grumbled

editors note the writer reported from china between april 
1979 and november 1984 and was the associated press beijing bureau 
chief she is now the chief correspondent at the united nations

united nations a decade ago police scrubbed down beijings 
democracy wall and stifled the calls for political reform that 
sowed the seeds of todays protests for greater freedom in china 
democracy wall so named because it was laden with posters 
calling for democratic reform came to represent the early 
political dissent that was crushed by deng xiaoping chinas 
supreme leader 
the political tremors of 10 years ago presaged the current 
upheaval by millions of studentled protesters but there are major 
differences between the socalled beijing spring of 1979 and that 
of 1989 
the movement then was mostly underground and disorganized and 
involved a few thousand people mostly workingclass men it was 
far more strident and revolutionary than the past six weeks of 
jubilant demonstrations in beijing 
then there were no live television interviews with loquacious 
hopeful demonstrators in western clothes there were no rock 
concerts 
in december 1978 the united states and china restored 
diplomatic relations the next year witnessed the flowering and the 
end of the democracy wall in the same central square where todays 
students have centered their protests 
ten years ago the movement was fierce in rhetoric more 
negative than positive many dissidents likened communism to 
fascism and denounced deng as a modern emperor and tyrant they 
didnt know exactly what they wanted or how to get it but they 
knew they didnt want the status quo 
we dont want communism socialism capitalism or any other 
ism we want nationalism and the best for china dissidents 
said 
they were branded as counterrevolutionaries out to wreck chinese 
modernization 
in 1979 it took a special courage to stand up to the powerful 
state machinery that did not tolerate criticism ordinary citizens 
were afraid to speak out in support of the demonstrators poster 
writers artists and poets who clamored for change 
many were afraid to speak to foreigners because they might be 
interrogated by police 
in demonstrations police did not hesitate to disperse crowds 
using force some who dared speak out were beaten and jailed some 
lost their jobs 
one editor of an underground magazine wei jingsheng was tried 
and convicted as a traitor in 1979 he was sentenced to 15 years in 
a labor camp where some say he went mad and died 
but all that was before sweeping economic reforms gave people 
greater independence and confidence before glasnost and greater 
freedom began to sweep the communist world 
now millions of people nationwide have defied the government 
and martial law with marches and demands for democracy party 
reform and an end to endemic official corruption 
demonstrators have demanded the ouster of deng and his hardline 
protege premier li peng they have shouted chanted and they 
blocked army tanks when li declared martial law 
about 3000 went on a hunger strike 
though todays protest leaders face danger there is official 
recognition of legitimate demands for greater freedom 
the men and women today are disciplined and organized and more 
important they are backed by ordinary citizens their strength 
lies in numbers mass support reasonable demands for reform and a 
clean communist government they dont demand revolution 
even the government calls most of them patriots 
the student demands have been treated sympathetically by the 
official chinese press which has even joined the protests 
democracy wall a gray stone barricade between a bus yard and 
central tiananmen square was the focus of the movement 10 years 
ago when china was emerging from the cultural revolution and 
beginning to open to the outside world 
the wall 200 yards long and three yards high became a 
billboard for big character posters a staging ground for activism 
a gallery for dissident artists and a marketplace for ideas and 
unofficial magazines 
it made headlines in november 1978 when deng exploited it to 
discredit political opponents who banished him during the cultural 
revolution deng himself reportedly named it democracy wall 
wall posters are not forbidden they are a constitutional 
right and if the masses feel some anger we must let them express 
it deng said in late 1978 
but he also said the masses sometimes were confused 
then deng the architect of chinas economic reforms and open 
door decided that free speech had gone too far 
on dec 7 1979 big character posters were prohibited workers 
used scrapers shovels rakes brooms spatulas steel wool and 
eradicated the offending posters but not the ideas

soldiers planned to massacre people during a 
proindependence rally last month in soviet georgia and used clubs 
to beat the injured and the elderly an official report says 
the report issued by a georgian commission that looked into the 
april 9 clash that left 19 dead was circulated among deputies to 
the new soviet parliament which met during the weekend 
the report calls for the parliament the congress of peoples 
deputies to condemn the incident and determine who exactly was 
responsible 
otherwise the report said a shadow will be laid across 
the soviet government as a whole 
the report gives a horrifying account of troops behavior in the 
4 am clash with protesters it also supports claims of georgian 
activists who accused soldiers of extreme brutality 
soldiers blocked crossings surrounded citizens and beat them 
with clubs and shovels they did not spare hunger strikers girls 
old women doctors and red cross workers they pursued people who 
were running away and beat the wounded even more tearing them from 
the hands of medical personnel the report says 
we come to the conclusion that the action taken carries 
the signs of a punitive operation a planned mass massacre 
committed with special cruelty the commission reported 
the panel sponsored by the georgian parliament also said 
georgian television announced a curfew the day after the clash only 
four minutes before it went into effect so many residents were 
caught on the streets unaware one young man was shot and killed 
for violating the curfew 
it said the soviet media distorted coverage of the clash and its 
aftermath and it blamed local leaders for complete isolation from 
the people 
a medical subcommittees findings repeated widespread criticism 
of the defense and interior ministries for not telling doctors for 
several days exactly what sort of gas was used to control 
protesters 
western doctors who conducted autopsies have said the gases 
described as suffocants caused some of the deaths 
also more than 4000 people have required treatment mainly for 
poisoning and diagnosis and treatment would have been much easier 
if authorities had acknowledged earlier that they used a chemical 
agent the report said 
a soviet magazine recently carried an interview with georgian 
chief prosecutor vakhtang razmadze who said representatives of the 
communist party the government and the military attended the 
meeting at which the decision was made to use troops to break up 
the demonstration 
they included georgian party chief zhumber patiashvili who 
later resigned general igor rodionov the regional military 
commander who is now a deputy at the congress and a deputy 
national defense minister 
the account was consistent with a claim made thursday by 
president mikhail s gorbachev at the congress he said he and 
other politburo members found out about the decision to bring in 
troops only hours after the damage was done 
protests began in tbilisi georgias capital in early april in 
response to demands by the abkhazian minority in northwest georgia 
to have their area transferred to the russian republic

a fried egg sizzles and burns on the 
television screen as an ominous voice intones this is your brain 
on drugs 
another ad depicts a medical machine recording the active brain 
waves of a typical 14yearold followed by the somewhat deadened 
brain waves of a 14yearold after smoking marijuana 
the advertisements are brought to the screen by advertisers who 
have voluntarily collaborated on the efforts and by tv networks 
that have provided millions of dollars worth of free air time 
but do they work 
some including the mediaadvertising partnership for a 
drugfree america and its sister organization the advertising 
council maintain they are effective in changing public attitudes 
about drug use that position is supported by william j bennett 
director of the federal office of national drug control policy 
others say the ads are a waste of money 
don des jarlais an epidemiologist who works with heroin and 
cocaine addicts in new york city said when the addicts do refer to 
the ads its derisively 
theyre not aimed at addicts he said theyre aimed at 
people not using or casual users the preliminary data ive seen 
indicate they do change some attitudes but in terms of actually 
changing drug use that remains to be seen 
john condry a cornell university professor who has spent the 
past year at the center for research on the influences of 
television on children at the university of kansas said television 
is delivering too many mixed messages for the ads to have an impact 
condry said he has found that the ratio of prodrug to antidrug 
messages on television was 8to1 including programs and 
advertisements showing people smoking drinking or taking medicines 
even legitimate ads for such things as overthecounter pain 
medications send the wrong message he contended 
while its not illegal what they are saying is if you dont 
like the state youre in if you have a headache you take a drug 
take some sort of substance to change how you feel condry 
said 
for a child its not clear theres a distinction between one 
drug and another a pills a pill he said 
peggy charren president of action for childrens television 
said the money spent to make and broadcast the public service ads 
could be better spent on education 
the just say no ad effort promoted by the advertising 
council seems to me the kind of campaign that kids who are 
dealing in drugs laugh at she said 
its not that i think these advertisements are damaging 
charren said whats damaging about it is that it makes the 
society feel were doing something it makes the ad industry feel 
its ok to advertise the products of their clients in programs that 
glamorize crime in the streets violence against women and the 
culture that gives rise to drug dealing 
its conscience money for a society that is not taking care of 
that part of the population thats most likely to get involved in 
drugs she said 
but lloyd d johnston program director for the institute for 
social research at the university of michigan praised the 
effectiveness of the advertising campaigns 
johnston codirector of the 1988 national survey of high school 
seniors that indicated a decrease in illicit drug use credited the 
ads with having a substantial impact 
i personally believe the partnerships efforts played an 
important role in helping to bring about these changes and the 
young people we survey seem to believe it as well johnston wrote 
to the partnership for a drugfree america they report a very 
high level of recalled exposure to the antidrug advertising a 
high degree of credibility in the content and most important a 
high judged impact on their own drugusing behaviors and 
attitudes 
the annual university of michigan survey is backed by the 
federal government and has won acceptance over the years as the 
best measure of high school drug use but it makes no pretense of 
measuring drug use among the 15 percent who drop out of school and 
are more prone to drug use 
david clemm chief operating officer of the polling firm of 
gordon s black corp hired by the american association of 
advertising agencies to survey the antidrug ads impact said the 
survey found they were effective when they got a lot of air time 
in the areas where we were able to get more exposure we were 
having an impact clemm said among key groups we were seeing 
changing attitudes and perceptions changes in drug use 
the partnership has been responsible for some 70 different tv 
commercials and clemm noted that different ads affect different 
groups 
there isnt one single message that will work with every 
group he said 
younger children ages 9 and up respond more to ads questioning 
whether the drug pushers and drug users are really such cool 
characters the big men on campus the people you want to be 
friends with clemm said basing his remarks on interviews over 
two years with some 14000 people 
older teens and college students responded to concern over 
what their younger brothers and sisters might do because of their 
actions and adults were affected by depictions of the possible 
impacts on their work performance whether they might endanger 
others as well as themselves by taking drugs clemm said 
bennett cited the gordon black study when he said in an 
interview that the advertising does work it works not for the 
hardcore addict but it does work for a person whos a casual 
user in addition he said it helps prevent people from starting 
to use drugs if you get the right ad 
theresa venet grant of the partnership for a drugfree america 
rejected charrens contention that the commercials represent 
conscience money 
i think these ads work she said i think theres a 
changing tone in the entire entertainment industry that 
eliminates qualms advertisers might have in supporting programs 
while also participating in antidrug efforts 
among the shows she cited as making a conscious effort to 
deglamorize drug use were 21 jump street growing pains 
and family ties 
to say the industry doesnt care thats just as irresponsible 
as saying that we dont have a problem grant said

the special relationship forged between britain 
and the united states during ronald reagans presidency will thrive 
under george bush but on a more businesslike footing analysts 
predict 
that relationship is likely to be nurtured at the annual nato 
summit in brussels beginning monday 
mrs thatcher is siding with bush in a dispute with west germany 
over shortrange nuclear missiles in europe west germany has 
demanded that the west open negotiations with the east to reduce 
the number of missiles while the united states and britain want to 
modernize the weapons 
after the summit and a stop in bonn west germany bush is 
scheduled to travel to london on thursday for talks with mrs 
thatcher 
mrs thatcher had made a point of meeting with bush during his 
two terms as vice president and following his election in november 
described him as a worthy successor to reagan 
reagan and mrs thatcher were ideological soul mates who 
operated on a firstname basis and with obvious personal warmth 
during the eight years that their conservative administrations 
overlapped 
things arent likely to be as folksy with bush 
i dont think the chemistrys going to be there said john 
young faculty member of the london school of economics 
international history department 
i think theres going to be less warmth there i think there 
was genuine mutual admiration between ronald reagan and margaret 
thatcher because they are kind of believing people young said 
they believe in a cause to fight for and they admire each 
other for standing up and fighting president bush through his 
background is far more a wheelerdealer kind of character he 
said 
charles h price ii reagans ambassador to britain predicted 
bushs relations with mrs thatcher will be even closer than his 
predecessors because both are handson managers 
i think with george bush in a sense she will have a more 
special relationship than ronald reagan had price told american 
reporters before returning to the united states 
former secretary of state henry kissinger agreed telling 
britains sky television 
the relationship good as it was between president reagan and 
mrs thatcher will be at least as good if not better between 
president bush and prime minister thatcher 
mr reagan based his relationship very much on personal 
intuition kissinger said president bush is a man who is more 
reflective about the conceptual matters 
peter jay britains ambassador to washington from 197779 said 
personal relations between leaders has little impact on policy or 
decision making 
but he pinpointed one factor that he said could make bushs 
relations with the british leader different from reagans 
president bush actually knows about and is interested in 
government and mrs thatcher knows about and is interested in 
government both at the national and international level jay said 
mrs thatcher has regularly backed the united states sometimes 
alone 
britain was the first to deploy us cruise missiles in europe 
in 1983 and it was the only ally to support the 1986 us bombing 
raid on libya 
despite her personal reservations mrs thatcher publicly 
endorsed the 1987 ussoviet agreement to remove the missiles and 
in january royal air force base molesworth 50 miles north of 
london became the first nato cruise missile base to be disarmed 
reagan in turn approved vital arms supplies and intelligence 
to britain during the 1982 falkland islands war against argentina

a bill to boost federal spending this year by 
less than 1 percent has set democrat against democrat and the house 
against the senate in a classic case study of the dynamics that 
drive congress 
the bloodletting has been sparked by a 37 billion domestic 
spending bill the house approved last wednesday and the senate 
plans to debate this week 
the measure is a routine one at this point in the federal fiscal 
year which ends sept 30 the supplemental spending bills 
traditionally provide funds for agencies that find themselves 
needing more money for the final few months of a year 
but as usual there is more to it than that and the more has 
touched off skirmishing among many of the capitals power centers 
the white house and house democrats have been feuding over the 
measure since shortly after march 24 when president bush asked 
congress for a 22 billion version of the bill the house 
appropriations committee which originates spending legislation 
expanded it to a 47 billion package before slicing 1 billion 
from it last week 
the 1 billion cut is not enough white house budget 
director richard darman complained to congressional leader last 
wednesday 
a provision supplying 822 million for a host of antidrug 
programs has touched off battling between democrats and republicans 
in the house all of them already looking at elections next year 
and beyond 
aware of opinion polls showing that the public considers illegal 
drugs to be the nations worst problem the houses majority 
democrats had inserted the drug funds into the bill 
this sparked a bush administration veto threat against the 
measure arguing that there is no reason to inflate this years 
federal deficit by supplementing law enforcement agencies that 
already have more money than they can spend the result was floor 
debate in which members of each party sought to embarrass the other 
rep ben jones dga described a rising body count from 
drugs and asked how long are we going to wait until we recognize 
the clear call of the american people 
but house minority leader robert michel rill said the 
measures drug spending was designed by democrats to build a 
partisan record to be used against incumbents in next years 
election 
the fighting spilled over into the democratic party itself 
liberals stymied for months by bipartisan budget deals that 
stifled many of their priorities were allowed to offer an 
amendment that would have transferred hundreds of millions of 
dollars from antimissile research to drug programs 
the provision was defeated 213205 with 47 democrats voting in 
opposition one opponent appropriations defense subcommittee 
chairman john murtha dpa bolstered his case for the militarys 
need for money for training and other programs by describing 
children crying at the memorial service for the victims of the 
fatal explosion aboard the battleship uss iowa 
but the liberals got their licks in too they pointed out that 
the position of their mostly republican opponents was in stark 
contrast to president bushs repeated pronouncements against what 
he has called the scourge of drugs 
it is about time we put our money where our mouth is 
taunted rep charles schumer dny 
on another level the bill has churned up the ageold struggle 
between the house and senate over whose pet projects get financed 
the bill which originated in the house so far contains only that 
chambers version of what it says needs to be done 
members of the senate have yet to be heard from including 
appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva who gave up 
his post of majority leader this year after making clear he 
intended to use his new job to help his home state win its share of 
federal largesse 
byrd made his presence known two weeks ago when the house broke 
12 billion for veterans out of the overall bill and into a 
separate measure and sent the legislation to the senate 
the veterans money is virtually sacrosanct politically but 
byrd and sen mark hatfield of oregon ranking republican on the 
appropriations committee reduced the size of the measure the 
effect was to keep the agency going for awhile longer but not 
until the new budget year begins oct 1 
byrd and hatfield made clear that they wanted a later bill 
containing the rest of the veterans money to carry with it money 
for projects the senate considers important 
among the measures the senate is expected to seek money for is a 
66 million boost to the program that subsidizes airlines 
servicing remote communities and 75 million to rebuild a radio 
telescope that collapsed last winter in west virginia 
the senate also plans to strip the antidrug money from the 
house bill as part of a deal with the white house for a compromise 
spending package according to congressional aides who asked to not 
be identified 
thus a clash looms between byrd and house appropriations 
chairman jamie whitten dmiss a wily veteran of congressional 
spending wars who has been in congress for 48 of his 79 years 
jamie has met his match in byrd one congressional aide said

nearly 80 percent of college students say 
religion is important in their lives but their faith has relatively 
little impact on their sexual behavior and attitudes according to 
a new campus survey 
half the 539 students questioned in a gallup poll commissioned 
by the christian broadcasting network said they read the bible at 
least occasionally and 55 percent said they had attended church or 
synagogue in the month preceding the survey 
a full 42 percent said religion is very important to them 
while another 37 percent said it is somewhat important only 6 
percent identified themselves as atheists or agnostics 
nevertheless 69 percent of the students said they do not 
believe premarital sex is wrong and 56 percent said they approve of 
living together in trial marriages half said they approve of the 
current status of abortion rights with 9 percent of female 
students saying they had had an abortion and 15 percent of the 
males saying their partners had had one 
responding to other questions on their own sexual practices 
three quarters of the students said they had engaged in sex and 
half said they have had more than one partner a quarter said they 
have had five or more partners another quarter said they were 
virgins 
on the one hand we were pleased that the majority of college 
students in america find religion somewhat important said susan 
norman a senior editor at cbn but we were disappointed to see 
that even though they believe in god their faith doesnt seem to 
have much of an effect on their personal lives and habits their 
sexual attitudes and practices 
gallup conducted the survey in march at 100 twoyear and 
fouryear campuses using a sample statistically representative of 
college students nationwide the margin of error is 6 percent 
the survey found that religion had the most impact on the 
lifestyles and attitudes of the 23 percent of the students who 
identified themselves as evangelicals or bornagain christians 
more than half of the evangelicals said they oppose premarital 
sex twothirds said they think living together before marriage is 
wrong and 71 percent said they oppose abortion in the first 
trimester of pregnancy 
catholic students representing 29 percent of the survey 
strayed furthest from the teachings of their church the survey 
found that three out of four approve of premarital sex and divorce 
on the grounds of incompatibility 59 percent approve of trial 
marriages and 53 percent approve of abortion rights 
protestants making up 48 percent of those surveyed fell in the 
middle the samples of jewish students and those of other religions 
were too small to be analyzed separately 
the survey found that evangelicals went to church and read the 
bible far more frequently than any other group maybe the key to 
having your faith affect your personal life is to have your faith 
practiced with action and also to have that community of support 
for morality through the church norman said 
the students broadest consensus was in opposing adultery asked 
how important it is for a married couple to have sexual relations 
only with each other 92 percent said very important 
i guess what theyre saying is that its okay to experiment a 
little bit before marriage but after marriage they expect their 
spouses to be faithful to them norman said 
poll director bob bezilla attributed the finding partially to 
the impact of aids 
the return to the monogamous family and all is a very very 
strong instinct right now he said if we had asked that 
question preaids lets face it there were an awful lot of 
onenight stands and a much more liberal atmosphere it may be a 
practical matter for some people 
on another issue the survey found that 66 percent of the female 
students would like to be married have children and hold a 
fulltime job or career outside the home the least popular option 
was being married with no children and no outside job chosen by 
only 1 percent and only 9 percent of the women said they wanted to 
be married with children but no outside job

this memorial day will be special for 24 
students in mary munsons firstperiod english class it coincides 
with john f kennedys birthday and the students think its an apt 
day to honor the late president 
the lincoln middle school students plan a memorial gettogether 
in kennedys honor and have even persuaded state lawmakers to 
endorse their notion that the late president should be honored on 
the day he was born not the day he died 
the students had a grand idea state rep john medinger said 
medinger credits the students for a resolution enacted last 
week in it the state legislature asked congress to honor kennedy 
annually on may 29 his birthday instead of nov 22 the date of 
his assassination in 1963 
ms munson said the class originally learned by accident that 
kennedys birthday was may 29 which happens to be memorial day 
this year they realized then that they didnt know much about him 
she said 
after doing some research the students made a pamphlet buttons 
and posters to promote awareness of the nations 35th president 
for 25 years weve focused on kennedys death the pamphlet 
says we believe it is time to move on 
kennedy would have turned 72 on monday

solidarity leader lech walesa told more 
than 300000 religous pilgrims sunday that upcoming parliamentary 
elections are the biggest step toward democracy in 45 years of 
communist rule 
at the biggest campaign rally so far walesa urged poles to vote 
in the june 4 election the first somewhat democratic vote in 
poland since world war ii 
many people dont believe they ask are the communists 
giving something away thats impossible it is a cheat he 
said this is the best chance in 45 years to fulfill our hopes 
and desires 
the opposition will vie with communist party candidates for all 
100 seats in a newly created senate and 161 of 460 places in the 
sejm the existing parliament the elections were set up last month 
after talks between solidarity and the government 
political reforms agreed to during the talks included 
reinstating the solidarity trade union after a sevenyear ban 
solidaritys political faction put up candidates for all available 
seats 
arriving on foot from the coal and steelproducing regions the 
pilgrims streamed up a hillside where walesa sat on an alter beside 
krakows cardinal franciszek macharski he is the secondranking 
church official in the predominantly roman catholic country 
sometimes we must pray or sing together walesa said it 
is the time for team play and not individual play today the team 
called solidarity is playing against the team called government 
coalition 
the pilgrims who each year trek to the piekary shrine in 
southern poland welcomed walesa enthusiastically 
although the cardinal did not speak about solidarity he 
introduced walesa to the crowd 
the church has wide influence in poland and played a key role in 
setting up negotiations between the opposition and the government 
when solidarity was illegal union leaders found sanctuary in many 
churches

nato leaders pondering us and soviet 
troops reductions in europe will be under close scrutiny during 
their twoday meeting from another army at record strength summit 
journalists 
sparks of disunity in the 16nation alliance have drawn a throng 
of 1600 reporters to cover natos 40th anniversary celebration 
last year when nato leaders came here to pat each other on the 
back for the alliances success about 1200 journalists showed up 
to ply the hallways and briefing rooms of the sprawling nato 
complex 
compared to many other summits where world leaders meet to 
ceremonially rubber stamp earlier decisions the current nato 
summit features tension suspense and an unpredictable outcome 
it has become a very good story said abc assignment editor 
marcus wilford 
the meeting will pit us president george bush and british 
prime minister margaret thatcher against alliance maverick west 
germany on whether the united states should open talks with the 
soviet union on reduction of shortrange missiles 
west germanys open support of a new round of arms talks breaks 
with nato defense doctrine and has created a rift within the 
alliance 
bush is also rumored to be planning announcement of a withdrawal 
of some us troops from europe a public relations counterpoint to 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs offers to reduce conventional 
forces in eastern europe 
usually you pretty much know what to expect at the outset 
but this time the controversy makes it more complicated said 
nbc producer ted elbert 
the us media top natos accreditation list with 450 
journalists many traveling with bush throughout his fournation 
european tour 
the us networks each have 40 to 50 people in brussels 
including their anchormen european networks have also massed in 
brussels for the summit 
news formats are getting more similar wherever you go 
commented british professor graham murdock a specialist on the 
media 
the dozen reporters sent by soviet media remain an exception and 
their coverage is again expected to closely reflect the government 
line said brian mcnair of ulster university 
glasnost has not substantially changed the way that the soviet 
media report on foreign affairs he said there will be no 
debate whether the soviet government is right 
strong coverage of events like the nato summit can earn the us 
networks an edge in their ongoing ratings war 
but the talking heads that dominate news conferences and 
briefings at such summits are unlikely to offer any footage as 
dramatic as a million flagwaving demonstrators in beijing 
threatening to topple the chinese government 
it is a problem we always face when we cover stories that 
involve intellectual concepts rather than bangbang footage 
said cbs special events producer mark kramer it is a challenge 
the us networks went out in force to cover the protests in 
beijings tiananmen square and some are now paying the piper 
some producers complain that equipment from beijing that was 
supposed to be forwarded to brussels got held up at chinese 
customs some personnel arrived late and tired or not at all 
forcing the networks to scramble for replacements 
absent crews may not regret missing the chance to toil in the 30 
trailers where film and videos are processed outside natos press 
center the trailers have been turned into saunas by a spell of 
torrid temperatures making this the hottest may of the century

an aging italian war veteran stood 
silently in a cheering crowd at the us military cemetery sunday 
straining to hear president bush pasquali fernando doesnt speak 
english but he understood the message 
we are here to honor the men who have fallen in war said 
fernando as he stood beside a field of white marble tombstones 
where bush gave a memorial day weekend speech paying tribute to 
americans killed in world war ii 
i hid american and british soldiers from the germans 
fernando said proudly 
each of the 7860 graves was decorated with american and italian 
flags and with a single pink chrysanthemum 
thousands of italians and a handful of americans stood on the 
grassy mall in front of the memorial where bush spoke some waved 
small american and italian flags they were given at the gate some 
cheered the president they could barely see and a few wilted in the 
heat they were carried to the shade by us navy medics 
i like bush simply because he is the president of the united 
states said fernando pulling a tattered document from his 
pocket 
the paper signed by british field marshall hr alexander 
supreme allied commander in the mediterranean in world war ii 
thanked fernando for helping allied soldiers escape or avoid 
capture 
not everyone in nettuno shared fernandos sentiments 
bushs earlier arrival at st francis roman catholic church to 
attend mass was delayed briefly when about 40 rightwing 
demonstrators vaulted barricades and formed a human pyramid in 
front of the presidents motorcade 
none made an attempt to reach bush or his limousine police 
removed them in about three minutes and took 15 to nearby anzio for 
questioning the demonstrators said they belonged to the destra 
nazionale msi national right italian social movement italys 
neofascist and fourth largest political party 
the protesters tossed handbills that questioned whether the 
allied troops that waded ashore at nettuno and anzio on jan 22 
1944 were liberators or invaders 
americans would like to continue to present themselves as the 
only wall of defense of democratic liberties the fliers said 
inside the cemetery 25 soviet jews who said they had been 
denied us visas sought out american reporters asking them to 
call their plight to bushs attention 
we were refuseniks in the soviet union and now we are 
refusniks in italy said valerie poljakov of kiev 
they said nettuno authorities had denied them permission to 
demonstrate silently along the motorcade route and wave banners 
urging bush to help them get visas 
most of those in the cemetery crowd said they came just to see 
an american president they began arriving hours ahead of bushs 
brief appearance standing in long lines to pass through metal 
detectors and have their handbags searched by security police 
the legacy of the american war dead was dramatized by the sight 
of three uniformed baseball teams of boys who joined the throng

immigrants fell near cisterna on the same day and was buried at 
the nettuno cemetery in a grave marked by the medal of honor

tragedy strikes bush said citing antolak as an american who 
understood the cost of freedom 
at the st clairsville ceremony monday he said antolaks 
brothers george and stanley will be there to remember their 
brother their hero and ours 
in st clairsville stanley antolak 76 said sunday that he was 
surprised that bush would mention him and his brothers in the 
cemetery speech in italy thats pretty special he said i 
never expected it 
stanley said he remembered his fallen brother sylvester as a 
farmer a carpenter a hunter an allround country boy 
after his tribute to american war dead bush paid a surprise 
visit by helicopter to the us aircraft carrier guadalcanal which 
was anchored in nearby waters 
we only had 10 minutes we wanted to show the flag bush 
told capt john mckay of virginia beach va when he arrived with 
first lady barbara bush 
the presidents impromptu visit was clearly a surprise for some 
of the guadalcanals crew as the president and his wife headed for 
mckays cabin one sailor scurried by from his morning shower

movie star rob lowes attorney said his client 
probably will comment this week on allegations he induced an 
underage girl into having sex in an atlanta hotel room and 
videotaped the action 
lawyer edgar neely iii of atlanta said he expects lowe to say he

the bush administration is planning to change 
the mix of airplanes and helicopters assigned to aircraft carriers 
resulting in a navywide loss of one full carriers worth of 
aircraft according to a congressional study 
although the bush administration is nominally planning to fill 
out and support the same number of carrier airwings as the reagan 
administration 13 active and two reserve airwings the bush 
administrations total numerical requirement for carriercapable 
aircraft represents the equivalent of one less airwing said the 
study by the congressional research service of the library of 
congress 
rep george hochbrueckner dny a member of the house armed 
services committee requested the study as part of his efforts to 
save the f14d jet fighter which was cut from the 1990 budget by 
defense secretary dick cheney hochbrueckner released the study 
sunday evening 
the navys new airwing structure doesnt solve the severe 
problem of aircraft shortfalls it tries to cover them up 
hochbrueckner said while i am all for moving to a standardized 
airwing i believe this sudden move by the navy is a defense of the 
bushcheney budget rather than a defense of the national interest 
hochbrueckner and long islands four other congressmen have been 
fighting to restore some 360 million to the 1990 budget for 12 new 
f14ds the f14d tomcat is manufactured by grumman corp in 
bethpage ny which has said it faces cutting 5600 jobs if 
funding for the jet is not restored 
ronald orourke crss naval analyst who prepared the study 
said he learned in the course of his research that the navy is 
planning to switch in the 1990s from a combination of aircraft 
carrier configurations to a standardized transitional airwing 
the result would be a reduction of 126 to 128 aircraft or the 
number required to fill out and support an active roosevelt or 
conventional airwing orourke said 
no navy spokesman would be available to discuss airwings until 
tuesday the navy press office said friday 
at the end of fiscal 1988 the navy operated a combination of 
roosevelt conventional kennedy and midway airwings roosevelt and 
conventional airwings carry 86 craft apiece the experimental 
kennedy and midway airwings carry 76 and 66 aircraft respectively 
at the end of fiscal 88 the navy and naval reserves had 10 
conventional airwings two kennedys two midways and one roosevelt 
switching to transitional airwings would require 10 fewer f14s 
than in 1988 a reduction of 21 percent the study found

in carefully cryptic terms the 
traveling white house is heralding a conciliatory message from 
president bush to counter soviet offers and perhaps defuse nato 
differences on tactical nuclear weapons 
bush flew from rome to brussels on sunday for the 40th 
anniversary nato summit beginning monday and his spokesman said it 
would be th forum for a number of us proposals many of which 
have not been presented before 
the proposals apparently will involve some reduction in us 
forces in europe on terms yet to be disclosed in addition there 
are likely to be economic gestures toward moscow involving a 
relaxation of restrictions on hightechnology exports 
according to white house press secretary marlin fitzwater troop 
levels will be one of the issues on the bush agenda at the meeting 
with the leaders of 15 other nato nations 
bush himself was silent on the subject dismissing questions 
about a report that he plans a 10 percent us troop reduction as 
he conferred with italian leaders and met with pope john paul ii in 
rome 
at advance memorial day observances on sunday at an american 
cemetery in nettuno italy near the world war ii landing zone at 
anzio bush spoke of the generations who have grown in peace and 
prosperity since that war 
with no experience of the horror and reduction of war it may 
be difficult for them to understand why we need to keep a strong 
military deterrent to prevent war and to preserve freedom and 
democracy the president said the answer is here among the 
quiet of these graves 
that insistence on deterrence despite soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachevs arms reduction offers is another of the topics 
awaiting bush at nato 
west germany has been pressing for immediate talks on 
shortrange nuclear missiles most of them deployed on german soil 
with ranges of 300 miles and down meaning that they also would be 
used on german soil if it came to that 
the bush administration doesnt want those talks now wary that 
the soviet union would seek to preempt the negotiations with an 
immediate proposal to eliminate all shortrange nuclear weapons 
the administration sees those weapons as an essential deterrent 
offsetting soviet superiority in conventional arms 
the administration tried without success to settle that 
disagreement prior to buhs journey to europe and the summit 
nevertheless the administration does not see the difference as a 
crisis or an issue likely to overshadow the summit 
the troop question would be a compelling issue too pressure on 
that topic is not just international there are growing demands in 
congress for a greater sharing of defense burdens by european 
allies 
some reduction in us forces is guaranteed at least 4000 
under budget decisions already made and almost certainly more in 
manpower assigned to intermediaterange nuclear missiles which are 
to be eliminated under a 1987 treaty with the soviet union 
according to pentagon testimony that will eliminate the jobs of 
about 14500 us personnel in europe over the next 16 months the 
armed forces want to keep most of those personnel in europe on 
other assignments but there are demands in congress to bring them 
home 
amid all of that the administration has indicated that some 
troop reduction may already have occurred routinely from the 
limit of 325000 to the perhaps 305000 estimated by an 
administration official the official who declined to be 
identified said manpower levels fluctuate constantly 
but a swing like that if it lasted would carry more than 
routine significance

the new congress of peoples deputies president 
mikhail s gorbachevs school for democracy is balancing in 
its first days on a thin edge between anarchy and oldstyle 
political manipulation 
in three exhausting days played out in the kremlin the 2250 
deputies 
alternately inflamed and bored colleagues with a flood of 
speeches more often touching on lofty principles or elementary 
procedure than politics 
refused to include many top reformers in the new fulltime 
legislature entrusting its duties to deputies selected by local 
delegations in a hazy manner 
forced gorbachev to answer sharp questions from littleknown 
deputies about his privileges and policies and to delay election 
of his candidate for vice president 
gorbachev has called the congress his concept for 
strengthening the soviet government and making it more democratic 
a school of democracy for a nation accustomed to heavyhanded 
kremlin control 
a few years ago deputies could have been jailed for saying some 
of the things they pronounced openly in debate many of the 
statements have taken the tone of a selfcleansing after years of 
forced silence 
gorbachev reacted with patience and humor he asserted his 
desire to be elected president before giving a policy speech but 
addressed touchy issues like his governmentprovided country house 
and his holding of both the party and government leadership 
reformist historian yuri afanasiev said gorbachev was either 
attentively listening to the majority or skillfully manipulating 
it 
before the congress took a break late saturday to resume its 
work monday morning gorbachev sought to reassure it that its 
disputes were normal 
one need not panic he said it is all right when passions 
are stirring 
the passion flared most sharply when reformers lost out in 
elections for the 542member supreme soviet legislature 
selfstyled progressives from moscow proved inept in a battle of 
tactics which lenin taught the communist party to value above 
nearly all else 
muscovites alloted 29 seats on the supreme soviet nevertheless 
put forward a list of 55 candidates for those seats 
they said it was a matter of principle that the congress should 
have a choice but reformer sergei stankevich acknowledged if 
the list is longer than the quota it is possible to lose some 
people 
that proved to be an understatement the congress used its 
choice to cull the reformers among them boris n yeltsin who won 
89 percent of the vote in march in popular elections for the 
congress of peoples deputies but didnt make the cut for the 
supreme soviet 
stankevich himself received only 806 votes from the 2250member 
congress 
reformers from the baltic republics more accustomed to 
parliamentary giveandtake threatened to boycott the elections if 
choices were forced on them and engineered the election of 
progressive slates by putting forward only as many candidates as 
they had allotted seats 
the delegation from russia was the only one of 15 republics that 
offered a choice of candidates for the new legislatures soviet of 
nationalities chamber 
moscow candidate alexander kraiko said reformers woke up too 
late to what was going on in the russian delegation which was 
allotted 11 seats 
we did not notice that there were 12 people that there were 
more people than our quota and it was clear that if our quota was 
exceeded he would not be elected he said 
rules and structure during the congressional session were poorly 
worked out and the meeting languished for hours as deputies 
repeated each other or made proposals that everyone ignored 
it lost its entire second day debating how to conduct elections 
for the supreme soviet 
gorbachev at one point declared that a crisis had developed 
because of an impasse over competitive balloting he then called a 
recess and ignored the issue when the session resumed

corrosion caused metal fatigue that led to the 
collapse of the left main landing gear on a delta air lines 727 jet 
while it was being towed away from an airport gate last week a 
federal investigator concluded 
arnold scott a denver investigator with the national 
transportation safety board blamed the collapse on fatigue in a 
corroded trunnion assembly on the plane trunnions are the main 
struts that attach landing gear to airplanes 
and so when the tug pulled the plane forward an inch or two 
that was all she needed and it collapsed right there scott said 
friday 
there were 113 passengers and seven crew members on board the 
flight when the landing gear collapsed at stapleton international 
airport no injuries were reported 
scott said the corrosion could not have been seen without taking 
apart the landing gear 
trunnions are scheduled for regular teardown inspections the 
one that failed wednesday was scheduled for inspection in august 
1990 and had never been taken off the 8yearold plane scott said 
following the incident delta made plans to inspect its entire 
fleet of 727s other airlines will be notified of the problem

guests at the wayside inn can walk away 
with a lot more than ashtrays and towels for a price 
the rooms in wayside of virginias six hotels have been 
decorated with antique furniture and art objects about 90 percent 
of which are for sale 
weve sold beds said judy brown historical curator of 
wayside properties beds are the big thing people want to take 
with them 
prices of the antiques vary a small print costs about 50 a 
fullsize walnut bed is priced at about 2000 and a painting of 
george washington sells for 45000 
rooms in the wayside inn in middletown which has been in use 
continously as an inn since 1797 are decorated mostly in the 
colonial style but the lincoln room has a portrait of abraham 
lincoln and an 1860s lincoln rocker socalled because lincoln had 
one like it in the white house the wallpaper pattern in the 
lincoln room matches one used at monticello thomas jeffersons 
home near charlottesville 
people are having a lot of fun with this ms brown said 
my idea was to do something so out of the ordinary you wouldnt 
have anything like it at home 
people are tickled we had a preservation group on wednesday 
they were thrilled to death 
wayside owns the hotel strasburg and two other inns in 
strasburg about five miles south of middletown in the northern 
shenandoah valley the company also owns the battletown inn in 
berryville and larricks tavern in middletown 
the inns have had few problems with theft and breakage ms 
brown said 
if youre going to do it like a holiday inn thats what 
youre going to have if youre going to have the ambiance you 
cant worry about it 
the project linking the inns and antiques grew from a 1985 fire 
that gutted the middeltown inn 
nobody really knew how the inn originally was until the 
fire ms brown said it kind of offered us an opportunity to 
put it back 
ms brown began replacing the antiques and reproductions in the 
rooms and developing each room with its own theme 
the inns owned by antique collector leo m bernstein have long 
had an unofficial policy of selling furnishings starting in may 
the practice became official with catalogued lists and set prices 
colors throughout the inns are bright but their authenticity 
can be documented ms brown said people thought the colonials 
were very very bland she said they were not they loved 
bright colors elaborate fabrics it was a sign of wealth 
people like to know when they come to a place like this they 
are living in history ms brown said but they dont have to 
go to an outhouse

just out of the shower one sailor clad 
only in a towel came facetoface sunday with his 
commanderinchief and the first lady 
the embarrassed seaman wound up as about the only man aboard the 
helicopter carrier guadalcanal who didnt seek a presidential 
handshake 
the lessthanregulation dress encounter testified to the 
spontaneity of president bushs surprise visit to the navy ship 
anchored 2 miles offshore in the mediterranean sea 
it was set up with about 10 minutes notice an extra memorial 
day weekend stop after bushs solemn speech and wreathlaying at 
the world war ii american cemetery in nettuno near the anzio 
allied landing zone nearly 8000 us war dead are buried beneath 
white crosses there 
bush was due to return to rome after the ceremony but he had 
his marine one helicopter head out to the guadalcanal instead 
john sununu the white house chief of staff said it was 
arranged on the spur of the moment when the president decided he 
wanted to do it 
surprise visit captain bush said as he returned the salute 
of capt john mckay of virginia beach va commodore of the task 
force that includes the helicopter ship we only have about 10 
minutes i wanted to drop in and show the flag 
mckay got enough advance word to make it back to the ship from 
the memorial ceremony a secret service helicopter took him in but 
there wasnt helicopter room for the ships own skipper he was 
left behind in nettuno 
there was a small honor guard of sailors in dress whites lined 
up for the presidents arrival work crews on deck duty cheered 
him most of the 1800 sailors and marines on the guadalcanal were 
below decks so mckay poured coffee in his cabin while they 
assembled on deck 
bush declined mckays suggestion that he address the crew on 
closed circuit television he wanted to shake as many hands as he 
could 
we may not have time for any of this but this is what i 
wanted to do he told the captain 
meanwhile sailors were racing across the flight deck to get 
into position for a glimpse of the president bush made a hurried 
handshaking tour lined up about 80 crew men for a photograph then 
waved thumbs up and shouted keep it up 
after less than 20 minutes the president and his wife were back 
on their helicopter lifting off for rome

the census bureau has hung out an early help 
wanted sign knowing that staffing up for the count that begins in 
11 months wont be easy because the temporary jobs dont pay much 
and most of the people who used to take them are working fulltime 
now 
we will need to hire about 480000 persons during the period 
october 1989 to september 1990 with about 315000 actually working 
at the peak of operations said charles d jones associate 
director of the census bureau 
in some areas there simply will not be enough people while in 
others the agency may be forced to hire those who are only 
minimally qualified because there wont be enough applicants to 
offer a choice 
as long as the economy is good and the unemployment rate is 
low we will face a big problem in hiring the number of people that 
we need explained census spokesman ray bancroft 
in 1790 it took just 650 people to count the nations 39 
million residents assistant us marshals did the job 
but the rapidly escalating population required ever more workers 
as the decades passed 3231 enumerators in 1850 52871 in 1900 
and 142962 by 1950 
this proved a major source of political patronage to the party 
in power in the early years but civil service rules eventually 
came into play for many jobs 
housewives later became an important factor in this job force 
being eager for the extra income from parttime work thats 
changed now with the majority of wives now working outside the 
home they are no longer available for census jobs 
indeed in 1980 the problem became so severe that during peak 
operations as many as 30 percent of enumerator jobs were unfilled 
and many offices suffered from high turnover rates 
eventually census officials had to go back to the oldstyle 
political referral system in that year asking local officials to 
suggest people for the jobs that wont happen in 1990 the census 
bureau says political recruiting is out 
yet in 1990 even though the majority of households will fill 
out their census form and mail them in officials expect to need as 
many as 200000 enumerators to visit the 30 million homes that 
dont respond by mail 
the remaining workers needed for the count will fill temporary 
office jobs tabulating running computers and managing local and 
district offices 
during preparation of the address lists for the 1990 count some 
28 percent of local offices reported problems in hiring sufficient 
staff turnover rates reached 60 percent in some areas double what 
had been expected according to a report from the general 
accounting office 
as a result census officials increased their recruitment 
efforts and have moved to change their pay system from a uniform 
6perhour rate to one based on local needs paying up to 
8perhour where necessary to be competitive with other employers 
in addition rep thomas c sawyer dohio proposed solving a 
part of the hiring problem by hiring retired federal and postal 
workers and military officers around the nation 
he has proposed legislation that would permit these retirees to 
accept census jobs on a temporary basis without having their 
retirement benefits reduced as required by current law 
as many as 15 million to 2 million people may be covered by 
this change which drew wide support at a hearing called by sawyer 
retired federal workers are accustomed to working within a 
bureaucracy are already trained in many of the skills that will be 
needed and often are familiar with local geography and residents 
noted judith park of the national association of retired federal 
employees 
in addition the bureau is working with state employment 
services offices in every state to get referrals and is also 
seeking help from local governments and minority organizations 
workers will need to pass a written test and must be united 
states citizens to work for the bureau they should be at least 18 
years old although the bureau says that it can hire people as 
young as 16 if they have a high school diploma

it was a crime that could not be allowed to 
go unsolved a federal judge assassinated on orders from a family 
so rich in drug money it tried to buy its own brand of justice 
ten years ago a single rifle bullet struck us district judge 
john wood in the back outside his home just days before he was to 
preside over the drug conspiracy trial of jimmy chagra 
wood known as maximum john for the sentences he gave in 
drug cases was the first federal judge to be killed this century 
the slaying was a traumatic occasion for an awful lot of 
people said jamie boyd a former federal prosecutor who worked 
on the wood case and is now a bexar county prosecutor it was an 
attack on the system not just a judge and it was a crime that had 
to be solved 
prosecutors suspected jimmy chagra and the fbi began 
meticulously putting its case together 
by the time of the first indictments in april 1982 the fbi had 
conducted more than 30000 interviews collected more than 500000 
pieces of information and spent nearly 5 million trials and 
appeals pushed the tab to more than 11 million 
in 1983 chagra was acquitted of murder and conspiracy to commit 
murder but he later pleaded guilty in the attempt on the life of 
another official and is serving a life term because he helped 
prosecutors with an unrelated case chagra has disappeared into the 
anonymity of the federal witness protection program though he 
remains in prison somewhere 
chagras wife and a man convicted of taking the chagras 
250000 to kill wood also are in prison 
joe chagra a nowdisbarred lawyer who advised his brother to 
have wood killed was released on parole last year and is working 
as a paralegal in el paso 
jimmy chagra was an el paso rug salesman who turned to the 
lucrative marijuana smuggling trade in the 1960s by the time of 
woods slaying prosecutors say his drug empire stretched from 
florida to las vegas 
he was known as a high roller who reportedly once paid off a 
casino debt of more than 900000 in cash and lost a 580000 golf 
match 
prosecutors say his generosity attracted con men among them 
charles harrelson who had served time on a 1968 murderforhire 
conviction 
harrelson father of cheers tv star woody harrelson said 
he went to las vegas to dupe jimmy out of 250000 prosecutors say 
he was a coldblooded trigger man 
jimmy felt he was above the system and thats why he had no 
compulsion for buying harrelsons murder of judge wood because as 
he accumulated so much wealth he believed he was bigger than our 
entire judicial system said jack lawn administrator of the drug 
enforcement administration he was an fbi agent in san antonio when 
wood was killed 
with joe chagras testimony given in exchange for a plea 
bargain a jury was able to convict elizabeth chagra and harrelson 
and his wife 
harrelson was convicted of murder and conspiracy and sentenced 
to two consecutive life terms plus five years in prison for 
obstructing justice he has steadfastly denied any involvement in 
the wood killing 
his wife at the time jo ann starr harrelson was convicted of 
perjury and obstructing justice and is serving 25 years in prison 
prosecutors say she bought the murder weapon 
mrs chagra was convicted of conspiracy tax fraud and 
obstruction of justice and sentenced to 40 years in prison 
joe chagra refused to testify against his brother 
but at the same time jimmy chagra was acquitted of murder in 
woods death he was convicted of possession of marijuana and 
obstruction of justice and he later pleaded guilty to 
masterminding a plot to kill an assistant us attorney who 
escaped a barrage of bullets just six months before and six blocks 
from where wood was killed he was sentenced to life for the 
attempt on the prosecutor 
joe who pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the judges death 
spent nearly 6 years in federal prison before being paroled in 
march 1988

foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher on sunday insisted that west germany stick to its demand 
for superpower talks on reducing shortrange nuclear weapons 
genschers free democratic party meanwhile passed a resolution 
emphatically stating that nato cannot exclude the possibility of 
eliminating shortrange nuclear arsenals 
the free democrats have made thinly veiled threats to leave 
chancellor helmut kohls coalition government if he accepts 
unsatisfactory compromises on those weapons at the nato summit that 
begins monday in brussels 
kohl is demanding early negotiations on reducing shortrange 
nuclear arsenals but the united states says talks must not be held 
until the warsaw pact eliminates its superiority in conventional 
forces 
the united states also wants a clear signal from kohl that he 
opposes complete elimination of shortrange nuclear weapons and 
wants west germanys support for natos plans to modernize the 
missile fleet 
kohl on sunday welcomed a disarmament initiative president bush 
plans to announce at the nato summit a radio station reported 
american news reports have said bush plans to propose the 
withdrawal of about 30000 us troops from europe as an important 
nato reply to disarmament initiatives launched by the warsaw pct 
hessischer rundfunk radio reported kohl as saying bushs 
proposal marks an important step forward 
a sunday newspaper welt am sonntag said government officials 
welcome bushs plans but also see them as a means of putting 
pressure on the west germans to soften their opposition to 
shortrange nuclear weapons 
at a free democrats convention in cologne on sunday genscher 
restated west germanys insistence that talks begin soon on 
shortrange nuclear weapons 
disarmament cnnot exclude any category of weapons genscher 
said to loud applause from the 400 delegates 
why fear disarmament negotiations when they would create more 
security and certainly not less in europe genscher said 
the foreign minister said west germany is committed to nato and 
to western defense efforts 
but he added just as defense capability is necessary for a 
lasting peace in europe so is cooperation dialogue and 
disarmament 
just before genschers speech the free democrats passed a 
resolution reaffirming a hard line on the shortrange nuclear 
arsenals 
according to the resolution the elimination of all landbased 
nuclear shortrange rockets and nuclear artillery cannot be 
excluded if this is permitted by an improved security situation 
in europe 
most shortrange missiles are based in west germany and their 
targets are in east germany kohl bowing to public pressure faces 
an election next year and has been pushing hard for talks on 
reducing the missiles 
us officials warn they would not be able to keep american 
troops in europe without the protection of the missiles

west germany is becoming increasingly 
wary of a nato defense policy that could unleash nuclear weapons on 
german soil despite this frontline nations strident protests 
the issue goes to the heart of a current dispute within the 
north atlantic treaty organization over whether superpower talks 
should be held to reduce shortrange nuclear weapons 
the arsenals are deployed on german territory and would be fired 
there in the event of war 
west germany is pressing for early superpower negotiations on 
the missiles the unites states and britain oppose such talks until 
soviet conventional superiority is reduced 
chancellor helmut kohls coalition government is also resisting 
a joint usbritish effort to replace natos aging shortrange 
missile arsenal in the 1990s with modernized rockets more than 
triple the current range 
the missile dispute is also at the core of a growing debate over 
just how much say west germany has in nato decisions that could 
literally affect its existence 
that debate was fueled after recent leaks about a topsecret 
nato exercise allegedly designed to test an alliance scenerio for 
using nuclear weapons in europe to stop a sovietled warsaw pact 
attack 
according to nato strategy the shortrange weapons are a vital 
part of a defense known as flexible response or the threat 
that nato could use nuclear weapons along with conventional forces 
to stop a soviet attack 
the leftistleaning news magazine der spiegel quoting anonymous 
sources said the exercise dubbed wintex 89 demonstrated the 
potential powerlessness of nonnuclear nato powers in preventing 
the use of the weapons 
the magazine said the west german and turkish participants in 
the exercise pulled out after nato officials led by us officers 
ordered a theoretical atomic strike that would have destroyed large 
parts of west and east germany turkey and the western territories 
of poland and czechoslovakia 
der spiegel charged that the goal of the exercise was to limit a 
nuclear exchange to central and eastern europe while buying time 
to negotiate an end to the conflict before a fullscale nuclear war 
erupted between the superpowers 
west germany is expected to commit suicide as part of the 
plan der spiegel wrote 
nato and west german officials refused to comment on details of 
the exercise but confirmed that it took place in a bunker outside 
bonn in late february and early march 
manfred woerner natos general secretary said it was a 
purely procedural exercise with innumerable artificial premises and 
not an operational scenerio for waging war 
spiegel said that under nato guidelines the decision to use 
nuclear weapons hinges on toplevel alliance approval and the 
goahead by the us president 
alliance partners are later consulted as time and situation 
permits the magazine said 
west german fears are aggravated by a tangle of allied treaties 
and postwar agreements that remain in effect more than four 
decades after the collapse of nazi germany 
while a 1959 treaty stipulates that west germany cannot be 
forced to accept the stationing of new nuclear weapons on its 
territory earlier treaties remain in effect that allow the allies 
the united states britain and france to routinely replace 
outmoded weapons 
liberals and leftists charge that west germany could be forced 
to accept new nuclear weapons over its objections 
the west german government however insists that it has the 
right to veto the deployment of new nuclear weapons on its soil 
foreign ministry spokesman hanns schumacher says there is 
simply no doubt that west germany must first agree to accept new 
nuclear weapons before they are deployed 
even if a group of lawyers gets together and says that germany 
can be legally forced to accept them it would really be a 
politically unrealistic position for the united states or nato to 
take he added

frustrated that thieves had broken into 
his waterbed store 20 times without getting caught tom showalter 
tied them to the scene of the crime literally and took their 
pictures 
he did it with the reel of nylon string which he usually ties to 
arrows so he can track down deer he hits when he goes bowhunting 
instead he tied the string to items in his store 
i figured if it works good for deer and its good enough 
for tracking through the woods and swamps then it was good enough 
to use here said showalter owner of a store called the bedroom 
your waterbed supermarket 
he said thieves would take stolen bedding out and sell it 
adding theyve broken about 3000 worth of windows to steal 
300 worth of bedding which they sold for about 30 
a robbery may 22 was the final straw 
showalter set up two video cameras tied string from his game 
tracker to several comforters and began spending the night in his 
store 
early saturday thieves broke in and apparently didnt notice 
that they were being taped and their booty had strings attached 
when they drove away from the store the line followed 
that reel was going 40 miles an hour showalter said 
there was only about 10 yards left on the reel when it stopped 
police lt d morgan said sunday that the thieves apparently 
drove to the end of the block turned right drove two blocks 
turned right again and parked 
investigators followed the string to the end of the block and 
around the first corner he said 
the string broke in that twoblock stretch he said 
they were able to pick it up again they found a car with 
some string hanging out of it that matched 
police said they believe they know who was photographed on the 
videotape but have not made arrests as of sunday morning 
showalter said he hopes the incident will persuade others to 
stop targeting his business

doctors who operated on irans ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini said sunday he suffered discomfort in his 
heart which was treated and relieved tehran television reported 
earlier reports said khomeini had been operated on to stop 
bleeding in his digestive system 
sundays broadcast monitored in nicosia gave no more details 
of khomeinis ailment but said all his bodily functions were normal 
and that the spiritual leader was in satisfactory condition and 
spending time with relatives 
in a statement after tuesdays operation khomeinis personal 
physician said khomeini was in excellent condition and was in fact 
an exception of history 
khomeini has been reported ailing since he suffered a heart 
attack in 1986 since then he has rarely been seen outside his 
house in tehrans jamaran suburb 
the recent operation has stirred old confusion about how old the 
whitebearded revolutionary patriarch is 
much of the confusion stems from a variety of birth dates cited 
for khomeini and from the difference between the length of the 
years observed by moslems and by the wests gregorian calendar 
reliable accounts in the past listed khomeinis birth date in 
western terms as may 17 1900 that would make him 89 
but khomeinis brother pasandideh told the radical pasdare 
islam magazine that the revolutionary leader was born according to 
the moslem calendar on jamadi alsani 20 hegira 1320 
moslem scholars calculate that this date translates to sept 23 
1902 which would make khomeini 86 by western standards 
after tuesdays surgery the chief surgeon dr hassan arefi 
also put khomeinis age at 86

the turkish government despite its ties to 
the west as a member of the nato alliance rejected a direct 
american request to inspect an advanced mig29 jet fighter flown to 
turkey a week ago by a defector administration officials say 
the rebuff caused a lot of resentment among officials at the 
pentagon and state department because the fighter was returned to 
the russians without the type of comprehensive inspection that 
would shed light on soviet capabilities said the officials who 
asked not to be named 
president bush in brussels for a nato summit scheduled an 
early morning meeting monday with turkish prime minister turgut 
ozal prior to the start of the 16nation nato meeting white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
this was a russian frontline mig29 not the export version 
of this plane explained one administration source 
weve examined export versions but the soviets dont share 
their top technology on the stuff they export this was a chance to 
really get a look at the engines lookdown radar and other 
systems that are loaded only on the soviet air force planes 
the sources said turkey never offered an adequate explanation 
for its refusal to allow american experts to study the plane but 
us officials assume the turks were trying to avoid antagonizing 
the neighboring soviets even though turkey is a member of the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
in ankara turkish foreign ministry spokesman inal batu 
reiterated sunday what he had said at a news conference last 
wednesday this is an affair completely between turkey and the 
soviet union he said 
batu added that i have no knowledge of any us request for 
permission to inspect the soviet plane he did not elaborate 
according to the administration sources the us government was 
not informed of the defection even though the pilot has asked for 
asylum in the united states until after the turks had already 
assured the russians they could have their plane back 
even at that point however the american embassy in ankara and 
some senior government officials in washington strongly and 
directly pressed the turks to give us a little time to look at this 
plane said one official 
the embassy informed them we could get a team there to the 
scene without delay but the turks said no they would have their 
own experts take a look at it 
capt alexander zuyev fled the soviet union on may 20 flying to 
the turkish town of trabzon on the black sea with a bleeding arm 
wound 
pravda the newspaper of the soviet communist party later 
reported that zuyev was working as a duty dispatcher at the 
tskhakaya airfield north of batumi and therefore was armed on the 
day of his flight it said he shot and wounded a sentry who fired 
back and wounded zuyev 
two other soviet fighters started chasing the mig29 but could 
not intercept zuyev because the border was so near pravda said 
the mig29 which carries the nato codename of fulcrum is 
considered the most modern and capable jet fighter currently in the 
soviet inventory 
the plane can fly at 23 times the speed of sound and according 
to us intelligence agencies carries a true 
lookdownshootdown radar enabling it to engage lowflying 
aircraft or cruise missiles 
turkey allowed zuyevs plane to be flown back to the soviet 
union on may 21 it was stripped of rockets and weapons which were 
returned on a separate plane 
two days after the defection turkish newspapers reported the 
mig had been examined by both turkish and american military experts 
before its return one day later on may 23 turkish officials said 
the plane had been inspected by ustrained officials who knew 
what to look for and that their findings would be shared with the 
nato allies 
look we had a real opportunity here and the turks shafted the 
alliance said one administration source its not just the 
us thats mad our pilots arent the only ones who might have to 
fight this plane one day 
the sources added that they were still assuming the turks would 
make good on the pledge to share information gleaned from their 
inspection but were not expecting much

tens of thousands of protesters swarmed through a 
stadium parking lot on sunday to protest the defeat of prominent 
reformers seeking seats in a new soviet legislature 
demostrators shouted shame when a speaker mentioned 
president mikhail s gorbachev who made the soviet political 
process more open but who was partially blamed for the defeat of 
several reform candidates 
the protest which had official approval came after results 
were announced sunday of balloting for the 542seat supreme soviet 
a newly created standing legislature 
the members of the fulltime legislature were picked by the 
congress of peoples deputies from among its 2250 members 
among the candidates defeated was boris n yeltsin a popular 
reformer and former moscow communist party chief 
rally organizer vitaly ponomarev claimed more than 100000 
people filled the lot and called the protest the biggest 
political meeting ever in moscow the nightly news put the crowd 
at 70000 
ponomarev accused gorbachev of siding with party bureaucrats 
rather than average soviets 
your behavior at the congress is the most shameful act of your 
political biography he said before he was interrupted by loud 
chants of shame 
you have to decide who you are for the bureaucracy or the 
people you cant sit on two chairs he said 
yeltsin did not attend the rally but his image was represented 
on a slew of signs and buttons 
moscow workers and intelligentsia they spat in your face 
yeltsin wasnt elected read one sign 
the assemblage voted with a show of hands to ask another 
deputy to give up his supreme soviet seat so yeltsin could serve 
and to notify the congress by telegram that by not choosing 
yeltsin the congress ignored the will of 56 million muscovites 
who initially elected yeltsin to the congress by a landslide during 
march elections 
the television news program vremya quoted a public opinion 
poll that said 49 percent of the population was dissatisfied with 
how elections to the supreme soviet were run asked if the majority 
at the congress is always right 62 percent said no 
vremya also broadcast a brief account sunday night of the 
protest 
historian yuri afanasiev who made a blistering speech friday 
criticizing the congress for being aggressively obedient and 
suggesting gorbachev could be manipulating it told the crowd not 
to despair 
if the whole country actively expresses its will like this we 
cant help to feel it in the palace of congresses in the kremlin 
he said referring to the building where the congress has been 
meeting 
congressional deputies from the 15 republics nominated 
candidates to represent their specific regions in the supreme 
soviet and the congress as a whole which is dominated by 
communist party members made the final choices for each region 
most of the regional delegations chose one candidate for each 
seat they were allotted but the moscow contingent dominated by 
reformers picked 55 candidates for its 29 allotted seats in the 
spirit of multicandidate elections 
that backfired however when the most prominent and popular 
reformers were snubbed by a majority of the congressional 
membership

france acknowledged sunday it exchanged information 
on nuclear weapons with the united states but it denied the 
country received help building its nuclear arsenal 
in a statement the defense ministry said any sharing did not 
compromise the independence of the french nuclear force 
the statement was issued in response to an article published 
saturday in the us quarterly foreign policy which revealed the 
secret briefings on design and safety aspects of nuclear weapons 
the defense ministry acknowledged the two countries exchanged 
technical information mainly in the domain of safety and to 
the benefit of both parties 
it did not lead to any transfer of concepts or formulas it is 
with its own means that france builds an independent nuclear 
deterrent the statement said 
the defense ministry refused to elaborate on the statement 
the article by princeton university professor richard h ullman 
said that starting in 1972 us experts briefed the french on 
numerous aspects of nuclear weaponry including penetration of 
soviet defenses 
the us defense department acknowledged it supplied france with 
information but a spokesman declined to provide details

the archbishop of panama on sunday 
condemned violence by paramilitary groups that seem to operate 
with official approval and demanded the release of political 
prisoners and an end to torture 
archbishop marcos mcgrath in his strongest criticism of gen 
manuel antonio noriegas regime told about 12000 people gathered 
for an outdoor mass that the roman catholic church had to speak out 
while the national life is in suspension 
thousands of supporters of opposition presidential candidate 
guillermo endara interrupted the homily with applause and at the 
end thousands waved white handkerchiefs and sang panamas national 
anthem 
international observers have said endaras ticket won panamas 
may 7 presidential race by a 3to1 margin but the vote was 
annulled on may 10 by the noriegacontrolled government 
endara and vice presidential candidates ricardo arias calderon 
and guillermo ford stood quietly in the crowd until the end when 
they were surrounded by shouting supporters as they left the muddy 
field where the nationally televised mass took place 
were with the archbishop 100 percent said endara he 
said exactly what the people think and he touched the heart of 
panama 
mcgrath rejected criticism that the church might be politicizing 
itself or taking sides in a political battle 
the church must speak for all men for truth for justice for 
fraternity the church must support these values and point out 
the obstacles in their way 
mcgrath said concern for people who hunger for god bread 
justice and fraternity led the panamanian bishops conference to 
release a pastoral letter two weeks ago condemning the beatings of 
opposition candidates and the nullification of elections 
he condemned torture and anarchic violence by those who have 
been called paramilitaries even though they sometimes appear to 
operate with official approval 
he called on the government and the military to allow political 
prisoners or those in exile to return to their families as a step 
toward the reconciliation of the panamanian family 
the reference to the military was an acknowledgement that the 
panamanian defense forces commanded by noriega hold the balance 
of political power in panama 
after the elections were annulled the organization of american 
states passed a resolution condemning noriega and calling for a 
transfer of power as soon as possible 
however an oas delegation sent to promote a solution to 
panamas problems only succeeded in exposing the political impasse 
last week and failed to bring about talks between the opposition 
and noriega 
the mass was nationally televised in a program that featured 
rare closeups of opposition candidates and scenes of their 
supporters waving white handkerchiefs and singing 
one of the most enthusiastic demonstrations came when the 
mediawise crowd spotted an american television crew on a platform 
thousands waved and chanted fervently for endara who was inside 
thanking the archbishop for his statements

a slowmoving freight train carrying 
fruit from california slammed into about 30 parked railroad cars 
early sunday killing the brakeman and the conductor and injuring 
two other workers aboard 
one of the parked rail cars was thrown into a 110car coal train 
traveling in the opposite direction on an adjacent track but no 
one aboard that train was injured said wayne beighle of the state 
department of public safety 
beighle said it was remarkable that no one else was killed in 
the accident which occurred at about 210 am the 35car fruit 
train was headed for chicago at the time 
evidently they thought the track was clear beighle said 
thats still under investigation 
ive never seen an engine torn up like that before in my 
life he said ive seen a lot of train crashes but nothing 
like this it looked like the front threequarters of that engine 
were cut in half i dont see how anyone lived 
department of public safety investigators said they were told 
the fruitbearing train had slowed to 20 mph as it approached 
amarillos train terminal 
apparently somebody saw what was coming up on the tracks but 
we dont know how soon before impact they applied the brakes 
bieghle said 
i see the devastating damage at 20 mph i can only imagine 
what it would have been like at higher speeds he added 
both trains involved were being operated by the santa fe 
railway although the engines damaged in the accident were owned by 
burlington northern 
state investigators and santa fe officials interviewed witnesses 
early sunday as an investigation into the crash began the national 
transportation safety board also will investigate 
the two workers who were killed were identified as steve r 
favreau 29 and robert n dawson 44 favreau was the trains 
brakeman and dawson was the conductor 
the trains engineer identified only as rh coleman was 
listed in critical condition sunday at northwest texas medical 
center in amarillo the other injured crew member identified as 
ah zermeno was in good condition at the same hospital 
all were from the amarillo area authorities said 
what was amazing to me was that another train was passing by 
as this accident occurred bieghle said the odds are 
astronomical there wasnt any time lapse 
he described the sequence of events this way the first train 
hits the parked cars an empty one is knocked into the cab of the 
other train then back into the first engine again that second hit 
is what really did damage 
no one in the second train was even shaken up officials said 
the coal train had been heading to muleshoe texas 
all of the parked railroad cars contained what santa fe 
officials called a common nonhazardous agricultural chemical

president bush praised his friend peter secchia on 
sunday and predicted the senate will confirm the michigan 
businessman as ambassador to italy 
a hitch in the senate confirmation process prevented secchia 
from taking the post and being here to greet bush on his first trip 
to europe as president 
but in remarks to the embassy staff at the us ambassadors 
residence bush called secchia a good friend and assured them 
he will do a good job 
he knows what he doesnt know said the president 
secchias fate was left in limbo when the senate adjourned 
earlier this month without confirmation 
senators have expressed reservations over secchias 
qualifications and his use of abusive sometimes profane language 
in public 
bush speaking from a platform in the garden of the roman villa 
where the us envoy lives said i believe the senate will 
confirm him 
secchia has big shoes to fill because of the remarkable 
job done by outgoing ambassador maxwell rabb who has served in 
the post for the past eight years the president said 
bush said the twoday rome visit went remarkably well 
he and first lady barbara bush posed for pictures with the

a regional prosecutor said sunday he is 
filing charges against a swede suspected in the 1986 slaying of 
prime minister olof palme 
chief prosecutor anders helin told national radio his case 
against christer pettersson 42 was based on the fact that the man 
had been identified by several people at the murder site he did 
not elaborate 
palme was gunned down from behind on feb 28 1986 while walking 
home unguarded with his wife lisbet from a downtown movie 
speaking of the indictment helin said pieces are missing we 
do not for instance have the murder weapon and we do not have 
technical evidence that of course is a weakness 
the arrest of pettersson last december gave an unexpected twist 
to the massive investigation which had focused on an international 
conspiracy 
the suspect is believed to have acted on his own he has a long 
criminal record which includes a manslaughter conviction and has 
a history of mental illness he has denied killing palme 
helin declined to say how sure he was that pettersson was the 
right man saying only the investigation has produced such 
evidence that it was our duty to hand down an indictment 
he said observations provided by mrs palme who reportedly has 
identified pettersson as the killer was an important factor in the 
decision to file charges 
the trial to be held in a special security hall in stockholms 
local courthouse is scheduled to start june 5 
it originally was set for may 29 but defense attorneys asked to 
have it postponed saying they had not finished reading the more 
than 2500page investigation

to the captors of nine american hostages to let me see them 
some of my countrymen are hostages here because they wanted to 
help lebanon the roman catholic archbishop said 
several moslem leaders reacted angrily to oconnors decision 
not to go to west beirut and said his views of lebanons years of 
conflict would be incomplete 
i wish that those who are holding the hostages would let me 
see them because i would go anywhere that a priest can go 
oconnor said during a visit to an institute for warwounded 
victims in the christian heartland northeast of beirut 
the cardinal traveled to the facility in beit shebab in a 
bulletproof black cadillac escorted by four jeeps full of army 
commandos 
oconnor came to lebanon to refocus attention on the hostages 
whose plight has been overshadowed by civil war fighting the 
hostages are believed held in moslem districts of the city by 
extremist fundamentalist groups linked with iran 
oconnor looked angry as he told reporters of the decision to 
scrap meetings with moslem government and religious leaders 
were not going to west beirut at the moment for security 
reasons i am told this is not a good time for me to go he said 
sources at bkirki monastery seat of maronite catholic patriarch 
nasrallah sfeir where oconnor is a guest said the cardinal 
received a telephone call from the us embassy minutes before he 
announced the trip cancellation 
oconnor however said the decision was made by sfeir and 
luciano angeloni pope john paul iis representative in lebanon 
its their considered opinon that this morning i should not go 
to the west for security reasons but this is not because of any 
discussion with our ambassador mr john mccarthy or any 
officials in the us government oconnor said 
whether i will still go i just dont know he added i 
still very much would like to go over and pay those courtesy calls 
but i am now subject to the recommendations of my host 
but sfeirs aide bishop roland abu jawdeh told reporters the 
patriarch had nothing to do with the cancellation of the visit 
the only person who mentioned security was ambassador 
mccarthy who also cancelled a lunch sunday in the cardinals 
honor abu jawdeh said 
oconnor had been scheduled to meet in west beirut with acting 
prime minister salim hoss who heads the moslem cabinet in 
lebanons dual government and shiite moslem parliament speaker 
hussein husseini 
hoss said i regret to say there are those who have an 
interest in preventing the cardinal from listening to our views 
he did not mention any names but said they portrayed the 
security situation to him in an exaggerated manner to make him call 
off the visit 
husseini said oconnor was fed misleading information to 
prevent him from coming to west beirut to get the moslem views 
oconnor overruled state department objections in coming to 
lebanon for a threeday visit he arrived saturday 
aides said the archbishop was unaware of the moslem criticism 
when he celebrated an outdoor mass at virgin marys church in the 
town of harisa 
he told about 2000 applauding christians my reason for being 
here is i love you 
he drew cheers when he declared that the bishops in the united 
states will not turn their backs on you not as long as im alive 
the christians in lebanon have never persecuted any other 
people they have always wanted to live in peace with moslems and 
others the world does not understand this 
he added i will fight for your freedom 
at least 15 foreigners including nine americans are held 
hostage in lebanon they include anglican church envoy terry waite 
of britain who disappeared in west beirut on jan 20 1987 while 
on a mission to free the hostages he turns 50 on wednesday 
the longest held hostage is american terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press he was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
the latest fighting in lebanons 15yearold civil war pits army 
commander gen michel aouns 20000 mostly christian troops against 
a syriandruse alliance that outnumbers them 41 
oconnor held a 90minute meeting sunday with aoun who heads a 
christian cabinet contesting power with hoss 
syrian gunners in west beirut blasted the coast of the christian 
enclave north of bkirki with sporadic shellfire maintaining a 
blockade against the areas 1 million inhabitants police said 
there were no casualties 
at least 359 people have been killed and 1396 wounded since the 
fighting and aoun declared on march 8 a war of liberation 
against the syrian troops 
syria under a peackeeping mandate from the arab league sent 
troops into lebanon in 1976

anything when you have occupying armies and when you have shells 
coming in he told reporters

in another move to suppress the demonstrations 
demanding greater freedom conservatives who have gained the upper 
hand in chinas power struggle have created a censorship committee 
sources said sunday 
one of the key demands of tens of thousands of students who have 
occupied beijings central tiananmen square has been a free press 
for several days during the rallies and marches the closely 
watched chinese news media reported the events with a freedom 
unprecedented in the 40 years of communist party rule 
thousands of journalists participated in some of the marches and 
signed petitions calling for a free press 
diplomatic and government sources said premier li peng and other 
hardliners estalished a fivemember group with broad powers to stop 
the dissemination of information considered harmful to the 
conservative cayse 
they said the group was formed tuesday following the imposition 
of martial law on may 20 since then the news media has been 
dominated with reports supporting the crackdown 
a liberal newspaper in shanghai the world economic herald has 
been stopped from printing its last two issues 
in beijing security forces were posted at such major news 
outlets as the peoples daily the xinhua news agency and the 
central radio and television stations 
the sources said li was furious last monday when the peoples 
daily the communist partys newspaper published a frontpage 
article saying martial law could not solve political problems 
on the same day the paper published a photograph of hundreds of 
people blocking what appeared to be a teargas equipped vehicle 
from entering beijing 
the picture of a vehicle that could be used to scatter 
demonstrators was significant because the government had said 
martial law was not intended to suppress the student movement 
the peoples daily printed a frontpage story sunday saying the 
vehicle was a truck used to carry antiaircraft weapons for the 
air force 
last week zhao ziyang lis rival and the moderate head of the 
communist party reportedly was stripped of power for expressing 
support of the student movement 
the sources said hu qili who belonged to zhaos faction and was 
the politburo member in charge of superiving the media also was 
removed from positions of authority 
they said the censorship committee will assume some of hus 
functions the sources said the five committee members all known 
for their conservative views are wang renzhi head of the partys 
propaganda department chief government spokesman yuan mu he 
dongchang vice minister of the education commission zeng jianhui 
xinhuas deputy president and ding weijun head of the beijing 
city information department 
yuan is the best known of the group during the ultraleftist 
cultural revolution he was closely associated with the gang of 
four who ruled china during the movements last years 
but he survived the gangs purge earning the nickname foxy 
a reference to his ability to weather political changes 
some chinese journalists said formation of the committee signals 
a new winter for the media 
for three days we were in the sun said one now we are 
waiting for a thunderstorm 
reporters at leading media outlets said they are being told to 
write reports detailing their activities during the movement 
the reports could be used later as evidence against them they said 
still they said no punishment will be able to wipe out the 
successes of midmay 
on may 1719 papers throughout china were filled with articles 
on the student movement some even urging the government to give in 
to some of the student demands 
those days taught us that chinese can report the truth 
something we thought only westerners could do said one reporter 
we also realized that people will read newspapers if they are 
truthful seeing my articles pasted on the walls of buildings all 
over town was such an encouragement

a dissenting group has broken away 
from the church that disciplined britains lord chancellor for 
attending roman catholic mass one of its ministers said sunday 
the small free presbyterian church of scotland last week 
rejected an appeal by lord mackay of clashfern britains chief 
legal officer against his suspension as an elder of the church 
mackay 61 then announced he would leave the church rather than 
accede to its demand he not attend catholic funeral mass as he had 
done twice in honor of fellow peers the church regards the roman 
catholic faith as a perversion of christianity 
on sunday the rev angus morrison said from his pulpit in 
edinburgh that a dissenting minority of the church had broken 
away 
supporters of the breakaway movement formed the new presbytery 
of the associated presbyterian churches in inverness on saturday 
morrison issued a statement saying the synod by a majority 
has made pronouncements and reached decisions which violate the 
constitution of the church 
in many cases these have been irregular and have denied the 
rights of individual christians i and others find in conscience 
that we cannot remain and we have therefore separated from the 
church 
we constitute a dissenting minority claiming to adhere to the 
doctrine and constitution of the church 
the statement reserved the right of ministers and elders to 
exercise the functions of their offices for those church member who 
join the new group 
it said there would be implications for church property 
indicating the possibility of disputes over the control of church 
assets 
the free presbyterian church of scotland claims a membership of 
7000 including overseas members but the number of regular 
worshipers in scotland is thought to be about 3000 
morrison would not estimate how many members the new group might 
attract or say if mackay might be among them 
he mackay isnt involved the minister said i dont 
want to be seen to speculate on him and i think he needs a good 
rest and a bit of peace and quiet after all this business

an energy department panel evaluating cold 
fusion experiments canceled a visit to the university of utah after 
researcher b stanley pons bristled at the committees composition 
a newspaper said sunday 
pons demanded that the panel be changed either by dismissing 
members he feels are hostile to his research or by adding friendly 
ones according to the deseret news 
i see this visit as a waste of valuable time since many of 
these panel members have already clearly stated their positions 
pons told the newspaper i feel there is little one can say to a 
hostile person that will change his mind 
pons said he and coresearcher martin fleischmann a british 
colleague from the university of southampton think the panel was 
organized in a manner that can only lead to a negative and 
nonobjective report on fusion research 
on march 23 pons and fleischmann announced they had achieved 
roomtemperature or cold fusion using rods of palladium inside 
coils of electrically charged platinum immersed in heavy water 
heavy water is water made with an isotope of hydrogen called 
deuterium 
pons and fleischmann said the energy generated by their 
experiment was up to 100 times that needed to produce the reaction 
scores of laboratories have attempted to duplicated the 
experiment but few report similar results and proof of nuclear 
fusion remains elusive pons and fleischmann have been particularly 
criticized by physicists who contend the reaction may be a 
chemical reaction not fusion 
a cochairman of the 20member energy department committee 
university of rochester nuclear chemistry professor john huizenga 
told the university of utah on friday that the panels visit 
scheduled for wednesday was being canceled 
in a telephone interview sunday huizenga told the associated 
press that the reasons for the cancellation were rather 
complex but acknowledged that pons concerns over the panels 
makeup were a factor 
huizenga said several committee members also had memorial 
dayrelated commitments that conflicted with the trip 
whether the committee reschedules the visit depends on several 
factors including pons and fleischmanns concerns about its 
composition huizenga said he declined to give further details 
but said he would like to visit the university at some point 
the committee has also planned visits to stanford university and 
texas aampm university which have duplicated parts of the utah 
experiment 
pons said saturday that the panel included several scientists 
who have expressed disbelief at his fusion claims and therefore do 
not have the impartiality desired in such a review committee 
it is disappointing that the committee is composed of so many 
members who have previously stated their very negative position in 
the press regarding this research he said 
he said the most notable of those were ibm fellow richard 
garwin steve koonin of the university of california at santa 
barbara and mark wrighton head of the chemistry department of the 
massachusetts institute of technology 
pons said he was disappointed that the committee instead of 
negotiating cancelled the visit 
he said he and fleischmann would continue to only allow 
reputable sincere scientific collaborators into their labs 
pons a professor of chemistry said he is even more convinced 
that he and fleischmann have tapped fusion 
the newest results are very strong and indeed confirm and 
surpass our earlier results he said these data and their 
analysis will be published later this summer in scientific 
literature

a group of us navy veterans and former uboat 
crewmen spent the memorial day weekend remembering a part of 
history they shared 45 years ago the capture of the only german 
submarine during world war ii 
they gathered sunday to rededicate the newly renovated sub to 
the museum of science and industry where it has been on display 
for 35 years 
they lost and we won but weve become very good friends 
retired adm earl trosino who lead the boarding party during the 
capture told the crowd of about 150 veterans and their families 
they honored those veterans on both sides who have died since 
the war 
many of the men in this engagement both american and german 
have been transferred to another realm by our supreme commander 
but we must remember them and honor them for they will always be a 
part of us he said 
the u505 submarine was captured june 4 1944 two days before 
dday off the coast of west africa the capture was significant 
because it enabled the allies to break the german radio code the 
sub had sunk eight allied ships in the three previous years 
the sub is one the most popular attractions at the museum on the 
citys south side tours cost 250 for adults and 2 for children 
and senior citizens admission to the museum is free 
most of the group gathered for the memorial day weekend were 
sailors assigned to the ships that surrounded the submarine as it 
was towed to bermuda but two of the captured german sailors flew 
in from europe for the occasion and a third hans gobeler 
traveled from nearby elkhart ind 
gobeler 65 recalled with a thick accent the last day he served 
as petty officer on board the submarine 
we got chased a couple of days and that morning we were 
feeling safe he said we heard the sonar noise and went up 
the periscope and saw we were surrounded by a unit of us navy 
the us ships dropped depth charges and forced the craft to 
surrender 
after we got the depth charge i saw the ship jumping up he 
said i thought it would break said josef kraus who came to 
the ceremony from his home in southern bavaria he was 19 when he 
was the subs helmsman 
kraus said he is happy to have become friends with the american 
crewmen since the war ended

nearly 5000 opposition supporters 
marched sunday through this town known nationwide for toughness 
kicking off the 1990 electoral campaign with the first united 
opposition march 
democracy yes sandinismo no the crowd chanted as it snaked 
through town for more than two hours 
no uniformed police were in sight during the march the largest 
show of opposition to nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
this year and no violence was reported 
only with unity can we defeat the sandinista regime said 
one of the speakers mauricio diaz head of the popular social 
christian party 
the sea of flags posters and banners representing labor unions 
and 15 opposition parties flowed through monimbo a neighborhood so 
feisty that even the dreaded national guard of ousted dictator 
anastio somoza was afraid to enter 
masaya 17 miles southeast of the capital of managua was 
crucial to the popular revolution that finally replaced somoza with 
the leftist sandinista national liberation front on july 19 1979 
masaya was the tomb of somocism it will be the tomb of 
sandinism people chanted 
the united opposition which spans the political spectrum from 
left to right took pains to distance itself from the 
antigovernment rebels known as the contras 
azucena ferrey the only woman on the political directorate of 
the usbacked nicaraguan resistance the rebel leadership gave 
her speech after the rally was officially pronounced over 
supporters of her social christian party gathered separately from

a retired nasa engineer who predicted 
that the beginning of the end of the world would occur in 1988 now 
says his forecast was off by one year 
edgar whisenant said bornagain christians will be taken up into 
heaven sept 1 in the rapture 
whisenant 56 created a stir last year with the publication of 
88 reasons why the rapture will be in 1988 he estimated that 
he and the world bible society here gave away or sold about 45 
million copies of the booklet 
the final shoutrapture 89 report is to be released this 
week said whisenant who cowrote the booklet with greg brewer 
i made a mistake last year my calculations were off by one 
year whisenant said in a telephone interview last week from his 
little rock ark home 
the mistake occurred he said because presentday gregorian 
calendars count only 99 years for the first century calculations 
begin at 1 ad not zero 
but i believe my mistake was gods will a shout a 
preparation period for the church and there has been a revival i 
believe this year its the rapture he said the evidence is 
there 
whisenant who lives on his pension from the national 
aeronautics and space administration said he has dedicated his 
life to trying to unlock the bibles riddles about the rapture 
ive spent 50000 of my own money to get the word out about 
this whisenant said ive never made a cent on it ive put 
152000 miles on my vw and all i own is a bed when you fear god 
enough you dont lie cheat or steal 
in the new booklet he said he is not a prophet and such 
studies are subject to error 
the world bible society which had revenues of 31 million in 
1987 made an estimated 200000 on the controversial booklet but 
it was given to christian charities said society head norvell 
olive 
olive said he plans to send out 300000 free copies to 
protestant ministers nationwide before selling them for 2 a copy 
in christian bookstores

the 1865 explosion of the paddlewheeler 
sultana was a disaster to rival the sinking of the titanic and the 
muddy mississippi river coughed up burned and bloated bodies for 
weeks afterward 
but until sunday no memorial had been created in this onetime 
confederate stronghold for the union soldiers who perished aboard 
the steamship many of them emaciated survivors of confederate 
prison camps during the civil war 
before a small crowd of about 50 people a 6foot granite marker 
was unveiled in memphis elmwood cemetery as a reminder that the 
sultana went down in flames just seven miles north of the citys 
downtown riverfront 
built for 300 passengers and a crew of 76 the paddlewheeler was 
carrying more than 2300 people in addition to 100 horses and 
mules when three of its four boilers exploded at 2 am on april 
27 1865 less than three weeks after the end of the war 
most of the more than 1500 people who died had recently been 
freed from prison camps in alabama and were headed north to be 
released from the army many were crowded onto two decks directly 
over the paddlewheelers 18foot boilers one of which had 
developed a leak and been hastily repaired 
when one of the boilers blew setting off two others the upper 
decks collapsed forming a funnel that dumped dozens of the victims 
into the fire said hugh berryman a forensic pathologist at the 
university of tennessee in memphis 
jerry potter a memphis lawyer who has researched the disaster 
for a dozen years and is writing a book on it said union officers 
may have overloaded the paddlewheeler to inflate troop transport 
payments 
there were two other steamboats that were trying to get a 
portion of the men the only explanation i have been able to 
uncover for why the sultana got them all is bribery potter said 
potter and berryman estimated the sultana death toll at 1547 
by comparison 1503 lives were lost when the ocean liner titanic 
hit an iceberg and sank in the remote north atlantic in 1912 
other counts of the sultana victims have put the total between 
1400 and 1450 but berryman said those estimates failed to 
include one of three trainloads of soldiers who boarded the boat at 
vicksburg miss 
our figure is probably a conservative one berryman said 
the sultana monument financed by three memphis residents will 
be the second of two major markers to the disaster 
the other in knoxville tenn was put up in 1916 by sultana 
survivors who raised money for the monument themselves 
researching the disaster has been difficult because newspapers 
of the day were still primarily concerned with the assassination of 
abraham lincoln two weeks earlier and with the end of the war 
berryman said 
it was just lost to history because of the other events that 
were going on at the time berryman said

a student activist group early monday urged 
students over loudspeakers to maintain their occupation of 
tiananmen square until june 20 when chinas legislature is set to 
discuss the democracy movement 
the announcement came a day after about 80000 students from 
throughout china marched in beijing to recharge their campaign for 
a freer society with less corruption 
they also demanded the fall of conservative premier li peng who 
declared martial law in the city may 20 to suppress the movement 
we cannot leave the square student loudspeakers blared 
if the peoples liberation army suppresses us we will become an 
exemplary model for all future movements to come 
the announcers who said they were from a leadership group 
claimed 30000 students from beijing remained on the increasingly 
dirty foulsmelling square the numbers were inflated 
the announcement further confused the question of who is leading 
the student movement 
activists from beijing proposed saturday that the occupation end 
tuesday and that the students concentrate on propaganda work 
informing the masses of the movements goals thousands of students 
are returning to their home provinces daily to spread the word 
but many of the largely outoftown students remaining in the 
square say they will refuse to go 
students from most of chinas 31 provinces paraded through the 
narrow streets of the capitals old quarters sunday 
well keep coming until li peng steps down the marchers 
chanted 
li peng is a big political thug said a student from coastal 
shandong province 
also sunday sources said government hardliners formed a 
censorship group to assert more control of the increasingly 
independent staterun media which have been largely sympathetic to 
student demands 
another 30000 students marched against li in shanghai with one 
banner depicting the premier as a cockroach with a military cap 
thousands of chinese also marched in taiwan hong kong and sydney 
australia to show solidarity 
unlike demonstrations last week that drew up to 1 million 
people there were few nonstudents in the beijing march 
factories are now taking economic measures against workers who 
participate one student leader said 
but large crowds of residents continued to applaud protesters 
and to gather around university gates reading student posters and 
listening to student broadcasts 
hardliners led by li who is believed to be acting for senior 
leader deng xiaoping reportedly have placed moderate communist 
party general secretary zhao ziyang under house arrest and removed 
him from his post 
zhao had expressed sympathy for the students whose demands 
included talks with the government on a freer society and an end to 
corruption and profiteering by officials 
martial law was declared in response to the student occupation 
of tiananmen square which entered its 16th day sunday about 
10000 students remain in the 100acre square down from a peak of 
about 200000 
beijing activists have proposed that the occupation end tuesday 
and that the students concentrate on informing the masses of the 
movements goals thousands of students are returning to their home 
provinces daily 
but many of the students they will stay at least until june 20 
when chinas legislature is expected to meet 
we will not leave we havent achieved our goals said 
yao gangfu a sophomore at jiangsu chemical engineering institute 
peoples liberation army troops were rushed to the outskirts of 
beijing to enforce martial law but were prevented from entering the 
city by throngs of residents soldiers have retreated to nearby 
camps and roads have cleared 
one western analyst said about 200000 troops have been sent to 
beijing but he believes such large numbers were called in as part 
of the leadership power struggle not merely to suppress students 
official media continued to report support for the martial law 
decree with nationwide television saying the countrys largest 
union was behind the move even though many of its members marched 
with the students 
in another step to end the protest the party central committee 
and the state council fully affirmed the students patriotic 
enthusiasm and will not investigate and punish those students who 
have voiced and committed extremist words and acts the staterun 
xinhua news agency reported 
a party central committee meeting is expected to be convened 
soon to approve the reported purge of zhao 
sources said the conservatives still may be determining what 
accusations to make publicly against the party leader 
a document circulated among highlevel party members accuses 
zhao of forming an antiparty coalition and using the student 
movement to seize power one diplomatic source said 
but another document distributed to lowerlevel officials is 
less harsh saying zhao betrayed the party and revolution helped 
incite the demonstrations and tried to split the army the source 
said 
defense minister qin jiwei party propaganda chief hu qili and 
vice premier tian jiyun are believed included in a purge the scope 
of which remains unclear 
many analysts feel that after zhaos purge li peng may be next 
to fall because of his unpopularity

president bush arrived sunday for the 
16nation nato summit prepared to respond to soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachevs arms reduction proposals as the western alliance 
seeks common ground in the changing landscape of eastwest 
relations 
the twoday summit that begins monday marks the 40th anniversary 
of the north atlantic treaty organization but a dispute over the 
alliances own shortrange nuclear missiles threatened to undermine 
the unity celebrations 
still nato officials said they would not let the missile 
dispute overshadow what they described as the real task of the 
summit leaders planning their strategy to deal with the enormous 
changes under way in the soviet union and eastern europe 
nato is at once ready to assure a common defense and to reduce 
arms bush said as he set the tone for his meeting with allied 
leaders possible us initiatives included proposals to reduce 
us troop strength in europe and drop a ban on hightechnology 
exports to the soviet union 
the new york times reported in mondays editions that bush in a 
confidential letter to other western leaders late last week had 
proposed that nato offer a cut of about 30000 american troops in 
europe as part of a plan to reduce nonnuclear forces 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said sunday evening 
that some of the allies had been briefed on the substance of the 
us proposals but he declined to provide details of the 
initiatives 
bush said on his arrival in belgium home of nato headquarters 
that he looked forward to the time the soviet union will be 
welcomed as a constructive partner but he also stressed the 
need to maintain nato defenses and the security of europe 
the united states remained at loggerheads with west germany over 
bonns demand for early superpower talks to reduce shortrange 
nuclear weapons the united states says those weapons will remain 
essential until the warsaw pacts superiority in conventional 
forces is reduced 
but west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher insisted 
sunday at a german political rally that disarmament cannot 
exclude any kind of weapons 
a spokesman for margaret thatcher who arrived here sunday 
night said the british prime minister cannot contemplate 
negotiations to reduce shortrange nuclear missiles unless and 
until conventional force reductions have been agreed and theyre 
being tangibly implemented 
the british spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
it was possible no deal would be reached at the summit we arent 
in the business of a bad agreement we are in the business of 
retaining flexible defense he said 
bush flew to brussels from italy where he closed out a twoday 
visit with an emotional memorial day weekend tribute to americans 
slain in a 1944 assault on fascist italy 
at the us military cemetery in nettuno which holds the 
remains of nearly 8000 soldiers bush said their deaths 
demonstrated why we need to keep a strong military deterrent to 
prevent war and to preserve freedom and democracy 
bush highlighted the story of war hero sylvester antolak a 
young soldier from ohio who won the medal of honor for 
singlehandedly capturing an enemy machinegun nest despite being 
hit three times by gunfire antolak who is buried in nettuno knew 
the cost of maintaining freedom bush said 
earlier some two dozen rightwing demonstrators had delayed the 
presidential motorcade for about three minutes hurling a blizzard 
of flyers questioning whether the us troops in world war ii were 
liberators or invaders a handful were arrested 
bush was greeted at brussels national airport by belgian prime 
minister wilfried martens 
we want to see an end to the division of europe the 
president said but he also called on the east to adopt western 
values as a way of bringing the two sides closer together 
martens called for seizing the opportunities to improve the 
conditions of peace while taking care not to jeopardize security 
white house officials declining to be identified said whatever 
actions bush might take on the 305000 to 324000 troops in western 
europe would be framed as a nato proposal in eastwest arms 
reduction talks in vienna 
whatever he proposes will be done in the context of submitting 
suggestions for alliance consideration secretary of state james 
baker said sunday 
the new york times report said bushs proposal to nato leaders 
would mean a 10 percent overall us troop cut including a 20 
percent cut in us army and air force combat troops in europe the 
presidents plan would require the soviet union to cut more of its 
troops in eastern europe than moscow has proposed thus far the 
times said 
the paper said bush also proposed that the west accept the 
soviet contention that aircraft in europe be part of a conventional 
arms pact bush suggested an acceleration of efforts to negotiate a 
treaty and expressed hope an agreement would be reached within a 
year and implemented by 1992 or 1993 the times said 
baker and defense secretary dick cheney also acknowledged west 
germanys interest in reducing the nato shortrange nuclear weapons 
on its soil but they said the united states is in no hurry to 
pursue talks with the soviets on that issue 
in an nbctv interview from rome baker said the president has 
already acknowledged at least the principle of negotiations 
although he feels very very strongly that before you can talk 
about that or get into that you need to see a conventional forces 
agreement with the warsaw pact 
but genscher on sunday threatened that his free democratic party 
would withdraw from west germanys coalition government if 
chancellor helmut kohl adopted the american stance facing such 
political pressure at home kohl warned on saturday against delay 
in addressing the missile issue 
fitzwater said sunday that the situation is unchanged we 
continue to discuss it 
white house officials meanwhile indicated bush is now ready to 
have nato negotiate directly with the warsaw pact on troop levels 
the comprehensive western arms reduction proposal tabled in 
vienna in march called for indirect manpower cuts through 
withdrawal of equipment and consequently the troops needed to 
operate it 
gorbachev this month offered a 126 million cutback in warsaw 
pact troops as part of an overall reduction in forces to reach 
equal ceilings of 135 million for the two alliances 
an american initiative to reduce troops might blunt disarmament 
tendencies within nato and allow the western leaders to paper over 
the missile issue with an ambiguous communique at the windup of the 
brussels summit on tuesday 
pressure has been building on bush since gorbachev announced 
late last year that the soviets would withdraw 5000 tanks and 
50000 troops from central and eastern europe and cut soviet forces 
by 500000 overall

the last few years we have heard a great deal about the 
failures of public schools and by implication of americas 
teachers no one can say that many schools and faculties dont need 
to be improved crisis is the word most often used to describe 
conditions in the schools
